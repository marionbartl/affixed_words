In the past five years , Warsaw ’s Jewish community had grown to 600 families from 250 .
The cafes and bars of the old Jewish quarter in Krakow brim with young Jewish converts listening to Israeli hip hop music .
Michal Pirog , a popular Polish dancer and television star , who recently proclaimed his Jewish roots on national television , said the revelation had won him more fans than enemies .
“ Poland is changing , ” he said .
“ I am Jewish and I feel good , ” he said .
Pawel ’s metamorphosis from baptized Catholic skinhead to Jew began in a bleak neighborhood of concrete tower blocks in Warsaw in the 1980s , where Pawel said he and his friends reacted to the gnawing uniformity of socialism by embracing anti-Semitism .
They shaved their heads , carried knives and greeted one another with the raised right arm gesture of the Nazi salute .
“ Oy vey , I hate to admit it , but we would beat up local Jewish and Arab kids and homeless people , ” Pawel said on a recent day from the Nozyk Synagogue here .
“ We sang about stupid stuff like Satan and killing people .
We believed that Poland should only be for Poles . ”
One day , he recalled , he and his friends skipped school and took a train to Auschwitz , the Nazi death camp , near Krakow .
“ We made jokes that we wished the exhibition had been bigger and that the Nazis had killed even more Jews , ” he said .
Even as Pawel embraced the life of a neo - Nazi , he said that he had pangs that his identity was built on a lie .
His churchgoing father seemed overly fond of quoting the Old Testament .
His grandfather hinted about past family secrets .
“ One time when I told my grandfather that Jews were bad , he exploded and screamed at me , ‘ If I ever hear you say such a thing again under my roof , you will never come back ! ’ ”

At the last election 2 million Labour supporters switched to the Liberal Democrats , many in protest over the war in Iraq .
They have been urged to stick with this choice in 2010 by the former New Statesman editor John Kampfner , who reports that he feels more at home with the Lib Dems than with Labour .
Labour and the Lib Dems often spar over their progressive credentials .
On civil liberties , many might sympathise with Kampfner .
But his thesis that , on tax and spending , the Liberal Democrats are " the most redistributive of any party " is much more questionable .
It certainly took a battering at the weekend , as Nick Clegg , the Lib Dem leader , praised Margaret Thatcher and insisted his party would now be a more ruthless cutter of public spending than the Tories .
But this was just the latest step in a rightwards shift the Lib Dems have been making under Clegg 's leadership , in order to defend their seats against David Cameron 's advance .
A raft of former spending commitments have been ditched , such as a higher state pension and free care for the elderly .
Charles Kennedy 's famous pledge for a 50 p top rate of tax – which attracted many Labourites in 2005 – was the first thing to be axed ( since when it has been introduced by Labour ) .
This time round , the centrepiece of the Lib Dem manifesto is a radical £ 17bn tax cut in the form of increasing the income tax allowance .
It has been branded as a tax cut focused on struggling families and " a vital measure of social justice " .
The reality is very different .
Raising tax thresholds does n't help the poorest because they do n't have enough to pay income tax .
That 's the unemployed , low - paid part - time workers and many pensioners .
Analysis published this week shows that 3 m households in the poorest quarter of the population would see not a penny from this £ 17bn policy .
Nor is it focused on struggling families .
Increasing the income tax allowance is a society - wide tax cut , with most of the proceeds going to the better - off .
Only £ 1bn of the £ 17bn cost goes on the stated aim of " lifting those on low incomes out of tax " .
In truth , most of the remaining £ 16bn is a juicy middle - class tax cut to sell in Conservative marginals around the country .
It is an extraordinary priority at a time when public services are facing the axe .
Whereas Labour 's tax credits have been progressive , giving most to the poorer half of society , the Lib Dem tax cut would be regressive , giving most to the richer half .
Households near the top would get on average four times as much as the poorest .
The Lib Dems have some good proposals to pay for this measure , including restricting higher - rate pensions relief and tackling tax avoidance .
But this welcome shift in resources away from the super - rich would n't stop this tax cut increasing inequality between the bottom and middle of society , including relative poverty .
And too often Lib Dem policies fail this redistribution test .
Their mansion tax is another idea all progressives should support .
But not when it 's combined with a pledge to scrap the child trust fund – the only asset many poor kids will ever have .
In 2005 Michael Howard considered a boost in the income tax allowance for the Conservative manifesto .
He rejected it as being too unfair .
( " The poorest would have received just 7 p a week , the richest £ 7 , " he said .
" That is why we looked elsewhere " . )
The main cheerleader for the Lib Dem tax cut today is Norman Tebbit , not child poverty charities ; he is urging the Tories to adopt it .
Moreover , Clegg has delighted rightwingers by selling the policy as a crusade for " tax freedom " – a term straight out of the US Republicans ' phrasebook .
So in his budget next week , Alistair Darling should , calmly and politely , set out Labour 's different priorities .
The reality is that many on low and middle incomes would be vastly better off if future resources were put into tax credits or protecting public services .
( And then there 's that £ 178bn deficit to think about . )
It 's not that there are n't many decent progressives in the Liberal Democrats , people like Steve Webb and Evan Harris .
And Clegg does have a difficult balancing act to pull off .
He is right that in 2005 being too Bennite in Brent put off nice Tories in Torbay .
And I suspect many Labour party members will secretly wish him well in his electoral battles with the Conservatives .
But , with all respect to John Kampfner , the Lib Dems still have some way to go before they can claim the mantle of social justice from Labour .
Two IT employees of the suburban Philadelphia school district accused of spying on students by activating the cameras on their school - issued laptops have been placed on administrative leave .
An attorney for one of the employees also claimed that the Lower Merion Police Department knew of the school district 's ability to activate the cameras and that a special Web site had been used by the department to view the photographs taken by the laptops .
A spokesman for Lower Merion School District of Ardmore , Pa. today confirmed that Carol Cafiero , information systems coordinator , and Michael Perbix , one of three people with the title of network technician on the district 's technology staff
Web site , were placed on paid leave two weeks ago .
Both have been employed by the district for the past 12 years .
On Feb. 16 , Michael and Holly Robbins of Penn Valley , Pa. , on behalf of their son Blake , sued Lower Merion , accusing it of spying on students and students ' families using the iSight camera in the MacBook laptops issued to each high school student in the district .
According to the original complaint , Blake Robbins was accused by a Harriton High School assistant principal of " improper behavior in his home " and shown a photograph taken by his laptop as evidence .
Robbins has said he was accused by the assistant principal of selling drugs and taking pills , but he claimed the pictures taken by his computer 's camera showed him eating candy .
A federal judge has issued a consent order barring the district from activating the cameras .
Charles Mandracchia of the law firm Mandracchia & McWhirk LLC , who represents Cafiero , said today that his client has done nothing wrong .
" She has not been accused of any wrongdoing of any kind , " he said in an interview .
" Hiring an attorney is more prophylactic than anything .
There 's a lawsuit , and she could be called as a witness . "
Cafiero has not been called to testify in front of a grand jury , said Mandracchia .
The Philadelphia offices of the U.S. attorney and the FBI are investigating the Robbins ' allegations .
Both Mandracchia and Marc Neff , a Philadelphia attorney who represents Perbix , said that their clients had only been following orders when they triggered the laptop cameras .
" It was their duty to turn on the camera , " Mandracchia told WTXF - TV of Philadelphia in an interview last Friday .
" But they would only do that if they received a request from the two high schools , the two buildings , because they had no direct contact with the students , they did n't know the students . "
" Every time a tracking device was activated , it was activated at the request of an administrator or another IT person , " said Neff .
Lower Merion School District spokesman Doug Young today declined to answer specific questions related to the administrative leave , citing the ongoing investigation .
" The district generally does not comment on personnel matters , but we feel compelled to do so in the interest of two longtime staff members , " Young said in an e-mailed statement .
" Placing them on administrative leave with pay is not a reflection of any wrongdoing on their part .
It is a standard , prudent step in an investigation such as this one and it occurred in conjunction with the start of the review process nearly two weeks ago . "
Mandracchia added that the Lower Merion Police Department had been involved in at least some of the efforts to recover lost or stolen laptops using the photographs taken by the MacBooks ' cameras .
" They had a private Web site for some of these pictures , for the Lower Merion Police Department to view , and they were the only ones allowed to view it . "
He also argued that Cafiero and Perbix had assumed that turning on the cameras was legal because local law enforcement was involved and knew of the practice .
" If the police department is receiving this information , you as an employee have no knowledge of doing anything inappropriate , " he said .
Neff was not immediately available Monday for comment .
His Web site identifies him as a criminal defense attorney whose office " limits its practice to federal and state criminal defense and related matters , including grand jury investigations , parole matters , and forfeiture cases . "
His client , Perbix , had been mentioned in several reports last month as the district IT worker who had praised the tracking functionality of LANRev software , which is used to locate lost or stolen laptops .
" Yes , we have used it .
It 's a fantastic feature , " Perbix said in a promotional webcast for LANRev .
Absolute Software Corp. , the company that acquired LANRev last year , has said it will issue an update to disable the camera feature in the software .
The superintendent of the Lower Merion Police Department , Michael McGrath , declined to comment Sunday on Mandracchia 's claims that the department had access to a site where the school district laptop 's camera photographs were posted .
Instead , McGrath pointed to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Levy on Feb. 22 .
In that statement , Levy confirmed an investigation was ongoing but said that he and other agencies involved would not comment further until the investigation was complete .

It ’s 9AM .
I am already starting my second cup of coffee , and I have just finished an hour and a half of reading other people ’s articles while leaving thoughtful comments .
This is what I have been doing for the past couple of weeks in hopes of driving more traffic to my site .
In the pursuit of any endeavor we ca n’t ignore the fundamentals .
Knowledgeable , aspiring young bloggers know that you need to build relationships if you want to establish a loyal fanbase .
This means visiting other blogs , replying to comments and e-mails , making your site look presentable , and providing consistency in content .
However , the fundamentals alone wo n’t get you the success you want , whether it is with blogging , starting a business , or with life in general .
Do n’t get me wrong – the fundamentals are crucial – but you need that X factor if you want to take your work to the next level .
In fact , with the competition , it is almost as if we need a Y and Z factor too .
So what do X , Y , and Z stand for ?
Well … that is for you to figure out .
If I could tell you , then they would no longer be X , Y , and Z ; they would just be any old information that any hack could get a hold of .
Risk - Taking
“ Living at risk is jumping off the cliff and building your wings on the way down . ”
– Ray Bradbury
Pat Flynn at SmartPassiveIncome.com makes a healthy living off blogging .
He says he is not a millionaire , but he does make enough to support his wife and new baby boy .
As a successful businessman , he says if you want to up the ante then you need to take bold actions .
In business or in life you really only have two choices :
A . Do you want to blend into the background ?
B . Or do you want to stand out from the rest ?
When asked this question , many will jump to their feet and scream , “ I want to stand out from the rest ! ”
But it is n’t that easy .
Standing out can be painful .
It requires us to step out of our comfort zone , take risks , experience failure , and then still have the conviction and will to get back up again .
Many wo n’t be able to get back up on that horse after only their first time falling .
It can be that hurtful and dispiriting .
Mindful Persistence
Some folks believe that as long as you are strong and persistent in spite of your failures , then you can make it through anything .
I ’ve written about this before and I certainly still believe that commitment is a strong value to have during any endeavor .
But what if your failure is n’t due to you or any lack of skills ?
Maybe you keep getting thrown off because there is something wrong with the horse ?
How do you know when a failure is due to your lack of commitment or if it is the pursuit in itself that fails ?
That is why I propose mindfulness , a concept I discuss very frequently on this blog .
Mindful persistence means knowing when to be persistent and knowing when to ditch an idea completely .
We need to know when to attribute a failure to our self and when to attribute a failure to uncontrollable circumstances .
If the problem is something inside ourselves , then we need to stay persistent , do research , keep failing , and eventually learn the tools of the trade .
If the problem is an uncontrollable circumstance then it is time to accept a change in strategy .
“ Test fast , fail fast , adjust fast . ”
– Tom Peters
What risks am I taking ?
As a 21 year old , my biggest resource is not money or experience but how I spend my time .
I graduated college a semester early so that I could get a jump - start on what I wanted to do .
Even before I chose to major in psychology I knew I wanted to make a living being self - employed , without any concerns for bosses and strict deadlines .
My biggest risk thus far is my decision to remain unemployed and devote my full - time towards this site .
I am now working on my first ebook , which is going to be my first bold step forward in monetizing my work .
Some may think I am naive or foolish , but I see things in my future that I can not expect others to see for me .
That is a big part of what makes a risk a risk .
I am willing to step out on that limb .
Ask yourself , “ What risks am I taking ? ” What things are you looking to put on the line and what do you think you can achieve in return ?

The diagram above indicates how you will wire the motor , micro-switch and battery pack to the pins on the toggle switch .
This is called ' Dead - Bugging ' and is a prototyping method from way back .
It 's a very simple circuit but it 's easy to mess up the wiring .
Follow the directions carefully or purchase the Useless Printed Circuit Board from us to speed up and greatly simplify the wiring process .
And a cool LEDs to the circuit too .
Wire the gear motor to the indicated pins .
A short length of wire connects opposite pins on the toggle .
Another wire connects the other outside pins on the toggle and this wire has the microswitch in - line .
The battery pack goes to the other remaining pin on the toggle .
If you find that the motor is running in the opposite direction from what is needed , simply reverse the wires going to the motor .
tydarby posted the great graphic below , showing how wire up a modified servo .
The pins to use on the micro-switch are the common ( C ) and normally closed ( NC ) .
Nothing should be connected to the normally open ( NO ) pin .
Notes :
Batteries :
The original parts list used a 4 AA holder but you may find that 4 batteries driving the machine makes for way too fast operation .
Blink , and you 'll miss it .
In most cases you should be able to get away with just 2 or 3 AA batteries , making the overall action more slower , and more visible .
Keep in mind that the our kit only uses 2 AA batteries .
More on Motors :
I originally chose to use servo's because they are available almost everywhere , and are standardized , but you do n't have to use one .
Just about any motor should work , as long as it's geared down , and has enough torque to flip the switch .
The more salvaged parts you use , the better .
Keep in mind that another reason for using a geared motor is to prevent bounce - back from happening when the machine shuts off .
Without the gearing , motor would n't keep the arm pressing down on the micro - switch while it 's off .
The machine 's arm would just keep hitting the switch , turn off then on , then off , then on ....
The next couple of steps show the original way I made my machine .
If you 're building one using the information above , then SKIP the next 4 steps and jump to step 10 .
US woman accused of plotting to murder unnamed Swede and raising money for her cause on the internet
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
An American woman who called herself Jihad Jane has been charged over an alleged plot to murder a Swedish man .
Colleen Renee LaRose , 46 , from Philadelphia , is also accused of conspiracy to provide support to terrorists , making false statements and attempted identity theft .
Irish police yesterday arrested seven people over an apparent plot to kill Lars Vilks , a Swedish cartoonist who had a bounty put on his head after depicting the prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog – though Vilks has not been named as LaRose 's alleged target .
Garda sources said the four men and three women were in their mid-20s to late - 40s .
Some of them arrested hold Irish citizenship and some are from the Middle East .
Converts to Islam were among them , the Irish police said .
Vilks 's cartoon , drawn in 2007 , prompted al - Qaida to place a $ 100,000 ( £ 67,000 ) bounty on his head and offer a 50 % bonus to anyone who slit his throat to ensure he was " slaughtered like a lamb " .
At least three Swedish newspapers – Dagens Nyheter , Expressen and Sydsvenska Dagbladet – published the cartoon today .
The US justice department declined to comment on whether the two cases were connected .
David Kris , the head of the department 's national security division , said : " The indictment , which alleges that a woman from suburban America agreed to carry out murder overseas and to provide material support to terrorists , underscores the evolving nature of the threat we face . "
LaRose , who also called herself Fatima LaRose online , allegedly posted a comment on YouTube in June 2008 saying she wanted to help " the suffering Muslim people " .
According to the indictment filed in a federal court in Pennsylvania she sent emails to unnamed co-conspirators offering to become a martyr as well as to use her American background to avoid detection .
The indictment accuses LaRose of agreeing in March 2009 to marry a co-conspirator from a south Asian country who was trying to obtain residency in Europe .
He is alleged to have urged her to go to Sweden , find the unnamed Swedish man " and kill him " .
The indictment claims she tried to raise money over the internet , lure others to her cause and lied to FBI investigators .
LaRose was arrested after returning to the US in October 2009 on a charge related to the theft of a US passport , according to court documents .
If convicted on the four counts in the indictment , which was dated 4 March 2010 , LaRose could face a sentence of life in prison and a fine of $ 1 m ( £ 670,000 ) .
Michael Levy , the US attorney in Pennsylvania , said the case showed that terrorists were looking for Americans to join their cause .
" It shatters any lingering thought that we can spot a terrorist based on appearance . "
The Obama administration has grown increasingly worried about Americans and foreigners living in the US taking up the cause of anti-American militants .
Two recent cases have fuelled those concerns : the arrest of a Chicago man accused of helping plot the 2008 Mumbai attacks and an Afghan immigrant living in Colorado who pleaded guilty to plotting a bomb attack on the New York subway system .
OTTAWA — Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon took a harder line Tuesday against Israel ’s controversial decision to build settlements in east Jerusalem , saying he condemns the plan .
That ’s the strongest language to date by a Conservative cabinet minister against Israel .
The Harper government has been accused in the past of tilting its Middle East policy too much toward Israel , drawing complaints from Canadian Arab and Muslim groups .
But Cannon now appears to be following the tougher U.S. line after Israel ’s surprise announcement last week that it plans to build 1,600 new apartments in a Jewish neighbourhood in disputed east Jerusalem .
Last week , Cannon released a cautious statement that expressed both “ regret ” and “ concern ” for the new settlement plan , calling it an obstacle to the pursuit of peace in the Middle East .
His language was tougher Tuesday during testimony before the House of Commons foreign affairs committee .
“ We firmly believe in two sovereign states living side by side in harmony .
That is the position that the government of Canada has put forward , ” Cannon said .
“ On expansion into east Jerusalem , we feel that this is contrary to international law and therefore condemn it .
We ’re very concerned with what is taking place . ”
Israel ’s settlement plan upstaged a visit by U.S. Vice - President Joe Biden to the country last week and soured relations between Washington and Jerusalem .
The Obama administration immediately criticized the settlements in the toughest language possible — in contrast to the softer language in Cannon ’s statement last week .
Cannon said that the Palestinian - Israeli conflict would be a topic of discussion when he hosts G8 foreign ministers for a day of meetings in two weeks near Ottawa .
He also told the committee that Prime Minister Stephen Harper telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the issue .
Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae later pressed Harper for details of his conversation with Netanyahu .
“ I have discussed this with Prime Minister Netanyahu and of course I repeated the government of Canada ’s position , as the minister of foreign affairs did last week in collaboration with a number of our allies .
Our position on the particular issue at hand is well known , ” Harper told the Commons .
“ At the same time I indicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu , and would indicate to all involved in this particular conflict , that I hope they will all do their best efforts to see their way to resuming peace talks in some form as soon as possible . ”
Rae retorted : “ It is interesting that the prime minister did not repeat the words of his minister two hours ago at the committee of the House of Commons . ”
Cannon ’s office later tried to back away from the tougher language he used before the all - party committee of MPs .
“ I want to make it clear that what the minister said today in committee is not an escalation in our diplomatic language , our position has not changed , we have expressed Canada ’s concern regarding the planned expansion of Israeli settlements and are encouraging Israelis and Palestinians to move ahead with indirect peace talks , ” spokeswoman Catherine Loubier said in an e-mailed statement .
A United Nations - backed diplomatic group , known as The Quartet , has also registered its condemnation of the new Israeli settlement plan .
In a statement issued last week , the group — comprised of the UN , the European Union , the U.S. and Russia — said it “ condemns Israel ’s decision to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem . ”
Rae questioned why Harper ’s office did not publicize his Monday telephone call to Netanyahu .
He said that Canada has a leadership role to play in the helping to revive the stalled Middle East peace process .
“ I think the impasse between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority has frankly been exacerbated by events of recent days and I think it is very important that the Canadian government do whatever it can to try to bring the parties together , ” said Rae .

The aftershocks of Israel ’s decision to announce the new settlement during the Biden visit continued to be felt Tuesday .
The U.S. State Department announced the postponement of a visit to the region by the Obama administration ’s special Middle East peace envoy , George Mitchell .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who has called the timing of the last week ’s Israeli announcement an insult , brushed off suggestions of a crisis in U.S. - Israeli relations but called on Netanyahu ’s government to prove its commitment to the peace process .
Clinton said the U.S. remains committed to reviving the stalled peace process .

It is the curious incident of the cuttlefish and seahorse in the daytime .
Biologists diving in the seas off Spain witnessed a European cuttlefish laying its eggs on a passing seahorse , which then swims away , eggs in tow .
The researchers believe they have filmed the European cuttlefish laying eggs in the wild for the first time .
However , during filming , one cuttlefish appears to confuse the seahorse with seaweed , laying its eggs on the passing fish despite the water being clear .
The eggs were really tight round the seahorse 's tail
Marine researcher Ms Fiona Read
The startling behaviour was captured on film by Manuel Enrique Garcia Blanco , an underwater cameraman and photographer , who works with Ms Fiona Read , a PhD student at the Marine Research Institute in Vigo , Galicia , Spain .
Together , the researchers are investigating the sustainability of fisheries in the northwest Iberian Peninsula , including an old type of fishing for cuttlefish still practised by fishers living in a few villages within Galicia .
As part of the research , Mr Blanco was diving off the island of Toralla in the Ria de Vigo , where cuttlefish arrive in the winter to breed and spawn .

During one dive , he filmed a pair of European cuttlefish ( Sepia officinalis ) mating and laying eggs in the seagrass , which to the best of the researchers ' knowledge is the first time such behaviour has been recorded in the wild .
Over two hours , he recorded the cuttlefish laying 15 eggs at two different sites .
The cuttlefish attached the eggs onto seagrass , which holds the eggs in the current , laying an egg at each site around three minutes apart .
This is similar to what other European cuttlefish do when reproducing in captivity , behaviour observed by the researchers the year before in an aquarium .
However , Mr Blanco also captured another , much more improbable first : a seahorse swimming along with two cuttlefish eggs attached to its tail .
" The cuttlefish had laid the eggs on the seahorse rather than the seagrass , " Ms Read told the BBC .
" From the egg - laying behaviour , it is almost certain the cuttlefish put the eggs on when the seahorse was sitting in the seagrass . "
Rather than let the seahorse be compromised by the eggs , Mr Blanco decided to intervene .
" The eggs were really tight round the seahorse 's tail and it was thought to effect the survival of the seahorse , " explains Ms Read .
" So the seahorse was captured and the eggs were cut from its tail .
" The seahorse is expected to survive but the eggs were damaged during the dissection . "

Certain vigilant operatives from the blogosphere have caught wind of some key words and phrases that we might soon be hearing on Fox News , as Republican pollster and memo composer Frank Luntz has let fly with his latest manifesto on how to spin the news about happenings on Capitol Hill to the GOP ’s advantage .

Introduction
In the past several months I ’ve been working with a rather large application built with symfony .
I noticed that symfony makes heavy use of the Singleton pattern ( other frameworks , like Zend do that too ) ; everywhere in the code there were pieces like this one :
<? php // ... sfSomething ::getInstance ( ) ; // ... ?>
I know that in more than half of the situations , you can write your code using plain static classes , with some initialize ( ) method , as an alternative to writing singletons .
For example , this is a dummy Singleton :
<? php class DummySingleton { private function __construct ( ) {} private function __clone ( ) {} public static function getInstance ( ) { if ( self : : $ __instance == NULL ) self : :$ __instance = new DummySingleton ; return self : : $ __instance ; } public function foo( ) { echo ' I am DummySingleton : : foo ( ) ' ; } } ?>
Now this is a completely useless class , but it suits our purpose of illustrating the Singleton .
Notice the amount of code needed by the Singleton pattern .
Except the foo( ) method , all the code in the class makes sure you have only one instance at any time during the execution .
Now let ’s write a static class that does the same thing as the Singleton :
<? php class DummyStatic { static public function foo( ) { echo ' I am DummyStatic : : foo ( ) ' ; } } ?>
This is much cleaner , as we do n’t need the extra code the Singleton needs , and can focus on our task at hand .
Performance comparison
Let ’s compare the performance of the two approaches .
I ’ve written a small test script that looks like this :
<? php /** * A singleton class */ class TestSingleton { // singleton code private static $ __instance = NULL ; private function __construct ( ) {} private function __clone ( ) {} static public function getInstance ( ) { if ( self : : $ __instance == NULL ) self : :$ __instance = new TestSingleton ; return self : :$ __instance ; } // our actual code public $ val = 0 ; public function test ( ) { for ( $ i=0 ; $ i < 30 ; $ i++ ) $ this -> val += $ i ; } }
/** * a plain static class ( all members are static ) */ class TestStatic { static public $ val = 0 ; static public function test ( ) { for ( $ i=0 ; $ i < 30 ; $ i++ ) self : : $val += $ i ; } }
// how many runs $ runs = 500000 ;
// benchmarking Singleton $ start = microtime ( TRUE ) ; for ( $i=0 ; $i< $runs ; $i++ ) TestSingleton::getInstance ( ) -> test ( ) ; $ run1 = microtime ( TRUE ) - $ start ;
// benchmarking static $ start = microtime ( TRUE ) ; for ( $i=0 ; $i< $runs ; $i++ ) TestStatic::test ( ) ; $ run2 = microtime ( TRUE ) - $ start ; echo '< pre > ' ; echo ' test singleton : '.number_format ( $run1 , 8 ) . " s
" ; echo ' test static : '.number_format ( $run2 , 8 ) . ' s' ; ?>
Basicly , I put together the two types of classes .
Both have a method called test ( ) , which does some arithmetic operations , just to have something that spends some execution time .
I ’ve ran this script for various values for the $runs variable : 100 , 1 k 10 k , 100k , 200k , 300 k , 500k and 1M .
Test results
Number of runs Singleton call time ( s ) Static call time ( s ) 100 0.004005 0.001511 1,000 0.018872 0.014552 10,000 0.174744 0.141820 100,000 1.643465 1.431564 200,000 3.277334 2.812432 300,000 5.079388 4.419048 500,000 8.086555 6.841494 1,000,000 16.189018 13.696728
I have also done some spreadsheet magic , and generated this chart :
As you can see , for a relatively small number of runs ( < 1 k ) , the Static code is significantly faster than the Singleton , an than it stabilizes arround 15 % faster than Singleton , as I expected .
This is because every function / method call involves some operations ( symbol lookup , stack manipulation etc. ) , and each call to the Singleton method , in fact , also calls the getInstance ( ) static method .
Conclusion
It may not be that obvious that making extensive use of Singletons has this kind of side effect ; however , if your code has more that 100 or 1,000 calls to some getInstance ( ) method of a Singleton class , you might want to consider caching the reference to the object it returns , or even refactoring the code to use only static method calls .
You might say that you need an object because you do stuff in the constructor .
That can be easily achieved with some kind of static initialize ( ) method , that should be called once in your code , just before usage .
If you have some auto loading mechanism in place , you could call it just after loading the class , for example , if you want to automate the initialization process .
But keep in mind that this is not a 100 % replacement for Singletons ; you need an object if you want to serialize / unserialize it ( for caching , some RPC call , etc. ) .
Update .
Tested with Facebook ’s HPHP compiler :
I ’ve tested the script using the HPHP compiler , and the results are spectacular .
While keeping the same time ratio between the Singleton and Static calls , what stroke me is the huge difference ( HPHP is ~ 200 times faster ) :
Number of calls
Time spent ( Apache ) Time spent ( HPHP ) Apache Singleton call Apache Static call HPHP Singleton call HPHP Static call 100 0.004005 0.001511 0.00001502 0.00000906 1,000 0.018872 0.014552 0.00008988 0.00007486 10,000 0.174744 0.141820 0.00075102 0.00063801 100,000 1.643465 1.431564 0.00829983 0.00795388 200,000 3.277334 2.812432 0.01839614 0.01339102 300,000 5.079388 4.419048 0.02502608 0.01932502 500,000 8.086555 6.841494 0.04114008 0.03280401 1,000,000 16.189018 13.696728 0.07872796 0.06373119
Happy coding .
In March 2008 , the Department of Defense supposedly published a memo about a perceived national security threat .
The target : Wikileaks a site that had previously put out sensitive information about Abu Ghraib .
Advertisement
It 's been two years since that memo , which Wikileaks has published ( PDF ) , and there 's no clear evidence that Wikileaks was ever tampered with .
But it 's chilling to think that it could have ever even — and still may be — a possibility .
Sites like Wikileaks catalog our secret history , the version that we were n't supposed to know .
In fact , according to the memo , the DoD 's primary concern was that someone from inside the government was feeding the site important documents :
The possibility that a current employee or mole within DoD or elsewhere in the U.S. government is providing sensitive information or classified information to Wikileaks.org cannot be ruled out .
Wikileaks.org claims that the " leakers " or " whistleblowers " of sensitive or classified DoD documents are former U.S. government employees .
These claims are highly suspect , however , since Wikileaks.org states that the anonymity and protection of the leakers or whistleblowers is one of its primary goals .
Advertisement
In other words , a primary source .
According to the memo , the DoD considered Wikileaks ' weaknesses , at least in regards to finding those moles through site exploits :
The obscurification technology used by Wikileaks.org has exploitable vulnerabilities .
Organizations with properly trained cyber technicians , the proper equipment , and the proper technical software could most likely conduct computer network exploitation ( CNE ) operations or use cyber tradecraft to obtain access to Wikileaks.org 's
Web site , information systems , or networks that may assist in identifying those persons supplying the data and the means by which they transmitted the data to Wikileaks.org .
...
Successful identification , prosecution , termination of employment , and exposure of persons leaking the information by the governments and businesses affected by information posted to Wikileaks.org would damage and potentially destroy [ its ] center of gravity and deter others from taking similar actions .

A frightening thought , although to date there have n't been any reports of Wikileak source exposures .
( Though they 've definitely screwed up themselves . )

Other than the obvious Big Brother creepy - crawly feelings this story invites , it 's also an important reminder about how we keep our collective memory .
It 's through news , and occasionally through secret documents , and through the stories we tell .
If Wikileaks had n't existed , the Guantanamo Bay torture manual may never have come to light .
Nor a map of Abu Ghraib .
Sites like Wikileaks force us to remember those things that some people would rather us forget .
Deleting it , or its information , is like a memory wipe of history .

Memory [ Forever ] is our week - long consideration of what it really means when our memories , encoded in bits , flow in a million directions , and might truly live forever .
Here at the Sexist , one of the most persistent rape myths offered up to excuse sexual assault is the idea that rape is just one big misunderstanding .
Under this theory , rape is n’t a conscious assault against a person who has n’t consented to sex ; it ’s the result of an honest miscommunication that arises from natural communicative differences between men and women .
Today , Thomas MacAulay Millar at Yes Means Yes ! pointed to a recent paper that addresses this myth head - on .
The report , “ If a girl does n’t say ‘ no ’ : Young men , rape , and insufficient knowledge ” [ PDF ] , identifies the “ miscommunication model ” as one of the dominant theories informing public thinking about how sexual assault actually happens .
In order to identify how the “ miscommunication model ” functions in everyday conversation , researchers interviewed two focus groups of college - aged men in the UK Australia about their interpretations of sex and consent .
The young men who participated in the study displayed “ sophisticated and nuanced understandings ” of different ways people could indicate sexual refusal .
But when it came time to talk about non-consensual sex , these same men were startlingly eager to explain away acquaintance rapes as communication failures instead of deliberate assaults .
* “ I do n’t think I ’d ever say ‘ no ’ ” :
First , researches asked the men how they would turn down unwanted sex .
The men displayed a marked reluctance to offer a clear “ no ” to sex , and instead suggested that they would employ euphemism and body language to communicate their refusal .
( Note : I ’ve edited the study for style ) .
Moderator : . . . the next scenario is , you ’re back at your house with a girl .
It ’s looking like sex is on the cards for whatever reason you really do n’t want to have sex with her tonight .
How do you let her know ?
John :
You could come up with one of ya , your cliches , like , ‘ I do n’t think this is a good idea ’ , or ah , you know , ‘ I ’m not ready for this ’ or you know one of the cliches .
As soon as you come out with that cliche , they know .
They know what you ’re trying to say because it ’s used all the time , whereas if you sort of try and dance around the cliches they might not get the point straight away .
. . .
James : I ’ve got no idea .
George : I know people that will do anything for a root .
If it got to that stage , obviously you ’re interested .
Well I ’d assume that ’d be the case so then why would you say no ?
You always , it ’s easier to make an excuse the next day than at the time .
Moderator : Hehe .
How do you say no ?
James :
If it ’s a disgusting woman .
I mean just a platonic kind of friend but a disgusting woman .
You gotta make a face if they ’re sort of implying something , then they ’ll probably get the picture .
. . .
I do n’t think I ’d , do n’t think I ’d ever say ‘ no ’
John :
You just say — - James :
If they were at my house then it ’d be for a reason , so .
John :
Oh yeah .
‘ This is n’t quite what I expected tonight ’ and then they ’d say ‘ what did you expect . ’
‘ Not this , I just thought we ’d have a drink and then you ’d go home .’ . . .
James :
And then they ’d start to get the , get the idea .
Andrew : I ’d call a cab ( inaudible ) rather sensitive excuse , I guess .
John : Yeah , you do n’t wanna say .
You could n’t say ‘ no ’ , could you .
You do n’t wanna say ‘ No , I do n’t like you now . ’
You know you ’d come up with some excuse : ‘ You looked good in the soft light at the pub , but now . . . ’ George : ‘ I ’m sobering up now ’
John : Yeah hehehe , ‘ And I ’m having second thoughts . ’
A soft gentle excuse would be the best one .
* “ There ’s always little hints ” : Researchers then asked the men how they know when a woman is refusing sex .
The men indicated that women also often rely on body language and euphemism to relay their lack of consent .
Interestingly , even though the men professed to favoring the exact same tactics , they attributed these devices to the way that “ women are ” :
Moderator : Hmm , great , okay so are there ways of knowing when it ’s not on the cards ?
How would a guy pick up that sex is not on the cards that way ?
John : Body language .
James : Yeah ( inaudible ) body language .
Moderator :
What ’s that , sorry ?
James :
It ’s all put down as body language .
. . .
Women are pretty good fakers , teasers , no , but it ’s body language all the time .
George : The conversation gets shorter .
James : Mhmm .
George : Very abrupt .
John : Start looking at their watch and you know ( inaudible ) “ It ’s getting late . ”
Andrew : ‘ How long does the taxi take to get here , ’ that type of thing .
. . .
John : “ I just remembered I ’m working early in the morning , ” you know there ’s always little hints like letting you know that “ I ’ve just uh changed my mind . ”
Yeah there ’s always little hints .
* “ The perpetrator could actually really be the victim ” :
But then the young men start talking about rape , and the idea that lack of consent can be clearly communicated through euphemistic or nonverbal cues is quickly abandoned .
The researchers note that prior to the rape discussion , the young men never indicated that “ the explicit use of the word ‘ no ’ is necessary for a woman ’s refusal of a sexual invitation to be understood as such . ”
Suddenly , even “ no ” is not enough .
Once the idea of rape is raised , these men claim ignorance of understanding when a woman is refusing sex , and go on to say that even when a woman explicitly says “ no , ” she can be making a victim of the perpetrator .
Kyle :
Um I just , I just had a thought .
When does no mean no , when does yes mean yes , I ’m just wondering how this type of information ties into rape and stuff like that .
Um , with um , common defences of ( inaudible ) stuff like that .
. . .
I ’m wondering in those situations , what is the thinking of the perpetrator in terms of these signals they ’re interpreting that are coming their way , you know ?
. . .
Jason :
If you do n’t give a verbal ‘ no ’ then you ’re up shit creek .
. . .
Cam :
Then again , well as you said , well , when ’s no , no when ’s yes yes .
The perpetrator could actually really be the victim where they ’re going ‘ no ’ and they ’re basically throwing themself on you and go , ‘ well , I said ‘‘ no . ’’’
Kyle : Playing hard to get .
* “ So both parties are a problem there “ : Researchers then directly asked the men what they thought about the “ miscommunication theory . ”
They supported it :
Jason :
If a girl does n’t say ‘ no ’ look you in the eye and say ‘ no . ’
Anything else can be sort of miscommunicated so if she looks you in the eye and goes ‘ no ’. . .
Fine .
But if she goes . . . if she sort of says ‘ no , ’ and does the whole look away flirty it sort of like leaves you in the lurch .
Moderator : Alright .
Any other ideas ?
Cam : Basically , well , it can actually happen to a male or female , like , this myth that I ’ve heard females say about ‘ oh how could a guy get raped . ’
Hey , just ‘ cause you do n’t want it do n’t mean it do n’t feel good .
Um you know , the same goes for females basically .
Whichever sex it is has to be clear about ‘ look na this has gone past where I want to go I ’m not prepared to go any further ’ and make it clear .
‘ No more . ’
‘ Stop there . ’
Or you know if they want some of the stuff but they do n’t wanna do it all .
You know they need to go ‘ look , ’ and be clear , ‘ I want it to go here , and just here for now . ’ . . .
Basically you know otherwise there is misconception and there is , you know miscommunication where one ’s going ‘ okay well they ’re doing this ’ and the other ’s going , ‘ I wish they ’d back off a bit .
’So unless each is clear then , you know , it will continue .
. . .
Moderator : . . . do you think it ’s necessary for a women to say ‘ no ’ clearly and effectively for her to be understood as not wanting to have sex or are there other ways of knowing that she does n’t want to ?
Mike :
You can always take the physical signs , but like I said before they ’re generally really ambiguous , you never know if they are definite .
I reckon verbal ’s probably the best way to get round it .
. . .
If she says ‘ no ’ I ’ll stop , you know .
. . .
Cam :
Yep , but they really need to make it clear in both physical and verbal .
There ’s no point them saying ‘ oh no I do n’t want it ’ and then for you know , they ’re basically they ’re guiding you in , so to speak .
Well , gee , do they really not want it ? . . .
Jason :
There ’s plenty of opportunities for all women to stop it , assuming the boy ’s being honourable and stuff but um they can not sort of get into that sort of situation the flirty situation in the first place or they can not go home with you an’ they can not go into the bedroom an’ they can once you ’re there they can sort of like go ‘ no you ’re not allowed to take my clothes off ’ and they can — - I think it ’s what ’s that 30 second rule they had in America where the guy was having sex with her , and she goes ‘ na this is a bad idea , ’ says ‘ no , ’ he finishes , and she goes ‘ oh that was rape ’ and sort of like — - so there ’s plenty of opportunities for a girl to avoid the situation , and um , so , but if a girl looks you in the eye and says ‘ no ’ then that ’s sort of the end of it .
Mike :
Um back on that note I think I think things progress I ’d say from the age of say maybe eighteen , or maybe even twenty onwards .
Generally you find people being more sexually active , generally like they ’re sort of coming out of the later stage of adolescence and that the sign is generally that if you go out with someone I think from that age on , you ’re , that ’s sort of what ’s going to happen , that ’s pretty much what the plan is , but then to back out , like if it gets to a situation where like , you can end up in a situation where it , like , becomes date rape .
Generally you ’re given the signs that to that point it is okay , you know , like it depends on the age ( inaudible ) .
Probably eighteen onwards I ’d say .
Kyle :
Um , sorry to interrupt , but I just realized that , um , that statement is kind of putting the blame on women almost .
She fails , something she did — - Jason :
He misinterprets her — - Kyle :
She fails to say ‘ no ’ clearly .
Well , what about the guy ?
Cam : Yeah , he ’s also , he ’s failed to actually interpret what she means , so it ’s actually both parties .
Mike :
So both parties are a problem there .
. . .
Jason : Women often seem to forget that men do n’t deal with subtleties .
If we want something , we tell you .
. . .
Mike : Men deal in yes and no , whereas women deal in a vast array of options , so , yeah .
. . .
Like I think i- if the situation is ambiguous the male is going to lean towards the positive side of interpretation of it .
Jason : Hehe , of course .
This is where things fall off the rails .
Suddenly , men do n’t deal with “ subtleties , ” even though the men have previously reported that they would turn down sex in the same way they ’d expect women to — - subtly .
Suddenly , a person misinterpreting lack of consent is completely understandable if “ she fails to say ‘ no ’ clearly , ” even though the men had previously never invoked direct refusalas a way they know if women do n’t want to have sex with them .
Suddenly , a woman is required to engage in a very specific behavior — - looking her sex partner in the eye and saying “ no ” — - in order to not be responsible for her own rape .
And suddenly , in order to neutralize the misogyny a little bit , both men and women are equally as likely to be in a position where they must deter sexual advances with eye contact and a firm “ no , ” even though the men had previously indicated that they could never even conceive of a situation where they would be expected to do such a thing .
As Thomas MacAulay Millar notes , these men are likely not rapists .
So why is it so natural for them to make excuses for them ?
“ The gist of it is that these young men evidenced an understanding of and even a preference for nuances and diplomatic communication to refuse sex , but then when discussing rape , reversed course and began to argue that anything the least bit ambiguous was unintelligible , ” Millar writes .
“ What gives ?
Why create a social framework where rape is accidental if they do n’t have to cover their own asses ? ”
I do n’t have an answer to that , but the study does suggest one way we to address this problem :
Show people studies like this .
“ [ I ] n presenting this research , and its ’ associated transcripts , to young men and women , ” the study claims , “ we have found that by drawing attention to our shared commonsensical knowledge of how everyday refusals are normatively done , and then to how this knowledge is often then patently discounted in favour of the interpretative repertoire of miscommunication . . . young people become engaged in an active discussion of how it is that both sexual consent and sexual refusal are actually negotiated . ”
Chile has been shaken by a strong 6.3 - magnitude earthquake that officials said was not an aftershock from the massive quake that killed more than 800 people last weekend .
The head of the Office of National Emergency ( ONEMI ) , Carmen Fernandez , said no damage had been reported but " obviously there is fear among the people " .
The quake struck at 7:39 pm ( local time ) and its epicentre was 105 kilometres below the Andes mountains , north - east of Calama , according to the US Geological Survey , which monitors earthquake activity .
Calama , a major centre for mining with one of the world 's largest open - air copper mines located nearby , is 2,500 metres above sea level so there is no danger of a tsunami , Mr Fernandez said .
The powerful 8.8 - magnitude quake and following tsunami that struck Chile on Saturday killed more than 800 people , according to official figures .

Google — a big advertising company that does n’t advertise — debuted at the Super Bowl Sunday .
Their ad tells the story of a romance helped along by a series of Google searches conducted by ( one is left to imagine ) a young man who finds love after a simple plan to study abroad in Paris turns into love , marriage and a need to know how to assemble a crib .
John Battelle more or less ran down Google ’s intentions Saturday after Google CEO Eric Schmidt tipped his hand on Twitter .
But it was an unexpected move by the search giant which reaps billions from online ads but has eschewed advertising its own brand even as competitors Microsoft and Yahoo have spent 10’s of millions of dollars on television and print creative to compete with the company that nevertheless retains a search market share exceeding 70 percent .
Google ’s avoidance of self - promoting commercials might seem unnecessary since their company name is almost a verb when it comes to search .
But it is unusual because even big companies with world - known brands find it helpful to remind the public about themselves in a positive light — especially on the Super Bowl .
And even Google may also need a little jolt of positive buzz given its bold initiative to scan the world ’s books and its high - profile threat to stop censoring search results in China ( which means it will be news to some that Google has been censoring search results in China ) — to say nothing of its behavioral targeting strategy .
As Battelle reminds , Schmidt in 2006 called brand advertising “ The last bastion of unaccountable spending in corporate America . ”
At something like $ 3 million per 30 - second spot the decision to start ( and perhaps finish ) a TV campaign on the Super Bowl is a lot like arranging to fly for the first time on the Space Shuttle .
And , since it ’s just a series of screengrabs of searches , the suggestions as they take shape , and the results which tell the heart - warming narrative , the ad itself must be a contender for the cheapest ever aired during the Super Bowl .
In fact , it was n’t even produced for the Super Bowl .
Schmidt said in a post on the Google blog that the ad , “ Parisian Love , ” has been on YouTube for over three months and that the company decided “ to share it with a wider audience . ”
Considering that the estimated worldwide audience for Super Bowl XLIV was about one billion people that is an exponentially wider audience than the 1.2 million hits the video has online at this writing .
“ We did n’t set out to do a Super Bowl ad , or even a TV ad for search , ” Schmidt said in the post .
“ Our goal was simply to create a series of short online videos about our products and our users , and how they interact . ”
More good luck for Google : their ad aired in the third quarter , which is n’t ordinarily prime time since Super Bowl games can tend to be blowouts and viewership drops off .
But this year the second half began with a rare onside kick by the New Orleans Saints which they converted into a quick touchdown to take the lead for the first time .
The re-energized Saints went on to decisively beat the favored Indianapolis Colts , 31 - 17 .
Reaction to the TV ad , which has no narration and a gentle soundtrack , was quick and largely positive .
Word of mouth marketing expert David Binkowski said on Twitter that “ @Google ad was very good .
Value proposition was dead on and they told their story extremely well . ”
New York Times media reporter Brian Stelter joked : “ I want to try this “ Google . ” ( Seriously , though , that was a lovely ad , and everybody in the room adored it . ”
Wired ’s own Steven Levy said , tongue perhaps in cheek , “ Ca n’t wait to see the analytics on Google superbowl ad . ”
Media critic Jeff Jarvis was non-plussed .
“ Disappointed Google did n’t make a new commercial appropriate to the Super Bowl .
France ?
Football ?
Google ? ”
But one YouTube commenter in particular was undoubtedly what Google had been hoping for .
“ ahhh was watching the superbowl ( coincidentally as﻿ an American girl in Paris ) and this made me cry !! ” said .
“ Best ad of the whole superbowl ! ”
People buy different insurance plans for protecting their valuables .
In this context , the umbrella insurance coverage is one kind of added liability insurance used by several businesses .
It is specifically designed to safeguard the insured individuals or businesses against certain lawsuits and claims .
An umbrella insurance plan helps by protecting the assets and the business of the insured .
Many insurance companies provide such policies .
But it is always a good idea to consult the right insurance agent with proper licensing and certification to know more about such coverages .

Understanding the Umbrella Insurance Coverage
The umbrella insurance coverage covers significant property damage , especially when a standard insurance liability limit might be exhausted .
This kind of insurance is perfect for professionals and individuals like lawyers and doctors , and non-profit volunteers .
Umbrellas insurance plans help individuals fill the void left over by their standard or primary insurance plans .
Generally , purchasing an umbrella coverage from the same insurance firm not only helps in enhancing the coverage of the primary insurance but also helps the insured in getting the policy at discounted prices .
Work Procedure of an Umbrella Insurance Plan
The different types of insurance plans available in the market offer a certain type of coverage .
For example , if you are going for an automobile insurance plan , it will protect you if you experience a motor vehicle accident .
Similarly , if you are going for a homeowner ’s insurance plan , it will cover your home and its belongings against theft , damage , or fire .
In contrast , an umbrella insurance package covers most of the aspects of the insured ’s financial life .
An umbrella insurance plan is used in the same way as a homeowner ’s umbrella insurance , office package insurance , shopkeeper ’s umbrella insurance , business package insurance , doctor ’s package insurance , etc .
There are some common sections of such plans that offer coverage against allied perils , fire , electronic equipment , burglary , and other household appliances , and loss of cash because of personal accident or assault .
What are the Benefits of an Umbrella Insurance Policy ?
Umbrella insurance coverage comes as an extra layer of protection and security for an insured individual or business .
It is considered as one progressive step across the insurance arena .
It is one of the most progressive insurance products presently being offered by several insurance agencies .
It not only helps in ensuring complete peace of mind but even makes the insured feel additionally safe and secure .
There are several benefits of opting for an umbrella insurance plan , and we will be looking at them below :
The policy is highly beneficial for the ones who possess several assets .
The insured under an umbrella insurance policy gets covered for legal liability , personal liabilities , and various other common risks to properties .
It is possible to purchase an umbrella insurance plan within an affordable range if it is bought from the same insurance company from where an individual got his or her primary or standard insurance coverage .
The umbrella policy is available within an affordable range because there are huge discounts offered by the insurance company to its existing clients .
The majority of the insurance companies also have provisions of reinstatement of the sum insured during the policy ’s time .
An umbrella insurance plan covers the insured against unforeseen circumstances , dangers , and threats not covered by their standard insurance plans .
The policy offers broader coverage on different varieties of standard insurances along with the flexibility of choosing the needed sections for the desired amount insured .
Hassle - free renewals are an important benefit of such policies .
Everything happens in just a single stroke .
There are even several rider options available for the policyholders to choose from for an all - inclusive coverage .
Umbrella Insurance Plan Cost
Such insurance plans might not be effective in intentional criminal activities , contractual liabilities , and war .
The policy also does not offer any coverage for damages caused by body illnesses , transit , and motor vehicles .
This policy will be the right bet for you if you want that extra cushioning and your standard or primary insurance coverage .
However , the cost of this insurance plan will completely depend on the amount of coverage you are buying and the coverage amount insured you have opted for .
If you are going for several policy sections and more sum insured , then the policy will cost you more .
Nevertheless , it is important to note that such insurance plans are more affordable than other individual plans .
Conclusion
Umbrella insurance coverage is the tool that assures complete peace against all future expenditures .
It will help you protect your valuable assets in the most trouble - free manner .
This extra liability coverage even protects the insured from huge claims and lawsuits .
Beck sure seemed to throw a lot of his longtime pals and allies under his personal bus yesterday , while calling for his audience to eschew " violent behavior " :
Beck :
Get away from anybody who 's calling for a revolution -- whether it's a Tea Party revolution , or a Communist revolution !
Hmmmm .
Sounds like good advice , actually .
Especially considering just who we 've been hearing talk about a new American " revolution " .
All of them , as it happens , are part of the same Tea Party crowd Beck seemingly just threw overboard .
You know , the crowd he 's been exhorting for the past year .
Folks like Sarah Palin :
Palin :
And I am a big supporter of this movement , I believe in this movement .
Got lots of friends and family in the Lower 48 who attend these events and across the country , just knowing that this is the movement , and America is ready for another revolution , and you are a part of this .
Or her wingnut - in- arms , Rep. Michele Bachmann :
At this point the American people - it's like Thomas Jefferson said , a revolution every now and then is a good thing .
We are at the point , Sean , of revolution .
And by that , what I mean , an orderly revolution -- where the people of this country wake up get up and make a decision that this is not going to happen on their watch .
It wo n't be our children and grandchildren that are in debt .
It is we who are in debt , we who will be bankrupting this country , inside of ten years , if we do n't get a grip .
And we can't let the Democrats achieve their ends any longer .
This one , by the way , received a warm on - air endorsement from Beck 's Fox colleague , Sean Hannity :
Bachmann : Right now I 'm a member of Congress .
And I believe that my job here is to be a foreign correspondent , reporting from enemy lines .
And people need to understand , this is n't a game .
this is n't just a political talk show that 's happening right now .
This is our very freedom , and we have 230 years , a continuous link of freedom that every generation has ceded to the next generation .
...
Hannity : It 's not -- you are not overstating this case , Congresswoman , and you do n't need to apologize for it .
And as a matter of fact , it 's refreshing .
And I can tell you , all around this country , on 535 of the best radio stations in this country , people are saying " Amen , " " Hallelujah " , " where have you been ? "
And then there was the actor Bob Basso , who Beck hired to play " Thomas Paine " for one of Beck 's pro-Tea Party rants .
Beck hired Basso because he is fond of portraying Paine for his Birtherite rants and putting them up on YouTube , including this one -- a nativist , immigrant - bashing rant calling for a " Second American Revolution " :
Basso : Join the grassroots movement of the Second American Revolution -- not of guns and violence , but of pressure , pressure , pressure .
...
Take back America now !
Choose to be part of the Second American Revolution !
Pressure , pressure , pressure !
No presidential candidate , no political party can save you now .
Only an aroused citizenry will turn this uncommon sense around .
And he or she who does nothing now is helping them to destroy America !
We wo n't even mention the outfit that was an original sponsor of the " 9 - 12 March on Washington " while calling for a " Second Civil War " .
It 's almost as if Beck is starting to turn on the very creature he created .
It 's all getting weirder by the day .
But then , with Beck , that 's pretty much what we 've come to expect .
" Erratic " does n't begin to cover it .
i Phone has announced it is to launch an anti-bullying application for its customers in response to the tragic suicide of Irish teen , Phoebe Prince , in Massachusetts in January .
Prince allegedly took her own life on January 14 after suffering from physical and mental bullying at the hands of kids in her South Hadley High School .
A lot of the bullying was issued via cyber space , mainly through social networking sites such as Facebook and in the form of text messages to her cell phone .
The new application , called Bully Shield , retails at $ 0.99 .
The creator of the anti-bullying program said he made it to offer help to other children who may be bullied at school and are not sure how to cope with it .
Since thie Irish teenager 's death , several schools across the country have implemented strong anti-bullying measures .
The Senate in Massachusetts has passed an anti-bullying bill which includes ways to deal with cyber bullying .
On Monday , nine students in South Hadley were charged in connection with Phoebe 's bullying .
A study in the Feb. 1 issue of the journal Sleep suggests that healthy older adults without sleep disorders can expect to have a reduced " sleep need " and to be less sleepy during the day than healthy young adults .
Results show that during a night of eight hours in bed , total sleep time decreased significantly and progressively with age .
Older adults slept about 20 minutes less than middle - aged adults , who slept 23 minutes less than young adults .
The number of awakenings and the amount of time spent awake after initial sleep onset increased significantly with age , and the amount of time spent in deep , slow - wave sleep decreased across age groups .
Yet even with these decreases in sleep time , intensity and continuity , older adults displayed less subjective and objective daytime sleep propensity than younger adults .
Furthermore , two additional nights involving experimental disruption of slow - wave sleep led to a similar response in all age groups .
Daytime sleep propensity increased , and slow - wave sleep rebounded during a night of recovery sleep .
According to the authors , this suggests that the lack of increased daytime sleepiness in the presence of an age - related deterioration in sleep quality cannot be attributed to unresponsiveness to variations in homeostatic sleep pressure .
Instead , healthy aging appears to be associated with reductions in the sleep duration and depth required to maintain daytime alertness .
" Our findings reaffirm the theory that it is not normal for older people to be sleepy during the daytime , " said principal investigator Derk - Jan Dijk , PhD , professor of sleep and physiology at the University of Surrey in the U.K .
" Whether you are young or old , if you are sleepy during the day you either do n't get enough sleep or you may suffer from a sleep disorder . "
The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Centre of the University of Surrey and involved 110 healthy adults without sleep disorders or sleep complaints ; 44 were young ( 20 to 30 years ) , 35 were middle - aged ( 40 to 55 years ) and 31 were older adults ( 66 to 83 years ) .
After an eight - hour baseline sleep test , subjects were randomized to two nights with or without selective slow - wave sleep disruption by acoustic stimuli , followed by one recovery night .
Nighttime sleep was evaluated by polysomnography , while sleep propensity was assessed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT ) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale .
During the baseline night , mean objective total sleep time decreased from 433.5 minutes for young adults to 409.9 minutes for middle - aged adults and 390.4 minutes for older adults .
Average minutes of slow - wave sleep decreased from 118.4 minutes for young adults to 85.3 minutes for middle - aged adults and 84.2 minutes for older adults .
Mean number of minutes spent awake after initial sleep onset increased from 21 for young adults to 49.9 for middle - aged adults and 70.7 for older adults .
Objective daytime sleepiness measured by the MSLT decreased with age .
When asked to lie in a comfortable position on the bed and try to fall asleep , young adults fell asleep in an average of 8.7 minutes , compared with 11.7 minutes for middle - aged adults and 14.2 minutes for older adults .
The authors noted that the cause of the age - related reductions in slow - wave sleep and sleep need still must be established .
Related factors could include alterations in reproductive hormones or changes in the brain .
They added that the study did not address sleep propensity during the evening hours , when it is possible that older adults may be sleepier than young adults .
According to the authors , the study also has implications for the treatment of insomnia in older adults , who may be unaware of their reduced sleep need .
Therefore , sleep restriction , which leads to increased homeostatic sleep pressure , may be a successful behavioral therapy for insomnia in healthy older adults .
One of the things that Sean Hayes loves about Los Angeles ’s Marino Ristorante , the old - school Italian restaurant he picked as the setting for this interview , is the music .
“ They play the craziest renditions of Frank Sinatra , ” he says .
“ Stuff I ’ve never heard .
Like he sings ‘ Close to You ’ by the Carpenters . ”
Sure enough , not 10 minutes later , Sinatra is crooning , “ Why do birds suddenly appear … ”
“ That song !
So romantic for our interview ! ”
Hayes exclaims .
It ’s not the first gay hint the actor has dropped since our lunch began , nor is it the last .
When I order the same dish he does — rigatoni with tomato sauce and chicken — he proclaims , “ It must be a gay thing : the pasta with chicken .
It ’s all the craze ! ”
And when he laments that he has to look good for the next day ’s Advocate photo shoot , he says , “ I ’m so fucking fat right now .
I ’m not even kidding . ”
Sizing up the handsome , salt - and - pepper - goateed man across from me , I offer a sincere reply : “ Oh , please .
You look great .
You do n’t need to worry . ”
His response : “ You have n’t seen me naked . ”
And with a Jack McFarland–like , high - pitched flourish , he adds , “ Yet ! ”
If the guy who spent eight years playing über - gay Jack on Will & Grace had his way , coy suggestions that he is of a certain proclivity ( wink , wink ) would be all he ever shared publicly on the topic of his sexuality .
But nearly four years since the long - running sitcom ended , the 39 - year - old not only is preparing to make his Broadway debut in the first revival of the 1968 musical Promises , Promises but also has agreed to his first interview with The Advocate .
Still , we should be clear on one thing :
He ’s not happy about sitting down with the magazine .
And to understand why , let ’s get a little backstory .
The youngest of five kids raised by their divorced mother in a Chicago suburb , Hayes played classical piano ( “ I think I learned every sonata by Mozart ” ) and , like all his siblings , started auditioning for commercials at age 5 or 6 ( “ Looking back , it was probably for some extra money ” ) .
After a few years studying piano at Illinois State University and a few more honing his improv comedy skills at Second City in Chicago , Hayes moved to Los Angeles in 1995 .
He promptly landed a string of high - profile TV commercials in which he played the husband , boyfriend , or potential hookup to any number of attractive women , all in the name of hawking Doritos , Pepsi , and even Tidy Cats .
Hayes went on to play the charming and sexy title character in the frisky gay romantic comedy Billy ’s Hollywood Screen Kiss , which premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival .
Buzz led to an art - house release , and Hayes had his first brush with the gay press , to whom he did not reveal anything about his sexual orientation .
“ Little did we know , ” says Tommy O’Haver , the film ’s director , “ it was history in the making for gay television . ”
Some TV executives caught Hayes ’s performance at the festival and contacted him to audition for Will & Grace .
“ He and I actually roomed together at Sundance , ” O’Haver says .
“ I remember when he got the call .
It all happened very quickly . ”
Indeed , just a few months later — a year after Ellen DeGeneres came out —
Will & Grace hit the air , riding a mini wave of gay man–straight woman friendship tales , including 1997 ’s My Best Friend ’s Wedding and As Good as It Gets and 1998 ’s The Object of My Affec­tion .
Will , you ’ll recall , was the well - adjusted gay man ; Grace , his straight female best friend and roommate ; and Jack was their outlandish next - door neighbor who was everything Will was not : extroverted , irresponsible , narcissistic , and — at least compared to every other man on TV — flamboyant .
The show met with rave reviews but not a little controversy .
Out characters had been so rare on network TV that the media seized on two points : “ Jack is too gay ! ” and “ Will is n’t gay enough ! ”
To Hayes , it was all unfair and inaccurate : “ The [ press ] wrote , ‘ The flamboyantly feminine over - the - top gay guy Jack … ’
But if you did n’t apply ‘ gay ’ to Jack , he would just be the crazy next - door neighbor who had girls in the revolving [ door ] . ”
Suddenly everyone wanted to know if Hayes himself was gay and how he felt about playing a gay character .
Faced with the very real prospect of jeopardizing his chance at landing straight roles down the road , he started reciting stock answers , variations on what he told the Detroit Free Press early on : “ When I play a gay character I want to be as believable as possible .
And when I ’m playing a straight character I also want to be as believable as possible .
So the less that people know about my personal life , the more believable I can be as a character . ”
And Hayes never pretended to be something he was n’t ; he never walked some pretty woman down the red carpet or faked a straight relationship .

Senate votes to renew Patriot Act
The Senate Wednesday evening passed a one - year extension to the Patriot Act , a Bush - era homeland security law that has been much maligned by Democrats but described by Republicans as key to the war on terror .
Several key components of the law are set to expire Sunday , including wire - tapping , surveillance and seizure provisions .
If passed by the House , they will expire on Feb. 28 , 2011 .

The law was passed by voice vote , which does not require debate on the Senate floor .
Democrats have been extremely critical of the law , which has been described as overreaching and reactionary .
Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , in a statement Wednesday , said he " would have preferred to add oversight and judicial review improvements " to the act 's renewal .
By blocking the cellular signaling activity of a protein , a team of neuroscientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( CSHL ) has prevented memory loss in fruit flies caused by brain plaques similar to those thought to cause Alzheimer 's disease in humans .
The study also resolves a long - standing controversy about the role of this protein , PI3 kinase , which was previously thought to have a protective function against the disease .
" Our work suggests that the peptides , or fragments , of β- amyloid associated with Alzheimer 's disease directly increase the activity of PI3 kinase , which in turn causes memory loss and increases the accumulation of plaque in the brain , " explains CSHL Professor Yi Zhong , who led the research team .
The study appears online , ahead of print , March 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
β- amyloid peptides are known to alter a slew of cellular signaling proteins such as PI3 kinase , causing a wide range of cellular dysfunctions within the brain 's neurons , thus impairing brain activity .
But exactly how these dangerous peptides cause signaling havoc and trigger memory loss has been a mystery , largely because such studies have been performed in cultured cells , not in living organisms .
Zhong and his colleagues addressed the question in a biological system that closely recapitulates the disease pathology seen in humans : fruit flies engineered to produce human β- amyloid in their brains .
The team previously showed that these flies develop many key features of Alzheimer 's , including age - dependent memory loss , massive neurodegeneration , β- amyloid deposits and plaque accumulation .
Searching for the molecular basis of memory loss , the team discovered the importance of PI3 - kinase by studying a type of neurotransmission called long - term depression ( LTD ) , in which nerve signal transmissions at particular synapses , or junctions between nerve cells , is depressed for an extended period , usually lasting hours .
LTD is known to be pathologically enhanced when β- amyloid is present in fly brain .
The team has now found that LTD enhancement in the β- amyloid - producing flies is due to increased activity of PI3 - kinase .
A reduction of this activity via injections of PI3 kinase - blocking drugs or by switching off the gene that encodes PI3 kinase both restored normal LTD signals .
With these measures , the team not only improved memory in aging fruit flies , but also decreased the buildup of β- amyloid deposits .
These findings on β- amyloid 's effect on PI3 kinase activity might explain another mystery about the disease .
Among patients , the disease is sometimes known as " brain diabetes " because brain tissue gradually becomes resistant to insulin , further impairing brain function .
Insulin is one of the molecules that normally induce PI3 - kinase activity , which in turn mediates the cell 's response to insulin .
" Our results now suggest that the Alzheimer 's brains might become insulin - resistant because PI3 kinase activity is already at the maximum due to its activation by β- amyloid and therefore is no longer able to respond to insulin , " explains Zhong .
" It might be possible to tackle these various disease symptoms by targeting PI3 kinase . "

In the last - ditch warrantless wiretapping accountability case , Judge Vaughn Walker has ruled that the Bush administration illegally eavesdropped on American lawyers representing Al Haramain , a now - defunct Islamic charity , and that the attorney could pursue civil remedies .
The lawyers alleged some of their 2004 telephone conversations to Saudi Arabia were siphoned to the National Security Agency without warrants .
The allegations were initially based on a classified document the government accidentally mailed to the former Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation lawyers .
The document was later declared a state secret and removed from the long - running lawsuit weighing whether a sitting U.S. president may create a spying program to eavesdrop on Americans ’ electronic communications without warrants
" Plaintiffs must , and have , put forward enough evidence to establish a prima facie case that they were subjected to warrantless electronic surveillance , " U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled , in a landmark decision .
Even without the classified document , the judge said he believed the lawyers " were subjected to unlawful electronic surveillance . " ( .pdf )
It ’s the first ruling addressing how Bush ’s once - secret spy program was carried out against American citizens .
Other cases considered the program ’s overall constitutionality , absent any evidence of actual illegal eavesdropping .
The Obama administration ’s Justice Department staunchly defended the lawsuit .
The classified document was removed from the case at the behest of both the Bush and Obama administrations that declared it a state secret .

Mount Everest , the highest mountain in the world , is also one of the most storied with many tales of adventure , bravery , strength , daring and death .
01 of 04 Who First Reached the Summit of Everest ?
Corbis via Getty Images / Getty Images Did Edmund Hillary or Tenzing Norgay reach the summit of Mount Everest first in 1953 ?
The climbers , first to stand on the summit , agreed that they would say that they reached the summit together , thereby negating anti-colonialism in Nepal and India .
Evidence , however , indicates that expedition leader John Hunt and Christopher Summerhayes , British ambassador to Nepal , covered up the fact that Hillary actually reached the summit before Tenzing .
A three - page memo by Edmund Hillary in the Royal Geographic Society archives stated that he was first to reach Everest 's summit :
" [ I ] stepped on top of Everest … I quickly brought up Tensing [ sic ] beside me . "
The official public version by Hillary said : " A few more whacks of the ice axe in the firm snow and we stood on the summit . "
02 of 04 The Strange Case of Mr. Wilson A Gypsy Moth plane similar to the Ever Wrest .
Corbis via Getty Images / Getty Images
One of the strangest attempts to climb Mount Everest was by Maurice Wilson ( 1898 - 1934 ) , an eccentric Englishman , who tried to climb Everest after flying to the mountain -- despite knowing nothing about mountaineering or flying .
Wilson decided to climb
Everest while recuperating from illness , forming a plan to fly to Tibet , crash the plane on the mountain 's upper slopes , and climb to the summit .
He then learned to fly a Gipsy Moth plane , which he named Ever Wrest , and spent five weeks hiking around Britain for practice .
He flew to India in two weeks and spent the winter in Darjeeling planning his expedition .
Wilson , with no climbing equipment , approached the Rongbuk Glacier and got lost crossing difficult terrain .
On May 22 , 1934 , he tried to climb to the North Col but failed at an ice wall .
On May 31 , his last diary entry read : " Off again , gorgeous day . "
His body was found in 1935 in snow , surrounded by his blown - apart tent .
The last twist in the Wilson saga was that it appears he was a cross - dresser who had worked in a ladies dress shop in New Zealand .
He was supposedly found wearing women 's underwear and had women 's clothes in his pack .
A 1960 Chinese expedition added fuel to the story by finding a woman 's dress shoe at 21,000 feet .
03 of 04 Did Russians First Climbed Everest ?
Nicole Kucera / Getty Images According to a report in the Alpine Journal by Yevgeniy Gippenreiter , a large Soviet expedition with 35 climbers went to the north side of Everest in Tibet to attempt the Northeast Ridge Route in late 1952 .
The group , led by Pavel Datschnolian , worked up the mountain to a high camp in early December , placing a team of six for a summit bid .
But the men , including Datschnolian , vanished , probably swept down by an avalanche and were never found .
Russian climbers have researched archives , mountaineering journals from the 1940s and 1950s , and checked all the known climber names and discovered nothing .
It 's as though none of the supposed climbers , including the leader , or the expedition ever existed .
Just imagine what might have been if they had succeeded ?
As the Sydney Morning Herald noted in the April 21 , 1952 , edition :
" [ …] Russia has more ' firsts ' to her credit than any other country .
Russians invented steel , the electric lightbulb , the radio - telegraph , and the ten - gallon hat .
So why not be the first up Everest , even if it is only to prove that the " abominable snowman " is a capitalist warmonger ? "
There are three things that I really love about Perl :
Moose
Catalyst
DBIx - Class
That 's where the problem starts .
It 's not really a BBC problem , though .
It 's a problem for all " enterprise " customers .
I just tried to upgrade Moose and got the following message :
*** This version of Moose conflicts with the version of Catalyst ( 5.80007 ) you have installed .
You will need to upgrade Catalyst after installing this version of Moose .
*** ***
This version of Moose conflicts with the version of MooseX : : AttributeHelpers ( 0.2 ) you have installed .
You will need to upgrade MooseX : : AttributeHelpers after installing this version of Moose .
*** ***

You will need to upgrade MooseX :: MethodAttributes after installing this version of Moose .
*** ***
This version of Moose conflicts with the version of MooseX : : Types ( 0.16 ) you have installed .
You will need to upgrade MooseX : : Types after installing this version of Moose .
***
I 'm doing this for a personal project , Veure , but when I see message like that , there 's an issue .
Specifically , enterprise customers .
The Perl community is largely a community of JFDI hackers ( thanks , Jesse ! ) .
However , corporate users have a different issue .
We have admins .
Lots of them .
We have projects .
Lots of them .
We have boxes .
Lots of them .
We have operating systems .
Lots of them .
We have versions of Perl .
Lots of them .
We have databases .
Lots of them .
We have modules installed .
Lots of them .
We have tests .
Some of them .
Now take those " lots " and start doing some imaginary math .
We have very , very busy admins .
As a result , we have to submit a reason for every change request .
On a personal project , I 'm quite happy to upgrade this code because there 's no chance I 'm going to impact others .
In a corporate environment , things start to become more tricky .
Admins would like to see this :
One operating system
One programming language
One version of said programming language
One database
One standard set of modules
One box ( hah ! )
... and so on
I know that some people dismiss this with comments like " your admins must not be very good " or something like that , but small systems turn into large systems which turn into huge systems .
Along the way , admins leave , new admins start .
They leave .
More admins start .
Critical business knowledge is lost and rediscovered .
Business needs change .
Systems evolve in ways that the previous architecture does n't support .
The BBC is not a small company and frankly , I 've loved the quality of people that I work with .
These are n't idiots , but they are busy and requirement management is often akin to skeet shooting while blindfolded .
Even that is n't as silly as it sounds because sometimes the law changes and we must rapidly adopt to it .
Now that London is hosting the 2012 Olympics with its Bart - Simpson receiving a censored logo , we have to address this .
Other TV stations may change direction and decide to work with the BBC or against the BBC .
We do n't know their decisions in advance and this again causes us to rethink what we do .
Heck , I could ( but can't , sorry ) , tell you fascinating stories about challenges we constantly face with iPlayer ( Americans : think of it as the British Hulu ) which force us to rethink technology solutions all the time .
In other words , what we do is hard .
Very hard .
People who do n't work here have no idea the technical challenges we face .
Recently I proposed fixing an issue in our code base where package and filenames did n't match .
As a result , multiple filenames contained the same package .
This was apparently a bug workaround , but now it 's a time bomb .
Fixing the issue was denied .
Why ?
It 's not a problem yet , but getting new features out the door is a problem .
It 's not just obstinate management .
Part of the issue involves possibly upgrading to a new version of Catalyst .
However , we can't just tell the admins " upgrade this " .
We have to tell them " upgrade this and here 's why " .
That 's because they 're busy and if every one of our many , many teams was upgrading everything all the time , without having a concrete business case , fewer features would get out the door .
Thus , I wanted to fix a potential bug ( one which modern versions of these modules sensibly warn about ) , but I could n't demonstrate that it was actually causing a problem .
Thus , my business case was weakened vis-a - vis the fact that we 're preparing for the Olympics .
Olympics versus " not a bug " .
I report .
You decide .
I 'm not taking a stand one way or the other .
It 's very , very important that these projects address issues they have and appeal to developers who want these issues addressed .
However , as I 've encountered time and time again in large environments , upgrading is problematic .
As a result , we tend not to upgrade until we need a particular feature and can make a business case for it .
Thus , for the best projects with the most active developers , individually we love it ( I certainly do ) , but at a corporate level , it becomes a sysadmin nightmare .
That 's because we tend not to upgrade unless we absolutely have to but our software is so out of date that we 're practically shutting down our work to upgrade everything we need , including rewriting large parts of our software to match .
Meanwhile , we have to make sure that our publication latency is reduced as much as we can when journalists covering the Olympics or World Cup want to report something live .
I 've successfully upgraded " not a bug " modules on the grounds that we need to ensure that when we must upgrade , we 're not so far behind the curve that the upgrade is very difficult .
I 've not done this often , though .
Our Catalyst is a year old ( I think ) and we 've no plans to upgrade it because it's " not a bug " .
There is a terribly tension between those who need stability and those who need new features .
I do n't have the right answer here , but the problem is not as simple as some would suggest .
How do you think former Lehman Brothers executives felt about the recently released report on the firm ’s failure that reveals , among other things , the firm used a weird accounting practice known as “ Repo 105 ” to move $ 50 billion of toxic mortgage assets off its books in order to make its balance sheet look healthier ?
Embarrassed ?
Regretful ?
Are they thinking to themselves Wow , in retrospect , that does look pretty bad .
What were we thinking ?
Not really , no .
This morning ’s Post reports that former CEO Richard Fuld feels “ vindicated ” by the report , since Repo 105 is not illegal , but merely kind of skeazy .
Others apparently feel the same way : “ I ’m like , whatever , ” a former managing director of Lehman London tells the Observer .
“ When I read this , I giggle a little bit , because $ 50 billion is a drop in the ocean . ”
The “ yappers ” who are shocked by it , he said , are merely unsophisticated “ nonprofessionals ” who are just looking for someone to point the finger at for the near - collapse of the financial system .
But as amusing as it is , it ’s also kind of sad , really , said another executive , that people are just so stupid .
They ’re like a bunch of animals .
Like wild , ignorant bulls , starved into rage , stupidly crashing around and driving their horns into things just because they do n’t know what else to do .
“ They just want to be mad and do n’t know what they ’re talking about and want to be outraged . ”
After an interview , that executive sent a follow - up email comparing the widespread furor over Lehman Brothers to the groupthink that sent America into Iraq after Sept. 11 .
Only a few people are smart enough to understand * the truth * of the matter , which is that ultimately bankers are smarter and better than everyone else , always have been always will be .
Not that it ’s fun to have this knowledge !
Quite frankly , it is a terrible burden , because no matter how much you say it and how true it is , no one wants to believe you .
“ It would be like telling people in 2005 that real estate prices are going to collapse , ” the second said .
“ People would n’t believe you , no matter what you said . ”
All they have is each other .

Battles win wars , topple thrones , and redraw borders .
Every age of human history has experienced battles that have been instrumental in molding the future .
Battles influence the spread of culture , civilization , and religious dogma .
They introduce weapons , tactics , and leaders who dominate future conflicts .
Some battles have even been influential not for their direct results , but for the impact of their propaganda on public opinion .
The following list is not a ranking of decisive engagements , but rather a ranking of battles according to their influence on history .
Each narrative details location , participants , and leaders of the battle , and also provides commentary on who won , who lost , and why .
Narratives also evaluate each battle 's influence on the outcome of its war and the impact on the victors and losers .
Battle # 10 Vienna
Austria - Ottoman Wars , 1529
The Ottoman Turks ' unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1529 marked the beginning of the long decline of their empire .
It also stopped the advance of Islam into central and western Europe , and ensured that the Christian rather than the Muslim religion and culture would dominate the region .
In 1520 , Suleiman II had become the tenth sultan of the Ottoman Empire , which reached from the Persian frontier to West Africa and included much of the Balkans .
Suleiman had inherited the largest , best - trained army in the world , containing superior elements of infantry , cavalry , engineering , and artillery .
At the heart of his army were elite legions of Janissaries , mercenary slaves taken captive as children from Christians and raised as Muslim soldiers .
From his capital of Constantinople , the Turkish sultan immediately began making plans to expand his empire even farther .
Suleiman had also inherited a strong navy , which he used with his army to besiege the island fortress of Rhodes , his first conquest .
Granting safe passage to the defenders in exchange for their surrender , the Sultan took control of Rhodes and much of the Mediterranean in 1522 .
This victory demonstrated that Suleiman would honor peace agreements .
In following battles where enemies did not surrender peacefully , however , he displayed his displeasure by razing cities , massacring the adult males , and selling the women and children into slavery .
By 1528 , Suleiman had neutralized Hungary and placed his own puppet on their throne .
All that now stood between the Turks and Western Europe was Austria and its Spanish and French allies .
Taking advantage of discord between his enemies , Suleiman made a secret alliance with King Francis I of France .
Pope Clement VII in Rome , while not allying directly with the Muslim Sultan , withdrew religious and political support from the Austrians .
As a result , by the spring of 1529 , King Charles and his Austrians stood alone to repel the Ottoman invaders .
On April 10 , Suleiman and his army of more than 120,000 , accompanied by as many as 200,000 support personnel and camp followers , departed Constantinople for the Austrian capital of Vienna .
Along the way , the huge army captured towns and raided the countryside for supplies and slaves .
All the while , Vienna , under the able military leadership of Count Niklas von Salm - Reifferscheidt and Wilhelm von Rogendorf , prepared for the pending battle .
Their task appeared impossible .
The city 's walls , only five to six feet thick , were designed to repel medieval attackers rather than the advanced cast - cannon artillery of the Turks .
The entire Austrian garrison numbered only about 20,000 soldiers supported by 72 cannons .
The only reinforcements who arrived in the city were a detachment of 700 musket - armed infantrymen from Spain .
Despite its disadvantages , Vienna had several natural factors supporting its defense .
The Danube blocked any approach from the north , and the smaller Wiener Back waterway ran along its eastern side , leaving only the south and west to be defended .
The Vienna generals took full advantage of the weeks before the arrival of the Turks .
They razed dwellings and other buildings outside the south and west walls to open fields of fire for their cannons and muskets .
They dug trenches and placed other obstacles on avenues of approach .
They brought in supplies for a long siege within the walls and evacuated many of the city 's women and children , not only to reduce the need for food and supplies but also to prevent the consequences if the Turks were victorious .
One other factor greatly aided Vienna : the summer of 1529 was one of the wettest in history .
The constant rains delayed the Ottoman advance and made conditions difficult for the marching army .
By the time they finally reached Vienna in September , winter was approaching , and the defenders were as prepared as possible .
Upon his arrival , Suleiman asked for the city 's surrender .
When the Austrians refused , he began an artillery barrage against the walls with his 300 cannons and ordered his miners to dig under the walls and lay explosives to breach the defenses .
The Austrians came out from behind their walls to attack the engineers and artillerymen and dig counter - trenches .
Several times over the next three weeks , the invaders ' artillery and mines achieved small breaches in the wall , but the Viennese soldiers quickly filled the gaps and repelled any entry into the city .
By October 12 , the cold winds of winter were sweeping the city .
Suleiman ordered another attack with his Janissaries in the lead .
Two underground mines near the city 's southern gate opened the way briefly for the mercenaries , but the staunch Viennese defenders filled the opening and killed more than 1200 .
Two days later , Suleiman ordered one last attack , but the Viennese held firm once again .
For the first time , Suleiman had failed .
Scores of his never - before - defeated Janissaries lay dead outside the walls .
The Turkish army had no choice but to burn their huge camp and withdraw back toward Constantinople , but before they departed they massacred the thousands of captives they had taken on the way to Vienna .
Along their long route home , many more Turks died at the hands of raiding parties that struck their flanks .
The loss at Vienna did not greatly decrease the power of the Ottoman Empire .
It did , however , stop the Muslim advance into Europe .
Suleiman and his army experienced many successes after Vienna , but these victories were in the east against the Persians rather than in the west against the Europeans .
The Ottoman Empire survived for centuries , but its high - water mark lay somewhere along the Vienna city wall .
Following the battle for Vienna , the countries of the west no longer viewed the Turks and the Janissaries as invincible .
Now that the Austrians had kept the great menace from the east and assured the continuation of the region 's culture and Christianity , the European countries could return to fighting among themselves along Catholic and Protestant lines .
If Vienna had fallen to Suleiman , his army would have continued their offensive the following spring into the German provinces .
There is a strong possibility that Suleiman 's Empire might have eventually reached all the way to the North Sea , the alliance with France notwithstanding .
Instead , after Vienna , the Ottomans did not venture again into Europe ; the Empire 's power and influence began its slow but steady decline .
Battle # 9 Waterloo
Napoleonic Wars , 1815
The Allied victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 brought an end to French domination of Europe and began a period of peace on the continent that lasted for nearly half a century .
Waterloo forced Napoleon into exile , ended France 's legacy of greatness , which it has never regained , etched its name on the list of history 's best known battles , and added a phrase to the vernacular : " Waterloo " has come to mean decisive and complete defeat .
When the French Revolution erupted in 1789 , twenty - year - old Napoleon left his junior officer position in the King 's artillery to support the rebellion .
He remained in the military after the revolution and rapidly advanced in rank to become a brigadier general six years later .
Napoleon was instrumental in suppressing a Royalist uprising in 1795 , for which his reward was command of the French army in Italy .
Over the next four years , Napoleon achieved victory after victory as his and France 's influence spread across Europe and into North Africa .
In late 1799 , he returned to Paris , where he joined an uprising against the ruling Directory .
After a successful coup , Napoleon became the first consul and the country 's de facto leader on November 8 .
Napoleon backed up these aggrandizing moves with military might and political savvy .
He established the Napoleonic Code , which assured individual rights of citizens and instituted a rigid conscription system to build an even larger army .
In 1800 , Napoleon 's army invaded Austria and negotiated a peace that expanded France 's border to the Rhine River .
The agreement brought a brief period of peace , but Napoleon 's aggressive foreign policy and his army 's offensive posturing led to war between France and Britain in 1803 .
Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France in 1804 and for the next eight years achieved a succession of victories , each of which created an enemy .
Downplaying the loss of much of his navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 , Napoleon claimed that control of Europe lay on the land , not the sea .
In 1812 , he invaded Russia and defeated its army only to lose the campaign to the harsh winter .
He lost more of his army in the extended campaign on the Spanish peninsula .
In the spring of 1813 , Britain , Russia , Prussia , and Sweden allied against France while Napoleon rallied the survivors of his veteran army and added new recruits to meet the enemy coalition .
Although he continued to lead his army brilliantly , the stronger coalition defeated him at Leipzig in October 1813 , forcing Napoleon to withdraw to southern France .
Finally , at the urging of his subordinates , Napoleon abdicated on April 1 , 1814 , and accepted banishment to the island of Elba near Corsica .
Napoleon did not remain in exile for long .
Less than a year later , he escaped Elba and sailed to France , where for the next one hundred days he struck a trail of terror across Europe and threatened once again to dominate the continent .
King Louis XVIII , whom the coalition had returned to his throne , dispatched the French army to arrest the former emperor , but they instead rallied to his side .
Louis fled the country , and Napoleon again claimed the French crown on March 20 .
Veterans as well as new recruits swelled Napoleon 's army to more than 250,000 .
News of Napoleon 's return reached the coalition leaders while they were meeting in Vienna .
On March 17 , Britain , Prussia , Austria , and Russia agreed to each provide 150,000 soldiers to assemble in Belgium for an invasion of France to begin on July 1 .
Other nations promised smaller support units .
Napoleon learned of the coalition plan and marched north to destroy their army before it could organize .
He sent part of his army , commanded by Emmanuel de Grouchy , to attack the Prussians under Gebhard von Bluecher in order to prevent their joining the Anglo - Dutch force near Brussels .
Napoleon led the rest of the army against the British and Dutch .
The French army won several minor battles as they advanced into Belgium .
Although the coalition commander , the Duke of Wellington , had little time to prepare , he began assembling his army twelve miles south of Brussels , just outside the village of Waterloo .
There he arrayed his defenses on high ground at Mount St. Jean to meet the northward - marching French .
By the morning of June 18 , Napoleon had arrived at Mount St. Jean and deployed his army on high ground only 1300 yards from the enemy defenses .
Napoleon 's army of 70,000 , including 15,000 cavalrymen and 246 artillery pieces , faced Wellington 's allied force of about 65,000 , including 12,000 cavalry and 156 guns , in a three - mile line .
Both commanders sent word to their other armies to rejoin the main force .
A hard rain drenched the battlefield , causing Napoleon to delay his attack as late as possible on June 18 so that the boggy ground could dry and not impair his cavalry and artillery .
After ordering a sustained artillery bombardment , Napoleon ordered a diversionary attack against the allied right flank in the west in hopes of getting Wellington to commit his reserve .
The British defenders on the west flank , including the Scots and Coldstream Guards , remained on the reverse slope of the ridge during the artillery bombardment and then came forward when the French advanced .
The attack against the Allied right flank failed to force Wellington to commit his reserve , but Napoleon pressed on with his main assault against the enemy center .
As the attack progressed , Napoleon spotted the rising dust of Bluecher 's approaching army , which had eluded Grouchy 's , closing on the battlefield .
Napoleon , disdainful of British fighting ability , and overly confident of his own leadership and the abilities of his men , continued the attack in the belief that he could defeat Wellington before the Prussians joined the fight or that Grouchy would arrive in time to support the assault .
For three hours , the French and the British fought , often with bayonets .
The French finally secured a commanding position at the center at La Haye Sainte , but the Allied lines held .
Late in the afternoon , Bluecher arrived and seized the village of Plancenoit in Napoleon 's rear , which forced the French to fall back .
After a brutal battle decided by bayonets , the French forced the Prussians to withdraw .
Napoleon then turned back against Wellington .
Napoleon ordered his most experienced battalions forward from their reserve position for another assault against the Allied center .
The attack almost breached the Allied defenses before Wellington committed his own reserves .
When the survivors of Napoleon 's best battalions began to withdraw from the fight , other units joined the retreat .
The Prussians , who had regrouped , attacked the French flank , sending the remainder running in disorder to the south .
Napoleon 's last few reserve battalions led him to the rear where he attempted , without success , to regroup his scattered army .
Although defeated , the French refused to give up .
When the Allies asked a French Old Guard officer to surrender , he replied , " The Guard dies , it never surrenders . "
More than 26,000 French were killed or wounded and another 9,000 captured at Waterloo .
Allied casualties totaled 22,000 .
At the end of the one - day fight , more than 45,000 men lay dead or wounded within the three - square - mile battlefield .
Thousands more on both sides were killed or wounded in the campaign that led to Waterloo .
Napoleon agreed once again to abdicate on June 22 , and two weeks later , the Allies returned Louis to power .
Napoleon and his hundred days were over .
This time , the British took no chances ; they imprisoned Napoleon on remote St. Helena Island in the south Atlantic , where he died in 1821 .
Even if Napoleon had somehow won the battle , he had too few friends and too many enemies to continue .
He and his country were doomed before his return from Elba .
France never recovered its greatness after Waterloo .
It returned territory and resumed its pre-Napoleon borders .
With Napoleon banished , Britain , Russia , Prussia , and Austria maintained a balance of power that brought European peace for more than four decades -- an unusually long period in a region where war was much more common than peace .
While a period of peace in itself is enough to distinguish Waterloo as an influential battle , it and Napoleon had a much more important effect on world events .
While the Allies fought to replace the king of France on his throne , their leaders and individual soldiers saw and appreciated the accomplishments of a country that respected individual rights and liberties .
After Waterloo , as the common people demanded a say in their way of life and government , constitutional monarchies took the place of absolute rule .
Although there was post - war economic depression in some areas , the general plight of the common French citizen improved in the postwar years .
Through the passage of time , the name Waterloo has become synonymous with total defeat .
Napoleon and France did indeed meet their Waterloo in southern Belgium in 1815 , but while the battle brought an end to one age , it introduced another .
Although the French lost , the spirit of their revolution .
and individual rights spread across Europe .
No kingdom or country would again be the same .
Battle # 8 Huai-Hai
Chinese Civil War , 1948
The Battle of Huai - Hai was the final major fight between the armies of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) and the Nationalist Party of Kuomintang ( KMT ) in their long struggle over control of the world 's most populous country .
At the end of the battle , more than half a million KMT soldiers were dead , captured , or converted to the other side , placing China in the hands of the Communists who continue to govern today .
Struggles for the control of China and its provinces date back to the beginnings of recorded history .
While some dynasties endured for many years and others for only short periods of time , the Chinese had fought among themselves and against foreign invaders throughout history only to find themselves divided once again at the start of the twentieth century .
Political ideologies centered in Peking and Canton .
Divisions in the country widened when the Japanese invaded in 1914 .
During World War I , the Chinese faced threats from within , from the Japanese , and from the newly formed Soviet Union .
When World War I finally ended , the Chinese continued their internal struggles with local dictators fighting to control small regions .
In 1923 , the country 's two major parties , the CCP under Mao Zedong and the KMT controlled by Chiang Kai - shek , joined in an alliance to govern the country .
The two sides had little in common , and in less than five years , the shaky alliance had come apart when their leaders ' views on support from the Soviet Union clashed .
Mao encouraged Soviet support while Chiang opposed it .
By 1927 , the two parties were directly competing for control of China and its people .
Mao focused on the rural areas while Chiang looked to the urban and industrial areas for his power .
From 1927 to 1937 , the two sides engaged in a civil war in which Chiang gained the upper hand through a series of successful offensives .
Chiang almost destroyed the CCP army in 1934 , but Mao and 100,000 men escaped before he could do so .
For the next year , the Communists retreated from the Nationalists across 6,000 miles of China to Yenan , a retreat that became known as the Long March .
Only 20,000 survived .
In 1937 , Chiang and Mao once again put their differences aside to unite against another invasion by Japan .
Mao and his army fought in the rural northern provinces , primarily employing guerrilla warfare .
Mao also used this opportunity to solidify his support from the local peasants while stockpiling weapons provided by the Allies and captured from the Japanese .
His army actually gained strength during the fighting .
Meanwhile Chiang faced stronger Japanese opposition in the south , which weakened his army .
Despite efforts by the United States to mediate an agreement , the Communists and Nationalists resumed their armed conflict soon after the conclusion of World War II .
In contrast to their weaker position prior to the war , the Communists now were stronger than the Nationalists .
On October 10 , 1947 , Mao called for the overthrow of the Nationalist administration .
Mao , a student of Washington , Napoleon , and Sun Tzu , began to push his army south into the Nationalist zone .
Whereas the Nationalists often looted the cities they occupied and punished their residents , the Communists took little retribution , especially against towns that did not resist .
Now the Communists steadily achieved victories over the Nationalists .
During the summer of 1948 , the Communists experienced a series of victories that pushed the major portion of the Nationalist army into a cross - shaped area extending from Nanking north to Tsinan and from Kaifeng east through Soochow to the sea .
Mao decided that it was time to achieve a total victory .
On October 11 , 1948 , he issued orders for a methodical campaign to surround , separate , and destroy the half - million - man Nationalist army between the Huai River and the Lung Hai Railway -- the locations that gave the resulting battle its name .
Mao divided his battle plan into three phases , all of which his army accomplished more smoothly and efficiently than anticipated .
The Communists divided the Nationalist - held territory into three areas .
Then beginning in November , they attacked each in turn .
Early in the campaign , many Nationalists , seeing no hope for their own survival , much less a Nationalist victory , defected to the Communists .
Chiang , who also was encountering internal divisions within his party , attempted to reinforce each battle area , but poor leadership by the Nationalist generals , combined with Communist guerrilla activities , made his efforts ineffective .
Chiang even had air superiority during the entire battle but was unable to coordinate ground and air actions to secure any advantage .
Over a period of two months , the Communists destroyed each of the three Nationalist forces .
Support for Chiang from inside and outside China dwindled with each successive Communist victory .
The United States , which had been a primary supporter , providing arms and supplies to the Nationalists , suspended all aid on December 20 , 1948 .
U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall stated , " The present regime has lost the confidence of the people , reflected in the refusal of soldiers to fight and the refusal of the people to cooperate in economic reforms . "
Within weeks of the U.S. announcement , the Communists overran the last Nationalist position and ended the Battle of Huai - Hai .
Of the six highest - ranking Nationalist generals in the battle , two were killed in the fighting and two captured .
The remaining two were among the few who escaped .
By January 10 , 1949 , the half - million members of the Nationalist army had disappeared .
Within weeks , Tientsin and Peking fell to the Communists .
On January 20 , Chiang resigned his leadership of the Nationalists .
The remaining Nationalist army and government continued to retreat until they finally withdrew to the island of Formosa .
On Formosa , renamed Taiwan , Chiang regained power and developed the island into an Asian economic power .
Mainland China , however , remained under the control of Mao and his Communists , who are still in power today .
The Communist takeover of China achieved by the Battle of Huai - Hai greatly influenced not only that country but the entire world .
Over the next two decades , Mao focused almost exclusively on wielding complete control over his country .
He ruthlessly put down any opposition and either executed or starved to death more than 20 million of his countrymen in order to bring to China the " joys " and " advantages " of Communism .
Fortunately for the rest of the world , Mao remained focused on his own country .
He disagreed with the Soviets on political and philosophical aspects of Communism , and the two nations viewed each other as possible opponents rather than allies .
China 's internal struggles and its conflicts with its neighbors have restricted its active world influence .
Even though it remains today the largest and strongest Communist nation and the only potential major Communist threat to the West , China remains a passive player , more interested in internal and neighboring disputes than in international matters .
Had the Nationalists been victorious at Huai - Hai , China would have played a different role in subsequent world events .
There would have been no Communist China to support North Korea 's invasion of the South , or North Vietnam 's efforts to take over South Vietnam .
Had Chiang , with his outward views and Western ties , been the victor , China might have taken a much more assertive role in world events .
Instead , the Battle of Huai - Hai would keep China locked in its internal world rather than opening it to the external .
Battle # 7 Atomic Bombing of Japan
World War II , 1945
The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to hasten the end of World War II in the Pacific .
Although it would be the first , and to date the only , actual use of such weapons of " mass destruction , " the mushroom clouds have hung over every military and political policy since .
Less than five months after the sneak attack by the Japanese against Pearl Harbor , the Americans launched a small carrier - based bomber raid against Tokyo .
While the attack was good for the American morale , it accomplished little other than to demonstrate to the Japanese that their shores were not invulnerable .
Later in the war , U.S. bombers were able to attack the Japanese home islands from bases in China , but it was not until late 1944 that the United States could mount a sustained bombing campaign .
Because of the distance to Japan , American bombers could not reach targets and safety return to friendly bases in the Pacific until the island - hopping campaign had captured the Northern Mariana Islands .
From bases on the Mariana Islands , long - range B - 29 Superfortresses conducted high altitude bombing runs on November 24 , 1944 .
On March 9 , 1945 , an armada of 234 B - 29s descended to less than 7,000 feet and dropped 1,667 tons of incendiaries on Tokyo .
By the time the fire storm finally abated , a sixteen - square - mile corridor that had contained a quarter million homes was in ashes , and more than 80,000 Japanese , mostly civilians , lay dead .
Only the Allied fire bombing of Dresden , Germany , the previous month , which killed 135,000 , exceed the destruction of the Tokyo raid .
Both Tokyo and Dresden were primarily civilian rather than military targets .
Prior to World War II , international law regarded the bombing of civilians as illegal and barbaric .
After several years of warfare , however , neither the Allies nor the Axis distinguished between military and civilian air targets .
Interestingly , while a pilot could drop tons of explosives and firebombs on civilian cities , an infantryman often faced a court - martial for even minor mistreatment of noncombatants .
Despite the air raids and their shrinking territory outside their home islands , the Japanese fought on .
Their warrior code did not allow for surrender , and soldiers and civilians alike often chose suicide rather than giving up .
By July 1945 , the Americans were launching more than 1200 bombing sorties a week against Japan .
The bombing had killed more than a quarter million and left more than nine million homeless .
Still , the Japanese gave no indication of surrender as the Americans prepared to invade the home islands .
While the air attacks and plans for a land invasion continued in the Pacific , a top - secret project back in the United States was coming to fruition .
On July 16 , 1945 , the Manhattan Engineer District successfully carried out history 's first atomic explosion .
When President Harry Truman learned of the successful experiment , he remarked in his diary , " It seems to be the most terrible thing ever discovered , but it can be made the most useful . "
Truman realized that the " most terrible thing " could shorten the war and prevent as many as a million Allied casualties , as well as untold Japanese deaths , by preventing a ground invasion of Japan .
On July 27 , the United States issued an ultimatum : surrender or the U.S. would drop a " super weapon . "
Japan refused .
In the early morning hours of August 6,1945 , a B - 29 named the Enola Gay piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Tibbets lifted off from Tinian Island in the Marianas .
Aboard was a single atomic bomb weighing 8,000 pounds and containing the destructive power of 12.5 kilotons of TNT .
Tibbets headed his plane toward Hiroshima , selected as the primary target because of its military bases and industrial areas .
It also had not yet been bombed to any extent , so it would provide an excellent evaluation of the bomb 's destructive power .
At 8:15 A.M . , the Enola Gay dropped the device called " Little Boy . "
A short time later , Tibbets noted , " A bright light filled the plane .
We turned back to look at Hiroshima .
The city was hidden by that awful cloud ... boiling up , mushrooming . "
The immediate impact of Little Boy killed at least 70,000 Hiroshima residents .
Some estimates claim three times that number but exact figures are impossible to calculate because the blast destroyed all of the city 's records .
Truman again demanded that Japan surrender .
After three days and no response , a B - 29 took off from Tinian with an even larger atomic bomb aboard .
When the crew found their primary target of Kokura obscured by clouds , they turned toward their secondary , Nagasaki .
At 11:02 A.M . on August 9 , 1945 , they dropped the atomic device known as " Fat Man " that destroyed most of the city and killed more than 60,000 of its inhabitants .
Conventional bombing raids were also conducted against other Japanese cities on August 9 , and five days later , 800 B - 29s raided across the country .
On August 15 ( Tokyo time ) , the Japanese finally accepted unconditional surrender .
World War II was over .
Much debate has occurred since the atomic bombings .
While some evidence indicates that the Japanese were considering surrender , far more information indicates otherwise .
Apparently the Japanese were planning to train civilians to use rifles and spears to join the military in resisting a land invasion .
Protesters of the Atomic bombings ignore the conventional incendiaries dropped on Tokyo and Dresden that claimed more casualties .
Some historians even note that the losses at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were far fewer than the anticipated Japanese casualties from an invasion and continued conventional bombing .
Whatever the debate , there can be no doubt that the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan shortened the war , The strikes against Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the only air battles that directly affected the outcome of a conflict .
Air warfare , both before and since , has merely supplemented ground fighting .
As confirmed by the recent Allied bombing of Iraq in Desert Storm and in Bosnia , air attacks can harass and make life miserable for civilian populations , but battles and wars continue to be decided by ground forces .
In addition to hastening the end of the war with Japan , the development and use of the atomic bomb provided the United States with unmatched military superiority -- at least for a brief time , until the Soviet Union exploded their own atomic device .
The two superpowers then began competitive advancements in nuclear weaponry that brought the world to the edge of destruction .
Only tentative treaties and the threat of mutual total destruction kept nuclear arms harnessed , producing the Cold War period in which the U.S .
And the USSR worked out their differences through conventional means .
Battle # 6 Cajamarca
Spanish Conquest of Peru , 1532
Francisco Pizarro conquered the largest amount of territory ever taken in a single battle when he defeated the Incan Empire at Cajamarca in 1532 .
Pizarro 's victory opened the way for Spain to claim most of South America and its tremendous riches , as well as imprint the continent with its language , culture , and religion .
Christopher Columbus 's voyages to the New World offered a preview of the vast wealth and resources to be found in the Americas , and Hernan Cortes 's victory over the Aztecs had proven that great riches were there for the taking .
It is not surprising that other Spanish explorers flocked to the area -- some to advance the cause of their country , most to gain their own personal fortunes .
Francisco Pizarro was one of the latter .
The illegitimate son of a professional soldier , Pizarro joined the Spanish army as a teenager and then sailed for Hispaniola , from where he participated in Vasco de Balboa 's expedition that crossed Panama and " discovered " the Pacific Ocean in 1513 .
Along the way , he heard stories of the great wealth belonging to native tribes to the south .
After learning of Cortes 's success in Mexico , Pizarro received permission to lead expeditions down the Pacific Coast of what is now Colombia , first in 1524 - 25 and then again in 1526 - 28 .
The second expedition experienced such hardships that his men wanted to return home .
According to legend , Pizarro drew a line in the sand with his sword and invited anyone who desired " wealth and glory " to step across and continue with him in his quest .
Thirteen men crossed the line and endured a difficult journey into what is now Peru , where they made contact with the Incas .
After peaceful negotiations with the Incan leaders , the Spaniards returned to Panama and sailed to Spain with a small amount of gold and even a few llamas .
Emperor Charles
V was so impressed that he promoted Pizarro to captain general , appointed him the governor of all lands six hundred miles south of Panama , and financed an expedition to return to the land of the Incas .
Pizarro set sail for South America in January 1531 with 265 soldiers and 65 horses .
Most of the soldiers carried spears or swords .
At least three had primitive muskets called arquebuses , and twenty more carried crossbows .
Among the members of the expedition were four of Pizarro 's brothers and all of the original thirteen adventurers who had crossed their commander 's sword line to pursue " wealth and glory . "
Between wealth and glory stood an army of 30,000 Incas representing a century - old empire that extended 2,700 miles from modern Ecuador to Santiago , Chile .
The Incas had assembled their empire by expanding outward from their home territory in the Cuzco Valley .
They had forced defeated tribes to assimilate Incan traditions , speak their language , and provide soldiers for their army .
By the time the Spaniards arrived , the Incas had built more than 10,000 miles of roads , complete with suspension bridges , to develop trade throughout the empire .
They also had become master , stonemasons with finely crafted temples and homes .
About the time Pizarro landed on the Pacific Coast , the Incan leader , considered a deity , died , leaving his sons to fight over leadership .
One of these sons , Atahualpa , killed most of his siblings and assumed the throne shortly before he learned that the white men had returned to his Incan lands .
Pizarro and his " army " reached the southern edge of the Andes in present day Peru in June 1532 .
Undaunted by the report that the Incan army numbered 30,000 , Pizarro pushed inland and crossed the mountains , no small feat itself .
Upon arrival at the village of Cajamarca on a plateau on the eastern slope of the Andes , the Spanish officer invited the Incan king to a meeting .
Atahualpa , believing himself a deity and unimpressed with the Spanish force , arrived with a defensive force of only three or four thousand .
Despite the odds , Pizarro decided to act rather than talk .
With his arquebuses and cavalry in the lead , he attacked on November 16 , 1532 .
Surprised by the assault and awed by the firearms and horses , the Incan army disintegrated , leaving Atahualpa a prisoner .
The only Spanish casualty was Pizarro , who sustained a slight wound while personally capturing the Incan leader .
Pizarro demanded a ransom of gold from the Incas for their king , the amount of which legend says would fill a room to as high as a man could reach - - more than 2,500 cubic feet .
Another two rooms were to be filled with silver .
Pizarro and his men had their wealth assured but not their safety , as they remained an extremely small group of men surrounded by a huge army .
To enhance his odds , the Spanish leader pitted Inca against Inca until most of the viable leaders had killed each other .
Pizarro then marched into the former Incan capital at Cuzco and placed his handpicked king on the throne .
Atahualpa , no longer needed , was sentenced to be burned at the stake as a heathen , but was strangled instead after he professed to accept Spanish Christianity .
Pizarro returned to the coast and established the port city of Lima , where additional Spanish soldiers and civilian leaders arrived to govern and exploit the region 's riches .
Some minor Incan uprisings occurred in 1536 , but native warriors were no match for the Spaniards .
Pizarro lived in splendor until he was assassinated in 1541 by a follower who believed he was not receiving his fair share of the booty .
In a single battle , with only himself wounded , Pizarro conquered more than half of South America and its population of more than six million people .
The jungle reclaimed the Inca palaces and roads as their wealth departed in Spanish ships .
The Incan culture and religion ceased to exist .
For the next three centuries , Spain ruled most of the north and Pacific coast of South America .
Its language , culture , and religion still dominate there today .
Battle # 5 Antietam
American Civil War , 1862
The Battle of Antietam , the bloodiest day in American history , stopped the first Confederate invasion of the North .
It also ensured that European countries would not recognize the Confederacy or provide them with much - needed war supplies .
While the later battles at Gettysburg and Vicksburg would seal the fate of the rebel states , the defeat of the rebellion began along Antietam Creek near Sharpsburg , Maryland , on September 17 , 1862 .
From the day the American colonies gained their independence at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781 , a conflict between the United States North and South seemed inevitable .
Divided by geographical and political differences , and split over slavery and state 's rights issues , the North and South had experienced mounting tensions during the first half of the nineteenth century .
Finally , the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860 provided the spark that formally divided the country .
Although Lincoln had made no campaign promises to outlaw slavery , many in the South viewed him as an abolitionist who would end the institution on which much of the region 's agriculture and industry depended .
In December 1860 , South Carolina , acting on what they thought was a " state 's right " under the U.S. Constitution , seceded from the Union .
Three months later , seven other southern states joined South Carolina to form the Confederate States of America .
Few believed that the action would lead to war .
Southerners claimed it was their right to form their own country while Northerners thought that a blockade of the Confederacy , supported by diplomacy , would peacefully return the rebel states to the fold .
However , chances for a peaceful settlement ended with the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter , South Carolina , on April 12 - 14 , 1861 .
Four more states joined the Confederacy a few days later .
Both sides quickly mobilized and aggressive Confederate commanders achieved success against the more reluctant and cautious Union leaders .
While warfare on land favored the Confederates , they lacked a navy , which allowed the U.S. Navy to blockade its shores .
This prevented the South from exporting their primary cash crop of cotton , as well as importing much - needed arms , ammunition , and other military supplies that the meager Southern industrial complex could not provide .
In May 1862 , General Robert E. Lee took command of what he renamed as the Army of Northern Virginia .
Lee soon became one the most beloved commanders in history .
Yet , while his men adored him , his critics noted his inability to control his subordinate leaders .
Despite his shortcomings , Lee outmaneuvered and out - generaled his opponents in his initial battles .
He turned back the Union march on Richmond and then moved north to win the Second Battle of Bull Run near Manassas , Virginia , on August 30 , 1862 .
Both Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis realized , however , that the South could not win a prolonged war against the more populous and industrialized North .
To endure and succeed , the South would need war supplies and naval support from Britain , France , and possibly even Russia .
While these countries were sympathetic with the Southern cause , they were not going to risk bad relations or even war with the United States unless they were convinced the rebellion would succeed .
Following their victory at the Second Battle of Bull Run , Lee and Davis devised a plan that would meet their immediate needs for supplies as well as their long - range goal of European recognition .
They would take the war into the North .
On September 6 , the Army of Northern Virginia crossed into Maryland with the intention of raiding and gathering supplies in southern Pennsylvania .
Union General George B. McClellan paralleled Lee , keeping his army between the invading rebels and Washington , D.C. , where Lincoln feared they would attack .
On September 9 , 1862 , Lee issued Order Number 191 , calling for half of his force to move to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , to control the region 's rail center , while the other half marched to Harpers Ferry to capture the town 's gun factory and to secure lines back to the South .
Four days later , a Union soldier discovered a copy of the order in a field , wrapped around three cigars .
He kept the cigars , but Lee 's order was shortly in McClellan 's hands .
Even though McClellan now possessed the complete Confederate battle plan and his forces outnumbered the rebels 76,000 to 40,000 , he remained cautious because his own intelligence officers incorrectly warned that the Confederates ' force was far larger .
On September 14 , McClellan began to close on Lee 's army only to be slowed by small forces in passes in South Mountain .
The brief delay allowed Lee to form his army along a low ridge near Antietam Creek just east of Sharpsburg , Maryland .
McClellan finally attacked on the morning of September 17 , but his characteristic hesitation and poor communications caused the battle to be composed of three separate fights rather than one united effort .
The battle began with a murderous artillery barrage , followed by an infantry assault on the Confederate left .
Attacks and counterattacks marked the next two hours , with neither side able to maintain an advantage .
Meanwhile , at midmorning , Union troops assaulted the rebel center that stood protected in a sunken road .
By the time the rebels withdrew four hours later , the depleted , exhausted Union force was unable to pursue past what was now known as the " Bloody Lane . "
In the afternoon , still another Union force attacked the rebel right flank to secure a crossing of Antietam Creek .
Even though the waterway was fordable along much of its banks , most of the fight was concentrated over a narrow bridge .
After much bloodshed , the Union troops pushed the Confederates back and were about to cut off Lee 's route back south when rebel reinforcements arrived from Harpers Ferry .
Even so , the third battlefront , like the other two , lapsed into a stalemate .
On the morning of September 18 , Lee and his army withdrew back to Virginia .
Since he was not forced to retreat , Lee claimed victory .
McClellan , overly cautious as usual , chose not to pursue , although it is possible that if he had done so he could have defeated Lee and brought the war to a quick conclusion .
Between the two armies lay more than 23,000 dead or wounded Americans wearing either blue or gray .
A single day of combat produced more casualties than any other in American history -- more dead and wounded than the U.S. incurred in its Revolution , the War of 1812 , the Mexican War , and the Spanish - American War combined .
Casualties at Antietam even outnumbered those of the Longest Day , the first day of the Normandy Invasion , by nine to one .
The influence of Antietam reached far beyond the death and wounds .
For the first time , Lee and the rebel army failed to accomplish their objective , and this provided a much - needed morale boost for the Union .
More importantly , when France and England learned of the battle 's outcome , they decided that recognition of the Confederate States would not be advantageous .
The battle also changed the objectives of the United States .
Prior to Antietam , Lincoln and the North had fought primarily to preserve the Union .
Lincoln had waited for the opportunity to bring slavery to the forefront .
Five days after Antietam , he signed the Emancipation Proclamation .
Although the Proclamation did not free slaves in Union states and , of course , had no power to do so in areas controlled by the rebels , it did advance the freeing of slaves as an objective of the war .
Prior to the battle and the Proclamation , European nations , although opposed to slavery , still had sympathies for the Southern cause .
Now with slavery an open issue and the Confederate 's ability to win in question , the South would have to stand totally alone .
While it took two - and - a - half more years of fighting and the battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg to finally end the war , the Confederate States were doomed from the time they withdrew southward from Antietam Creek .
An improving Union army , combined with a solid refusal of outside support for the Confederacy , spelled the beginning of the end .
Antietam ranks as one of history 's most influential battles because if the South had been victorious outside Sharpsburg , it is very possible that France , England , and possibly even Russia would have recognized the new country .
Their navies would have broken the Union blockade to reach the cotton needed for their mills and to deliver highly profitable war materials .
France , who already had troops in Mexico , might have even provided ground forces to support the South .
Lincoln most likely would not have issued his Emancipation Proclamation and might have been forced to make peace with the rebels , leaving the country divided .
Although future events , such as the two World Wars , would likely have made the former enemies into allies , it is doubtful that , in their state of division , either the United States or Confederate States would have been able to attain the level of world influence or to develop into the political , trade , and military power that the unified United States would become .
Battle # 4 Leipzig
Napoleonic Wars , 1813
The allied victory over Napoleon at Leipzig in 1813 marked the first significant cooperation among European nations against a common foe .
As the largest armed clash in history up to that time , Leipzig led to the fall of Paris and the abdication of Napoleon .
After the Russian army and winter had handed Napoleon a nasty defeat in 1812 , Europeans felt confident that peace would prevail after more than a decade of warfare .
They were wrong .
As soon as Napoleon returned to France from icy Russia , he set about rebuilding his army , conscripting teens and young men .
He strengthened these ranks of inexperienced youths with veterans brought back from the Spanish front .
While Napoleon had been weakened by Russia , he believed that the other European countries were too distrustful of each other to ally against him .
In early 1813 , he decided to advance into the German provinces to resume his offensive .
Just as he had done before , he planned to defeat each army he encountered and assimilate the survivors into his own force .
European leaders were correct to fear that Napoleon could accomplish his objectives , but they remained reluctant to enter into alliances with neighbors who were former , and possibly future , enemies .
Karl von Metternich , the foreign minister of Austria , saw that neither his nor any other European country could stand alone against the French .
Even though he had previously negotiated an alliance with Napoleon , he now began to assemble a coalition of nations against the French emperor .
Metternich 's diplomacy , combined with the massing of the French army on the German border , finally convinced Prussia , Russia , Sweden , Great Britain , and several smaller countries to ally with Austria in March 1813 .
Napoleon disregarded the alliance and crossed into Germany with the intention of defeating each opposing army before the " allies " could actually unite against him .
Napoleon won several of the initial fights , even defeating the Prussians at Lutzen on May 2 .
He soon realized , however , that his new army was not the experienced one he had lost in Russia .
More importantly , he had not been able to replace much of his cavalry lost in the Russian winter , limiting his reconnaissance and intelligence - gathering capabilities .
When Napoleon learned that armies were marching toward Dresden from the north , south , and east against him , he negotiated a truce that began on June 4 .
Metternich met with Napoleon in an attempt to reach a peace settlement but , despite generous terms that allowed France to retain its pre-war borders and for him to remain in power , Napoleon refused to accept the agreement .
During the negotiations , both sides continued to add reinforcements .
On August 16 , the truce ended and combat resumed .
For two months , the Allies harassed the French but avoided a pitched battle while they solidified their plans for a major attack .
Napoleon 's army , forced to live off the land and to rapidly march and countermarch against the multiple armies around them , steadily became more exhausted .
In September , the Allies began a general offensive in which the French won several small battles .
Yet the Allies forced them back to Leipzig in October .
Napoleon had 175,000 men to defend the town , but the Allies massed 350,000 soldiers and 1,500 artillery pieces outside his lines .
On the morning of October 16 , 1813 , Napoleon left part of his army in the north to resist an attack by the Prussians while he attempted to break through the Russian and Austrian lines in the south .
The battle raged all day as the front swept back and forth , but by nightfall both sides occupied the same positions as when the battle began .
Little action took place on October 17 because both sides rested .
The battle on October 18 closely resembled that of two days earlier .
Nine hours of furious combat accomplished little except to convince Napoleon that he could not continue a battle of attrition against the larger Allied force .
The odds against him increased when the Swedish army arrived to join the Allies and a unit of Saxons deserted the French to join the other side .
Napoleon attempted to establish another truce , but the Allies refused .
During the night , the French began to withdraw westward by crossing the Elster River .
A single stone bridge , which provided the only crossing , soon created a bottleneck .
Napoleon deployed 30,000 soldiers to act as a rear guard to protect the crossing , but they were stranded when the bridge was destroyed .
A few swam to safety , but most , including three senior officers , were killed or captured .
Once again , Napoleon limped back toward Paris .
Behind him he left 60,000 dead , wounded , or captured French soldiers .
The Allies had lost a similar number , but they could find replacements far more quickly and easily than Napoleon .
Other countries , including the Netherlands and Bavaria -- which Napoleon had added to his confederation by conquest -- now abandoned him and joined the Allies .
On December 21 , the Allies invaded France and , following their victory at Paris on March 30 , 1814 , forced Napoleon into exile on Elba .
Napoleon soon returned , but after only one hundred days he suffered his final defeat by the Allies at Waterloo on June 18 , 1815 .
Metternich continued his unification efforts and signed most of the Allies to the Concert of Europe , which provided a balance of power and a peace that lasted until the Crimean War in 1854 .
Most of the alliance survived another three decades until the ambitions of Germany brought an end to European peace .
The Battle of Leipzig was important because it brought Napoleon a defeat from which he could not recover .
More important , however , was the cooperation of armies against him .
This alliance is so significant that Leipzig is frequently called the Battle of the Nations .
For these reasons , Leipzig ranks as one of history 's most influential battles .
Leipzig also eclipses Waterloo in its influence .
\ While the latter was certainly more decisive , a victory by Napoleon at Leipzig would likely have broken the alliance and placed the French in a position to once again defeat each of the other nation 's armies .
A French victory at Leipzig would have meant no defeat of Napoleon at Paris , no abdication to Elba , and no return to Waterloo .
Battle # 3 Stalingrad
World War II , 1942 - 43
Stalingrad was the last great offensive by the German Nazis on the Eastern Front .
Their defeat in the city on the Volga River marked the beginning of a long series of battles that would lead the Russians to Berlin and Hitter 's Third Reich to defeat .
The Battle of Stalingrad resulted in the death or capture of more than a quarter million German soldiers , and denied the rich Caucasus oil fields to the Nazis .
Despite the lack of success by the German army to capture the cities of Moscow and Leningrad in their blitzkrieg offensive in the fall and winter of 1941 , Hitler remained determined to conquer Russia in order to destroy Communism and gain access to natural resources for the Third Reich .
With his army stalled outside the cities to the north , Hitler directed an offensive against Stalingrad to capture the city 's industrial assets and to cut communications between the Volga and Don Rivers .
Along with the attack against Stalingrad , German columns were to sweep into the Caucasus to capture the oil fields that would fuel future Nazi conquests .
In the spring of 1942 , German Army Group A headed into the Caucasus while Group B marched toward Stalingrad .
Initially both were successful , but the German army , depleted by the battles of the previous year , was too weak to sustain two simultaneous offensives .
The Germans might have easily captured Stalingrad had Hitler not continued to redirect units to the Caucasus .
By the time he concentrated the offensive against Stalingrad , the Soviets had reinforced the area .
Stalin directed the defenders of the city that bore his name , " Not a step backward . "
Hitler accepted the challenge and directed additional forces against the city .
On August 23 , 1942 , more than a thousand German airplanes began dropping incendiary and explosive bombs .
More than 40,000 of the 600,000 Stalingrad civilians died in the fiery attack .
The survivors picked up arms and joined the soldiers in defense of their city .
The next day , the Sixth German Army , commanded by General Friedrich Paulus , pressed into the edge of the town and assumed victory when they found it mostly in ruins .
They were wrong .
Soldiers and civilians rose from the rubble to fight back with small arms and even hand - to - hand combat as they contested every foot of the destroyed town .
Elements of the Soviet Sixty - second Army joined the fight .
Clashes over the city 's Mamaev Mound resulted in the hill changing hands eight times as the battle line advanced and retreated .
Near the center of the city , the Stalingrad Central Railway station changed hands fifteen times in bitter , close infantry combat .
German artillery and air power continued to pound the city , but the Russians maintained such close contact with their opponents that much of the ordinance exploded harmlessly to their rear .
By September 22 , the Germans occupied the center of Stalingrad , but the beleaguered Russian soldiers and civilians refused to surrender .
They provided Soviet General Georgi Zhukov time to reinforce the city 's flanks with additional soldiers , tanks , and artillery pieces .
On November 19 , the Russians launched a counter - offensive against the north and south flanks of the Germans .
The two attacks focused on lines held by Romanian , Italian , and Hungarian forces who were allied with the Germans , rather than the better trained and disciplined Nazi troops .
On November 23 , the two pincers linked up west of Stalingrad , trapping more than 300,000 German soldiers in a pocket thirty - five miles wide and twenty miles long .
General Paulus requested permission from Hitler to withdraw prior to the encirclement , but he was told to fight on .
Reich Marshal Hermann Goering promised Hitler that he could supply the surrounded Paulus with 500 tons of food and ammunition per day .
Goering and his Luftwaffe failed to deliver even 150 tons a day while the Russians destroyed more than 500 transport aircraft during the supply effort .
A relief column led by General Erich von Manstein , one of Hitler 's finest officers , attempted to reach the surrounded army but failed .
The Russians continued to reduce the German perimeter .
By Christmas , the Germans were low on ammunition , nearly out of food , and freezing in the winter cold .
On January 8 , 1943 , the Russians captured the last airfield inside the German lines and demanded the surrender of the entire army .
Hitler radioed Paulus , " Surrender is forbidden .
Sixth Army will hold their position to the last man and last round .... "
He also promoted Paulus to field marshal and reminded him that no German of that rank had ever surrendered on the battlefield .
The Germans did not hold out to the last round or the last man .
By January 31 , their numbers had plummeted to 90,000 , many of whom were wounded .
All were hungry and cold .
Units began to give up , and within two days all resistance ceased .
Field Marshal Paulus surrendered himself , 23 generals , 90,000 men , 60,000 vehicles , 1,500 tanks , and 6,000 artillery pieces .
Of the 90,000 Germans captured at Stalingrad , only about 5,000 survived the harsh conditions of the Soviet prisoner - of - war camps .
Those who were not worked to death died of starvation and disease .
Paulus , however , was not harshly treated by his captors but remained under house arrest in Moscow for eleven years .
He was allowed in 1953 to return to Dresden in East Germany , where he died in 1957 .
The siege of Stalingrad provided sufficient time for the German Army Group A to withdraw from the Caucasus .
The loss of Army Group B in the rubble of Stalingrad and the toll experienced by Army Group A before its withdrawal , however , weakened the German army on the Eastern Front to the point where it could never again mount a major offensive .
More than two years would pass before the Red Army occupied Berlin , but Stalingrad opened the way to the future victories that led to Hitler 's Bunker and the defeat of Nazi Germany .
Victory at Stalingrad did not come easily or cheaply for the Russians .
Nearly half a million soldiers and civilians died in defense of the city .
Almost all of its homes , factories , and other buildings were destroyed .
But the Russians had won , and that victory united the Russian people , giving them the confidence and strength that drove them on to Berlin .
Stalingrad proved to the Russians and their allies that they could both stop and defeat the great German army .
The battle was the turning point of World War II .
Victory at Stalingrad for the Germans would have led to victory in the Caucasus Mountains .
With the oil and other resources from that area , the German army would have been able to turn more of their power to the Western Front .
If the German armies in the east had survived to face the British , the Americans , and their Allies in the west , the war definitely would not have concluded as quickly .
Perhaps even the eventual allied victory might have been in doubt .
While Stalingrad was the turning point of World War II , and the valor of its defenders will never be in doubt , the Soviet brand of Communism in whose name the battle was fought has not survived .
Stalingrad did not even survive to see the demise of the Soviet Union .
In the purge of all references to Stalin after his death , the city was renamed Volgograd .
Yet , the brave defenders of Stalingrad , who fought for themselves and their city , deserve recognition as fighting one of history 's most decisive and influential battles .
Battle # 2 Hastings
Norman Conquest of England , 1066
The Norman victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 was the last successful invasion of England - - and the first and only since the Roman conquest a thousand years earlier .
Its aftermath established a new feudal order that ensured that England would adopt the political and social traditions of continental Europe , rather than those of Scandinavia .
The single battle also gained the country 's crown for the Norman leader William .
Prior to the Battle of Hastings , the Vikings ruled Scandinavia , Northern Europe , and much of the British Isles .
Areas they did not directly control were still vulnerable to their constant raids .
Earlier Viking victories in France had led to intermarriage and the creation of a people who called themselves the Normans .
Other Vikings conquered the British Isles and established their own kingdoms .
Royal bloodlines ran through the leaders of all of the monarchies , but this did not prevent them from fighting each other .
Claims of crowns and territories reached a state of crisis with the death of Edward the Confessor , the King of England in 1066 , who had left no heir .
Three men claimed the throne : Harold Godwin , brother - in - law of Edward ; William , the Duke of Normandy and a distant relative of Edward's ; and King Harald Hardrada of Norway , the brother of Harold Godwin .
Both Harald and William assembled armies to sail to England to secure their claims .
Godwin decided that William presented more of a threat and moved his English army to the southern coast across from Normandy .
Weather , however , delayed William , and King Harald 's ten thousand Vikings arrived first .
On September 20 , the Vikings soundly defeated the local forces around the city of York and seriously weakened the English army in the region .
Hearing of the battle , Godwin turned his army north and covered the two hundred miles to York in only six days .
At Stamford Bridge , he surprised the Vikings and soundly defeated them .
The retreating Viking survivors filled only twenty - four of the three hundred ships that had brought them to England .
Godwin had inflicted the most decisive defeat on the Vikings in more than two centuries , but there was no time to celebrate .
A few days later , he learned that the Normans had landed at Pevensey Bay in Sussex and were marching inland .
Godwin hurried back south with his army and on October 1 he arrived in London , where he recruited additional soldiers .
On October 13 , Godwin moved to Sussex to take defensive positions along the Norman line of march on Senlac Ridge , eight miles northwest of the village of Hastings .
He did not have long to prepare because William approached the next day .
Godwin possessed both advantages and disadvantages .
He had the advantage of the defense , and his army of 7,000 was about the same size as that of the Normans .
Only about 2,000 of his men , however , were professionals .
These housecarls , as they were known , wore conical helmets and chain - mail vests and carried five - foot axes in addition to metal shields .
The remaining Saxons were poorly trained militiamen known as fyrds , who were basically draftees levied from the shires .
Many of the fyrds , and most of the housecarls , were exhausted from their march as well as from the fierce battle with the Vikings .
William 's army contained about 2,000 cavalrymen and 5,000 infantrymen , equally armed with swords or bows or crossbows .
Despite the lack of numerical superiority and an enemy defense that would only allow for a frontal assault , William attacked .
The Normans advanced behind a rain of arrows from their archers , but the Saxon shields turned aside most of the missiles .
Several direct attacks by the infantry fared no better .
William then personally led a cavalry charge but was turned back by marshy ground and the Saxon defenses .
Defeat , or at best stalemate , appeared to be the outcome of the battle for the invaders .
The Normans were further demoralized when a story swept the ranks that William had been killed .
When the Norman leader heard the rumor , he removed his visor and rode to the head of his army .
His soldiers , seeing that he was alive , rallied and renewed the assault .
William also ordered his archers to fire at a high angle rather than in a direct line in order to reach behind the Saxon shields .
The battle remained in doubt until William 's cavalry turned and wildly fled from the battlefield .
Whether the cavalry was retreating from fright or as a ruse , it had the same results .
The Saxons left their defenses to pursue , only to be struck by the Norman infantry .
At about the same time , an arrow hit Godwin in the eye , and he was killed by the advancing infantry .
The leaderless Saxons began to flee .
William , soon to be known as the Conqueror , pursued the retreating Saxons and seized Dover .
With little resistance , he entered London on December 25 , 1066 , and received the crown of England as King William I .
Over the next five years , William brutally put down several rebellions and replaced the Anglo - Saxon aristocracy with his own Norman followers .
Norman nobles built castles from which to rule and defend the countryside .
Norman law , customs , traditions , and citizens intermingled with the Saxons to form the future of England as a nation .
Later the adage would declare , " There 'll always be an England . "
The fact remains that the England that eventually came to exist began on the Hastings battlefield , and 1066 became a schoolbook standard marking the expansion of English culture , colonization , and influence around the world .
Battle # 1 Yorktown
American Revolution , 1781
The Battle of Yorktown was the climax of the American Revolution and directly led to the independence of the United States of America .
While others may have been larger and more dramatic , no battle in history has been more influential .
From the days following their victory at Yorktown , Americans have steadily gained power and influence up to their present role as the world 's most prosperous nation and the only military superpower .
The idea that a group of poorly armed , loosely organized colonists would have the audacity to challenge the massive , experienced army and navy of their rulers seemed impossible when the revolution 's first shots rang out at Lexington and Concord in 1775 .
The rebels ' chances of success seemed even more remote when the American colonies formally declared their independence from Great Britain on July 4 , 1776 .
Despite the huge imbalance of power , the Americans understood that time was on their side .
As long as George Washington and his army remained in the field , the newly declared republic survived .
Washington did not have to defeat the British ; he simply had to avoid having the British defeat him .
The longer the war lasted , the greater the odds that the British would become involved in wars that threatened their own islands and that the British public would tire of the war and its costs .
During the first year of the war , Washington had lost a series of battles around New York but had withdrawn the bulk of his army to fight another day .
Many British commanders had unintentionally aided the American effort with their military ineptness and their belief that the rebels would diplomatically end their revolt .
Participants on both sides , as well as observers around the world , had begun to take the possibility of American independence seriously only with their victory at Saratoga in October 1777 .
The poorly executed plan by the British to divide New England from the southern colonies by occupying New York 's Hudson River Valley had resulted not only in the surrender of nearly six thousand British soldiers but also in the recognition of the United States as an independent nation by France .
The American victory at Saratoga and the entrance of the French into the war also drew Spain and the Netherlands into the fight against England .
By 1778 , neither the British nor the Americans could gain the upper hand , as the war in the northern colonies had come to a stalemate .
The British continued to occupy New York and Boston , but they were too weak to crush the rebel army .
Washington similarly lacked the strength to attack the British fortresses .
In late 1778 , British commander General Henry Clinton used his superior sea mobility to transfer much of his army under Lord Charles Cornwallis to the southern colonies , where they occupied Savannah and then Charleston the following year .
Clinton 's plan was for Cornwallis to neutralize the southern colonies , which would cut off supplies to Washington and isolate his army .
Washington countered by dispatching Nathanael Greene , one of his ablest generals , to command the American troops in the South .
From 1779 to 1781 , Greene and other American commanders fought a guerrilla - like campaign of hit - and - run maneuvers that depleted and exhausted the British .
In the spring of 1781 , Cornwallis marched into North Carolina and then into Yorktown on the Virginia peninsula flanked by the York and James Rivers .
Although his army outnumbered the Americans two to one , Cornwallis fortified the small town and waited for additional men and supplies to arrive by ship .
Meanwhile , more than seven thousand French infantrymen , commanded by Jean Baptiste de Rochambeau , joined Washington 's army outside New York , and a French fleet led by Admiral Paul de Grasse waited in the Caribbean , preparing to sail northward .
Washington wanted de Grasse to blockade New York while the combined American - French armies attacked Clinton 's New York force .
Rochambeau and de Grasse proposed instead that they attack Cornwallis .
On August 21 , 1781 , Washington left a few units around New York and joined Rochambeau to march the two hundred miles to Yorktown in only fifteen days .
Clinton , convinced that New York was still the rebels ' primary target , did nothing .
While the infantry was on its march , the French navy drove away the British ships in the area at the Battle of Chesapeake Capes on September 5 .
De Grasse then blockaded the entrance to Chesapeake Bay and landed three thousand men to join the growing army around Yorktown .
By the end of September , Washington had united his army from the north with the rebel Southerners .
He now had more than 8,000 Americans along with the 7,000 French soldiers to encircle the 6,000 British defenders .
On October 9 , 1781 , the Americans and French began pounding the British with fifty - two cannons while they dug trenches toward the primary enemy defensive redoubts .
The American - Franco infantry captured the redoubts on October 14 and moved their artillery forward so they could fire directly into Yorktown .
Two days later , a British counterattack failed .
On October 17 , Cornwallis asked for a cease - fire , and on the 19th he agreed to unconditional surrender .
Only about one hundred and fifty of his soldiers had been killed and another three hundred wounded , but he knew that future action was futile .
American and French losses numbered seventy - two killed and fewer than two hundred wounded .
Cornwallis , claiming illness , sent his deputy Charles O'Hara to surrender in his place .
While the British band played " The World Turned Upside Down , " O'Hara approached the allies and attempted to surrender his sword to his European peer rather than the rebel colonist .
Rochambeau recognized the gesture and deferred to Washington .
The American commander turned to his own deputy , Benjamin Lincoln , who accepted O'Hara 's sword and the British surrender .
Several small skirmishes occurred after Yorktown , but for all practical purposes , the revolutionary war was over .
The upheaval and embarrassment over the defeat at Yorktown brought down the British government , and the new officials authorized a treaty on September 3 , 1783 , that acknowledged the independence of the United States .
Yorktown directly influenced not only the United States but also France .
The French support of the United States and their own war against Britain wrecked France 's economy .
More importantly , the idea of liberty from a tyrant , demonstrated by the Americans , motivated the French to begin their own revolution in 1789 that eventually led to the age of Napoleon and far greater wars .
The fledgling United States had to fight the British again in 1812 to guarantee its independence , but the vast area and resources of North America soon enlarged and enriched the new nation .
By the end of the nineteenth century , the United States had become a world power ; by the end of the twentieth , it was the strongest and most influential nation in the world .
Before Yorktown , the United States was a collection of rebels struggling for independence .
After Yorktown , it began a process of growth and evolution that would eventually lead to its present status as the longest - surviving democracy and most powerful country in history .
The American Revolution , beginning at Lexington and Concord and drawing strength from Saratoga , culminated at Yorktown in the most influential battle in history .

The Department of Defense has released more than 800 heavily - redacted pages of intelligence oversight reports , detailing activities that its Inspector General has “ reason to believe are unlawful . ”
The reports are the latest in an ongoing document release by more than a half - dozen intelligence agencies in response to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit filed by EFF in July 2009 .
The reports , submitted to the Intelligence Oversight Board ( IOB ) by various Department of Defense components , cover the period from 2001 through 2008 .
The IOB ’s role within the Executive Office of the President is to ensure that each component of the intelligence community works within the Constitution and all applicable laws .
As such , the Inspector General of each intelligence agency is required to submit periodic reports to the IOB , which in turn is required to forward to the Attorney General any report identifying an intelligence activity that violates the law .
Intelligence oversight reporting is rarely disclosed to the public .
This new release , from various Defense components including the Army and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , comes in four parts , see here .
Much of the reported improper activity consisted of intelligence gathering on so - called “ U.S. Persons , ” including citizens , permanent residents and U.S. - based organizations .
Although Defense agencies are generally prohibited from collecting such information ( except as part of foreign intelligence or counter - intelligence activity ) , it is apparent from the unredacted reports released to EFF that some DoD components have had chronic difficulty complying with that prohibition .
Some specific items of interest include :
Part 1
Pg 98 : A report that the Joint Forces Command , working with the FBI , improperly collected and disseminated intelligence on Planned Parenthood and a white supremacist group called the National Alliance , as part of preparations for the 2002 Olympics .
Pg 122-137 : A NORAD intelligence briefing improperly included intelligence on an anti-war group called Alaskans for Peace and Justice in 2005 .
Pg 257-258 : A 2006 report that NORAD had procedural problems relating to collecting information on U.S. Persons .
Part 3
Pg 53 - 54 : A report from 2003 of a closed investigation into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib and other sites in Iraq .
Pg 60 : A report from 2006 of improper intelligence ( in the TALON program ) on an anti-recruiting group .
Pg 112 : A report from 2007 of an Army Reserve officer routinely collecting data on U.S. Persons exercising their free speech rights .
Part 4
Pg 19 : A 2008 report that Army Signals Intelligence in Louisiana intercepted civilian cell phone conversations .
Pg 65 : A 2008 report that Army Cyber Counterintelligence officers attended the Black Hat hacker conference without disclosing their Army affiliation and without prior authorization to do so .
Pg 173 : A report that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations ( AFOSI ) set up a “ honey pot ” computer system to identify foreign threats in May 2006 .
In October 2007 , AFOSI realized that the honey pot system might have been in violation of a sealed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) order that required a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrant for such activity .
AFOSI was not privy to the FISC order and only knew of it from public media reporting .
The operation was suspended .
Amazingly , when the Air Force asked the Justice Department to see the FISC order at issue , DOJ ’s National Security Division denied the Air Force ’s request .
According to the release schedule ordered by a federal judge last December , we expect to receive additional IOB reports from the CIA , National Security Agency , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Defense later this month .
We will post the documents to our website as we receive them .
An 11 - year - old boy whose mother died after losing her health insurance has become an advocate for health care reform — and opponents of reform are gunning for him .
Marcelas Owens of Seattle lost his mother in 2006 after the 27 - year - old woman was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension , a condition that can lead to heart failure if left untreated .
Due to missed work , Tiffany Owens lost her job , and with it her health insurance .
Not long after , she died of her disorder .
ADVERTISEMENT
Owens appeared at a Capitol Hill press conference flanked by the Democratic leadership on Thursday , the day after he turned 11 years old .
“ I do n’t want any other kids to go through the pain that our family has gone through , ” Owens said .
“ My grandma and I want Barack Obama and Congress and everybody to come together and to help get the health care bill passed . ”
The image of an 11 - year - old boy with a sad story championing the health reform effort appeared to be too much for some conservative commentators , with columnist Michelle Malkin accusing the Democrats of “ wielding the human kiddie shield as its last - stand defense for Demcare . ”
Malkin wrote , “ Have you noticed something about the audiences that President Obama has cherry - picked to cheer his government health care takeover roadshow ?
They ’re getting younger and younger . ”
She added that if President Obama did n’t end his public appearances on health care soon , “ he ’ll be peddling Democratic reconciliation tactics on ‘ Dora the Explorer ’ and ‘ SpongeBob SquarePants ’ . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Malkin used that expression , “ human kiddie shield , ” before , when President Obama answered an 11 - year - old girls ’ question at a health care town hall in New Hampshire last August .
“ Look for Dems to play the kiddie human shield card to the hilt , ” she wrote .
Tim Graham at NewsBusters reported that Owens “ has an entire family of liberal activists , ” and castigated the news media for not focusing more on his family ’s connections to Seattle activist groups .
Criticizing CBS ’ and MSNBC ’s coverage , Graham wrote that “ what neither network shared with the viewer is how Marcelas has become a constant talking point for his home - state Democrat Sen .
Patty Murray , and how he is a spokesman for a liberal lobby , the Washington Community Action Network . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Seattle Times reports that Owens ’ mother “ had been active with Washington Community Action Network , a Seattle - based consumer advocacy organization . ”
Also writing at NewsBusters , Matthew Balan criticized CNN correspondent Jim Acosta for calling Owens a “ brave young man . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Arthur Delaney at the Huffington Post notes that the controversy over Owens follows a pattern that has played out before .
In 2007 , 12 - year - old Graeme Smith became the target of muckraking when he urged President George W. Bush not to veto an expansion of children ’s health benefits .
Marcelas
Owens appears to be holding up well under the political pressure , saying he has “ no bad comments ” about people who oppose health care reform .
“ Their opinion is their opinion and they can say what they want about me , ” Delaney quoted Owens .
“ And I ’ll just keep turning around and doing what I ’m doing . ”
UPDATING OUR POLITICAL DICTIONARIES ….
Josh Marshall had a very short item the other day that I ’ve been meaning to mention .
He was helping readers understand the new political “ lexicon . ”
“ Jamming it through ” : to vote on a bill .
It got me thinking about how we should all update our understandings of political terms that had fairly straightforward definitions up until fairly recently .
“ Obstructionism , ” for example , only refers to Democratic minorities opposing Republican proposals .
“ Tyranny ” is found when an elected Democratic majority passes legislation that Republicans do n’t like .
“ Reconciliation ” describes a Senate process that Republicans are allowed to use to overcome Democratic “ obstructionism . ”
“ Terrorism ” refers to acts of political violence committed by people who are n’t white guys .
“ Bipartisanship ” is found when Democrats agree to pass Republican legislation .
“ Big government ” describes a dangerous phenomenon to be avoided , except in cases relating to reproductive rights or gays .
“ Treason ” refers to Democrats criticizing a Republican administration during a war .
“ Patriotism ” refers to Republicans criticizing a Democratic administration during a war .
“ Fiscal responsibility ” is a national priority related to keeping our deficit in check , which only applies when Republicans are in the minority .
“ Parliamentarian ” is a seemingly independent official on the Hill who Senate Republicans are allowed to fire when the GOP disapproves of his / her rulings .
See how fun this is ?

* Dykstra allegedly allowed to borrow too much
* Former star ’s assets being liquidated in bankruptcy
* JPMorgan declines to comment
NEW YORK , March 17 ( Reuters ) - Lenny Dykstra filed a $ 100 million lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N alleging he was fraudulently induced into borrowing more money than he could afford , leading to the former star baseball center fielder 's bankruptcy .
Dykstra contended that Washington Mutual Inc , now owned by JPMorgan , let him borrow $ 20.5 million even though it knew the sum was “ well beyond ” his means .
He said the thrift them reneged on an assurance it would let him refinance a mortgage used to buy a mansion from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky .
“ Defendant issued a loan designed to fail , ” Dykstra said in a complaint filed on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court .
“ The end result was that plaintiff incurred losses of approximately $ 100 million . ”
Dykstra seeks triple and punitive damages .
JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment .
Arturo Cisneros , a court - appointed trustee liquidating Dykstra ’s assets through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in California , was not immediately available for comment .
The case arose out of Dykstra ’s roughly $ 17.4 million purchase in 2007 of Gretzky ’s six - bedroom , eight - bath mansion on 6.7 acres in Thousand Oaks , California .
Dykstra , 47 , alleged Washington Mutual agreed to lend him $ 12 million .
He said a loan officer then steered him to a different lender for an $ 8.5 million “ piggyback ” loan , payable in full in one year , to cover the rest of the mortgage and to pay off loans at a property in Simi Valley , California .
But Dykstra alleged this arrangement left him responsible for $ 135,000 in monthly loan and property tax payments , which was more than then the $ 125,000 in monthly income he then had .
Dykstra said he was eventually forced to enter a series of transactions to pay off the $ 8.5 million loan , causing him to take on more debt and sell assets .
Last July , Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in the wake of more than 20 lawsuits over his entrepreneurial activities .
Earlier this month , Dykstra asked a California judge to dismiss that case , saying he would do a better job satisfying creditor claims than the trustee , whom he said is “ only interested in dumping assets as quickly as possible . ”
By ending the bankruptcy proceedings , Dykstra said he could “ once again claim his role as a productive member of society . ”
A hearing in that case is set for April 6 .
The Thousand Oaks mansion is being listed by Ewing & Associates Sotheby ’s , with a $ 14.9 million asking price .
Dykstra retired from baseball in 1996 after 12 years with the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies .
He helped the Mets win a World Series crown and the Phillies a pennant .
The case is Dykstra v. JPMorgan Chase & Co , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York , No. 10-02413 .
The bankruptcy case is : In re Lenny Kyle Dykstra , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Central District of California , No. 09-18409 .

It says something about the glamorous life I lead that my heart skipped a beat last night when I went through the daily mail and found the census form had arrived .
“ Oh cool , the census , ” I actually said as my wife leaned in for acknowledgment that I was glad to see her , too .
Only it was n’t the census form .
It was a letter saying the census form would be arriving in about a week .
Want to guess how much this little exercise cost ?
Hand me that napkin .
There were 105,480,101 households in 2000 .
At 500 sheets of paper per ream , that ’s 210,960 reams of paper for the letter .
It ’s cheap paper , though .
At $ 40 a case , Office Max has the cheapest price I could find online , so that ’s $ 843,000 for the paper .
Five - hundred envelopes go for $ 30 .
That ’s another $ 6.3 million ( I ’m rounding up and down here ; it ’s the government afterall ) .
Finally , there ’s the cost of mailing .
It ’s presorted first - class mail .
According to the U.S. Postal Service Web site , pre-sorted mail costs .335 , although a standard rate letter could be sent for 17 cents .
But this was first - class .
Total : $ 35,335,833.83 .
Total : $ 42.5 million ( although I remain somewhat skeptical about the postage ) to send you a letter to tell you you ’re going to get another letter next week .
Oh , and sending a postcard would ’ve been $ 15.8 million cheaper .
The average person pays $ 13,000 in federal taxes per year .
So it took the annual federal taxes of nearly 327 taxpayers to send you the letter .

A NASA radar aboard India 's lunar orbiter has detected ice deposits , astronomers reported Monday , in the moon 's north pole craters .
More than 40 small craters -- ranging from 1 to 9 miles across -- containing water ice turned up in the search by the NASA " Mini - SAR " radar aboard India 's Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft .
" Although the total amount of ice depends on its thickness in each crater , it 's estimated there could be at least 1.3 trillion pounds of water ice , " says NASA statement .
The finding confirms ice indications from NASA 's Lunar Prospector mission , and comes after November 's impact - blast test that successfully detected ice in south pole lunar craters by NASA 's $ 79 million LCROSS mission .
" The emerging picture from the multiple measurements and resulting data of the instruments on lunar missions indicates that water creation , migration , deposition and retention are occurring on the moon , " said Mini - SAR investigator Paul Spudis , of Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston , in a statement .
Because polar craters on the moon have been shaded from sunlight for billions of years , planetary scientists suspect ice can remain frozen in the shadows , chilled to temperatures below - 300 degrees Fahrenheit .
The Mini-SAR results show surface roughness inside the craters suggestive of ice mixed with lunar dirt .
Chandrayaan - 1 was launched in 2006 , aimed at exploring the moon from a 60 - mile high lunar - pole - circling orbit .

Attention Raiders !
An anonymous source came forward , as they so often do , and has claimed that the final name for the Playstation 3 Motion Controller Wand Sphere contraption is going to be called “ Playstation Arc . ”
The rumors have been swarming about this controllers name for some time now and have ranged from such titles as “ Gem ” and “ Sphere . ”
We have not heard much official word about this device since E3 last year , outside of a few promotional videos here or there .
The product is schedules for release this Spring , and is suppose to ship along side of many games such as Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition , Ape Escape Ps3 , and a multitude of patches to incorporate motion controls into other games .
OPR said it wanted to refer its findings to state bar disciplinary authorities where Yoo and Bybee are licensed .
However , a top DOJ official rejected those findings , after reviewing responses to the report by Yoo and Bybee .
Yoo is currently teaching law , while Bybee is now a federal judge .
The DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility found that former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John
Yoo engaged in professional misconduct by failing to provide " thorough , objective , and candid " legal advice in creating memoranda regarding the " enhanced interrogation " of detained terrorist suspects , while his boss Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee acted in " reckless disregard " for failing to provide " thorough , objective , and candid legal advice . "
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing Friday to delve into the recent report issued by the Department of Justice regarding the so - called " torture memos " authored by the Bush administration 's Office of Legal Counsel .
“ I have serious concerns about the role each of these government lawyers played in the development of these policies .
I have said before that if the judiciary committee , and the senate , knew of Judge Bybee ’s role in creating these policies , he would have never been confirmed to a lifetime appointment to the federal bench .
The right thing to do would be for him to resign from this lifetime appointment , " said Leahy in a statement .
“ As a United States Senator , as a former prosecutor , and as an American citizen , I am offended by the premeditated approach taken by former high - ranking officials in the Office of Legal Counsel in constructing the legal underpinnings of seriously flawed national security policies . "
Additionally , Vermont author and activist Charlotte Dennett , who had recently pressed the DOJ to release the report and other documents related to the probe of Yoo and Bybee , was pleasantly surprised by what was released , though less surprised about the DOJ 's exoneration .
" What the Department of Justice released on Friday was frankly a greater show of transparency than many of us expected .
David Margolis ’ report came as no surprise as it had already been summarized to the press a few weeks ago , causing widespread condemnation and mounting concerns that the Obama administration was determined to cover up the crimes of the Bush administration , " said Dennett , who has been trying to force the DOJ to release the results of their probe .
In January , Dennett and several other attorneys , activists and authors — as part of the Justice Robert Jackson Steering Committee — filed a Freedom of Information
Act request to release many of the documents the DOJ willingly released on Friday .
Dennett is part of the so - called " accountability movement " which is pushing the notion that some former Bush administration officials should be tried for war crimes .
The Robert Jackson Steering Committee , founded in September 2008 , is named in honor of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson , who was the top U.S. prosecutor of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg .
" We must never forget , " Jackson had said in his opening statement , " that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow .
To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our lips as well . "
Dennett documents the accountability movement in her new book The People v Bush : One Lawyer 's Campaign to Bring the President to Justice and the National Grassroots Movement She Encounters Along the Way , published last month by Vermont - based Chelsea Green .
While Leahy and Dennett both believe , on balance , the OPR findings show that Yoo and Bybee acted recklessly and should be held accountable , a top DOJ official said they did n't rise to the level of disbarment .
" I do not adopt OPR 's findings of misconduct .
This decision should not be viewed as an endorsement of the legal work that underlies those memoranda , " wrote David Margolis , associate deputy attorney general .
" However , OPR 's own analytical framework defines ' professional conduct ' such that a finding of misconduct depends on application of known , unambiguous obligation or standard to the attorney 's conduct .
I am unpersuaded that OPR has identified such a standard . "
With that , Margolis said he would not authorize OPR to refer its findings to the state bar disciplinary boards in the jurisdictions where Yoo and Bybee are licensed .
" While I have declined to adopt OPR 's findings of misconduct , I fear that John Yoo 's loyalty to his own ideology and convictions clouded his view of his obligation to his client and led him to author opinions that reflected his own extreme , albeit sincerely held , views of executive power , " wrote Margolis .
" But as all that glitters is not gold , all flaws do not constitute professional misconduct , " Margolis added .
Though Yoo and Bybee 's errors were " more than minor " Margolis said he did not believe their advice would have great impact , because " the memos were written for a limited audience and were but part of the dialogue with the CIA . "
The OPR report claimed that the threat of terrorism after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 did not justify Yoo and Bybee 's actions .
" Situations of great stress , danger , and fear do not relieve Department attorneys of their duty to provide thorough , objective , and candid legal advice , even if that advice is not what the client wants to hear , " the OPR report claimed .
" Accordingly , we concluded that the extraordinary circumstances that surrounded the drafting of the Bybee and Yoo Memos did not excuse or justify the lack of thoroughness , objectivity , and candor reflected in those documents . "
Leahy agrees .
" The report from the Office of Professional Responsibility is a condemnation of the legal memoranda drafted by key architects of the Bush administration ’s legal policy , including Jay Bybee and John Yoo , on the treatment of detainees , " said Leahy .
" The deeply flawed legal opinions proffered by these former OLC officials created a ‘ golden shield ’ that sought to protect from scrutiny and prosecution the Bush administration ’s torture of detainees in U.S. custody .
In drafting and signing these unsound legal analyses , OLC attorneys sanctioned torture , contrary to our domestic anti-torture laws , our international treaty obligations and the fundamental values of this country . "
Dennett 's January FOIA request sought the release of the original report , which was allegedly completed in December 2008 , as well as additional emails , plus the final final report that has been held up for months by Attorney General Eric Holder .
Dennett said her group was surprised to discover among the DOJ ’s releases a more critical independent assessment from the ethics lawyers in the Office of Professional Responsibility dated July 2009 calling for disciplinary action against Yoo and Bybee , as well as the original OPR report released in December 2008 which her group had requested through the Freedom of Information Act .
" These two OPR reports set forth clear evidence that pressure came down from the Bush White House and the CIA to authorize torture and after the torture took place , legally justify it , " said Dennett .
" Yoo and Bybee ’s deference to the CIA ’s concern about possible criminal prosecutions runs throughout these reports , and therefore merits a congressional investigation and renewed calls , not only for Bybee ’s impeachment and Yoo ’s dismissal as a law professor at Berekely , but their criminal prosecution . "
Dennett , who ran for state attorney general as a Progressive in 2008 , believes Bush should be held accountable for lying to Congress and the U.S. public about why it was necessary to invade Iraq .
She and others also believe other officials need to be tried for torturing suspects in custody .
Her book chronicles the growth of this so - called " accountability movement " that believes public officials should be held accountable for crimes they commit while in office , such as committing torture .
This movement began with efforts to impeach Pres .
George Bush and more recently has rallied around prosecuting high level officials in the Bush administration — including Bush 's lawyers who crafted the so - called torture memos in the Department of Justice — for war crimes .

Different ways of seeing stats
With Britain 's economic fortunes in the balance , decision makers are looking at all the economic surveys .
But , as Michael Blastland writes in his regular column , just one specific woman losing her job could make the difference between boom and bust .
Let 's say she lives in Durham .
Today , the smart skirt hangs in the cupboard .
Today , her shoes are not polished .
Last week , by chance , she lost her new job when an unlucky few were made redundant at Bluggins & Co , shoe - makers to the gentry , and the axe fell among recent recruits .
We 'll call her Eve .
This week , by chance , someone knocks on the door as part of what is known as the Labour Force Survey , a huge wheel of the statistical bureaucracy that follows the working lives of very roughly 100,000 adults .
About the same as interviewing every household in Oxford every three months .
How is unemployment measured ?
She is just one of those surveyed .
But Eve , unknowingly , is about to move mountains .
She will make economies tremble with a 30 - minute interview and a cross in a box on a laptop questionnaire .
Vast sums of money will lurch round the world 's financial system .
Politicians will reel and businesses be broken .
How ?
Because her unemployed status is noted .
It enters the record .
And , in our fiction , 5,037 people who took part in the survey last month were classified as unemployed .
This month , in a group that changes partially each time , there are 5,038 .
Calculations are made , the new total of unemployed in the sample is extrapolated to the population as a whole , the unemployment rate found to be 7.8 % .
At this , the world trembles .
For last month - again , in our fiction - the rate had been 7.7 % .
" Analysts " had expected a fall to 7.6 % - continuing signs of recovery .
They declare themselves " shocked " .
They fail to check the headline figure against others that might calm them down and the media pronounce that unemployment is rising again .
' Jittery '
The headline writers go to town , speculating on " Double Dip Doom " .
" Failed " says another , as all the attempts at economic rescue , by Bank of England or government , are written off .
The prospects for the UK 's public finances are revised by commentators everywhere as the recovery is doubted and , with it , the reviving tax revenues the government depends on to reduce its monthly borrowing .
The markets are jittery .
They have Greece in mind .
A rating agency downgrades the nation 's credit worthiness .
Panic sets in .
Money takes flight .
No -one wants UK gilts unless interest rates rise horribly .
The UK public finances are said to face meltdown .
And at the bottom of this mountain of fuss lies Eve .
Why she alone ?
Because the sample size on which the unemployment numbers are based is such that a change of 0.1 % in the unemployment rate is equal to about 65 people .
What is the Labour force survey ?
But it might be even more finely balanced than that .
For the numbers are unlikely to add up to anything divisible by a round 65 .
And if there are , say 32 left over , the number will be rounded down , but if there are 33 , it will be rounded up .
Thus can one person make the difference between whether or not the official unemployment rate rises .
This is not a criticism of the way the data is gathered or presented at source .
Check the ONS and it states clearly that the figure is accurate only to 0.2 per cent , most of the time .
This means that a rise of 0.1 per cent in the unemployment rate could be consistent with an actual fall in unemployment across the whole economy of 0.1 per cent .
The range of uncertainty is equal to tens of thousands of people in the real economy .
The sampling variability once you get down to the regions of the UK is about three times bigger than for the whole country .
' Set of clues '
Our little fantasy is improbable and depends on unlikely statistical happenstance and thoughtless public comment .
But the point is that feverish times make attention twitchy .
Every piece of evidence about the state of the economy is interpreted , explanations offered , forecasts recalculated , and much is made out of little , perhaps too much .
The difference between a rise and a fall is judged with solemn faces when the truth is the change we observe may not even be there .
Economic data is never a set of facts ; it is a set of clues , some of which are the red herrings of unavoidable measurement error .
The Labour Force Survey is one of the biggest and best around , but it is a question to ask of all surveys : on how many real people in those surveys does the appearance of change depend ?
Not how many in the survey , but how many make the difference .
The next day , before the figures were even published , Eve found a new job .

James Webb Space Telescope Sunshield Design Achieves Significant Landmark
Press Release From : Goddard Space Flight Center
Posted : Tuesday , February 2 , 2010
The James Webb Space Telescope 's five - layer , tennis court - sized sunshield has passed its critical design review , certifying that its design is complete and meets mission requirements .
By achieving thermal , deployment and stray - light targets , the sunshield is now ready for manufacturing .
Sunshield manufacturing and test plans were also evaluated and approved as part of the review , which took place Jan. 11 - 14 at the company 's Redondo Beach , Calif. , space systems manufacturing facility .
The Observatory is being designed and developed by Northrop Grumman under contract to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md .
" Passing this review is the culmination of years of intense effort meeting the unique challenges that have defined this mission , " said Scott Willoughby , Webb telescope program manager for Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems .
" This is the first time a sunshield of this size and complexity will fly on a space telescope , " Willoughby said .
" We 've achieved a very significant mission - critical milestone with this important validation of our sunshield design . "
In preparation for the design review , 18 separate sub-assembly design audits were conducted on the sunshield 's extremely complex system of latches , tensioners , spreader bars and telescoping boom assemblies .
The goal was to validate these sub-assemblies at the system level and evaluate points where they interface .
" There are no text books or guidelines on how to design and build a deployable Sunshield of this size , " said Keith Parrish , Webb telescope Sunshield Manager at NASA Goddard .
" Nearly a decade ago NASA and Northrop Grumman had to start from scratch and literally invent the techniques , materials , and mechanisms needed to do the job .
We still have quite the challenge in front of us now that we start into the fabrication and testing phase but it's also a very exciting time . "
The Webb telescope 's sunshield is a five - layer structure the size of a tennis court .
Each of the five membrane layers is about as thick as a human hair ( one to two - thousands of an inch thick ) and is made of a polymer - based film called Kapton .

The sunshield will absorb and deflect solar light to keep the telescope operating at cryogenic temperatures so infrared sensors can see into the most distant galaxies .
The Webb telescope is NASA 's next - generation premier space observatory , exploring deep space phenomena from distant galaxies to nearby planets and stars .
The Webb telescope will give scientists clues about the formation of the universe and the evolution of our own solar system , from the first light after the Big Bang to the formation of star systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth .
Expected to launch in 2014 , the telescope is a joint project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency .

There was a moment of rare clarity this week for America 's efforts to advance Israeli - Palestinian peace .
The US vice - president Joe Biden was on a visit , ostensibly a charm offensive to an Israel that has been heretofore neglected by the Obama administration 's most senior echelons , and an opportunity to discuss broad regional issues , notably Iran .
By coincidence , Biden 's trip coincided with special Middle East envoy George Mitchell 's launching of indirect , or proximity , talks , between the Israelis and Palestinians .
Perhaps less coincidental , Biden 's presence was greeted by announcements of dramatic new plans for Israeli settlement expansion in East Jerusalem .
A crisis in the relaunched Israeli - Palestinian peace talks had apparently arrived a little earlier than expected – day zero to be precise .
Not that those resumed negotiations were being greeted by much more than scepticism anyway .
For most observers and even participants , the customary and polite suspension of disbelief that normally accompanies a new round of peace talks was barely on display .
Both sides seemed ready to settle down to a predictable and protracted game of placing blame for failure at the other 's door .
Then , on the day of Biden 's arrival , Israel announced plans to market 112 new housing units in the West Bank and bettered that 24 hours later ( shortly after the Biden - Netanyahu confab ) when a district committee gave planning authorisation to 1,600 new units in East Jerusalem .
What provided this episode with refreshing clarity was the way in which it exposed the deeper dynamics that are driving contemporary Israeli realities .
Netanyahu seems to have been genuinely blindsided by this development .
Israel 's settlement addiction proved stronger even than the prime minister 's desire to spend a few days going settlement cold turkey .
Israel 's leadership scrambled to summon their best explanations and apologies – the decision was insensitive , ill - timed , a local initiative , and a mere technical planning detail .
If only the decision had been taken two days or two weeks earlier or later everything would have been OK .
And so in one fell swoop the naked Israeli settler reality was exposed in all of its absurdity .
For the rest of the world , East Jerusalem , just like the West Bank , is occupied territory ; all settlements over the Green Line are illegal ( even if not everyone always uses that word ) .
For Israel 's leaders , the timing may have been unfortunate , but the impulse to settle Palestinian land is fundamentally sound .
Palestinian land is claimed as state land or confiscated , plans are authorised , tenders are issued , construction begins , and settlers move in .
After more than 40 years , and endless seemingly trivial and mundane bureaucratic decisions , over 500,000 Israelis now reside beyond the Green Line ( for a detailed analysis of this process , read East Jerusalem settlement experts Daniel Seidemann and Lara Friedman here ) .
The settlers and their sympathisers are entrenched in every relevant nook and cranny of Israel 's bureaucracy and security establishment .
The momentum that they can now generate ( especially but not only when their sympathisers hold senior government office ) , is stronger than Israel 's demographic concerns , is stronger than fear of Israel acquiring an international pariah status , and as was proven this week , is stronger than the needs of the US - Israel relationship .
America 's vice - president has just seen this dynamic first hand and up close .
Mainstream Israeli commentators were apparently shocked to discover the power of the settler momentum .
Pundits such as Ari Shavit , known for their staunch nationalism and vilification of human rights groups working in the territories , had a rude awakening .
In Ha'aretz he described " the settlements in the West Bank that serve the centrifuges in Natanz [ Iran ] .
If sane Israel does not wake up , it will be defeated by the metastasising of the occupation and the lack of the central government 's ability to stop it . "
And that , in a nutshell , is why Benjamin Netanyahu may be our last , best chance for a two - state peace deal .
The extremism and excesses of his government may finally open enough eyes and lead to enough local and international action to roll back this settler behemoth .
More moderate Israeli governments , even those perhaps sincerely committed to a variation on the de-occupation , two - state solution theme , have definitively failed to halt the settlements march .
When Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert were negotiating on paper potential Israeli withdrawals , the settlements and the occupation were being expanded and entrenched on the ground .
Even when Ariel Sharon was removing 7,500 settlers from Gaza , he was adding a greater number to the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
But under Netanyahu , what you see is what you get .
And perhaps this clarity and this exaggeration is exactly what is needed .
Everything else , all the relevant actors , were stuck in an ugly paralysis .
The Palestinians remain divided and devoid of strategy .
For 20 years the Fatah - led PLO had been waiting for the US to deliver Israel for an equitable two - state outcome .
The only alternative to negotiations to gain any traction had been indiscriminate and unjustifiable violence .
The Arab states had produced a breakthrough peace initiative in 2002 but it never translated into a programme for public diplomacy or even pressure to be brought to bear on Israel , America , or the Quartet .
The US and EU continue to place their faith in confidence - building measures and unmediated negotiations between the parties , hoping against hope that a formula which had failed for over a decade would produce a breakthrough and that rational argument might prevail .
Not surprisingly , none of this was going anywhere .
It has taken a Netanyahu - led extreme right , religious government in Israel ( the defunct Labor party of Ehud Barak can be justly ignored as window dressing ) to send a signal strong enough to perhaps pierce this paralysis .
Israelis and Palestinians , it is clear , are in an adversarial relationship , talk of partnership is premature , talk of confidence - building is naive .
Transparently run Palestinian institutions and well - groomed Palestinian security forces will not remove the settler - occupation complex .
And neither will gentle persuasion .
The naked extremity of the Netanyahu government is producing new international initiatives and new coalitions .
In Jewish diaspora communities , there is a determination to reclaim a more moderate and progressive vision of what it means to be pro-Israel and to apply Jewish ethics and Jewish values , that helped guide civil rights struggles in the past , to contemporary Israeli reality .
Such efforts are gaining ground – notably the emergence of J Street in America .
Inside Israel , a new progressive discourse , still lacking real parliamentary representation , is struggling to make its voice heard in civil society — notably in weekly demonstrations at Sheikh Jarrah .
On the Palestinian side , alternative strategies to the negotiation dependency or violence that dominated the past are gaining ground – especially in non-violent resistance to land confiscations and the separation barrier .
Prime Minister Fayyad 's plan for statehood by mid-2011 could become a significant hook if it develops some teeth .
European actors have been toying with initiatives of their own in adapting to this new reality .
All 27 member states achieved a remarkable consensus in endorsing the most powerful and comprehensive statement of EU policy last December .
Lady Ashton , at least declaratively , has gotten off to an impressive start and will be visiting the region next week , and crucially Gaza will be on her itinerary .
Britain is taking the lead in imposing labelling on settlement products , and the French and Spanish governments are exploring options for advancing Palestinian statehood even in the face of peace process stalemate .
None of this would likely have happened if the government in Israel was nice - sounding and well - intentioned , but ultimately hapless in the face of the settler - occupation complex .
Nothing is also likely to really come to fruition without the US assuming leadership .
These new developments may serve to create an environment in which there is more political space for the US to operate in .
US administrations have helped generate moments of decision for Israel in the past and not only in the Egyptian peace deal and full evacuation of the Sinai brokered by President Carter .
President Bush confronted Yitzhak Shamir with the withholding of loan guarantee monies , leading to the election of Yitzhak Rabin in 1992 in a campaign in which settlements and opposition to them featured prominently .
Benjamin Netanyahu's first term in office ended abruptly when President Clinton challenged him to sign , and then implement , the Wye River Memorandum of 1998 , something his coalition could not sustain and which led to the election of Ehud Barak , ushering in at the time a moment of great hope .
The realities today are no longer the same .
The Israeli inability to confront its own settler - occupation demon is more deeply entrenched .
Israel will have to be presented with clear choices , clear answers to its legitimate security and other concerns , and clear consequences for nay - saying .
A successful effort will also have to be more comprehensive and more regional in its scope , almost certainly involving Syria and bringing Hamas into the equation .
No one should expect this to be easy .
But if one person can generate American will to lead such an effort and an international alliance to see it through , then surely that person is the Israeli leader who we saw on display in all his glorious stubbornness this week .

Climate skepticism is free speech .
Alternative points - of - view deserve to be heard .
Finally !!
Is that what you are thinking ?
Its ok .
You can admit it .
We are all friends here .
Do you remember this little thing ?
Well it turns out some of you daring bakers want to make this yourselves .
Yeah you !
I cant wait to see and read all about it ... send me links girls !
( and boys ... if there are any boys )
Well .
In order for me to do a tutorial I had to make another one .
So , forgive the less then stellar decorations , but here is our ' tutorial ' heart cake .
But you didnt come to see the outside right ?
Here goes .
Start out by making four eight inch pans of white cake .
( If you want the actual recipe , just click here )
Make one 9x13 ( you can do whatever shape and size you want ) pan of red velvet cake .
( recipe here )
First I need to level each cake .
I use this handy dandy leveling cake thingy I got at Walmart for a few bucks .
Remember to do this for all four white cakes .
Add about 1 /2 cup to 1 cup frosting and then put one layer on top .
You want two separate two layer cakes at this point .
For the red velvet cake I just ran my fork through it to break it up .
Then I added about a cup of frosting and combined well .
NOW !
I usually like to freeze the cakes for at least a couple hours .
If you cant freeze them , at least try and pop them in the fridge for a bit !
I know this looks pretty weird ( maybe cause it is ) but this is what I am going to use to make sure I have some uniformity in the heart design .
Its just two toothpicks and a piece of twine .
Place one toothpick in the center of the cake , then ( holding firmly ) drag the outside toothpick around the cake and make a circle .
Like this !
Now I have a rough guide line of where I am going to being carving .
Do this to both cakes .
( or , if you are a good drawer , just take a knife and cut a shallow line around the perimeter . )
Carve out a V shape in the cake .
The top half of the heart is a little trickier .
This time , I started with my knife in the center of the cake and created this little island .
I then moved back out to my " guide line " and started cutting .
I ended up creating this channel .
Once this has been created , you can go back in a do some more carving to create more detail .
Here is after I went in with a spoon and carved out a bit more .
The two cakes carved out .
The hard part is pretty much done now !
Now I can start filling in the cakes with the red velvet cake .
All filled !
At this point I put it in my freezer for about 15 minutes .
Just to let them set .
I added some frosting the the edge of the bottom cake .
Make sure you know which is which !
You are going to want to add the cake with the hallowed out ' channel ' to the top of the V cake .
Here goes nothin !
I have found the easiest way to do this is to just use your hand .
Place it flat over the top of the ' channel ' cake and flip it over .
Then gently place it one the bottom cake .
Add some more frosting and do a rough crumb coat over the whole cake .
And here is our thin layer of icing for the crumb coat .
Put this in the fridge about at least a half hour , or as long as overnight .
Now .
Go eat an apple .
Seriously .
Cause if you are anything like me you have been snacking on the cake scraps this whole time and you need a healthy energy boost .
There .
Feel better ?
Lets get back to work .
I ended up using all my red velvet cake so I didnt have any left over for decoration .
So white it is !
Ready to see what all this work was for ?
I thought it turned out pretty good !
Granted , this is my third time making it in a month so I had better be able to at least make it presentable by now . :)
And it tastes as good as it looks !
( I might be biased )
So I hope you are brave enough to try a heart cake for your loved one this Valentines Day .
Be sure to let me know how it works out .. and take lots and lots of pictures ! :)
Recipes :
Red Velvet Cake
For the red velvet cake I messed around with a recipe from Magnolia Bakery .
* This is how I modified this recipe : I used 2 sticks of butter , 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks , 2 tablespoons of food color , and apple cider vinegar .
I wanted a more dense cake because I knew I was using it in the center of the heart cake and I needed to make sure it was sturdy enough .
3 1/3 cups cake flour ( not self - rising )
3/4 cup ( 1 1/2 sticks ) unsalted butter , softened
2 1/4 cups sugar
3 large eggs , at room temperature
6 tablespoons red food coloring
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees .
Grease and lightly flour three 9 x 2 - inch round cake pans , then line the bottoms with waxed paper .
To make the cake :
In a small bowl , sift the cake flour and set aside .
In a large bowl , on the medium speed of an electric mixer , cream the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy , about 5 minutes .
Add the eggs , one at a time , beating well after each addition .
In a small bowl , whisk together the red food coloring , cocoa , and vanilla .
Add to the batter and beat well .
In a measuring cup , stir the salt into the buttermilk .
Add to the batter in three parts , alternating with the flour .
With each addition , beat until the ingredients are incorporated , but do not overheat .
In a small bowl , stir together the cider vinegar and baking soda .
Add to the batter and mix well .
Using a rubber spatula , scrape down the batter in the bowl , making sure the ingredients are well blended and the batter is smooth .
Divide the batter among the prepared pans .
Bake for 30 - 40 minutes , or until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean .
Let the layers cool in the pans for 1 hour .
Remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack .
*****
* I used only all - purpose flour and then added 1 tsp baking powder .
I am going to play around with this a bit more next time and maybe even add some baking soda .
I found this recipe on Food Network .
White Cake
1 1/2 cups self - rising flour
1 1/4 cups all - purpose flour
1 cup ( 2 sticks ) unsalted butter , softened
2 cups sugar
4 large eggs , at room temperature
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F .
In a small bowl , combine the flours .
Set aside .
In a large bowl , on the medium speed of an electric mixer , cream the butter until smooth .
Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy , about 3 minutes .
Add the eggs , 1 at a time , beating well after each addition .
Add the dry ingredients in 3 parts , alternating with the milk and vanilla .
With each addition , beat until the ingredients are incorporated but do not over beat .
Using a rubber spatula , scrape down the batter in the bowl to make sure the ingredients are well blended .
Carefully spoon the batter into cake pan .
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes ( for round cake ) , or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean .
*****
And I am loving Magnolia 's Vanilla Buttercream frosting .
* My only modification to the recipe is I like to add a little almond extract , and it seems that 1 tsp. is the perfect amount !
And be sure to use CLEAR vanilla extract to get a white frosting .
Makes enough for one 2 - layer 9 - inch cake or 2 dozen cupcakes *
1 cup ( 2 sticks ) unsalted butter , softened
6 to 8 cups confectioners ’ sugar
1/2 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Place the butter in a large mixing bowl .
Add 4 cups of the sugar and then the milk and vanilla .
On the medium speed of an electric mixer , beat until smooth and creamy , about 3 - 5 minutes .
Gradually add the remaining sugar , 1 cup at a time , beating well after each addition ( about 2 minutes ) , until the icing is thick enough to be of good spreading consistency .
You may not need to add all of the sugar .
If desired , add a few drops of food coloring and mix thoroughly .
( Use and store the icing at room temperature because icing will set if chilled . )
Icing can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days .

( CNN ) -- A California jury recommended Tuesday that a man who once appeared on " The Dating Game " be executed for the murders of four women and a child .
The jury deliberated an hour before deciding that Rodney Alcala , 66 , should pay with his life for the murders of Robin Samsoe , Jill Barcomb , Georgia Wixted , Charlotte Lamb and Jill Parentau , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office said .
Alcala will be formally sentenced Wednesday in Santa Ana , Orange County , where the case was tried even though most of the crimes were committed in neighboring Los Angeles .
The slayings took place between November 1977 and June 1979 , covering a wide swath of suburban Los Angeles from Burbank to El Segundo , prosecutors said .
Before he was a convicted serial killer , Alcala was a winning bachelor on " The Dating Game . "
" Oh yeah , I remember it quite clearly , " said Jed Mills , the game - show contestant who sat next to Alcala in 1978 .
" He was creepy .
Definitely creepy . "
Alcala was found guilty on February 25 of murder , kidnapping and an array of sexual offenses .
He acted as his own attorney during the penalty phase of the trial .
At the time of the murders , no one knew that the man with the wavy long hair and toothy grin was a serial killer .
That included Mills , a veteran television and film actor , whose only encounter with Alcala was when both of them appeared on " The Dating Game . "
" That 's when I became part of a nightmare , and I did n't realize it was a nightmare until 32 years later , " Mills said .
Alcala , who already had been convicted for the 1968 rape of an 8 - year - old girl , was the first contestant to be introduced in the game - show episode .
" Bachelor No. 1 is a successful photographer who got his start when his father found him in the darkroom at the age of 13 , fully developed , " host Jim Lange said .
" Between takes you might find him skydiving or motorcycling .
Please welcome Rodney Alcala . "
After the three bachelors were announced , the young woman who would choose one of them for a date began asking questions .
She posed her first one to Alcala .
" What 's your best time ? " she said .
" The best time is at night , " Alcala answered with a wide smile .
" Nighttime . "
Mills , who was bachelor No. 2 , said he had an almost immediate aversion to Alcala .
" Something about him , I could not be near him , " Mills recalled .
" I am kind of bending toward the other guy to get away from him , and I do n't know if I did that consciously .
But thinking back on that , I probably did . "
Alcala was able to charm Cheryl Bradshaw from the other side of the " Dating Game " wall .
" Who will it be ? " the host asked her at the end of the show .
" I 'll take One [ Bachelor No. 1 ] , " Bradshaw said , and out strolled Alcala .
If Alcala appeared likable to viewers at home , Mills said he was the complete opposite when they sat together in the show 's green room , where the show 's contestants waited before going on air .
" He was quiet , but at the same time he would interrupt and impose when he felt like it , " Mills said .
" And he was very obnoxious and creepy -- he became very unlikable and rude and imposing as though he was trying to intimidate .
I wound up not only not liking this guy ... not wanting to be near him ... he got creepier and more negative .
He was a standout creepy guy in my life . "
Within months of his " Dating Game " appearance , Alcala would become a killer , prosecutors said , abducting and murdering a 12 - year - old girl in 1979 .
Before the decade was over , Alcala would claim four more victims , according to testimony at his trial .
CNN asked noted crime profiler Pat Brown to analyze Alcala 's appearance on " The Dating Game . "
" He was aware that he could say things that were considered sexy and funny and the girl would like that , " Brown said .
" He watched the game and he gave those answers and he won , so he learned some tricks .
But a psychopath 's true nature comes seeping through .
" When you go back and look , what 's most fascinating is that he had already committed a crime , " Brown said , " Raped a little girl .
Here is a man portraying himself as a desirable young man when he is a violent sexual predator of children . "
Alcala 's real identity revealed itself off the stage when he was with the other bachelors , Brown believes .
" He is showing his psychopathic personality in the green room , " she said .
" He was n't acting at that time .
Those were his enemies , and he had to beat them to get the girl and he wanted to win .
" This guy probably literally hated them .
This guy was going on the show to prove how special and wonderful he was .
And his ego was riding on it . "
Though Bradshaw chose Alcala as her date , she refused to go out with him , according to published reports .
Being rejected can have a profound impact on serial killers , Brown suggested .
" One wonders what that did in his mind , " Brown said .
" That is something he would not take too well .
They do n't understand the rejection .
They think that something is wrong with that girl : ' She played me .
She played hard to get . ' "
Mills said he still has a difficult time discussing Alcala .
" The more time has gone by , the creepier it gets , " he said , " because it kind of sinks in slowly .
What this guy did , it 's hard to express .
He kind of haunts me a bit .
" Just talking about it , I get a tightness in my stomach . "
CNN 's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report .

Scientology 's attitude to criticism Contents Introduction
L. Ron Hubbard 's paranoia
Hubbard 's opposition to civil rights
Fair Game
Suppressive Acts
The invalidity of criticism Introduction " The reactions of individuals and groups to criticism varies from grateful acceptance , or amused tolerance , at one end of the scale to a sense of outrage and vindictive counter - attack on the other .
Perhaps unfortunately ( especially for its adherents )
Scientology falls at the hyper - sensitive end of the scale .
Judging from the documents , this would seem to have its origin in a personality trait of Mr. Hubbard , whose attitude to critics is one of extreme hostility .
One can take the view that anyone whose attitude to criticism is such as Mr. Hubbard displays in his writings cannot be too surprised if the world treats him with suspicion rather than affection . "
[ Sir John Foster , Report of the Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology ( 1971 ) , p. 127 ]
Sir John Foster 's perceptive words remain as true today as when they were first written over 25 years ago .
Scientology has made it clear on numerous occasions that ( as officials have put it ) " it is not a turn - the - other - cheek religion . "
L. Ron Hubbard 's death in 1986 has not led to a more tolerant attitude towards criticism - quite the opposite , as critics and publishers continue to be sued , attacked and harassed by Scientology and its paid agents .
The policies instigated by Hubbard have now been set in stone as part of the so - called unalterable " scriptures " of Scientology .
L. Ron Hubbard 's paranoia
Years before Hubbard created either Dianetics or Scientology , anecdotal accounts suggest that he already was a very thin - skinned person .
Those who knew him in his heyday as a pulp fiction writer in the 1930s noted his intemperate reaction to sceptics :
" One evening [ in 1934 ] , Frank Gruber [ a friend of Hubbard and fellow pulp fiction writer ] , sat through a long account of his experiences in the Marine Corps , his exploration of the upper Amazon and his years as a white hunter in Africa .
At the end of it he asked with obvious sarcasm : ' Ron , you 're eighty - four years old are n't you ? '
' What the hell are you talking about ? '
Ron snapped .
Gruber waved a notebook in which he had been jotting figures .
' Well , ' he said , ' you were in the Marines seven years , you were a civil engineer for six years , you spent four years in Brazil , three in Africa , you barnstormed with your own flying circus for six years ...
I 've just added up all the years you did this and that and it comes to eighty - four . '
Ron was furious that his escapades should be openly doubted .
' He blew his tack , ' said Gruber .
He would react in the same way at the [ American Fiction ]
Guild lunches if someone raised an eyebrow when he was in full flow .
Most of the other members expected their yarns to be taken with a pinch of salt , but not Ron .
It was almost as if he believed his own stories . "
[ Russell Miller , Bare - Faced Messiah ( 1987 ) , p.67 ; Frank Gruber , The Pulp Jungle ( 1967 ) ]
In the late 1940s , Hubbard evidently suffered a period of acute mental distress ; he wrote on 15 October 1947 to the Veterans Administration , requesting psychiatric treatment for " moroseness and suicidal inclinations . "
It is unclear whether he actually received any such treatment .
His development of Dianetics in 1948 - 49 may have been an attempt to cure himself of his mental problems , but although it certainly made his name ( and a lot of money ) the strains probably worsened his state of mind .
Hubbard faced many organisational problems , a hostile press and medical profession and political clashes within the Dianetics Foundation between those who favoured a scientific approach and those ( such as himself ) who veered more towards pseudoscience and mysticism .
As if this was not enough , his four - year marriage with Sara Northrup Hubbard was on the verge of collapse .
In 1950 , he took a lover - Barbara Klowdan , a 20 - year - old psychology major .
She soon recognised that he was , in her words , " a deeply disturbed man " who displayed all the symptoms of " a manic depressive with paranoid tendencies . "
She later recalled : " He was highly paranoid and would be rushing along the street with me and I would say , " Why are you walking so fast ? "
He 'd look over his shoulder and say , " Do n't you know what it 's like to be a target ? "
At all times he thought the American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association and CIA had hit men after him ... he thought everyone was after him .
This was long before the IRS was after him .
No one was after him at that time , but he certainly had delusions .
When I went to work for him he had hired somebody who had been in the police department .
He gave everyone who worked for him a lie detector test asking if he had designs on his life . "
[ Barbara Klowdan , interview with Russell Miller , 28 July 1986 ]
This paranoia deepened in later years .
By the mid-1960s , Hubbard was convinced that he faced a sinister international conspiracy ( the " Tenyaka Memorial " ) masterminded by the psychiatric profession , who organized attacks on Scientology through the IRS , the FBI , the CIA , the KGB , the American Medical Association , the World Federation of Mental Health , the Bank of England , Interpol and others .
His paranoia has since become a fundamental and deeply - rooted element of Scientology ( see the 8 October 1993 speech of Hubbard 's successor , David Miscavige , for a prime example ) .
Hubbard 's paranoia came through in much of his work , particularly visibly in the example of the tape " Ron 's Journal ' 67 " , still a compulsory part of a Scientologist 's training .
In it he states : " ... I found after the southern African matter that it was vitally necessary that I isolate who it was on this planet that was attacking us .
The attacks were all of the same pattern , they always followed the same newspaper routes , they always used the same type of parliamentary member and I thought that I had better look into this very thoroughly .
The organisation ... employed several professional intelligence agents ... [ who ] looked into this matter for us and their results ... have told us all that we needed to know with regard to any enemy we have on this planet .
Our enemies are less than twelve men .
They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles .
They own and control newspaper chains and they , oddly enough , spin [ sic ] all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up .
Now these chaps are very interesting fellows , they have fantastically corrupt backgrounds , illegitimate children , government graft - a very unsavoury lot - and they apparently some time in the very distant past had determined upon a course of action .
Being in control of most of the gold supplies on the planet , they entered on a programme of bringing every government to bankruptcy and under their thumb , so that no government would be able to act politically without their permission .
The rest of their apparent programme was to use mental health , which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy , to remove from their path any political dissenters , and they were the people behind the Siberia Bill , which almost passed the House of Representatives in the United States and did pass , if I remember rightly , the Senate , which gave the power to any governor of any state in the United States simply to pick up anyone on the street and send him to Alaska .
We defeated this Siberia Bill and many other mental health , quote - unquote , Acts of this character but never really before knew from whom they were coming ... ...
These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control , of course , income tax , government finance - [ Harold ] Wilson , for instance , the current Premier of England , is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually .
They organise these mental health groups which sprung up simultaneously all over the world and anything that has mental health in it - in its name - or mental hygiene or other things of that character - such names as that - are part of the organisation which stems from these from these less than a dozen greedy men . "
[ Hubbard , " Ron 's Journal ' 67 " ]
Hubbard 's opposition to civil rights Hubbard 's moral orientation had never been particularly clear - L. Sprague du Camp , the science fiction writer , recalled that before the Second World War some had thought him a fascist , others believing him to be profoundly liberal .
It gradually became clear in the 1950s that he lacked what might be termed " conventional " morality .
In particular , he despised the concepts of democracy and human rights .
In Hubbard 's 1951 book , Science of Survival , he wrote about people on the lower end of the " tone scale " which he had devised - a list of human emotional states ranging from 0.0 ( death ) , to 40.0 ( godlike ) .
" There are only two answers for the handling of people from 2.0 down on the tone scale , neither one of which has anything to do with reasoning with them or listening to their justification of their acts .
The first is to raise them on the tone scale by un-enturbulating some of their theta by any one of the three valid processes .
The other is to dispose of them quietly and without sorrow .
Adders are safe bedmates compared to people on the lower bands of the tone scale .
Not all the beauty nor the handsomeness nor artificial social value nor property can atone for the vicious damage such people do to sane men and women .
The sudden and abrupt deletion of all individuals occupying the lower bands of the tone scale from the social order would result in an almost instant rise in the cultural tone and would interrupt the dwindling spiral into which any society may have entered .
It is not necessary to produce a world of clears in order to have a reasonable and worthwhile social order ; it is only necessary to delete those individuals who range from 2.0 down , either by processing them enough to get their tone level above the 2.0 line - a task which , indeed , is not very great , since the amount of processing in many cases might be under fifty hours , although it might also in others be in excess of two hundred - or simply quarantining them from the society .
A Venezuelan dictator once decided to stop leprosy .
He saw that most lepers in his country were also beggars .
By the simple expedient of collecting and destroying all the beggars in Venezuela an end was put to leprosy in that country . "
[ Hubbard , Science of Survival ( 1951 ) , p. 157 ]
This passage is worth quoting at length , as it illustrates a key point in Hubbard 's view of " ethics " : only " honest people " deserve rights .
It is a point reiterated in his 1967 book Introduction to Scientology Ethics : " As the society runs , prospers and lives solely through the efforts of social personalities , one must know them as they , not the anti-social , are the worthwhile people .
These are the people who must have rights and freedom . "
[ Hubbard , Introduction to Scientology Ethics ( 1967 ) ]
By " anti-social personalities " and " dishonest people " Hubbard meant those who commit " Suppressive Acts " by criticising Scientology .
Suppressive Acts , he wrote , are " clearly those covert or overt acts knowingly calculated to reduce or destroy the influence or activities of Scientology or prevent case gains or continued Scientology success and activity on the part of a Scientologist .
As persons or groups that would do such a thing act out of self - interest only to the detriment of all others , they cannot be granted the rights and beingness ordinarily accorded rational beings . "
[ Hubbard , Introduction to Scientology Ethics ( 1967 ) ]
In short , civil rights should only be granted to those who do not criticise Scientology .
This consideration is what lies behind Scientology 's infamous " Fair Game Law " .
Fair Game " A Suppressive Person or Group becomes ' Fair Game ' .
By Fair Game is meant , without right for self , possessions or position , and no Scientologist may be brought before a Committee of Evidence or punished for any action taken against a Suppressive Person or Group during the period that person or group is ' fair game ' . "
[ Hubbard , Introduction to Scientology Ethics ( 1967 ) ]
This is far from being a theoretical sanction and has been applied to critics and dissident Scientologists on many occasions .
Perhaps the clearest example is that of Amprinistics , a group founded in 1965 by a group of breakaway Scientologists .
Hubbard wrote a directive of breathtaking ruthlessness on how to deal with the dissidents : " They are each fair game , can be sued or harassed ... ( 2 ) Harass these persons in any possible way ... ( 4 ) Tear up any meeting held and get the names of those attending and issue SP orders on them and you 'll have lost a lot of rats . "
[ Hubbard , " Amprinistics " , HCO Executive Letter of 27 September 1965 ] " Fair Game " was supposedly cancelled in October 1968 , as follows : " The Practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease .
FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order .
It causes bad public relations .
This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP . "
[ Hubbard , " Cancellation of Fair Game " , HCO Policy Letter 21 October 1968 ]
As this letter makes clear , though , the only thing cancelled was the publication of Fair Game orders , not the policy itself .
This was confirmed in 1981 in the trial of Jane Kember ( Guardian World - Wide ) and Mo Budlong ( Deputy Guardian for Information World - Wide ) , the second of the two cases arising out of the Operation Snow White scandal : " Defendants , through one of their attorneys , have stated that the fair game policy continued in effect well after the indictment in this case and the conviction of the first nine co-defendants .
Defendants claim that the policy was abrogated by the Church 's Board of Directors in late July or early August , 1980 , only after the defendants ' personal attack on Judge Richey [ the presiding judge in the trial of Mary Sue Hubbard et al ] . "
[ Sentencing Memorandum of the United States of America , USA v Kember & Budlong , US District Court or the District of Columbia Criminal No. 78.401 ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) ]
Finally - and this is not mentioned at all by Scientology spokesmen - the policy letter supposedly cancelling Fair Game was itself cancelled on the orders of the current Scientology leadership , in HCO Policy Letter of 8 September 1983 , " Cancellation of Issues on Suppressive Acts and PTSness " ( the most recently published policy on Fair Game ) .
The policy has thus been restored in all its unpleasantness .
Suppressive Acts
At least as worrying as Scientology 's disdain for the concept of universal civil rights is the wide scope of " offences " which the organization regards as " Suppressive Acts " : Public disavowal of Scientology or Scientologists in good standing with Scientology organizations ; Public statements against Scientology or Scientologists but not to Committees of Evidence duly convened ; Proposing , advising or voting for legislation or ordinances , rules or laws directed toward the suppression of Scientology ; Pronouncing Scientologists guilty of the practice of standard Scientology ;
Testifying hostilely before state or public inquiries into Scientology to suppress it ; Reporting or threatening to report Scientology or Scientologists to civil authorities in an effort to suppress Scientology or Scientologists from practicing or receiving standard Scientology ; Bringing civil suit against any Scientology organization or Scientologist including the nonpayment of bills or failure to refund without first calling the matter to the attention of the Chairman at Saint Hill and receiving a reply ;
Demanding the return of any or all fees paid for standard training or processing actually received or received in part and still available but undelivered only because of departure of the person demanding ( the fees must be refunded but this policy letter applies ) ;
Writing anti-Scientology letters to the press or giving anti-Scientology or anti-Scientologist evidence to the press ;
Testifying as a hostile witness against Scientology in public ; Continued membership in a divergent group ; Continued adherence to a person or group pronounced a Suppressive Person or Group by HCO ; Failure to handle a person demonstrably guilty of Suppressive Acts ; Being at the hire of anti-Scientology groups or persons ;
Organizing a splinter group to use Scientology data or any part of it to distract people from standard Scientology ; Organizing splinter groups to diverge from Scientology practices , still calling it Scientology or calling it something else ; Calling meetings of staffs or field auditors or the public to deliver Scientology into the hands of unauthorized persons or ( persons ) who will suppress it or alter it or who have no reputation for following standard lines and procedures ;
Infiltrating a Scientology group or organization or staff to stir up discontent or protest at the instigation of hostile forces ;
First degree murder , arson , disintegration of persons or belongings not guilty of suppressive acts ; Mutiny ; Seeking to splinter off an area of Scientology and deny it properly constituted authority for personal profit , personal power or " to save the organization from the higher officers of Scientology " ;
Engaging in malicious rumor - mongering to destroy the authority or repute of higher officers or the leading names of Scientology or to " safeguard " a position ; Delivering up the person of a Scientologist without defense or protest to the demands of civil or criminal law ; Falsifying records that then imperil the liberty or safety of a Scientologist ; Knowingly giving false testimony to imperil a Scientologist ; Receiving money , favors or encouragement to suppress Scientology or Scientologists ;
Sexual or sexually perverted conduct contrary to the well - being or good state of mind of a Scientologist in good standing or under the charge of Scientology such as a student , a preclear , a ward or a patient ; Blackmail of Scientologists or Scientology organizations threatened or accomplished - in which case the crime being used for blackmail purposes becomes fully outside the reach of Ethics and is absolved by the fact of blackmail unless repeated .
[ Hubbard , Introduction to Scientology Ethics ( 1967 ) ]
The implications of this list of offences were spelled out by Lord Justice Stephenson in 1971 , in a case before the English Court of Appeal : " ' Suppressive acts ' include ' proposing , advising or voting for legislation or ordinances , rules or laws directed toward the Suppression of Scientology . . .'
So that if a voter in this country were to have the temerity to cast a vote in a Parliamentary election for a candidate who had indicated that he was minded to propose legislation which would ' suppress '
Scientology , that person would be guilty in the eyes of this organisation of having committed ' a suppressive act ' .
Again , ' testifying hostilely before state or public enquiries into Scientology to suppress it '; ' reporting or threatening to report Scientology or Scientologists to civil authorities in an effort to suppress Scientology or Scientologists from practising or receiving standard Scientology ' ; ' bringing civil suit against any Scientology organisation or Scientologist including the non-payment of bills or failure to refund without first calling the matter to the attention of the Chairman .
. .'; ' writing anti-Scientology letters to the press or giving anti-Scientology or anti-Scientologist evidence to the press ' ; ' testifying as a hostile witness against Scientology in public . '
If words mean anything , that meant that in the eyes of this organisation a person became ' a suppressive person ' - ' a suppressive person ' guilty of a suppressive act - if , however truthful , however much compelled by process of law , he should give evidence in a court of law hostile to the organisation of Scientology .
And this is the organisation which is seeking to have its documents treated as confidential by the order of the court .
It went on to include among ' suppressive acts ' : ' 1st degree murder , arson , disintegration of persons or belongings not guilty of suppressive acts ' .
There can be no doubt that the last five words relate to the preceding word ' persons ' .
What does that mean ?
That it was , in the eyes of this organisation in 1965 , ' a suppressive act ' to be guilty of ' first degree murder ' , provided that the person you murdered had not been guilty of suppressive acts .
The implication is obvious .
Yet another ' suppressive act ' is , ' delivering up the person of a Scientologist without defense or protest to the demands of civil or criminal law ' . "
[ Lord Justice Stephenson , Hubbard and another v Vosper and another , 17 - 19 Nov 1971 ]
The invalidity of criticism As Lord Justice Stephenson rightly observed , the extreme breadth of Hubbard 's code of " ethics " effectively outlaws a wide range of activities which are not only common rights but , where testifying to courts is concerned , are part of a citizen 's duties .
This is , however , completely consistent with Hubbard 's contempt for what he dismissively referred to as " wog morality " .
In particular , he refused to accept the validity of any criticism of Scientology : " Attackers are simply an anti-Scientology propaganda agency so far as we are concerned .
They have proven they want no facts and will only lie no matter what they discover .
So BANISH all ideas that any fair hearing is intended and start our attack with their first breath .
Never wait .
Never talk about us - only them .
Use their blood , sex , crime to get headlines .
Do n't use us .
I speak from 15 years of experience in this There has never yet been an attacker who was not reeking with crime .
All we had to do was look for it and murder would come out .
They fear our Meter .
They fear freedom .
They fear the way we are growing .
Why ?
Because they have too much to hide . "
[ Hubbard , " Attacks on Scientology " , HCO Policy Letter of 15 Feb 1966 ]
Another key article on Hubbard 's view of criticism was first published in Scientology 's Certainty magazine in 1968 ( and repeatedly republished thereafter , most recently in vol .
1 issue 2 ( Spring 1997 ) of the Office of Special Affairs ' internal newspaper , Winning ) : " Now get this as a technical fact , not a hopeful idea .
Every time we have investigated the background of a critic of Scientology we have found crimes for which that person or group could be imprisoned under existing law .
We do not find critics of Scientology who do not have criminal pasts .
Over and over we prove this .
Politician A stands up on his hind legs in a Parliament and brays for a condemnation of Scientology .
When we look him over we find crimes - embezzled funds , moral lapses .
a thirst for young boys - sordid stuff .
Wife B howls at her husband for attending a Scientology group .
We look her up and find she had a baby he did n't know about .
Two things operate here .
Criminals hate anything that helps anyone instinctively .
And just as instinctively a criminal fights anything that may disclose his past ...
We are slowly and carefully teaching the unholy a lesson .
It is as follows : " We are not a law enforcement agency .
BUT we will become interested in the crimes of people who seek to stop us .
If you oppose Scientology we promptly look and will find and expose your crimes .
If you leave us alone we will leave you alone " . "
[ Hubbard , " Critics of Scientology " , 1968 ]
This underlies the concept of " Dead Agenting " ; as a critic of Scientology invariably has a criminal past , all that is needed to discredit ( or " Dead Agent " ) the critic is to expose that past .
Or so a Scientologist would claim .
It is this belief which lies behind , for instance , Major Target # 1 of OSA 's " 558 Program " in Greece - " Priest Alevizopoulos investigated with his crimes exposed . "
However , Hubbard seems to have been conscious that publicising past indiscretions does not always work .
In 1960 , he wrote ( emphasis added ) : " If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization , always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace . "
[ Hubbard , " Dept of Govt Affairs " , HCO Policy Letter of 15 Oct 1960 ]
This can be a dangerous tactic , as it leaves Scientology wide open to libel writs ; it backfired disastrously in Canada in 1995 , where the Church was ordered to pay the highest libel damages in Canadian history after defaming Supreme Court judge Casey Hill .
Intakes of the mineral of at least 327 milligrams per day were found to reduce the risk of colon cancer by 52 per cent , compared to intakes less than 238 milligrams per day , while no benefits were observed in women , according to findings published in the Journal of Nutrition​ .
Being an epidemiological study , the findings do not prove causality , and additional studies , and particularly randomised trials , are needed to confirm the findings , said researchers from Japan ’s National Cancer Center in Tokyo .
Dietary sources of magnesium include green , leafy vegetables , meats , starches , grains and nuts , and milk .
Earlier dietary surveys show that a large portion of adults does not meet the RDA for magnesium ( 320 mg per day for women and 420 mg per day for men ) .
Magnesium has been heralded as an ingredient to watch for 2010 .
Indeed , a recent report from The Freedonia Group reported that global demand for nutrients and minerals will reach $ 12.6 bn by 2013 ; a 6.4 per cent increase on last year ’s level .
The report , World Nutraceutical Ingredients , highlighted magnesium as one of the minerals with fastest growth , along with calcium .
Other fact growing ingredients included soy proteins and isoflavones , psyllium and resistant maltodextrin fibres , omega - 3 fatty acids , probiotics , and carotenoids .
Study details ​
The Japanese researchers recruited 87,117 people with an average age of 57 and followed for about eight years .
Dietary intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire .
Average intakes of magnesium for men and women were 284 and 279 milligrams per day .
During the course of the study , 689 and 440 cases of colorectal cancer in men and women were documented .
Men with the highest average intakes of magnesium ( at least 327 mg/d ) were associated with a 52 per cent lower risk of colon , but not rectal , cancer , compared to men who consumed the lowest average intakes .
“ Increased intake of magnesium - rich foods is recommended if other studies , including randomized controlled trials , confirm our findings , ” ​ concluded the researchers .
Colorectal cancer accounts for nine per cent of new cancer cases every year worldwide .
The highest incidence rates are in the developed world , while Asia and Africa have the lowest incidence rates .
It remains one of the most curable cancers if diagnosis is made early .
Magnesium for male , but not female , hearts ​
A recent review of the cardiovascular benefits of magnesium in the Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners ​ , reported that increased intakes of the mineral may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in men , but the evidence is lacking for women .
And with the mineral being implicated in more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body , and toxicity issues being rare “ oral magnesium supplementation is recommended ” ​ , concluded the reviewers Tavia Mathers and Renea Beckstrand from Brigham Young University .

If there ’s a theme to my blog posts , it ’s something along the lines of Complexity is Killing Us .
The complexity of investment options is why you ’re afraid to put your money anywhere but inside an old sock .
Complexity is why the healthcare system in the United States is apparently unfixable .
Complexity is why scientists can’t convince a large segment of the public to believe in evolution or global warming .
Complexity is why your computer spends all morning begging you for updates instead of just doing what - the - frakk you want it to do .
And lately , I ’ve noticed that routine conversations have become too complicated .
In simpler times , I imagine conversations went like this :
Nobleman : “ Hey , peasant , would you like a potato ? ”
Peasant : “ Does it come with a beating ? ”
Nobleman : “ A brief one .
My arms are tired . ”
Peasant : “ Then yes , I would like a potato . ”
These days , there ’s no such thing as a simple conversation .
When you get a business call , it might start with a history of the industrial age , a complete explanation of some sort of technology , an exposition of budgetary limitations , a verbal sketch of the characters , a briefing on the politics of the situation , with a full accounting of the timing , the risks , the opportunity , so on .
Sometimes you want to know all of that stuff , and you have the time to listen .
Other times , you already have the information , or you do n’t have time to listen , or you ’re the wrong person .
That ’s when you have to go for the interrupt .
And interrupting is getting harder every year .
Thanks to complexity , and the impact it has on people ’s schedules , if you get a person ’s attention , you want to take advantage of it before your listener gets into an automobile accident , or has to run for another meeting , or his kid starts vomiting , or he simply can’t hold his bladder one more minute .
Your best strategy is to prevent the other person from talking – not a single peep – until you have said every last thing that you called to say .
I believe this is a modern phenomenon .
My guess is that in olden days it was customary to pause in your fire - hose - monologue now and then to let the other person ask for clarification , make a point , or just sigh .
Now any pause introduces an unacceptable risk of a failed phone call .
The interrupter ’s job is harder than ever .
I have experimented with ways to interrupt the fire - hose - monologue without seeming rude , but social conventions have n’t evolved fast enough to provide a polite solution .
So far , the best I have come up with is some variant on “ Can I interrupt you ? ”
But it always feels as if I just called someone a time - wasting windbag .
And I ’ve tried “ Whoa , whoa , ” but it feels as if I ’m scolding a horse .
I propose a new custom for interrupting when it ’s absolutely necessary .
Make a beeping sound like a garbage truck when it backs up .
That way it wo n’t seem so personal .
Try it and let me know how that works out for you .
MakeMKV lets you rip DVD ’s and Blu - Ray discs easily in Mac OS X ( or Windows or Linux for that matter ) , and during the beta , the program is free !

One Author You Ca n’t Read on your Kindle March 5 , 2010
Ever read an old novel , and realize how different its style is ?
Maybe it ’s a romantic novel from the 1800s , or a rambling post - modern narrative from Ernest Hemingway .
But around the 1940s , you get what I think of as “ The Great American Novelists ” .
That is , people who were consciously setting out to write glorious , high - stakes pageants about life itself .
I was a big fan of Thomas Wolfe , and finally got around to the watching a breathtaking production of a Thornton Wilder play .
But this all brings me back to the man I now think of as “ the lost novelist ” .
Because you ca n’t buy his books for the Kindle .
William Saroyan grew up in Central California , and later depicted all the joys and dramas of small - town life in “ The Human Comedy , ” a devastating , bittersweet look at one family during World War II .
He was always creating rich settings for touching stories about simple people facing an extraordinary crisis .
The jacket of one book calls him “ one of the permanently significant names in modern American fiction . ”
Today I went to a public library about three hours from where Saroyan grew up , and I pulled one of his books off the shelf .
It was published in 1951 , and I ’d never heard of it .
( It ’s called Rock Wagram – the story of a Fresno bartender who later in life struggles with the unexpected pitfalls of success . )
As I held the book in my hand , I thought : this is something you ca n’t do on a Kindle .
You ca n’t read this .
Every man is a good man in a bad world .
No man changes the world .
Every man himself changes from good to bad or from bad to good , back and forth , all his life , and then dies .
But no matter how or why or when a man changes , he remains a good man in a bad world , as he himself knows .
All his life a man fights death , and then at last loses the fight , always having known he would .
Loneliness is every man ’s portion , and failure .
The man who seeks to escape from loneliness is a lunatic .
The man who does not laugh at these things is a bore .
But the lunatic is a good man , and so is the fool , and so is the bore , as each of them knows .
Every man is innocent , and in the end a lonely lunatic , a lonely fool , or a lonely bore .
But there is meaning to a man .
There is meaning to the life every man lives .
Saroyan goes on to say it ’s “ a secret meaning . ”
And then the novel begins …
Poor Aoife Hickey and Claire Bergin , all (! ) they did was get good at a sport , train hard , get a good time and qualify for the Olympics Bobsleigh .
This must be doing their heads in .
After the Australians get their berth back and the Irish are recommended to also keep a place in the competition , now the Brazilians are unhappy that the Irish are being allowed to remain – seemingly the Irish were late to start competing in the first place – eh is this not more reason they should be allowed in as they have shown themselves to be better than Brazil and Australia ?
The Court of Arbitration of Sport will consider this matter tomorrow afternoon seemingly .
You ’ve probably heard that Apple recently announced the iPad .
The absence of Flash Player on the device seems to have awakened the HTML5 vs.
Flash debate .
Apparently , it ’s the final nail in the coffin for Flash .
Article Continues Below
The arguments run wide , strong , and legitimate on both sides .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs calls Flash Player buggy .
John Gruber of Daring Fireball says that Apple wants to maintain their own ecosystem — a formula Adobe ’s software does n’t easily fit into .
On the other end , Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch argues that Flash is a great content delivery vehicle .
Mike Chambers , Principal Product Manager for Flash platform developer relations at Adobe , expresses his concerns over closed platforms .
Interactive developer Grant Skinner reflects on the advantages of Flash .
However , the issue is larger than which one is better .
It ’s about preference and politics .
It ’s an arms race .
This is the Cold War of the Web .
Both the standards community and the Flash community are extremely good at sharing knowledge and supporting the people within their respective groups .
The relationship across communities , however , is n’t nearly as cordial .
Two things are happening : either the people within each camp stay to themselves , or one ignorantly hurls insults at the other .
As new technologies emerge , their following naturally starts small .
An effective rallying cry is to find — or create — a common enemy .
Huge strides such as Doug Bowman ’s Wired redesign , Dave Shea ’s CSS Zen Garden , and Jeffrey Zeldman ’s Designing With Web Standards had a significant influence , not only on the standards community , but on the entire web design industry .
They positioned standards as an alternative to Flash and table - based sites , not in conflict with them .
However , less enlightened followers wrongly interpreted these champions ’ examples as the first assault .
As Adobe Photoshop Principal Product Manager John Nack says , “ people want a certain ‘ killer ’ narrative . ”
The same thing is happening today .
Those pushing the HTML5 specification forward , such as Ian Hickson , Jeremy Keith , and the NYC gathering of geeks , are offering it as a new alternative with some major advantages over existing technologies .
Yet again , some have dubbed it the harbinger of doom for Flash .
The antagonistic nature of this debate is destroying the industry .
Designers and developers waste their time playing the “ one - up ” game , as opposed to collaborating .
Specialization has its advantages , but only as a subset of a larger whole .
Jamie Kosoy , my colleague and Associate Technical Director at Big Spaceship , says it well :
We do n’t have a single “ Flash developer ” at Big Spaceship .
In fact , we grimace at titles like that .
… We happen to be good at ( and love ) Flash , but we also happen to be good at ( and love ) a couple trillion different other technologies .
… We believe in strategic thinking and great design and pushing the limits .
Nowhere do we say it has to be done in technology X or programming language Y in order to be a successful and engaging project , and we do n’t believe the users who engage in the projects we put out there do either .
A line in the sand #section3
The problem with rallying behind a technology is that it traps us within the confines of its constraints .
We easily shift “ do n’t know ” and “ not sure ” into “ can’t ” and “ wo n’t . ”
Creativity is dictated by programming languages .
How sad .
Technologies are n’t inherently bad or good .
They ’re only appropriate or inappropriate for certain circumstances .
They ’re a means to an end , not solutions within themselves .
Each one is powerful in its own right to accomplish a certain goal .
The responsibility to use an appropriate technology lies with the one who made the choice .
Unfortunately , we ’ve misinterpreted irresponsible development as inadequate technology .
Case in point : Loading .
Flash provides powerful methods to track the download progress of every miniscule element .
And what have we chosen to do with it ?
We load everything up front and make the user suffer through minutes of a loading sequence , instead of loading assets progresssively as they ’re requested .
The Flash platform does not deserve the blame for bloated websites — the developers who made these poor decisions do .
Until we realize the foolishness of faith in technology , we ’ll see the same cycle repeated .
Doomed to repeat the past#section4
JavaScript has grown exceedingly popular of late , with much credit due to easy - to - use libraries like jQuery and the rediscovered usefulness of Ajax .
More and more , sites use JavaScript to provide great functionality for the people who visit .
More so , many experiments — like Scott Schiller ’s site and Browser Ball — push the boundaries of what JavaScript is typically used for .
The same is true for HTML5 , with amazing displays such as 9 Elements ’
HTML5 Canvas and Audio Experiment or Jilion ’s more practical SublimeVideo player .
These new executions bring interesting questions , many related to user experience .
If a feature needs a lot of code or graphics to power it , do we need to give the user progress indication ( read : preloader ) before they can use it ?
Once we use HTML5 video to interact with other videos , text , and graphics , will we need blending modes in HTML6 to create more seamless online environments ?
Will JavaScript developers realize the value that sound brings to an online experience and have to create ways to handle audio ?
Will we need a visual editor so that designers who do n’t code can take advantage of < canvas > ?
Will heavily scripted web applications become intense processor hogs ?
If this sounds familiar to you , it should .
These are the kinds of questions the Flash community explored throughout its early years .
Regardless of your opinion about Flash , it ’s difficult to deny the tremendous growth it has experienced .
From a simple drawing application , to a full - fledged scripting language , to powerful streaming video capabilities , and more , the Flash platform has expanded exponentially to respond to the needs of its users — the people who use it to create and the people who use the end result .
For better or worse , Flash has shaped the way people absorb online content .
We now have the advantage of learning from that journey , and we ’re already reaping the benefits .
For instance , any interaction model that modifies the full page refresh breaks the browser ’s back button functionality .
While it took eight years from Flash ’s inception to birth a solution such as SWFAddress , JavaScript developers have the benefit of hindsight and were able to implement a similar solution for JavaScript - based applications much faster .
I ’ll go so far as to assert that most technological advances are born from something that would be good for people using it .
When we put stock in technology and try to be creative for creativity ’s sake , we almost always repeat our mistakes .
When we try and solve problems instead , we force ourselves to care .
Innovation is a natural side effect .
Worth fighting for #section5
But we take pride in our technologies .
If I ’m not striving for my guru ranking in a particular programming language or design style , then what really matters ?
I ’ve hinted at it throughout the whole article , but let me make it painfully obvious .
People .
People matter .
Not users , but people .
A user is a faceless entity , robotically performing tasks that we test and optimize .
A person lives , laughs , cries , loves , hates — and uses the sites and applications we make .
My mom .
Your five - year - old .
His grandfather .
Her best friend .
Their science class .
They do n’t tell us how much they appreciate our progressive enhancement or how we use the drawing API or our impeccable use of attribute selectors .
They only say that a website was confusing or hard to read or fun to play with .
That ’s the real motivation for excellence : bringing ease , joy , and fun to the people around us .
We should be getting to the point where people can’t tell how a site was built .
I love coming across a site where how it was made is not immediately apparent to me .
That ’s how it should be : Create something excellent where the technology is transparent , and allow only the curious to look under the hood to actually see what ’s going on .
JavaScript , Flash , HTML5 , tables , Shockwave , Unity — no one cares when people using it can do what they ’re supposed to .
When something is broken — whether it ’s functionality or the user experience — that ’s when you ’ll hear whining about platforms .
Create a great experience for people and you ’ll receive due praise , regardless of the technology .
We want you #section6
The bickering is getting old .
Here ’s what we can do .
Start supporting initiatives instead of bashing them .
Do you think Flash sucks ?
Do n’t write a “ Dear Adobe ” rant on your blog ; contact the Adobe team directly and tell them what you think could be improved .
Think HTML5 is a joke ?
Get involved with the working group to make it better .
Got a problem with how a certain site is built ?

Key Figure in Bush ’s Military Commissions Set for Obama Job

A key behind - the - scenes architect of the Bush administration ’s first version of the military commissions for terrorism suspects — which the Supreme Court found to unconstitutionally restrict the legal rights of detainees — will take a central Pentagon position dealing with detainee policy for the Obama administration .
William Lietzau , a Marine colonel who currently serves as deputy legal counsel to the National Security Council , is poised to become the Pentagon ’s new deputy assistant secretary for detainee affairs in the next several weeks .
Lietzau , an international law expert described even by his critics as a brilliant and energetic attorney , previously served as a special adviser to Jim Haynes , the top Pentagon lawyer during Donald H. Rumsfeld ’s tenure , when Rumsfeld and Haynes codified torture and indefinite detention as hallmarks of Bush - era terrorism policy .
The position , which is not subject to Senate confirmation , came open late last year , after Phil Carter , the previous deputy assistant secretary for detainee affairs and a favorite of civil libertarians , abruptly resigned .
[ Security 1 ]
As the next deputy assistant secretary , Lietzau will be at the center of the Obama administration ’s decisions about trying the remaining Guantanamo detainees in reformed military commissions or in federal courts .
He will also be central to the construction of a post - Guantanamo terrorism - detention policy in an administration that claims to be more committed to the rule of law than its predecessor .
Lietzau is said to have gained the confidence of senior administration officials over the past year , particularly as he helped revise the military commissions to include greater process protections for defendants — even though civil libertarian groups still consider those rules to be unfair .
Two senior military lawyers who fought with Haynes over military commissions and interrogations in the Bush administration said they were surprised to hear of Lietzau ’s impending appointment to the Obama Pentagon .
Retired Rear Adm. Don Guter , who served as the Navy ’s Judge Advocate General from 2000 to 2002 , described Lietzau as a close Haynes confidante but not an outspokenly opinionated figure .
“ If he disagreed with Jim Haynes you ’d never know about it , ” Guter said .
“ Because of his close association with Haynes I ’d be more comfortable if I saw something public [ indicating ] he ’d made a break with those policies . ”
Retired Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Romig also described Lietzau as closely tied to Haynes , whose role in instituting extreme interrogations at Guantanamo Bay against the wishes of military lawyers cost him Senate confirmation for a federal judgeship .
Romig , the Army ’s Judge Advocate General during Bush ’s first term , said that although he did not know specifically what positions Lietzau took on detainee interrogations or if Haynes even consulted him on the issue , “ at that time , he was certainly in the bosom of the administration that was running interrogation programs that at the very least were quite troubling , and in many minds were a violation of the laws of war and the Geneva Conventions . ”
Lietzau ’s expertise in international law — he was part of the Clinton administration ’s delegation to the 1998 Rome conference that wrote the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court — should have allowed him to know “ what was right and wrong with [ Bush 's ] interrogation policies , ” Romig said .
While Lietzau was close to Haynes , he also became close to retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones , now Obama ’s national security adviser .
The two officers met in Europe a few years after Lietzau had left the commissions , when Jones commanded U.S. military forces on the continent and Lietzau was his staff judge advocate .
Lietzau joined the National Security Council last spring at Jones ’ request .
Lietzau has many advocates in the legal and policy communities .
John Bellinger , the former National Security Council and State Department legal adviser during the Bush administration , sparred frequently over detainee treatment with Haynes and David Addington , Dick Cheney ’s attorney , who took far more extreme positions .
But Bellinger , now a partner with the law firm of Arnold & Porter , considered Lietzau a first - rate appointee .
“ I think Lietzau is an excellent choice who knows the issues and is pragmatic and non-ideological , ” he said .
“ I have never seen him to approach terrorism issues or international justice issues in an ideological way .
Similarly , Eugene Fidell , a Yale Law professor and president of the National Institute of Military Justice , called Lietzau ’s appointment “ creative , ” despite any substantive policy disagreements they had .
“ The last thing I want is someone to come into the job without the respect of the military bench and bar , which he would have , ” Fidell said , “ and having to start from scratch in understanding the legal environment . ”
Rosa Brooks , a Pentagon policy official who criticized the military commissions during the Bush years , added that while she could n’t confirm Lietzau ’s appointment , “ I am a fan of Bill Lietzau ’s .
He ’s smart , an honest broker , and has both intellectual and moral integrity . ”
Lietzau was the first prosecutor for the military commissions established in 2001 — an official Pentagon release called him “ instrumental ” to the military commissions ’ “ preparations ” — and served in that role until 2003 .
Yet during that time , the commissions did not bring charges against a single detainee , a fact that raised eyebrows among his colleagues .
“ I have to believe in his position Lietzau was being used by Jim Haynes as a sounding board or adviser on all international law issues , ” Romig said , “ because he was not doing much as chief prosecutor .
In a valedictory May 2003 press briefing , Lietzau described his role as “ really the process portion of setting up military commissions . ”
That process , established by Rumsfeld , his deputy Paul Wolfowitz and Haynes , departed significantly from the military ’s courts - martial system , restricting a defendant ’s right to a public trial and allowing for hearsay to be admissible , although Lietzau pushed for defendants to retain the presumption of innocence .
At the briefing , a reporter asked Lietzau if the commissions provided a defendant with a defense comparable to the normal military justice system , and he replied that the commission ’s rules “ were drafted to accommodate that kind of flexibility that would be needed . ”
But five years after their creation , a 5 - 4 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that the commissions were unconstitutional , improperly established by the administration and providing defendants with insufficient due process rights .
In 2006 , Congress passed a law authorizing a new version of the commissions although the Supreme Court in 2008 found problems with the process rights of the new commissions as well .
One senator who voted against the 2006 Military Commissions Act was Barack Obama .
Last May at the National Archives , in one of Obama ’s most important national security speeches as president , Obama criticized “ the flawed commissions of the last seven years ” and said his embrace of a reformed version of the commissions would bring them “ in line with the rule of law . ”
Some in the administration believe Lietzau is , however ironically , the man for the job .
A senior administration official who would not speak on the record because Lietzau ’s appointment has not been announced said that the colonel “ believes the rule of law is a fundamental part of our effort in the fight against al - Qaeda ” and that Lietzau ’s long experience with both the military commissions and international law provides the administration with “ value added as we work with Congress ” on a “ durable ” legal infrastructure for terrorism detainees .
At times Lietzau has expressed surprise about the Bush administration ’s terrorism decisions .
During a talk he gave at Harvard shortly after 9/11 , he said he doubted that the administration would seek to try anyone in a military commission ; months later he was helping design them .
And in an article for a book on terrorism and international law published in 2002 , Lietzau averred that President Bush ’s assurance that the military treat detainees in the “ spirit ” of Geneva Conventions ensured that detainees “ will continue to be treated humanely . ”
Over the next several years , dozens and perhaps hundreds of people detained by the U.S. in Guantanamo , Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere were tortured — activities President Obama expressly forbid during his first week in office by issuing an executive order restricting interrogation techniques to those listed in the Army ’s field manual .
Lietzau was a deputy to Haynes during the winter of 2002 and spring of 2003 , when Haynes presided over an internal Pentagon debate resulting in the modified adoption for Guantanamo of “ enhanced interrogation ” techniques authorized for the CIA to use on senior - level al - Qaeda detainees .
A Senate Armed Services Committee investigation from 2008 determined that Haynes was a powerful bureaucratic force pressing for harsher detainee treatment .
A former colleague in Haynes ’ office , Richard Shiffrin , told the committee that Lietzau was present at a key 2002 meeting in which participants expressed “ some frustration with the quantity and quality of information being obtained ” at Guantanamo , although Shiffrin did not attribute any substantive position to Lietzau .
And no source for this piece had knowledge of Lietzau having anything to do with torture .
It is unclear what exactly Lietzau ’s appointment signifies in terms of concrete policy decisions or shifts .
An email to Defense Secretary Gates ’ spokesman , Geoff Morrell , went unreturned .
But Bellinger predicted Lietzau would “ adopt a balanced approach between the security needs of the country and military and the need to address worldwide concerns that we do not have an appropriate legal framework or legal policies . ”
The senior administration official said Lietzau was “ bound and determined to make sure , whether it ’s in three years or seven , when he walks away from this job , there is a durable legal infrastructure ” to handle terrorism detainees justly .
Both Guter and Romig , the former senior military JAGs who clashed with Lietzau ’s old boss , Haynes , independently described Lietzau as intellectually “ flexible ” and willing to faithfully implement the policies of his bosses .
“ The guy is smart , so he can figure out what the Supreme Court has said ” about the due process rights to which detainees are entitled , but “ it troubles me the guy can go from one end of spectrum to the other , arguably , ” Romig said .
“ It ’s very curious they would take somebody to run [ policy on ] detainees who was in the position he was in seven or eight years ago . ”
Soviet Union Lunar Sample Return Missions

The Soviet Union successfully executed three robotic sample return missions as part of the Cold War competition with the United States .
The first mission , Luna 16 , returned a small sample ( 101 grams ) from Mare Fecunditatis in September of 1970 , a time between the US Apollo 12 and 14 manned landings .
A year and half later ( February 1972 ) Luna 20 returned 55 grams of soil from the Apollonius highlands region .
Luna 16 and 20 were very similar in design and sampling method .
A drill at the end of the sampling arm collected soil from a few tens of cm below the surface .
The arm then placed the sample into the return capsule on top of the vehicle .
The distinctive shadow seen in the LROC image of Luna 20 is most likely that of the sampling arm .
The Luna 20 sample contained minerals similar to those sampled by the US Apollo 16 astronauts two months later from the Cayley plains ( 8°58 " S , 15°30 " E ) .
In October of 1974 Luna 23 set down on Mare Crisium , however technical difficulties prevented it from successfully acquiring a sample .
Undeterred , the Soviets tried again in August of 1976 , this time with much better luck .
Luna 24 was designed to auger over 2 meters into the lunar soil thus collecting a better section and a larger sample , 170 grams .
The positions of Luna 23 and 24 were not well constrained and are reported as within several hundred meters of each other .
From the new NAC images we can accurately measure the distance between the two landers to be about 2400 meters .
However the absolute position of the landers is only know to about 500 meters accuracy .
As the LRO mission ephemeris improves , the Luna absolute positions should be known to better than 100 meters .
Scroll around in a mosaic of two NAC high Sun images ( M111185087L , R ) and find Luna 23 and Luna 24 .
Look for a few very bright pixels near Luna 24 ; they may be small pieces of material blown off the descent stage as the ascent staged blasted off towards Earth .
The successful Soviet Luna sample return missions returned small , but important , samples from three locations on the Moon .
In this new era of lunar exploration several countries plan to soft land on the Moon in the near future , the first soft - landed spacecraft since Luna 24 .
India and Russia plan to launch a lander and rover called Chandrayaan 2 in 2013 .
The Chinese Chang'e lunar exploration program also plans a soft landing in 2013 .
I ’ve grown fascinated over the years with various efforts by Internet service providers to crack down on the menace from botnets , large groupings of hacked PCs that computer criminals remotely control for a variety of purposes , from spamming to hosting malicious software and attacking others online .
Indeed , the botnet problem has become such a global menace that entire countries are now developing anti-botnet programs in collaboration with domestic ISPs .
One of the more unique and long - running examples of this is Japan ’s “ Cyber Clean Center , ” ( referred to hereafter as CCC ) a little - known effort by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center ( JP - CERT ) and a collection of 76 Japanese ISPs covering 90 percent of the nation ’s Internet users .
Participating ISPs that have customers with botted PCs may send those users an e-mail — and in some cases a letter via postal mail — instructing them to visit the CCC ’s Web site , and download and run a cleanup tool developed by the JP - CERT in coordination with Trend Micro , the dominant anti-virus and computer security firm in Japan .
Relatively few of the thousands of U.S. - based ISPs have such programs in place , or if they do then not many have been willing to discuss them publicly .
Some notable exceptions are Cox , Comcast ( which is rolling out a trial bot infection notification system ) , and Qwest ( if I missed any other biggies , readers please set me straight ) .
It ’s unfortunate that such programs are n’t more widely emulated , because a majority of the world ’s bot problem begins and ends here in the United States .
According to a recent report ( .pdf ) by McAfee , the United States is home to the second largest pool of botted PCs — 2nd only to China — and is the world ’s biggest exporter of junk e-mail .
Obviously , as with most customer notification schemes , the primary challenge is messaging the user in a way that is not easily spoofed by criminals to convince people to download “ disinfection tools ” that actually infect their systems .
But at any rate , I thought the Japanese example was interesting as a regional approach , and so over the past several months have engaged the CCC folks in a Q&A via e-mail .
Below are some of the questions I asked and answers I received about the CCC program .
BK : About how many customers has the CCC reached over the years ?
CCC : Between Nov. 2009 and its inception in Dec. 2006 , Japan ’s CCC has helped more than a million customers remove bot infections from their PCs .
BK : Is this a manual or automated process ?
CCC : The detection of bots , collection , analysis and alerting of affected users is mostly automated .
BK : Is there a direct cost to ISPs for participating ?
Is it compulsory in any way ?
CCC : Involvement is optional for ISPs , but they get the benefit of a system they can provide free of charge to their customers to deal with bot infections .
BK : What is the policy among participating ISPs as to how they deal with customers whose systems are botted ?
How long do they have to be on the list of problem PCs to get a notice ?
CCC : It ’s generally up to the ISP on how to deal with infected users .
ISPs receive infection notices from the CCC project , but the ISP will follow their own procedures to contact the user .
So , the exact means they use to deal with infected customers and the timing is the ISP ’s decision .
BK : Is that notice sent via e-mail , or snail mail ?
Both ?
CCC : On the whole , notices are sent via email , but some ISPs are trying to improve on the response rate by using both email and snail mail .
Here ’s an example of one type of page that notified users might be asked to visit .
BK : Do you think there particular aspects about the Japanese culture that might be a factor in helping this program succeed , such as societal mores that may not be present in other cultures ?
CCC : That ’s an interesting question .
It ’s hard to be sure whether or not there are particular cultural traits responsible for the CCC project ’s success , though we expected that we might run into some user opposition at the beginning .
For example , users asking “ Why are they trying to spy on my computer ? ” , or that infection notices would be interpreted as trying to interfere too much .
Even though we ’d identified this as a risk , the replies we received expressed thanks , with very little negative feedback .
Perhaps this kind of acceptance when an outsider points something out is partly a trait of typical Japanese personalities .
One other difference might be that overseas , anti-bot activities involve law enforcement agencies trying to catch criminals or perhaps focusing on making life difficult for those infected .
However , the CCC does n’t have significant police co-operation .
We ’re just contacting people who get infected , as well as raising awareness of the problem .
Perhaps this kind of approach is also particularly Japanese .
BK : I notice that the rate of downloading disinfection tools by alerted users is 30 percent ( cumulative ) .
So that means that for every 10 people notified about a bot on their system , 3 people will respond and download available removal tools ?
Or could it be that removal tools just are n’t available for the bot that ’s on their system ?
CCC : From the users who receive the infection reports , around 40 % access the CCC website and about 30 % download the CCC Cleaner removal tool .
In other words , for every 10 people , 4 read the mail and visit the web site .
By reading the guide on the CCC Cleaner web site , users can get to grips with the download process .
So in answer to your first question , four out of ten people will visit the site , and three out of ten people will download CCC Cleaner .
Additionally , the notifications are for users who are already known to be infected with a bot which can be disinfected .
Therefore , there ’s no chance that the removal tool will be completely useless for a particular user receiving an email .
BK : Does the number of alerts sent pretty closely track the number of bot infections detected ?
Or are there other factors that trigger when a customer whose machine shows signs of being botted gets notified ?
CCC : When an infected user is detected , we send a notification .
If the CCC project detects another bot infection after the first notification , another one will be sent .

The new esa-p Supplier Portal will open to suppliers on Monday March 22nd at 14:00 .
ESA has delayed this opening so as to minimise as far as possible potential problems for suppliers as they begin to adopt the system .
Initial system start - up will bring typical issues and ESA is counting on the cooperation of its suppliers to assist it in rapidly communicating any problems encountered and thereby helping us to ensure that the new system runs smoothly as early as possible .
In the event that suppliers should be prevented from invoicing in the coming weeks , due to eventual technical reasons , they will be able to do so through an off - system procedure by following the instructions available in the esa-p Supplier Portal .
ESA has strengthened its support teams so as to respond to the needs of suppliers when the supplier portal goes live .
ESA is taking every possible step to ensure smooth operation of the system as quickly as possible .
ESA counts very much on your understanding and collaboration to make esa-p a success for all of us and contribute to further improved supplier - interaction with ESA .
From a press release provided by Centre national de la recherche scientifique in Paris , France :
Improved estimate of glacier decline in Alaska .
Glaciologists at the Laboratory for Space Studies in Geophysics and Oceanography ( LEGOS – CNRS / CNES / IRD / Université Toulouse 3 ) and their US and Canadian colleagues ( 1 ) have shown that previous studies have largely overestimated mass loss from Alaskan glaciers over the past 40 years .
Recent data from the SPOT 5 and ASTER satellites have enabled researchers to extensively map mass loss in these glaciers , which contributed 0.12 mm / year to sea - level rise between 1962 and 2006 , rather than 0.17 mm / year as previously estimated .
Mountain glaciers cover between 500 000 and 600 000 km2 of the Earth ’s surface ( around the size of France ) , which is little compared to the area of the Greenland ( 1.6 million km2 ) and Antarctic ( 12.3 million km2 ) ice sheets .
Despite their small size , mountain glaciers have played a major role in recent sea - level rise due to their rapid melting in response to global climate warming .
Of all the ice - covered regions of the planet , ice loss has been the greatest in Alaska and northwestern Canada , where glaciers cover 90 000 km2 .
Results from the LEGOS glaciologists and their US and Canadian colleagues , published in the February issue of Nature Geoscience , lead them to conclude that these glaciers have contributed 0.12 mm / year to sea - level rise over the period 1962 - 2006 , rather than 0.17 mm / year as previously estimated by a team at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska ( Fairbanks ) .
The new estimate was obtained by comparing recent topographies , derived from Spot 5 - HRS ( SPIRIT project ( 2 ) funded by CNES ) and ASTER ( GLIMS / NASA project ) , with maps from the 1950 - 60s , which enabled loss from three quarters of the Alaskan glaciers to be measured .
How did the team from the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska estimate that the contribution of these glaciers to sea - level rise was 0.17 mm / year ?
In 1995 , and then again in 2001 , the researchers used an airborne laser to measure the surface elevation of 67 glaciers along longitudinal profiles .
These elevations were then compared with those mapped in the 1950s and 1960s .
From this , the researchers inferred elevation changes and then extrapolated this to other glaciers .
Their results , published in Science ( 3 ) , pointed to a major contribution to sea - level rise for the 1950 - 1995 period ( 0.14 mm / year sea- level rise ) , which then doubled in the recent period ( after 1995 ) .
Why did they overestimate ice loss from these glaciers by 50 % ?
The impact of rock debris that covers certain glacier tongues ( 4 ) and protects them from solar radiation ( and thus from melting ) was not taken into account in the previous work .
Moreover , their sampling was limited to longitudinal profiles along the center of a few glaciers , which geometrically led to overestimation of ice loss .
This new study confirms that the thinning of Alaskan glaciers is very uneven , and shows that it is difficult to sample such complex spatial variability on the basis of a few field measurements or altimetry profiles .
Thanks to their regional coverage , satellite data make it possible to improve observations of glacial response to climate change and to specify the contribution of glaciers to sea - level rise .
Ice loss from Alaskan glaciers since1962 is evidently smaller than previously thought .
However , thinning ( sometimes over 10 m / year , as in the Columbia glacier ) and glacial retreat remain considerable .
Moreover , the spectacular acceleration in mass loss since the mid 1990s , corresponding to a contribution of 0.25 to 0.30 mm / year to sea - level rise , is not in question and proves to be a worrying indication of future sea - level rise .

With Greece on the brink of bankruptcy and Portugal in a bind , Germany has joined France in calling for a new system to rescue indebted nations in the euro zone - a European Monetary Fund , or EMF .
But neither Germany nor France nor any of other members in the euro zone have agreed on who should contribute to such a scheme and how much they should pay .
Responding to growing pressure to find a fix for Greece , German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has thrown his support behind the idea of creating a sweeping new initiative that would have similar powers to those of the International Monetary Fund , known by its acronym IMF , but would not compete with the Washington - based organization .
In an interview published on Sunday in the Welt am Sonntag weekly newspaper , Schaeuble said the euro zone countries should solve their problems through their own efforts and that he would " present proposals soon " for a new institution .
' Need to look ahead and get started now '
But could such a fund save Greece from defaulting on its debt ?
At this point , policy experts say , it would take too long to create such a fund , but they urge governments to get the ball rolling , nevertheless .
" The euro countries need to look ahead and get started now , " according to Cinzia Alcidi , a research fellow with the Centre for European Policy Studies .
" Portugal 's situation is n't very different from Greece 's , and there are other countries with problems . "
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaueble wants Europe to fix its own problems
Rescue efforts , however , are complicated by European Union treaties that prevent existing EU institutions from bailing out a struggling country outright .
Alcidi maintains that a monetary fund for euro countries is the answer and that German support for it is absolutely essential .
" Germany will have the first and last word , " she said .
" If it says the idea is feasible , the other euro zone nations will follow .
That 's our impression . "
The financial community appears receptive to a new regional financing mechanism , even though plenty of questions remain unanswered .
" I think the EMF is a very good idea and I 've been calling for it for some time , " said Carsten Brzeski , senior economist at the ING Group .
" But a key question is who is going to pay for it . "
German support is seen as essential for creating the EMF
One option , according to Brzeski , is to have all euro countries contribute an amount to a fund based on a percentage of their Gross National Production .
The problem with that option , he said , is that Germany , with Europe 's largest economy , would be the largest contributor .
" So that idea would certainly be a hard sale to German taxpayers , " he said .
Discourage governments from running up excessive debt
Another option , said Brzeski , is to have the offenders pay a percentage of their GNP , say , 0.1 percent according to benchmark criteria .
If necessary , they could then give investors new debt backed by the EMF in place of the old bonds .
Brzeski's suggestion for a fund is similar to one put forward by the Centre for European Policy Studies .
Under the center 's proposal , governments would pay into the fund based on how much their budget deficits exceeded the annual ceiling of 3 percent of Gross Domestic Production ( GDP ) and how much their total government debt exceeded the 60 percent GDP limit .
The payments , the center argues , would discourage governments from running up excessive debt and deficits .
Problems in the euro zone have been simmering for some time , according to Brzeski .
" Now we have a crisis and need to act , " he said , arguing in favor of creating the EMF .

Democrats on Wednesday made financial reform their new top domestic priority , vowing to enact an overhaul of Wall Street this year and warning opponents not to stand in the way .

Republicans who voted unanimously against healthcare reform will suffer the political consequences using the same strategy on Wall Street reform , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) told The Hill on Wednesday .
“ My hope is that they ’ll want to talk about solutions , ” Dodd said .
“ Or they can just sit there and explain to people why they want to side with the largest financial institutions ...
If they want to reject this bill for whatever false reasons they come up with , they ’ll have to bear the responsibility of having it happen again when they were given a chance to correct it .
“ So we ’ll see how they respond , and I hope they do n’t make the same mistake they made on healthcare , ” Dodd concluded .
Obama held a White House meeting Wednesday with Dodd and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , as top Treasury Department officials this week fanned out across Washington to stump for reforms .
Neal Wolin , deputy Treasury secretary , went to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s summit on the financial industry and repeatedly slammed the association for lobbying against administration - backed reforms .
“ Despite the urgent and undeniable need for reform , the Chamber of Commerce has launched a $ 3 million advertising campaign against it , ” Wolin said Wednesday .
“ That campaign is not designed to improve the House and Senate bills .
It is designed to defeat them .
It is designed to delay reform until the memory of the crisis fades and the political will for change dies out . ”
Bruce Josten , the Chamber ’s senior lobbyist , described Wolin ’s speech as “ political grandstanding ” and insisted the business lobby is committed to a bipartisan effort .
Republicans recognize Democrats have new momentum to push financial legislation through Congress and expressed concern about having limited power to shape or , if necessary , defeat it .

“ I think it ’s going to be very , very difficult to get 41 members to hold , especially if many of the provisions in this bill address concerns that everyday people on Main Street have , ” Corker said .
The new energy on financial legislation comes roughly 18 months after financial markets melted down , spawning the worst crisis since the Great Depression .
Democrats are pushing a package of reforms aimed at ending the notion that some companies are “ too big to fail , ” bolstering consumer protections and regulating the multi-trillion - dollar derivatives market , among other provisions .

“ I do n’t know that anybody ’s made a decision to oppose it .
We do n’t have a bill to react to yet , other than the one in committee , ” McConnell told The Hill .
“ The discussions are going to continue , and I hope we can get a bipartisan agreement .
Nobody ’s in favor of allowing ‘ too big to fail ’ to occur again . ”
The package of policies has been hotly debated in Washington , New York and financial centers around the world .
And even if the issue is a lower priority for voters than the broader state of healthcare or the economy , recent polls suggest strong support for new regulations .
A February Pew poll showed 59 percent of Americans believe it is a good idea to have stricter regulations on financial companies .
Nearly 80 percent of Democrats support a crackdown , and almost an equal number of Republicans say it is a good idea , ( 45 percent ) as believe it is a bad idea ( 48 percent . )
Democrats realize that financial regulation and clamping down on big banks , Wall Street speculation and lavish bonuses makes good politics , and say they wo n’t be reluctant to apply pressure either to ensure a successful , bipartisan vote .
“ They ’d better consider at least the impact of voting with the big banks at this point , ” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin Richard ( Dick ) Joseph DurbinComey defends FBI Russia probe from GOP criticism Comey on Trump finances : Debt can make officials ' vulnerable to coercion by an adversary ' Meeting Trump Supreme Court pick a bridge too far for some Democrats MORE ( D - Ill. ) , referring to Republicans .
“ Most people believe the big banks have not been fair to the people of this country , and they ’ve taken a lot of tax money . ”
When the House passed its financial overhaul bill in December with unanimous Republican opposition , Democrats responded that they would look to make the vote a campaign issue in the midterm election .
Bryon Allen , Republican pollster at Wilson Research Strategies , said there is n’t any evidence yet that financial regulatory reform is a key issue in the 2010 elections .
But Republicans are wary about Democratic messages on the issue .
“ I do n’t think anybody in Republican politics is looking for this to be the headline story , ” Allen said .
Corker said he recognized six months ago that the politics of financial reform are simply different from healthcare .
“ You do n’t pull the game - book out for healthcare and apply it to financial reform , ” said Corker .
Corker said it was a “ strategic mistake ” to allow the overhaul package to pass the Senate Banking Committee on Monday evening on a party - line vote .
The markup took only 21 minutes , after Republicans decided to pull hundreds of amendments .
Democrats and Republicans said they are still pursuing bipartisan negotiations and were hopeful that they could reach a consensus package of reforms .
Last year , the Banking panel passed a major credit card bill on a mostly party - line vote , but bipartisan negotiations continued and the Senate approved the final bill on a 90 - 5 vote .
But Corker is concerned that it will be more difficult to make changes to the bill on the Senate floor or later in the process .
Already on Wednesday , Democrats said they were looking at how to reconcile the House and Senate bills .
“ Barney and I are going to work very closely together in the coming days to try and harmonize , where we can , our proposals , so to minimize a conference when it occurs , if necessary , ” Dodd said in front of the White House .

Is he trustworthy ?
Forget what the songs say about his kiss , and check out the breadth of his cheekbones .
Men with wider faces are not only perceived as untrustworthy , they may deserve the reputation , according to a new study published in the journal Psychological Science .
In a computerized game , broad - faced men were more likely to exploit others for personal monetary gain , explained lead researcher Michael Stirrat of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
And other players expected this behavior .
The study did not address female trustworthiness .
A growing body of science is showing that facial configuration — placement of the eyes , width of the cheekbones and so on — provides clues to a person 's personality , including likelihood to be extroverted , conscientious and , now , trustworthy .
While this analysis is not unfailing , it works slightly more often than not .
The trust game
During the study , a participant was shown an expressionless photo of a fellow player 's face at the start of each game .
The participant then had to decide whether to take an immediate pay - off or entrust the money to the person in the snapshot — who , in turn , could decide to either , cooperate and help both players make more money , or take the cash and run .
Participants were more likely to entrust money to people with narrower faces , a characteristic measured by dividing the face width by the distance between the upper lip and upper eyelid .
Photos of all participants were analyzed when the games were completed , allowing researchers to see a correlation between slim faces and actual trustworthy behavior .
In another experiment using digitally manipulated photographs , people chose between wide and narrow versions of the same face .
Out of 285 participants , 165 said the narrower faces looked more worthy of trust .
" The effect is not huge , but there is a significant bias for trusting narrow male faces , " Stirrat said .
" And we are biased in the right direction . "
Testosterone and wider faces
While wide - faced men were more exploitive in this study 's context , " it is difficult to generalize to real life , " Stirrat said .
Other experiments have shown that men with wider faces tend to be more aggressive — broad - faced hockey players spend more time in the penalty box , for example — and are perhaps more dominant .
They are also more likely to use aggression for altruistic means by , say , attempting to punish people who steal or break other societal rules .
Here 's how the researchers figure the link between facial width and trustworthiness might work :
During male adolescence , a surge in testosterone prompts bone growth not only in the spine and limbs , but also in the face .
Therefore , a wide face may be a sign of an overall bigger man , one who can get away with being more aggressive and less cooperative .
Slighter men might act in a more civilized , and trustworthy , way — out of necessity .
Narrowness is only one aspect of an honest face .
We are also more likely to judge someone as trustworthy — rightly or wrongly — if they have faces that are attractive , babyish , similar in appearance to our own kin , or exhibit good health .
It makes good evolutionary sense for people to trust their own families and those who exhibit superior genes ; even if they are let down , the survival of their own genes is maximized .
In most cases , it pays to be trusting , Stirrat said , because people who feel trusted are more likely to behave in a trustworthy way .
PAULS VALLEY — Nathanael Christian claimed he broke into churches because his " family has always been very religious , ” police said .
A pastor at one of the churches said maybe he chose churches because he knows they ’re forgiving .
Christian , 21 , of Pauls Valley , is charged in Garvin County District Court with four counts of second - degree burglary .
He is accused of breaking into four area churches — on at least eight occasions — to use their Internet to access pornography .
In one break - in , $ 300 in calls to telephone sex services were made .
Laptops were stolen in two of the burglaries , police reported .
Pauls Valley police Detective Derrick Jolley said authorities were curious why the burglar targeted churches but never got a full explanation .
" ( Christian ) just said ‘ my family has always been very religious ’ with a look on his face that indicated it made sense to him , ” Jolley said .
No specific religion was targeted .
The churches burglarized were Trinity Baptist Church , First Assembly of God , St. Catherine Catholic Church and First Church of God.
Christian had never attended any of those churches , police said .
The Rev. Gary Underwood , associate pastor at First Church of God , said the burglar may have been sneaking in unnoticed during church outreach meetings in the evenings and staying after the doors were locked .
Underwood said Christian was further implicated in connection with the break - in by a woman who claims Christian was using the church phone to call her during the early morning hours .
" He obviously has an issue with pornography , ” Underwood said .
" Maybe , he chose churches to break into because he knows we are very forgiving . ”
Underwood said he and other church members would be willing to counsel him but feel he should be punished with jail time .
According to a police report , officer Jamie Hillis discovered the link that led police to Christian .
She researched the Internet history on one of the computers and found Christian ’s pages on MySpace and Facebook .
Christian has been in the Garvin County jail since his arrest on March 10 .
Jolley said Christian took responsibility for the burglaries and told police where he hid the two stolen laptops .
Christian had a history of victimizing a church .
In 2008 , he was convicted of second - degree burglary and of forging $ 7,000 in checks stolen from a church in Katie , a Garvin County community .
He was given a suspended prison sentence in exchange for participating in Oklahoma ’s Regimented Inmate Discipline program , a boot camp - type program operated by the state Corrections Department , according to court records .
Christian has pending identity theft charges against him in Garvin County in a 2009 case , court records indicate .
He also has a history of arrests on complaints of larceny , unauthorized use of a motor vehicle , entering a building with unlawful intent and malicious injury to property .
Dem . senators spent weekend with bank , energy , tobacco lobbyists
Twelve Democratic Senators spent last weekend in Miami Beach raising money from top lobbyists for oil , drug , and other corporate interests that they often decry , according to a guest list for the event obtained by POLITICO .
The guest list for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee 's " winter retreat " at the Ritz Carlton South Beach Resort does n't include the price tag for attendance , but the maximum contribution to the committee , typical for such events , is $ 30,000 .
There , to participate in " informal conversations " and other meetings Saturday , were senators including DSCC Chairman Robert Menendez ; Michigan 's Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow ; Bob Casey of Pennsylvania ; Claire McCaskill of Missouri ; freshmen Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Begich of Alaska ; and even left - leaning Bernie Sanders of Vermont .
Across the table was a who's who of 108 senior Washington lobbyists , including the top lobbying officials for many of the industries Democrats regularly attack : Represented were the American Bankers Association , the tobaco company Altria , the oil company Marathon , several drug manufacturers , the defense contractor Lockheed , and most of the large independent lobbying firms : Ogilvy , BGR , Quinn Gillespie , Heather Podesta , and Tony Podesta .
The retreat 's guest list is a marked contrast to Menendez 's recent rhetoric , which has echoed the White House denunciation of " special interests " and " fat cats . "
“ In the upcoming elections , voters will face a choice between Republicans who are standing with Wall Street fat cats , bankers and insurance companies -- or Democrats who are working hard to clean up the mess we inherited by putting the people ’s interests ahead of the special interests , " Menendez said in a press release last Wednesday .
The contrast between Menendez 's words and how he spent his weekend is a mark of how , even in the age of Obama , who has barred contributions from lobbyists , Democrats -- and particularly Congressional Democrats -- are riding a new wave of corporate support , the natural fruit of their majority status .
The weekend 's mellow schedule political included a Friday night dinner followed by a Saturday morning Political Breakfast Briefing , two Saturday evening " informal conversations with Senators , followed by a reception and dinner at DiLido Beach Club .
The Miami beach fundraiser guest list , to which a DSCC spokesman did n't immediately have a reaction , was a standard , corporate - heavy event that both parties have long used for high - dollar fundraising .
Other guests included lobbyists for two Indian tribes , for McDonalds , for beer and wine sellers , Ford , and a small handful of advocacy groups , including the gay group Human Rights Campaign .
CORRECTION : The Edison Electric Institute supports climate change regulations ; an earlier version of this item said , falsely , that the industry group opposes them .
Former British prime minister Tony Blair has told the Iraq War Inquiry the September 11 attacks changed the " calculus of risk " and meant it was no longer possible to contain Saddam Hussein through sanctions .
Mr Blair was appearing before the inquiry to explain why he backed the 2003 US - led invasion , to which he committed 45,000 troops .
It was the most controversial episode of his 10 - year premiership , provoking huge protests , divisions within his Labour Party and accusations he had deceived the public about the justification for invasion .
Under close questioning , Mr Blair said the September 11 , 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the United States , and the threat of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) , meant that the policy of containing Saddam could not continue .
" Up to September 11 , we thought he was a risk but we thought it was worth trying to contain it .
The crucial thing after September 11 is that the calculus of risk changed , " Mr Blair said .
" The point about this act in New York was that had they been able to kill even more people than those 3,000 , they would have .
And so after that time , my view was you could not take risks with this issue at all .
" We were advised , obviously , that these people would use chemical or biological weapons or a nuclear device if they could get hold of them , that completely changed our assessment of where the risks for security lay . "
Seven years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and almost three years after Mr Blair handed over to current British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , the issue still provokes deep public anger .
' War criminal '
Mr Blair 's appearance has been hugely anticipated .
Protesters chanting " Tony Blair , war criminal " gathered outside the building opposite parliament where the inquiry was taking place .
Relatives of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in Iraq joined about 100 anti-war demonstrators chanting and waving placards .
Names of those killed were also read out .
Mr Blair , who looked nervous at times as the hearing began , arrived early and entered by a back door amid heavy security and large numbers of police on stand - by .
" The real question Tony Blair needs to answer in the end will be at The Hague and before a war crimes tribunal , " said Andrew Murray , chairman of Stop the War Coalition .
" He is an accomplished actor but I think most people have long since seen through the script . "
Mr Blair 's appearance will not only affect his own personal legacy but still has the potential to damage the Labour government of his successor Mr Brown , who was finance minister during the war .
Some Labour leaders fear it will reignite strong feelings on the issue among voters , denting support for a party already trailing the Conservatives in polls in the run-up to an election due by June .
The inquiry has already heard from senior civil servants who said intelligence in the days before the March 20 , 2003 invasion indicated that Saddam 's WMD had been dismantled .
It will also examine the war 's legitimacy and at what stage Mr Blair , now an international envoy to the Middle East , promised then US president George W Bush that Britain would support military action against Iraq .
Witnesses have suggested Mr Blair gave that assurance in 2002 although then - attorney general Peter Goldsmith , the government 's top lawyer who eventually gave the invasion the green light , had warned him that using force for regime change would be illegal .
Mr Goldsmith told the inquiry he originally believed the United Nations had to approve the use of force and only changed his mind a month before the invasion .
The two top lawyers at the time at the Foreign Office have also said they had told the government the war would be unlawful .

Myth : Toilet Seats Are the Dirtiest Thing in the Bathroom
Oct. 14 , 2005  --
Few inanimate objects arouse as much universal germ fear -- especially among women -- as the dreaded public toilet seat .
" That 's like the first rule -- do n't sit on the toilet seat , " one woman told " 20/20 . "
Another woman described public toilets as being both nasty and filthy .
And a man told us he would " rather go almost anywhere else than a public bathroom . "
" Fifty percent of American women wo n't sit on a seat without some type of guard or without hovering , " said Allison Janse , author of " The Germ Freak 's Guide to Outwitting Colds and Flu . "
She admits she has spent years herself dangling over toilet seats , but now this self - professed germ freak is changing her attitude .
She says paper toilet shields help your head more than your bottom , and those who hover often just leave a mess for the next person .
How Many Germs
Sit on the Seat ?
Mothers teach their daughters not to sit on a public toilet seat , but is this really a big source of germs ?
" No , " said Janse .
" You 're not going to get germs from your backside .
You 're going to get them from your hands . "
To see if that 's true , " 20/20 " asked Janse 's co-author Dr. Charles Gerba to check our bathroom with his germ meter .
" Usually , actually the floor is the dirtiest , as you might guess , " said Gerba .
The floor test revealed about 2 million bacteria per square inch .
Gerba says that 's about 200 times higher than a sanitary surface .
" This is pretty bad , " said Gerba .
" We consider that a fail .
So you do n't want to walk around barefoot in ABC News toilets . "
Not surprisingly , the sanitary napkin disposal unit also failed the test and rated as the spot with the most germs in our ladies ' room .
But our sink , an area that is usually a haven for germs , was found to be unexpectedly clean .
The biggest surprise was found on the toilet seat .
" This is the cleanest spot so far , " said Gerba .
Gerba defines a sanitary surface as something clean enough to eat off of , with no more than 1,000 bacteria per square inch .
The toilet seat passed that test , but " 20/20 " reporter Don Dahler 's desk failed .
Still , it will be hard for most people to accept the conclusions shown by the data .
" No matter how often you hear that , you know , it 's safer to eat your turkey wrap off the toilet seat than your desktop at work , you 're just not going to believe it , " said Janse .
Avoiding Germs in the Stall
When you 're out using a public restroom , there are a few things you should consider doing when it 's time to visit a stall .
Janse said that since most people seek privacy by going to the stalls in the back of the bathroom , you will find fewer bacteria in the first stall .
And ladies , never put your bags on the floor .
" We found fecal bacteria on about 30 percent of the bottom of women 's purses .
So you may be moving bacteria from the bottom of the restroom floor to maybe the kitchen sink area when you 're going to make lunch , " said Gerba .
Here 's another tip :
Do n't be deceived by appearances .
While the men's room may look messier and smell much worse -- thanks to the urinal -- the ladies room harbors twice as much bacteria .
" There 's probably more bacteria in the women 's room because they spend a longer time there and also they bring in small children " said Gerba .
He says most of the germs you and your children pick up in the bathroom are on your hands , so make sure to wash them well but skip the so - called sanitary hand dryer .
" You actually end up with more bacteria with the hand blower because they 're taking the air in the restroom and blowing it onto your hands with the bacteria on it , " said Gerba .
But once your hands are clean there 's no need to worry about the door handle .
" Really the cleanest areas in the bathroom are actually the door handle and the toilet seat , " said Gerba .
He said that could just be because those are the two spots people fear and avoid the most .
Mexican heroin production is growing
Mexican drug gangs have expanded their activities in the US with heroin production doubling in 2008 , the US justice department says in a report .
Despite US funding for the war on drugs , trade in marijuana , ecstasy and methamphetamine also grew , the National Drug Threat Assessment said .
The report found that Mexican groups were active in every region of the US .
Gangs were moving an estimated $ 40 bn ( £ 27 bn ) in cash back into Mexico across the border each year , it added .
Mexico has long been the main conduit for illicit drugs smuggled into the US but this report suggests that the efforts to halt the flow on both sides of the border have had only a limited impact , the BBC's Richard Lister reports from Washington .
In 2007 the US pledged $ 1.4bn ( £ 0.9 bn ) over three years to fight the drugs cartels but the following year heroin production in Mexico rose from 17 to 38 metric tonnes .
This , the report says , led to lower heroin prices and more overdose deaths in the US .
Network growth
The report found that Mexican heroin was poised to take a " more significant share " of the market in US cities where South American heroin has traditionally dominated .
For Asian heroin , the US continued to be a secondary market , it said .
The assessment says that Mexican drug suppliers have increased their co-operation with American street and prison gangs to expand their distribution networks .
Speaking in Mexico City earlier this week , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more efforts to tackle the social issues such as poverty that fuel the drugs trade .
Mexico , which has some 50,000 troops engaged against the cartels , has suggested that American money and equipment has not arrived quickly enough .

Box Score of Four Home Run Game by Mike Cameron
What prompted the quote in the middleof the page ?
An article which appeared in The News Tribune which read in part , " ( Mike ) Cameron hit four home runs in four consecutive at - bats Thursday , joining an elite group of 12 other Major Leaguers that does n't include Babe Ruth , Hank Aaron , Barry Bonds - or Ken Griffey Jr. "
The " names on that list " did include the likes of Lou Gehrig , Mike Schmidt , and Willie Mays - and now Mike Cameron .
Here is a brief description of each long ball hit consecutively by Cameron during this historic game :
1st Home Run : Bases empty , count 1 - 2 , pitch from Jon Rauch hit approximately 405 feet over the wall in center field .
2nd Home Run : Bases empty , still in the first inning , count full , pitch from Jim Parque blasted approximately 425 feet over the wall in center field .
3rd Home Run :
Two outs , nobody on base , third inning , count 1 - 2 , pitch from Parque launched approximately 412 feet home run over the wall in left field .
4th Home Run :
Two outs , nobody on base , fifth inning , count 2 - 1 , pitch from Parque hurled approximately 412 feet over the wall in center field .
Baseball Almanac is pleased to present the box score from a game which manager Lou Piniella commented about , " I 've seen a lot of baseball in my life , but four home runs in the first five innings of a game ?
No !
It could n't happen to a nicer young man . "
Buy a Blight German Town Looking for Pothole Sponsors
They cause accidents and they blight the streets -- extreme winter weather has resulted in a rash of potholes across Europe .
With a shortage of cash to fix them , one German town has come up with a unique solution : selling sponsorships , complete with a plaque .
Chelsea are drawing up plans to reshape their squad after being knocked out of the Champions League and despite the current squad pleading for one more chance to win Europe 's top prize .
The 1–0 defeat by José Mourinho 's Internazionale on Tuesday exposed weaknesses in Carlo Ancelotti's squad .
The club will aim to retain the spine of the team but a number of fringe players are expected to be moved on in the summer .
Chelsea 's transfer policy in recent seasons has been one of relative prudence , as successive chief executives have aimed for self - sufficiency instead of continued reliance upon Roman Abramovich 's benevolence .
However , the club 's Russian owner has made it clear that should the right players become available at competitive prices , he will fund the occasional big signing .
Ancelotti may thus be able to consider moves for long - standing targets such as Fernando Torres , Franck Ribéry , Angel di María or Sergio Agüero .
Torres is emerging as the club 's principal target and the Spanish striker 's future at Liverpool could be decided by the level of investment attracted to his club in the next few months .
Real Madrid will compete for Ribéry 's signature though the French forward , who plays for Bayern Munich , confirmed interest from Chelsea last month .
Abramovich was at the club 's Cobham training base yesterday and he spoke to Ancelotti about long - term transfer policy .
Funds could be raised by moving players on with the likes of Deco , Ricardo Carvalho , Paulo Ferreira , Juliano Belletti and even Salomon Kalou potentially made available .
The owner 's desire to reinvigorate the squad could also have implications for contract negotiations with Joe Cole and Michael Ballack , whose deals expire at the end of the season , and possibly Nicolas Anelka , who is contracted until 2011 .
Previous Chelsea managers have come under serious scrutiny following elimination from the Champions League but Ancelotti , who has been at the club for nine months , retains the owner 's faith and will oversee the next stage in this team 's development .
" Most of the players are really happy and want to stay here and continue the adventure , " said the striker Didier Drogba , 32 , who was sent off late in the 1 - 0 second - leg defeat .
" It would mean a lot to win [ the Champions League ] together next season because we 've been trying so hard to do that for such a long time .
I hope there is more to come from this team . "
Their forward Florent Malouda , 29 , said the current team " could have given much more than we did " .
Ballack , now 33 , offered the telling admission that Inter 's physical power had proved too much to cope with .
" I do n't think this team is coming to an end because you can't use this game as a means of assessing the development of the side over the whole year , " the German midfielder said .
Uefa 's disciplinary panel has yet to decide if Drogba 's red card for violent conduct – the Ivorian stamped on Thiago Motta 's ankle – will prompt further sanction .
The Ivory Coast striker is nine months into a three - year probationary period for a previous offence .
Drogba was banned for four matches , with a further two games suspended , for verbally abusing the Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo after Chelsea 's defeat in last season 's semi-final , against Barcelona .
Drogba faces a mandatory two ‑match ban for his most recent offence , which could be extended to four games .
" The referee was a bit hard [ on me ] with this red card , " said the striker .
" I stepped on [ Motta 's ] achilles tendon , but it was not intentional and I was more focused on the cross and the ball .
I know I have had unhappy endings in Europe for the last three years [ he was also sent off in the 2008 final ] , but I 'm going to try and make it better .
I hope next season will be mine . "

The federal court that touched off a furor in 2002 by declaring the words " under God " in the Pledge of Allegiance to be an unconstitutional endorsement of religion took another look at the issue Thursday and said the phrase invokes patriotism , not religious faith .
The daily schoolroom ritual is not a prayer , but instead " a recognition of our founders ' political philosophy that a power greater than the government gives the people their inalienable rights , " said the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in a 2 - 1 ruling .
" Thus , the pledge is an endorsement of our form of government , not of religion or any particular sect . "
The dissenting judge , Stephen Reinhardt , said statements by members of Congress who added " under God " to the pledge in 1954 show conclusively that it was intended to " indoctrinate our nation 's children with a state - held religious belief . "
In a separate ruling , the same panel upheld the use of the national motto , " In God We Trust , " on coins and currency .
The language is patriotic and ceremonial , not religious , the court said .
Reinhardt reluctantly joined the 3 - 0 decision , saying he was bound by the court 's newly established precedent in the pledge case .
Atheist sued
Both suits were filed by Michael Newdow , a Sacramento atheist who has brought numerous challenges to government - sponsored religious invocations .
He said he would appeal the rulings to the full appellate court and the U.S. Supreme Court , but was not optimistic .
The rulings sent two messages , Newdow said : " To be a real American , you believe in God , and the judiciary unfortunately sometimes can't be trusted to uphold our constitutional rights when you 're a disenfranchised minority . "
Former Justice Department lawyer Gregory Katsas , who represented the Bush administration in the pledge case when the court heard it in 2007 , heard a different message : that " one nation , under God " suggests a government that " is limited and bound to respect individual rights . "
Swift reaction
Newdow first challenged the Pledge of Allegiance in 2000 on behalf of his daughter , a student in a Sacramento - area elementary school .
The appeals court ruled in June 2002 that the addition of " under God " was religiously motivated and sent " a message to nonbelievers that they are outsiders , " in violation of the constitutional separation of church and state .
Congress reacted furiously , passing a resolution with virtually no dissenting votes that denounced the decision .
The court put its ruling on hold until the case reached the Supreme Court , which sidestepped the constitutional issue and ruled that Newdow could not represent his daughter 's interests because her mother had legal custody .
Newdow then refiled the suit on behalf of the parent of a kindergartner in the Sacramento suburb of Rio Linda .
He won the first round before a federal judge in 2005 , but a new appeals court panel issued a 193 - page ruling Thursday upholding the pledge .
Pledge is n't prayer
In the majority opinion , Judge Carlos Bea acknowledged that " the words ' under God ' have religious significance , " but said they do not " convert the pledge into a prayer . "
The 1954 law that added those words at the height of the Cold War was meant to convey the idea of a limited government , " in stark contrast to the unlimited power exercised by communist forms of government , " said Bea , joined by Judge Dorothy Nelson .
" Congress ' ostensible and predominant purpose was to inspire patriotism . "
Reinhardt , a member of the 2002 panel that found the language unconstitutional , said Thursday 's majority ignored overwhelming evidence of religious motivation by the 1954 Congress .
He cited statements by numerous lawmakers denouncing atheistic communism and declaring a belief in God to be part of the American way of life .
Reinhardt also pointed to President Dwight Eisenhower 's signing statement that millions of schoolchildren would now proclaim " the dedication of our nation and its people to the Almighty . "
During the same period , Reinhardt said , Congress adopted " In God We Trust " as the national motto , ordered it inscribed on paper money and established an annual National Prayer Breakfast .
By inserting religious language into the pledge , Reinhardt said , " we abandoned our historic principle that secular matters were for the state and matters of faith were for the church . "
Acupuncture is unregulated in Britain Infections spread by acupuncture needles are under - diagnosed worldwide , according to doctors in Hong Kong .
Writing in the British Medical Journal , they call for tighter infection controls and regulation .
Acupuncture is currently unregulated in the UK , but the government is consulting on the issue .
The British Acupuncture Council says their members follow a strict code of conduct which includes infection control measures .
Needle risk Professor Patrick Woo and colleagues , from the University of Hong Kong , argue in an editorial that acupuncture may pose risks to patients because needles are inserted deep beneath the skin , and can introduce infection .
Drawing on worldwide studies , he says there have been cases where bacterial infections have been transmitted to patients who went on to develop serious problems .
They include joint destruction , multi-organ failure , flesh - eating disease and paralysis .
He says acupuncture has also been associated with hepatitis B .
The risk of severe side effects associated with acupuncture in the UK is one in every 200,000 cases
Dr Mike Cummings , British Association of Medical Acupuncturists Professor
Woo believes the link with acupuncture often goes unrecognised because of the long incubation period of some of the transmitted infections .
The authors call for clinicians to " have a high index of suspicion " for infections that might be transmitted by acupuncture and to " alert health authorities about clusters of cases " .
They conclude that " to prevent infections transmitted by acupuncture , infection control measures should be implemented , such as use of disposable needles , skin disinfection procedures , and aseptic techniques " .
" Stricter regulation and accreditation requirements are also needed , " they say .
Strict code British acupuncturists say practitioners who belong to a professional body in the UK have very high standards .
Janet Stringer , a practitioner and spokesperson for the British Acupuncture Council , said members undergo a three and a half year training and follow a strict code which includes the infection control measures suggested in the article .
She said : " Our code covers measures like single - use disposable needles .
" Clean needle technique is taken very seriously . "
Dr Mike Cummings , medical director of the British Association of Medical Acupuncturists , said severe infections associated with acupuncture were " incredibly rare " .
" Overall acupuncture is extremely safe , " he said .
" We inform patients that the risk of severe side effects associated with acupuncture is one in every 200,000 cases . "
Unregulated But Edzard Ernst , Professor of Complementary medicine at the University of Exeter , said that although virtually all UK practitioners would use disposable needles , the infection risk depended on the competence of the therapist .
He said that although acupuncturists who were medically trained would know how to handle sterility , he would be more worried about some of those who do not have a medical background .
He pointed out that acupuncture is unregulated in the UK and anyone can set themselves up as an acupuncturist without training or accreditation .
The government has recently been consulting on whether , and if so how , to regulate herbal medicine and acupuncture practitioners .
A spokesman for the Department of Health said : " We received over 6,000 responses and we are currently in the final stages of the analysis .
Our response will be published as soon as possible .
" We wo n't pre-empt the outcome of the consultation , but safety will be our main concern in making decisions . "

Two men kissing Part 2 : The counterattack
By Andy Alexander
First , there was the assault on The Post for publishing a photo of two men kissing .
Now , the counterattack .
Tuesday 's Omblog noted that The Post had taken heat from readers upset by the March 4 photo taken outside D.C. Court as the District began accepting license applications for same - sex marriages .
In calls and e-mails , many readers said the image had offended their sensibilities .
More than two dozen canceled their subscriptions .
But the Omblog item prompted a backlash .
It was picked up by bloggers , wire services and broadcast outlets , prompting hundreds of e-mails , calls and online comments praising The Post .
Those I ’ve received are running more than 10 - to - 1 in support of the decision to run the photo .
They ’re coming from around the globe .
“ It happened , it ’s fact , and the photo was in no way offensive , ” e-mailed Dylan Lacey of Brisbane , Australia .
“ I regret that you lost subscribers and that the Post will be financially worse off in some way , but hopefully your news subscribers will more than make up for it . ”
Nearly 20 people who e-mailed or offered online comments said they wanted to fill the void left by those who canceled .
“ It ’s been a few years since I let my subscription lapse .
The Post can count on my resubscription as a replacement for any one of the narrow - minded cancelers , ” wrote one online commenter who goes by “ scorbett1976 . ”
“ I just subscribed to the paper for the first time since I moved out here 6 years ago BECAUSE of this ! ” added another commenter , “ melissa4033 . ”
No response yet from The Post ’s circulation department on how many people in recent days cited the photo as the reason for starting a subscription .
Michael Larabee , who handles letters to the editor for The Post , said he has received a handful of supportive letters after receiving a small number critical of The Post ’s decision .
He hopes to run several in Saturday ’s “ Free for All ” section .
The D.C. Council voted in December to legalize same - sex marriage .
The Post photo of Jeremy Ames and Taka Ariga briefly kissing was taken March 3 , the day the District began accepting marriage licenses .
The District began issuing them this past Tuesday , and some same - sex couples immediately held marriage ceremonies .
Among those who e-mailed the ombudsman were several who applauded The Post ’s decision to run the photo , but who also said they were afraid to openly express their support for fear of being victimized by friends , co-workers or family members who do n’t know about , or do n’t approve of , their sexual orientation .
The photo captured “ a great step towards Civil Rights and Equality for all people , ” e-mailed Brandon , who lives in suburban St. Louis .
He asked that his last name not be used out of fear that he would receive “ negative backlash ” from family members who are “ less than supportive of the fact that I ’m homosexual . ”
But some remain adamantly opposed to the photo .
“ The Nation ’s Capital is now Sodom and Gomorrah and it too will be destroyed , not by God , but by mankind , ” wrote “ Ward4DC , ” an online commenter .
“ I hope the Washington Post will go out of business soon .
Good riddance to the Washington Post . ”
A commenter going by “ battleground51 ” added : “ Big , color photos of homosexuals hugging and smooching shows pure contempt for the values of the vast majority of Americans ... I ’m sure WaPo honchos think they are supporting a good cause .
That ’s their opinion only .
It just does not reflect America , as a whole . ”
But it does reflect what is happening in the District of Columbia , where same - sex marriage is legal .

BRAZEN : The Eli Lilly pharmaceutical warehouse in Enfield , Connecticut , where authorities say tens of millions of dollars worth of prescription drugs have been stolen in a brazen , well - planned heist .
In a Hollywood - style heist , thieves cut a hole in the roof of a warehouse , rappelled inside and scored one of the biggest hauls of its kind - not diamonds , gold bullion or Old World art , but about US $ 75 million ( NZ $ 105 million ) in antidepressants and other prescription drugs .
The pills - stolen from the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly &
Co in quantities big enough to fill a tractor - trailer - are believed to be destined for the black market , perhaps overseas .
" This is like the Brink 's pill heist , " said Erik Gordon , a University of Michigan business professor who studies the health care industry .
" This one will enter the folklore . "
The thieves apparently scaled the brick exterior of the warehouse in an industrial park in Enfield , a town about midway between Hartford and Springfield , Massachusetts , during a blustery rainstorm before daybreak Sunday .
After lowering themselves to the floor , they disabled the alarms and spent at least an hour loading pallets of drugs into a vehicle at the loading dock , authorities said .
" Just by the way it occurred , it appears that there were several individuals involved and that it was a very well planned - out and orchestrated operation , " Enfield Police Chief Carl Sferrazza said .
" It 's not your run - of - the - mill home burglary , that 's for sure . "
Experts described it as one of the biggest pharmaceutical heists in history .
Edward Sagebiel , a spokesman for Indianapolis - based Eli Lilly , put the wholesale value of the drugs at US $ 75 million and said they included the antidepressants Prozac and Cymbalta and the anti-psychotic Zyprexa .
No narcotics or other painkillers were in the warehouse , he said .
Other pharmaceutical warehouses have been hit with similar burglaries in recent years , but experts said the value of the Eli Lilly heist far eclipses any other prescription - drug thefts they have tracked .
The thieves could easily net US $ 20 million to US $ 25 million , Gordon said .
Enfield police would not say whether the building had surveillance video or whether employees are being investigated .
The building is unmarked and unprotected by fences .
The FBI was called in .
Experts said the heist shared many traits with warehouse thefts of pharmaceuticals last year near Richmond , Va. , Memphis , Tennessee , and Olive Branch , Miss .
Those thieves also cut through ceilings and sometimes used trapeze - style rigging to get inside and disable the main and backup alarms .
In some cases , they sprayed dark paint on the lenses of security cameras ; in others , they stole disks in the security recording devices .
Enfield police and the FBI would not comment on whether some of those techniques were also used in the Eli Lilly theft .
" The level of sophistication in these thefts is very high , " said Dan Burges , director of intelligence at FreightWatch International , a Texas - based security company .
" These thieves actively target certain products .
They find out where they are , they go there , they come looking for it .
They probably were conducting surveillance on that warehouse for days , if not weeks , before that theft occurred . "
Burges and Gordon said the thieves probably already had a buyer lined up , possibly an online pharmacy or someone in South America or Asia , where drug regulations are lax .
Gordon said it is unlikely the drugs would end up at a local hospital or drugstore chain .
" The people with a reputation to protect , a CVS or a Target or a Kroger or most hospitals , they do n't want to take any chances , " he said .
" It 's too big a risk .
You 're talking about people 's health . "
However , stolen drugs have made it into the US health care system , often through Internet suppliers or crooked wholesalers .
Last June , thieves stole 129,000 vials of insulin in North Carolina .
The drugs were not properly refrigerated , and later surfaced at a medical centre in Houston .
The Food and Drug Administration said in August that some patients suffered unsafe blood sugar levels after using them and that it had recovered just 2 percent of the stolen insulin .
" We know that any number of unscrupulous people interested in profit find ways to convince some secondary wholesalers to put these products back into circulation and on into pharmacies , " FDA spokesman Tom Gasparoli said in a statement .
Pharmaceuticals made up 5 percent of the thefts of commodities in 2009 in the US
The average such heist was worth about US $ 2.5 million , according to FreightWatch .
Pharmaceuticals are usually stolen from trucks or cargo containers - there were a few dozen such thefts last year - though Burges said warehouse break - ins are on the rise as thieves become more sophisticated .
" They 're very creative , they 're very good at what they do , and catching them is a very difficult thing , " he said .
Zyprexa and Cymbalta were Eli Lilly 's two best - selling drugs last year .
Prozac was Lilly 's first billion - dollar drug and the company 's top seller before it lost patent protection several years ago .
The thefts will not cause any national shortages of the products , Sagebiel said .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced regret on Sunday for the announcement of a Jewish settlement plan that has strained ties with Washington and threatens the revival of Middle East peace talks .

In his first public remarks on what Israeli commentators called his most serious crisis with Washington since taking office a year ago , he gave no sign he would meet Palestinian demands to cancel a project for 1,600 new settler homes .
“ I suggest not to get carried away and to calm down , ” Netanyahu told his cabinet , after a reprimand by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and written statements issued by the prime minister ’s office that failed to calm the dispute .
“ There was a regrettable incident here , that occurred innocently , ” Netanyahu said , referring to an announcement by a government ministry during a visit last week by Vice President Joe Biden , of planned construction in an area of the West Bank that Israel has annexed to Jerusalem .
The timing of the disclosure , after Palestinians agreed to indirect peace talks , embarrassed Biden and raised questions over whether Israel ’s settlement policy could harm U.S. - Israeli security cooperation on the question of Iran .
“ It was hurtful and certainly it should not have happened , ” Netanyahu said of the announcement by the Interior Ministry , controlled by the religious Shas party , a member of a governing coalition dominated by pro-settler parties , including his own .
David Axelrod , a senior aide to President Barack Obama , told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” program that Netanyahu ’s comments in response to U.S. criticism showed “ the message was received . ”
A senior U.S. official forecast “ a dicey period here in the next couple days to a couple of weeks ” as Palestinians demanded reversal of the settlement plan .
A U.S. envoy is due back in the region later in the week to try to get peace talks suspended since December 2008 under way .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had resisted restarting negotiations without a total Israeli settlement freeze .
An Abbas aide , Nabil Abu Rdainah , said Netanyahu ’s comments fell short of what was needed for the talks to begin .
“ What is required is the annulment of the Israeli decision and no return to the policy of provoking the Palestinian side , ” Abu Rdainah said .
INSULT
In unusually blunt remarks , Clinton had called Israel ’s behavior “ insulting ” after it approved the project while hosting Biden , who had focused during his visit on Washington ’s commitment to Israeli security and sanctions against Iran .
Although Clinton stressed Washington ’s ties with Israel were “ durable and strong , ” she told Netanyahu in a telephone call on Friday he must act to repair the relationship .
Netanyahu said at the cabinet meeting he had appointed a team of senior officials to look into the process leading up to the settlement project announcement and “ to ensure procedures will be in place to prevent these kinds of incidents . ”
It was not immediately clear whether the inquiry would help smooth relations with Washington after the latest display of friction between Netanyahu and Obama .
“ In flames , ” read the front - page headline in Maariv , a mass circulation , mainstream Israeli newspaper , underneath a cartoon depicting Obama boiling Netanyahu in a cooking pot .
Writing in the left - leaning Haaretz newspaper , commentator Aluf Benn said Netanyahu has reached “ the moment of truth . ”
He said Netanyahu must choose between political cooperation with the right and his need for U.S. support in curbing Iran ’s nuclear program the West says is aimed a producing nuclear weapons , an allegation Iran denies .
Angering settlers and their supporters , Netanyahu announced in November a 10 - month moratorium on new housing starts in West Bank settlements -- but exempted Jerusalem from the order .
Washington praised the move .
Palestinians fear settlements on land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war will deny them a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , with East Jerusalem as its capital .
Israel considers all of Jerusalem its capital , a claim that is not recognized internationally .
Motorola making a device in more than one color ?
You do n’t say …
One of our connects sent us the above photo of the Motorola Calgary / DROID Devour / Whatever , and confirmed the specifications we posted a few months back .
We also received some more feedback on the device — hit the jump for the goodies !
We ’re told the keyboard was “ nice ” and the phone itself was “ easier to use ” compared to the Motorola DROID .
Obviously that ’s personal opinion , and maybe the BLUR OS simplifies things for some people , but the trackpad apparently is killer as a navigational input device .
Oh ?
The device has Wi-Fi , GPS , a 1420 mAh battery , but unfortunately no SIM card slot as it is not a global device .
Whether the unit will come in multiple colors or not is not confirmed as these are still non-final units , we ’re told , but we ’d probably bet on it being available in black as well as silver .
If only they kept that RAZR - keyboard …

A healthy coral reef in St. Croix , U.S. Virgin Islands .
According to government scientists , some 27 percent of the world 's reefs are already gone .
If current trends continue , another two - thirds will disappear by 2032 .
WEST PALM BEACH , Florida  Coral reefs are dying , and scientists and governments around the world are contemplating what will happen if they disappear altogether .
The idea positively scares them .
Coral reefs are part of the foundation of the ocean food chain .
Nearly half the fish the world eats make their homes around them .
Hundreds of millions of people worldwide — by some estimates , 1 billion across Asia alone — depend on them for their food and their livelihoods .
If the reefs vanished , experts say , hunger , poverty and political instability could ensue .
SCIENCE FAIR BLOG : U.N. decides not to protect red and pink coral " Whole nations will be threatened in terms of their existence , " said Carl Gustaf Lundin of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .
Numerous studies predict coral reefs are headed for extinction worldwide , largely because of global warming , pollution and coastal development , but also because of damage from bottom - dragging fishing boats and the international trade in jewelry and souvenirs made of coral .
At least 19 % of the world 's coral reefs are already gone , including some 50 % of those in the Caribbean .
An additional 15 % could be dead within 20 years , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Old Dominion University professor Kent Carpenter , director of a worldwide census of marine species , warned that if global warming continues unchecked , all corals could be extinct within 100 years .
" You could argue that a complete collapse of the marine ecosystem would be one of the consequences of losing corals , " Carpenter said .
" You 're going to have a tremendous cascade effect for all life in the oceans . "
Exotic and colorful , coral reefs are n't lifeless rocks ; they are made up of living creatures that excrete a hard calcium carbonate exoskeleton .
Once the animals die , the rocky structures erode , depriving fish of vital spawning and feeding grounds .
Experts say cutting back on carbon emissions to arrest rising sea temperatures and acidification of the water , declaring some reefs off limits to fishing and diving , and controlling coastal development and pollution could help reverse , or at least stall , the tide .
Florida , for instance , has the largest unbroken " no - take " zone in the continental U.S. — about 140 square miles off limits to fishing in and around Dry Tortugas National Park , a cluster of islands and reefs teeming with marine life about 70 miles off Key West .
Many fishermen oppose such restrictions .
And other environmental measures have run into resistance at the state , local , national and international level .
On Sunday , during a gathering of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , restrictions proposed by the U.S. and Sweden on the trade of some coral species were rejected .
If reefs were to disappear , commonly consumed species of grouper and snapper could become just memories .
Oysters , clams and other creatures that are vital to many people 's diets would also suffer .
And experts say commercial fisheries would fail miserably at meeting demand for seafood .
" Fish will become a luxury good , " said Cassandra deYoung of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization .
" You already have a billion people who are facing hunger , and this is just going to aggravate the situation , " she added .
" We will not be able to maintain food security around the world . "
The economic damage could be enormous .
Ocean fisheries provide direct employment to at least 38 million people worldwide , with an additional 162 million people indirectly involved in the industry , according to the U.N.
Coral reefs draw scuba divers , snorkelers and other tourists to seaside resorts in Florida , Hawaii , Southeast Asia and the Caribbean and help maintain some of the world 's finest sandy beaches by absorbing energy from waves .
Without the reefs , hotels , restaurants and other businesses that cater to tourists could suffer financially .
Many Caribbean countries get nearly half their gross national product from visitors seeking tropical underwater experiences .
People all over the world could pay the price if reefs were to disappear , since some types of coral and marine species that rely on reefs are being used by the pharmaceutical industry to develop possible cures for cancer , arthritis and viruses .
" A world without coral reefs is unimaginable , " said Jane Lubchenco , a marine biologist who heads NOAA .
" Reefs are precious sources of food , medicine and livelihoods for hundreds of thousands around the world .
They are also special places of renewal and recreation for thousands more .
Their exotic beauty and diverse bounty are global treasures . "

( CNN ) -- Jerry Yellin has spent most of his life trying to forget about the stench of death on the island of Iwo Jima 65 years ago .
Yellin was a P - 51 fighter pilot who had turned 22 a few weeks before he touched down on the island March 7 , 1945 , amid some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II 's Pacific campaign .
" To one side , there were mounds and mounds and mounds of bodies of Japanese soldiers being pushed around by bulldozers into mass graves .
And right behind our squadron area was the Marine mortuary , where they 'd lay out the bodies , check their dog tags and fingerprint them for identification , " recalls Yellin , an 87 - year - old retiree who lives in Vero Beach , Florida .
" I 've lived with those memories all of my life and it was not something I ever wanted to go back to . "
Nevertheless , Yellin was back on the island last week for the first time since 1945 to attend a ceremony commemorating the battle 's 65th anniversary .
About 22,000 Japanese soldiers died defending the island , along with more than 6,000 Americans , in a battle that was memorialized in the iconic photograph of five U.S. Marines and a Navy corpsman raising the U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi , the island 's dormant volcano .
The Americans secured the island on March 26 , 1945 , marking the U.S. military 's most significant advance in its island - hopping strategy to reach Japan .
But the battle proved to be longer and deadlier than planners had anticipated , depleting much of the U.S. military 's resources .
The U.S. abandoned its plan to invade the Japanese mainland and turned to the atomic bomb to end the war .
Since 1995 , the Japanese and American associations of Iwo Jima have met on the 8 - square - mile island , now known as Iwo To , to commemorate the 35 - day battle with a " Reunion of Honor . "
Yellin and several other veterans made the day - long trip to Iwo Jima from Guam on March 3 with the tour company , Military Tours .
Each man had his own reason for going , but all left united through the shared experience of an event that only a few can understand , says Cyril " Cy " O'Brien , a Marine correspondent who covered the Battle of Iwo Jima , who also made the trip .
" In a way , it 's reliving something that happened so long ago that was probably what I would consider some of the most ennobling moments of our lives .
I am a writer , too , so going there this time , looking at the terrain and seeing this hill , this cliff , this gorge , opens a whole new page to the memory , " he says .
O'Brien , a retired newspaper reporter who is working on a book about his experiences as a war correspondent , has been back to Iwo Jima for the Reunion of Honor four times .
But the sense of awe never diminishes as the first sight of the island from the plane , he says .
" When we approached Iwo Jima and saw Suribachi , you would be amazed what happens .
Everything became as quiet and as solemn as if we 'd entered a cathedral .
You could tell the island had captivated everyone , the island had brought them back to their youth .
The first moment was a very stirring moment .
Always is , " he says .
For Yellin , it has been a longer journey back to the battlefield where , as a young airman , he left behind 11 comrades , sparking years of bitterness and racial prejudice .
Yellin recalls passing over the flag each time he and his brothers flew a mission to support the Marines on the ground , who faced the formidable task of taking the island from a military force on its last stand .
" I never thought of the people on the ground as people .
You can hate somebody so much that you do n't see them as people , " he says .
" I had no desire to go back to Japan .
Why the hell would you want to visit the place where your enemy was ?
Who wants to visit the people you fought against and hated ? "
The healing began in 1988 , when his son married a Japanese woman whose father was a pilot in the Japanese Imperial Army Air Service , who also flew missions in Iwo Jima .
Yellin's son's future in - laws opposed the marriage until the men met and shared their experiences in Iwo Jima .
" I hated him and he hated me .
We met for the first time three days before the wedding .
And he said , ' Any man that could fly a P - 51 against the Japanese and live must be a brave man , and I want the blood of that man to flow through the veins of my grandchildren . ' " he says .
" Then , my son got married and started having children and my whole life expanded .
I saw that human beings were killed in the war , and they were kind people , they were bright people , and now they 're my family . "
Through the marriage , the two wartime enemies made peace , a process that Yellin documented in a novel published last year , " Of War & Weddings . "
But he still never considered visiting Iwo Jima until he was offered an opportunity to commemorate his fallen brothers -- 11 in combat and five in training -- from the 78th Fighter Squadron in a ceremony during the Reunion of Honor .
Upon learning of his plans , Yellin 's 18 - year - old grandson expressed interest in seeing the place where his grandfathers had once fought each other .
" I just did n't want to relive all that , but because I have a Japanese grandson and because he wanted to go , I had to go , " says Yellin .
" And I 'm happy , delighted , thrilled that I went .
I cried most of the day , from the moment we landed .
Many memories came back , and we did a memorial for the 16 guys .
It was like closing the circle . "
Recently I needed to time some Ruby code as it was running ( related to my post on list intersection and another post on skip pointers which I have n’t finished writing yet ) .
Being a bit too keen ( as I often am : ) ) and seeing as it would be fairly easy to do , I decided to quickly roll an implementation similar to the following .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 beginning_time = Time . now ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } end_time = Time .
now puts " Time elapsed #{ ( end_time - beginning_time ) * 1000 } milliseconds " ```
You get the current time before and the current time after the code you need to measure the running time of and you simply subtract them from each other ( _to get the time in seconds_ ) .
The output is as follows : [ email protected ] :~/ projects $ ruby time.rb
Time elapsed 4.049 milliseconds </ pre>
But this seemed rather inflexible , and you would n't want to have to do it over and over again , so I rolled it into a method , to allow myself to time the execution of other methods , like so .
``` ruby def time_method ( method , * args ) beginning_time =
Time .
now self .
send ( method , args ) end_time =
Time .
now puts
" Time elapsed #{ ( end_time - beginning_time ) * 1000 } milliseconds " end def method_to_time ( * args ) ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } end time_method ( : method_to_time ) ```
As you can see we can now pass a symbol version of the method name we want to time into our _time_method_ .
Inside the _time_method_ we will call " _send_ " on the current object passing in the method name ( _which will essentially call the method we want to time_ ) and will wrap this call in our timing code , producing similar output ( _to that from above_ ) : [ email protected ] :~/ projects $ ruby time.rb
Time elapsed 6.198 milliseconds </ pre>
This is somewhat better , but now we can only time methods , not arbitrary code which is not very nice .
So , we enhance our _time_method_ by allowing it to take a block .
``` ruby def time_method ( method = nil , * args ) beginning_time =
Time .
now if block_given ?
yield else self .
send ( method , args ) end end_time =
Time .
now puts " Time elapsed #{ ( end_time - beginning_time ) * 1000 } milliseconds " end time_method do ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } end
[ email protected ] : ~/ projects $ ruby time.rb
Time elapsed 6.198 milliseconds
This allows us to time arbitrary code as well as methods – awesome !
However as I was browsing some code the other day ( for unrelated reasons ) , I discovered that it was n’t so awesome , because I reinvented the wheel and the existing wheel is potentially better .
If enjoy my Ruby posts ( like this one ) , here is some of the Ruby related stuff I am planning to write about in the near future .
Passing methods as arguments in Ruby
Ruby object serialization ( and deserialization :) )
A look at serializing Ruby blocks / procs
plus much more …

Ruby Benchmark Module
Ruby already has a module as part of its standard libraries that basically does all that timing stuff I was playing with above , it ’s the Benchmark module .
For example :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 require " benchmark " time = Benchmark .
measure do ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } end puts time ```
As you can see we pass the block we want to time to _Benchmark .
measure_ which will return output that will look like this when printed : [ email protected ] :~/ projects $ ruby time.rb
0.010000 0.000000 0.010000 ( 0.003298 ) </ pre >
You 're probably getting the picture already , but if not here is another way to use benchmark which will label our output to make it clearer : ``` ruby require " benchmark " Benchmark . bm ( 7 ) do | x | x .
report ( " first : " ) { ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } } x .
report ( " second : " ) { ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i }} x .
report ( " third : " ) { ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i }} end
[ email protected ] : ~/ projects $ ruby time.rb user system total real first : 0.000000 0.010000 0.010000 ( 0.008010 ) second : 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 ( 0.005251 ) third : 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 ( 0.003678 )
Not only did we run and time our code , but we did it multiple times producing , the user , system , total and real times for each run .
You can imagine how useful this could be especially considering that if we use one of the other methods of the Benchmark module ( Benchmark.benchmark ) it will allow us to format our output as well as easily produce averages and totals for all the runs .
Of course if you do n’t want all that extraneous stuff printed , the easiest way to use it is :
1 2 3 4 5 6 require " benchmark " time = Benchmark .
realtime do ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } end puts " Time elapsed #{ time * 1000 } milliseconds "
[ email protected ] : ~/ projects $ ruby time.rb Time elapsed 5.35893440246582 milliseconds
Which simply gives you the real elapsed time in seconds which you can then print out yourself .
In hindsight I am still pretty happy with my own _timemethod way as it is simple , flexible and mine :) .
But it is good to know that Ruby already provides a facility to easily time execution without having to write any extra code .

KNOXVILLE , Tenn . --
She is at the University of Denver now , where the air is thinner .
But she is able to breathe easier .
Started to the day she left Knoxville .
Linda Bensel - Meyers once had an office overlooking Tennessee 's Neyland Stadium .
Now she 's teaching at the University of Denver , which does not field a football team .
" Although it is hard to leave an institution I have dedicated myself to for 17 years , " Linda Bensel - Meyers wrote in her May resignation letter to a University of Tennessee official , " I am heartened to have found a new institution that supports my work , both in the renaissance of ethical education and in the national reform movement to prevent further exploitation of inner-city athletes . "
She concludes the letter , " It will take time , though , for me to forgive the university ; no faculty member should ever find her attempts to do her job met with institutional threats and public attacks on her character . "
Bensel - Meyers is not missed by those closest to the Volunteer football program .
For the better part of a decade , the tenured English professor lodged concerns about institutional misconduct by the academic services unit devoted to Tennessee athletes .
Her persistent efforts -- critics might call it a campaign -- brought public scrutiny to Rocky Top in the wake of the team 's 1998 national championship .
Her awareness of the issues came from her being director of composition , a role that funneled all allegations of plagiarism in the English department to her desk for review .
Since English 101 and 102 are mandatory for all students , she was ideally positioned to witness the writing skills of some of the recruited athletes .
She was astounded not so much by their deficiencies -- the daughter of a poor chicken farmer from Oregon , she believes the educationally underprivileged can learn to do college - level work -- but how much assistance they seemed to be getting from athletic department tutors .
For instance , one starter on the football team turned in a polished paper on the topic of Madonna , the pop icon .
When a skeptical teacher asked him to summarize the paper in class , a tactic used to root out plagiarism , the following is what the player wrote on a sheet of lined paper : I have learn a lot of the things about Madommon thought her videos , hearing to her music and Magizines Articiles people wrote about her .
Both in positives and negivites ways .
They should not be a double standard for men and women .
Because if they are double videos , they could be Double standard everywhere .
The ' academic freedom ' loophole
One of the emergent themes among whistleblowers is that their allegations often do not lead to NCAA violations .
It happened at Georgia in the 1980s , Nebraska in the 1990s , Tennessee earlier this decade -- and could occur at Ohio State as well , where the academics of Maurice Clarett and other football players are under scrutiny .
The reason : " Academic freedom . "
It 's a term used by universities to defend their right to draw up classroom policies and practices in whatever manner they see fit .
As academic entities , they are given wide latitude by the NCAA , which is after all an athletic governing body , to determine what constitutes excessive collaboration by tutors , improper grade changes and other unethical behavior .
Click here for more Bensel - Meyers fired off memos on several occasions objecting to what she believed to be was excessive tutorial assistance given to athletes .
Frustrated by the lack of internal response , and flush with e-mail messages from the athletic department tutor coordinator saying that tutors may have done too much work during the national championship season , Bensel - Meyers sent her memos to ESPN.com upon request and , separately , to the university chief counsel .
The university response was a jumble .
Tennessee suspended four players during the investigation , but later cleared them , saying no NCAA rules were broken .
An internal review found athletes , on average , received more grade changes than other students , but university leaders expressed little concern .
New rules were enacted to prevent tutors from typing papers , and oversight of the tutors shifted to the provost 's office .
But Bensel - Meyers considered the latter change cosmetic , since the athletic department still paid the bills .
" Linda helped us focus on changes that needed to be made , " said Anne Mayhew , vice provost for academic affairs and NCAA faculty athletic representative at Tennessee .
At the time , however , then - university president Wade Gilley criticized Bensel - Meyers .
Her e-mail inbox filled with vague threats and messages of hate .
Once - friendly faculty members treated her as a pariah .
She was replaced as director of composition and her office was relocated , from a window space overlooking Neyland Stadium to the basement .
At home , her marriage , already shaky , crumbled under the pressure .
One psychologist , she says , told her she developed symptoms similar to post - traumatic stress disorder .
" It transformed my whole life , " Bensel - Meyers says of blowing the whistle .
" Early on I came up with a metaphor for it -- it 's like being on the edge of a cliff , blind - folded while turning cartwheels .
Hoping I 'll land on my feet every day .
Because there have been things that have happened that I just could n't anticipate . "
Friends urged her to go easier on herself , slip into the shadows of the scandal .
Apply for other jobs around the country .
She declined , for a while .
Certain that athletes were being denied the education that lifted her out of a dusty chicken farm , she took it as her duty to continue to press the issue , her scope eventually broadening to other campuses .
Her passion eventually led to her becoming director of the Drake Group , an internationally honored band of faculty members that agitates for the reform of college sports .
The Drake Group has also become a de facto support group for other whistleblowers -- a label , incidentally , Bensel - Meyers does not prefer to stamp herself with .
" That term ( suggests ) someone is doing something that most people would not do , " she says .
" I have to believe that most people who had access to the information that I had access to would do the same thing . "

Germany warns that blocking sites does not go far enough .
Germany has called for stronger action to combat images of child sex abuse online , saying material should be deleted rather than blocked .
Justice minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger said Germany " rejected " the idea of stopping people getting access to images by blocking .
Her comments came after the unveiling of European Commission plans to block child sex abuse sites outside Europe .
The blocking plan is part of proposed new laws on child exploitation .
" Blocking , " said Ms Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger , " is not an effective weapon in the fight against child pornography and also leads to a loss of trust among internet users . "
" I expect a broad debate ... in which I will push the position ' delete , not block ' , " said the minister during an interview with the Hamburger Abendblatt regional daily newspaper .
Blocking vs deleting A spokeswoman for the UK Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) said both blocking and deleting had their merits .
" We are clear about what blocking can do , " she said .
" It can stop inadvertent access . "
The IWF is the UK's " notice and take down " agency .
When notified about illegal content it can remove it if it is hosted in Britain .
The IWF has reciprocal agreements with similar agencies in 35 other nations which try to get material removed rather than blocked .
But , she added , blocking is a good first step because of the efforts those peddling images of child abuse make to stop the material being removed .
" Commercial content moves around a lot , " she said .
" A mixture of blocking and removal is a good tactic because it 's so dynamic . "
Typically , she said , images of child sex abuse are hosted in regions such as the North America and Europe , where net infrastructure is at its most mature .
This is because , she said , this gives those selling images of abuse plenty of places to which they can move the content .

At least 35 people are dead after female suicide bombers blew themselves up in two Moscow train stations .
In the worst attack in the Russian capital since 2004 , two blasts struck separate stations during the packed morning peak hour commute .
The first bomb exploded just before 8:00 am local time at Lubiyanka station , near the Kremlin and the headquarters of Russia 's Federal Security Bureau .
As many as 20 people were killed .
About 40 minutes later a second explosion struck Park Cultury station , killing as many as 15 people .
There has been no claim of responsibility but suspicion is already falling on groups from the North Caucasus .
In recent months , the Russian government has been fighting a growing Islamist insurgency in the region .
Russian president Dmitri Medvedev condemned the attack and said Russia would fight terrorism " without hesitation and until the end " .
" The policy to suppress terrorism in our country and the fight with terrorism will be continued , " Mr Medvedev was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith condemned the " terrible acts " and said he was unaware of any Australians caught up in the attacks .
" I 'm advised by Australian officials that at this stage there is no evidence or indication that Australians or other foreigners have been caught up in these explosions , " he said .
" We can also vouch for the safety of all Australian officials and their families in Moscow . "
Nine million passengers use the Moscow metro every day and it has been a target for terrorists in the past .
There have been four attacks on Moscow 's trains in the past 15 years , including a bombing in 2004 that left more than 40 people dead .
" Shredded beef , special sauce , ketchup , mayo , lettuce , fried cheese , on a double - fried plantain bun . "
The name of this Venezuelan joint in Elmhurst , Queens , translates to " flattened plantain . "
Guess the otherwise happy looking plantain on the awning is fleeing said smashing .
The jaunty little chap is the first anthropomorphic vegetable I 've seen on a Latin American restaurant sign — usually animals like Pollo Campero 's chicken are depicted urging patrons to consume their brethren .
That frilly bit below the sign proclaims , " El Verdadero Sabor de la Comida Venezolano , " or " the true taste of Venezuelan food . "
As pupusas are to El Salvador , so patacónes are to Venezuela .
The hefty sandwiches resemble burgers , save for one key difference — rather than bread , the " bun " is two disks of flattened plaintain that have been fried twice .
Thanks to a combination of ketchup , mayo and the restaurant 's special sauce ( made from a secret combination of veggies ) this carne mechada patacón ( $ 5 ) smells sort of like a Big Mac , but it 's way better .
Sandwiched between the crunchy , nutty - tasting fried disks is a generous helping of stewed shredded beef , topped with lettuce and the aforementioned condiments .
Those ingredients would be perfectly tasty on their own , but there 's also a small disk of slightly salty fried cheese .
" Shredded beef , special sauce , ketchup , mayo , lettuce , fried cheese , on a double - fried plantain bun , " may not have the same ring as the Big Mac jingle , but a carne mechada patacón is still far more delicious than a Big Mac .
It 's also far messier .
By the end you 'll understand why you were given a generous stack of napkins and a wetnap .
Patacon Pisao also offers several other types of patacon ( pernil , queso , pollo ) as well as an array of arepas and tacuchos .
If you look closely at the sign you will note that the bit of text on the left reads , " Patacon Pisao # 2 . "
The original location is a truck in Inwood that opens in the evening and closes in the wee hours .
Good to know if I ever find myself hungry after a night of hoofing in a Dominican dance hall .

Milton Bradley said unrealistic expectations and poor communication , and not the player himself , were to blame for his struggles during his one season with the Chicago Cubs .
In an interview with The New York Times , Bradley -- who was dealt in the offseason to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Carlos Silva -- pointed to his career record to show what happened in Chicago .
" Two years ago , I played , and I was good , " Bradley told The Times .
" I go to Chicago , not good .
I 've been good my whole career .
So , obviously , it was something with Chicago , not me . "
Bradley , who has played for eight teams in 11 seasons , had a career - best season for the Texas Rangers in 2008 , batting .321 with 22 home runs and 77 RBIs .
Looking to add left - handed punch to their lineup , the Cubs signed Bradley to a three - year , $ 30 million contract before the 2009 season .
Bradley struggled to live up to the contract and manage the pressures of playing in a big market .
He batted .257 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs .
" Just no communication , " Bradley told the paper , referring to his Cubs tenure .
" I never hit more than 22 homers in my career , and all of a sudden I get to Chicago and they expect me to hit 30 .
It does n't make sense .
History tells you I 'm not going to hit that many .
Just a lot of things that try to make me a player I 'm not . "
Cubs manager Lou Piniella on Thursday disagreed with Bradley 's assertion .
" We expected him to bat fifth in our lineup , " Piniella said .
" Milton did get off to a struggling start for us in 2009 but that was last year .
We wish him well , and we hope Silva does well here . "
The Mariners are counting on Bradley , a .277 career hitter , to be their No. 3 hitter .
" We made the deal because we were looking for someone to hit in the middle of our lineup , " Mariners general manager Jack Zduriencik told the paper .
" Milton fit that spot .
We like what goes on here .
We have a lot of faith and trust in [ manager ]
Don [ Wakamatsu ] .
He allows players to be who they are , and that 's all we want Milton to do :
Come here and be a productive player for us , and have fun .
That 's the environment we want to create . "

The ABC ’s Hungry Beast recently conducted an extensive interview with the Australian Classification Board ’s Greg Scott about the censorship of the female anatomy , in particular the vagina .
It ’s part of a story on Labiaplasty .
I suggest you watch it below and read the complete transcript here ( as well as check out interviews with a doctor and soft porn graphic artist here ) .
When shown images of female genitalia , it ’s no surprise that Mr Scott is unable a lot of the time to give a definite and clear response as to whether the image would be banned .
It ’s another case of the ACB ’s lack of clear guidelines resulting in some pretty inconsistent decision making .
Mr Scott even acknowledges the fact :
Hungry Beast : I guess just a clear explanation of what genital detail means ?
Cos while I mean , there ’s clear guidelines for you guys some of the words used are quite vague - Greg Scott : Yeah yeah , well they ’re vague for us too sometimes .
And do n’t we know it .
Check out the blog of Hungry Beast reporter Kirsten Drysdale for some further insight .
Get what you DON 'T pay for :
Here are 196 programs that cost nothing but will make your computing life richer all while keeping your wallet fat .
We do n't want to make you feel bad , but , uh ... are you really still paying for software ?
Wow .
Well , we 're here to spread the word :
There 's no lack of free software to be found online .
Some of it is as powerful , if not more so , than the name - brand packages found on shelves at Best Buy for big bucks .
By free , we mean you do n't pay a dime except for what it costs to download and install the software .
There are even times when you do n't have to install anything , since there are a lot of great Web - based applications available these days .
Knowing all this , every year PCMag puts together a fresh look at the Best Free Software .
We check the previous year 's picks to make sure they 've still got the chops ( and the $ 0 price tag ) and cull through other options that have come our way .
We concentrate on productivity apps and utilities for Windows users , but make note when a program also works for Mac OS X and Linux distributions .
Every one of the products in this list that is classified as a Windows product is compatible with XP up to Windows 7 unless otherwise noted .
In addition , we know there 's plenty of free software available for smartphones , so we 've made a notation if the app has a mobile component , but we 'll leave the full list of no - cost apps for your phone to our mobile experts ( See " . " )
Many of the apps rounded up here are also " portable , " meaning that they have versions that can be placed on a USB Flash Drive and run without installation , sometimes as part of the PortableApp.com platform ; we 've marked them as such .
Did we miss any great no -cost programs ?

One fast - growing American industry has become a conspicuous beneficiary of the recession : for - profit colleges and trade schools .
At institutions that train students for careers in areas like health care , computers and food service , enrollments are soaring as people anxious about weak job prospects borrow aggressively to pay tuition that can exceed $ 30,000 a year .
But the profits have come at substantial taxpayer expense while often delivering dubious benefits to students , according to academics and advocates for greater oversight of financial aid .
Critics say many schools exaggerate the value of their degree programs , selling young people on dreams of middle - class wages while setting them up for default on untenable debts , low - wage work and a struggle to avoid poverty .
And the schools are harvesting growing federal student aid dollars , including Pell grants awarded to low - income students .
“ If these programs keep growing , you ’re going to wind up with more and more students who are graduating and can’t find meaningful employment , ” said Rafael I. Pardo , a professor at Seattle University School of Law and an expert on educational finance .
“ They ca n’t generate income needed to pay back their loans , and they ’re going to end up in financial distress . ”

BBC News , Islamabad
India accuses Pakistan of fomenting militancy in Kashmir Pakistan has long been accused of supporting militant groups operating in Kashmir .
As a fledgling peace process between India and Pakistan developed in the years since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US , it was widely believed that Islamabad 's support for militancy had declined .
This has changed once again .
Since 2009 militant activity has been on the increase in the Kashmir region .
After the deadly Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks of 2008 India called off peace talks .
Dialogue resumed in February 2010 but the issue of militancy allegedly supported by Pakistan remains high on India 's agenda .
Pakistan 's government denies any knowledge of Kashmir militant groups increasing their activities .
First rebellions Initially militant groups in Kashmir appeared to be operating on their own - but there is evidence to suggest that they are once again under the protection of Pakistan 's intelligence establishment .
Training camps are once again being set up on the Pakistani - controlled side of Kashmir .
WHO ARE THE MILITANTS ?
Hizbul Mujahideen Lashkar -e- Taiba Harkatul Mujahideen Jaish-e- Mohammad
Banned Pakistani groups ' expand '
Recruitment is also up in Pakistan 's Punjab province , which has provided most of the shaheeds or " martyrs " for the militants .
In fact , so emboldened have the militants become , that one militant alliance , the United Jihad Council ( UJC ) , held a public meeting for militants in Muzaffarabad in mid-January 2010 .
The meeting was chaired by , among others , former ISI chief Lt Gen Hamid Gul .
It called for a reinvigorated jihad ( holy war ) until Kashmir was free of " Indian occupation " .
This call has a long history across the disputed territory of Kashmir .
What started as essentially an indigenous popular uprising against Indian rule has undergone many changes .
The insurgency began in the 1980s as a peaceful rebellion but soon became an armed uprising .
The first armed rebel group was the indigenous Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front ( JKLF ) but Islamic militant groups proliferated rapidly .
These groups were part of the legacy of the Soviet Afghan war which had recently ended and spawned " holy warriors " , fired with religious zeal , who sought to carry jihad across the world .
Until the cataclysmic events of 11 September 2001 , these groups effectively ran the insurgency .
Based in Pakistani - administered Kashmir , they found financing and recruited for their activities within Pakistan .
Kashmir is at the heart of decades of hostility between India and Pakistan
In this regard , they are said to have been aided and guided by Pakistan 's intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) .
But this changed after 11 September when the international crackdown on " jihad " finally caught up with the Kashmir militants .
In 2002 , Pakistan 's then President Pervez Musharraf banned the most violent of the militant groups .
He also ordered a reduction in Pakistan 's open support for Kashmir militancy .
This included restructuring the ISI 's Kashmir wing and limiting the movement of militants across the border with India .
Even the Indian authorities agreed that infiltration by militants had become minimal - and had almost completely stopped by 2005 .
This policy remained in force until 2006 - 2007 , when President Musharraf 's career began to unravel .
Attacks in India
Since then , for reasons still not clear , Pakistan 's intelligence apparatus has once again allowed militants to restart the Kashmir campaign of militancy .
There are frequent protests against Indian rule
The essential structure of the Islamic militant groups have remained the same .
While new groups have emerged from time to time , militancy in Kashmir largely centred around three main organisations .
These are the Hizbul Mujahideen ( HuM ) , Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) and Harkatul Mujahideen ( HM ) .
With the late addition of the Jaish - e - Mohammad ( JEM ) , it is these four groups which continue to dominate Kashmir 's militant landscape .
Not much is known about collaboration between the various militant groups , but most say they are members of the United Jihad Council ( UJC ) .
The JEM and the LeT have achieved particular notoriety amongst the Indians .
Both are accused of carrying out audacious attacks on the Indian military in Kashmir .
They are also accused of involvement in numerous other attacks on Indian territory .
The most famous of these are the attacks on the Indian parliament in Delhi in 2001 and those across Mumbai in November 2008 .
The prevailing political sympathies among Kashmir militants is pro-Pakistani - with a heavy emphasis on religion .
However , this may not be entirely true for the separatist political movement represented by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference ( APHC ) - as many of its constituent groups have kept their options open .
The APHC is split between a faction which supports negotiations with the Indian government and a faction which is opposed to such dialogue .
Such ideological differences can also result in friction between the factions of the separatist movement .
Eternal mistrust Many ask why Pakistan appears to be so intent on reviving the Kashmir " jihad " ?
The answer , according to analysts , lies in the eternal mistrust that has plagued the relationship between the neighbours .
Pakistan has cried itself hoarse in recent years about India 's involvement in Afghanistan .
Pakistani authorities have repeatedly accused India of using its increasing influence with the US to foment insurgencies along the country 's western border .
In particular , it points to India 's alleged support of rebels in Balochistan province .
But these words went largely unheeded during the current Afghan war .
Now , the argument goes , elements in Pakistan feel the time is ripe to use Kashmiri jihadis as an additional bargaining chip .
Hawks argue the only way to get a favourable deal with India is to encourage militancy in Kashmir .
That such attacks could in theory lead to a nuclear confrontation between the two sides seems largely overlooked .

It ’s meant to be nice sentiment .
For the past three decades , March means presidential proclamations , specials on TV , a few lessons in the classroom .
Hey , did you know women have been around as long as men ?
No kidding !
And they did stuff too !
It ’s a whole month dedicated to women ’s history .
It involves the standard citations of notable women .
Relearn the names of Susan B. Anthony , Harriet Tubman , Alice Paul .
Did you know Victoria Woodhull was the first woman to run for president ?
Wow .
Did you women did not earn the right to vote until 1920 ?
Wow .
Whether it is the celebration of Black History in February or Asian Pacific American History in May or Hispanic Heritage in September or American Indian Heritage in November , these months that are intended to highlight the contributions of non-white non-males instead seem to trivialize such contributions , to marginalize their historical significance , as if they are not part of the official History ™ on which school children will be tested , but rather , a sub-category of history , fascinating trivia for Jeopardy or pub quizzes , but not critical to understanding the whole of human experience .
Oberlin was the first college to admit women .
Sandra Day O’Connor was the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court .
Here ’s your free basket of fries .
It ’s a way of setting up women as other , as something separate .
There is history , you see , and then there is women ’s history .
This year 's theme is " Writing Women Back into History , " but let ’s be honest .
Those textbooks are n’t going to be rewritten to reflect that re-insertion .
If anything , textbooks are being rewritten to further remove women from history .
In the proposed changes , Susan B . Anthony would be wiped from the history books , along with Florence Nightingale and Shirley Chisholm ( the first black woman elected to Congress ) .
In their place would be Abigail Adams and Phyllis Schlafly , a conservative politician who opposed feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment .
Yeah .
Because we can't have too many women featured in one textbook , and the contributions of Susan B . Anthony pale in comparison to Phyllis Schlafly , who , according to the Texas wingnuts who want to rewrite history , " has played a major role in articulating a viewpoint that is shared , most likely , by a majority of women . "
True to the 30 - year tradition , President Obama issued a proclamation :
Women 's History Month is an opportunity for us to recognize the contributions women have made to our Nation , and to honor those who blazed trails for women 's empowerment and equality .
...
This month , let us carry forth the legacy of our mothers and grandmothers .
As we honor the women who have shaped our Nation , we must remember that we are tasked with writing the next chapter of women 's history .
Only if we teach our daughters that no obstacle is too great for them , that no ceiling can block their ascent , will we inspire them to reach for their highest aspirations and achieve true equality .
Nice sentiments , of course , and President Obama has thus far been a far better president for women than his predecessor -- mostly because he has sought to undo the damage done by his predecessor by reversing the global gag rule , signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , and appointing a second woman to the Supreme Court .
But despite the president 's best intentions , his proclamation furthers the idea that women 's contributions to history are appropriately acknowledged as women 's history , discussed for 31 days out of the year , only to return , on April 1 , to the history , in which women are all but absent .
Women ’s History Month is a gimmick , a quick and patronizing pat on the head , a consolation prize .
It ’s a way of making clear that while there is n’t enough room in the official canon of History According to White Men , we should take a brief moment , once a year , to acknowledge that women played a role in history .
As if these women , these moments in history , do not merit real discussion within the context of history , but rather , outside of it .
Sure , it 's better than nothing .
But it 's not enough .
The solution is not to strip these months of their symbolic recognition , of course , but to transform the symbolism of a single month into a concrete and necessary understanding of history .
To acknowledge such contributions , not just with presidential proclamations , but with a total reformation of how we study history .
To re-insert the " others " back into the history where they have always existed but rarely been acknowledged .
To understand , above all , that every month , every day , should celebrate not his history or her history or their history , but our history .
So that one day we will not need a special month to remind us to stop and say , " Oh yeah , there were women too , " before returning to our regularly scheduled program .

Food marketers are vying harder than ever for your shopping dollar .
They use any of 14,000 additives to make their products last longer , taste fresher or seem more appealing .
The health effects of these compounds , especially in combination , are only gradually becoming apparent .
Read all the details in our four part series highlighting the worst compounds typically added to the food supply .
ARTIFICIAL FLAVORSLike artificial coloring , artificial flavoring is largely found in heavily processed foods and drinks .
These products are so devoid of naturally occurring flavor that inexpensive synthetic versions are used to mimic the real thing .
Artificial flavors fool the consumer into " tasting " raspberries or cheese or avocado while saving manufacturers money .
These flavors are compounded from hundreds of chemicals .
Some imitation vanilla flavorings use ingredients from petroleum or paper - mill waste .
The presence of many artificial flavorings indicates that the product is compensating for real flavor found in real foods , herbs and spices .
Packaging often trumpets the presence of " natural flavor " in products also riddled with artificial flavoring and minimal food value .
Artificial flavorings may contain substances such as hydrolyzed vegetable protein or monosodium glutamate which are not separately listed on the package .
Food manufacturers have the right to make flavorings a trade secret , giving little to no information about the actual flavoring ingredients .
ASPARTAMEThis artificial sweetener is found in a great variety of foods , many marketed as healthy .
These include diet beverages , frozen desserts , drink mixes , oral hygiene and pharmaceutical products , ready to eat gelatin and pudding , chewing gum , coffee flavoring and snack foods .
Aspartame is of particular danger to individuals with a disorder called phenylketonuria ( PKU ) who are unable to metabolize phenylalanine , one of the two amino acids in aspartame .
One out of every 15,000 babies in the U.S. is born with this inherited disorder and can suffer mental retardation if aspartame is ingested .
Although promoted for weight loss , two Purdue University studies found that artificial sweeteners may disrupt the body 's ability to correctly interpret calorie intake .
" The body 's natural ability to regulate food intake and body weight may be weakened when this natural relationship is impaired by artificial sweeteners , " said one of the researchers , Terry Davidson .
The researchers also noted an increase in obesity during the same time span that the use of artificial sweeteners increased .
According to Dr. Russell L. Blaylock , author of , aspartame is linked to cancer and neurological problems .
Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) lists aspartame on the foods to avoid list as a possible neurotoxin and as a likely cancer risk .

Myki's creator Kamco is being sued in the Supreme Court for $ 30 million by the rival firm that created Metcard .
In an increasingly bitter fight with Kamco , Metcard 's creator ERG is also holding myki equipment hostage until unpaid bills worth $ 1.8 million are settled .
The state government says it has assurances from Kamco that it will not be bankrupted by the two legal actions .
But opposition transport spokesman Terry Mulder said more proof was needed that taxpayers would not have to throw more money into the myki fiasco as a result of the court actions .
Myki is a reuseable public transport ticket for most of Victoria that will cost $ 1.35 billion to create and run for a decade .
Devoted to the art of making movies without using movie cameras , the Disposable Film Festival found the perfect poster child in Memoirs of a Scanner .
The short film came about when three University of Southern California - groomed filmmakers used an HP photo scanner to shoot 300 live - action scans that were then strung together with an audio track to tell a tale packed with alienation , sex and violence .
Damon Stea of Mindfruit Studios made Memoirs of a Scanner with Cassandra Chowdhury and Zack DeZon .
“ The shoot probably took around six hours of pure , unadulterated face - to - the - scanner animating , followed by pickup shots of all the papers and transitions , ” Stea said .
“ Editing was pretty quick as well — it was a remarkably simple process to actually complete . ”
Stea , a double - major in cinema production and videogame design at USC , ran into one technical difficulty .
“ It was hard to do lighting for a machine that was never meant to see a human face , ” he said .
“ I tried to create a background that pleased me and fit with the aesthetic , but in the end , the scanner had a plan for the light and we worked with the hardware rather than fighting it . ”
Memoirs of a Scanner is one of more than 50 films on tap at the four - day Disposable Film Festival , which opens Thursday in San Francisco .
Now in its third year , the festival shows work produced with single - use video cameras , cellphones , point - and - shoot cameras , webcams , computer screen - capture software and other image - capture devices .
Noting that similar festivals have sprung up in Amsterdam , Paris , London , Japan and Brazil , festival co-founder Carlton Evans explains the disposable DIY aesthetic : “ If you have a strong concept , you can take whatever you have and make a film . ”

Keith Davison was placed on the sex offenders register for life
How criminals are caught by relative 's DNA A rapist has been jailed after he was caught when a DNA sample given by his daughter for an assault implicated him in an attack in 1990 .
Police had exhausted all leads when a sample from Keith Davison 's daughter linked him to the rape of a 24 - year - old waitress in Ryde on the Isle of Wight .
Davison , 52 , of Ryde , was convicted of rape in January and jailed for eight years at Portsmouth Crown Court .
His daughter gave a DNA sample when she was cautioned for an assault in 2006 .
A technique known as familial searching linked DNA from the crime scene to his daughter 's sample .
Davison , of Binstead Hill , voluntarily provided a sample which showed a match and he was charged .
The victim had started to walk home along Ryde seafront at about midnight following her shift at a fast food outlet on 4 August , 1990 , the court heard .
I hope my experience can encourage more victims to have the confidence to report rape offences
Keith Davison 's victim Davison approached her from behind , put his T - shirt over her head and attacked her .
Police had no suspects until advancements in technology meant a DNA profile from material found at the crime scene was obtained in 2004 , but there were no matches on the national database .
The breakthrough came when Davison 's daughter gave a sample in 2006 .
Davison 's victim , who legally cannot be named , said : " Eight years in prison is a good result but no sentence will undo the harm I have suffered .
" At least now I can hope to move forward .
' Suicidal thoughts ' " I hope my experience can encourage more victims to have the confidence to report rape offences . "
The court heard the victim knew of Davison as their children went to the same school .
" He was just someone I would see across the playground .
" I only ever saw a brief glimpse of the attacker but Davison was always someone I felt jumpy near and avoided . "
Judge Ian Pearson told Davison : " [ The attack ] has had a significant effect on her life , depression , anxiety attacks , suicidal thoughts , panic attacks .
" The scientific evidence was overwhelming but you chose to challenge that evidence .
" You attacked a lone woman at night , blindfolded her and gagged her . "
Det Ch Insp Bob Maker , head of CID on the Isle of Wight , said : " It is a very serious crime and our thoughts are with the victim and victim 's family .
" In some ways this is some closure for the victim and that 's our primary concern . "
Davison was also put on the sex offenders register for life .

Those who are familiar with my comments on this site will know that I am highly critical of religion .
This is mainly due to a lack of evidence for a god or gods .
However , the misogyny contained within most holy texts , which I feel is endemic in the three major monotheistic creeds , is one of the reasons why I am so vocal in this criticism .
Today , though , I ’m posting about the opposite problem : misogyny and sexism within the atheist community .
I wish it did n’t exist , but it does , and I want to add my voice to that of Skeptifem , who flagged up this issue in November last year .
Atheism , as a movement , prides itself on being freethinking , educated and enlightened ; however some of the most vocal proponents of this white male - dominated scene display disgraceful misogynist attitudes which are rarely publicly criticised by other atheists .
Christopher Hitchens , a man who was recently very eloquent in his criticism of the Catholic Church at a recent televised debate , also wrote this Vanity Fair article – a ridiculous woman - hating salvo containing some disturbingly predatory language – and has referred to comedian Wanda Sykes as “ the black dyke ” .
Bill Maher , star of the film ‘ Religulous ’ , has also made plenty of nasty sexist comments , including “ jokes ” about domestic violence .
It does n’t stop with the ‘ famous ’ atheists .
Like any person subscribing to a particular worldview , I seek like - minded people .
This is why I joined the forum at RichardDawkins .
net *.
I was open about my feminism , thinking it would n’t be a big deal within a community of enlightened freethinkers ; this was a mistake .
Last year , I started a thread asking users whether they had experienced sexism on the forum or within the atheist community generally .
It was a simple enough question , and boy was I unprepared for the torrent of vitriol that was about to flow my way .
I was told that I had a chip on my shoulder ; I was pointedly asked , apropos of nothing , what I planned to do about the lack of male primary school teachers (?! ) ;
I was told I was oversensitive and overreacting , that if I found anything offensive on the forum then that was my problem , and that as I was openly feminist my posts could n’t possibly be ‘ innocent ’ (! ) and I should expect a hostile response ( asking for it , perhaps ? ) ; I was also targeted by some female users who said that they were n’t offended , so I obviously needed to ‘ lighten up ’ .
Put simply , most of the replies I got would n’t have looked out of place in the Daily Mail or on an MRA website .
Eventually , drained by constant arguing , I ditched the thread and left the forum .
Interestingly , I received a few private messages from female members who said that they had also experienced sexism , but did n’t want to post publicly about it for fear of the hostility turning on them .
Some freethinking community , eh ?
The presence of misogyny , sexism - apologia and anti-feminism within atheist circles makes me feel very let down and disillusioned .
I feel that to be a sexist atheist is to be a hypocrite ; as far as I am concerned , belief in the inferiority of women is as much a faith position as belief in all - powerful supernatural entities .
It seems to me that while all atheists are happy to apply rationality to the idea of a god , some ca n’t – or wo n’t – turn the spotlight of reason onto their own presumptions and prejudices about our human life on Earth .
That , in my opinion , shows weakness , cowardice and selfishness .
How many people are being put off joining the atheist community by attitudes such as these ?
For me , freethought is about questioning all assumptions about our world .
I would like to see more women rise to greater prominence within the atheist community ( such as Ophelia Benson , editor of Butterflies and Wheels , Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Annie Laurie Gaylor , for example ) , I would like to see well - known atheists who do not make a habit of spewing misogyny , such as Richard Dawkins and PZ Myers , be more openly critical of those who do , and fundamentally I would like to see debunking of all prejudices as standard within sceptical thinking .
The evidence for this happening is not encouraging at present – perhaps I will just have to ‘ have faith ’ ?

Nashville , Tennessee ( CNN ) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin drew many standing ovations from a friendly crowd Saturday night as she blasted Washington Democrats and the Obama administration in a keynote speech for what was billed as the first national Tea Party Convention .
" It 's so inspiring to see real people , not politicos , inside - the - beltway professionals , come out , stand up and speak out for common - sense conservative principles , " Palin said .
Palin sought to hold Washington accountable as she took on a number of issues , including national security , the economy , and the recent election of Republican Scott Brown to the Massachusetts Senate seat left vacant by the late Ted Kennedy .
" America is ready for another revolution and you are a part of this , " Palin said .
She called the Tea Party movement a " ground - up call to action that is forcing both parties to change the way they 're doing business . "
Palin gave particular attention to Brown 's election , calling him a representative " of this beautiful movement . "
" If there 's hope in Massachusetts , there 's hope everywhere , " she said .
" His victory is a sign of more good things to come . "
She called on the administration to take note of the election results , saying " you better stop lecturing and start listening . "
" The Obama - Pelosi - Reid agenda will leave us less secure , more in debt and under the thumb of big government , " she added , saying voters all over the country are sending a message that they want change in Washington .
She harkened Obama 's famous campaign slogan , asking , " How 's that hope -y , change -y stuff working out for you ? "
Palin answers questions
On national security , Palin said Americans have grown uneasy in the wake of an attempted Christmas Day terror attack aboard a U.S. - bound flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands .
She called on the administration to be transparent about threats facing the country .
" It 's not politicizing our security to discuss our concerns because Americans deserve to know the truths about the threats that we face , " she said , criticizing Obama 's approach to foreign policy with such hostile regimes as Iran .
On the economy , Palin said " we are drowning in national debt and many of us have had enough , " calling for a number of different reforms .
Palin was the darling of many conservatives when she served as the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee , which she said Saturday night was " the honor of a lifetime . "
Many of those attending the convention at Nashville 's Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center said they are big Palin supporters .
Tea Party meets in Nashville
Pam Silleman , a 52 - year - old small business owner and Tea Party activist who traveled to the convention from California 's Napa Valley , called Palin " the Tea Party 's inspiration . "
Asked if Palin , who is considered a possible contender for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination , should make a bid for the White House , Silleman said , " I would like to see her in a higher office but I do n't know that she 'll do it .
I would n't want her to be hurt that bad . "
Fremont Brown , a supporter who had " Palin 2012 " bumper stickers with him , said Palin is " the right person . "
" She has fervent heart and she 's conservative , " added the 59 - year - old Brown , who owns a small business in North Carolina .
" She was the only one truly qualified with executive experience of the four who ran in 2008 .
The others were glorified lobbyists . "
If Palin does make a stab at presidential politics , she 'll have a natural following among Tea Party activists , whose grass - roots network is fueled by anger over the growth of the federal government and President Obama 's policies .
Neither the Tea Party Nation , the group that organized the convention , nor a Palin spokeswoman would confirm reports that the former governor is getting paid about $ 100,000 for her keynote appearance .
" I will not benefit financially from speaking at this event , " Palin said in a statement this week .
" Any compensation for my appearance will go right back to the cause . "
In a blog post on the conservative Web site Townhall.com this past week , Palin said she looks forward to greater participation with the Tea Party movement in the coming weeks .
She said she will be on hand next month for a kickoff rally for the third Tea Party Express , a cross-country bus caravan .
The event will take place March 27 in Searchlight , Nevada , the hometown of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who finds himself in a tough re-election battle this year .
Palin also said she will attend an April 14 Tea Party rally in Boston .

A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. national poll released Friday indicates that Americans are split on Palin , with 43 percent seeing her in a positive light and 46 percent holding an unfavorable view .
" Opinion on Sarah Palin breaks down along party lines , with 7 in 10 Democrats disliking her and 7 in 10 Republicans with a positive view of Palin .
She has a net - negative rating among Independents : 42 percent favorable and 47 percent unfavorable , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" She also continues to rate better among men than women . "
iReport : React to Tea Party convention , Palin speech
Palin's experience has frequently been called into question , most recently in a book that chronicles the 2008 campaign .
" Game Change " by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann largely portrays the then - vice presidential candidate as wholly unprepared for the national stage and poorly versed in a range of pressing issues .
The book also alleges McCain aides quickly grew troubled with Palin 's lack of understanding on key issues , including the job of the Federal Reserve , the difference between North Korea and South Korea , and the purpose of the war in Afghanistan .
Palin has called the book " a bunch of BS from [ McCain campaign manager Steve ] Schmidt and those guys , " Palin said .
" It 's pretty made up . "

According to the Congressional Research Service , the deal appeared to violate the Iran Sanctions Act , meaning Daelim could have faced a range of punishments , including denial of federal contracts .
That is because the law covers not only direct investments , such as the purchase of shares and deals that yield royalties , but also contracts similar to Daelim ’s to manage oil and gas development projects .
But in 2009 the United States Army awarded the company a $ 111 million contract to build housing in a military base in South Korea .
Just months later , Daelim , which disputes that its contracts violated the letter of the law , announced a new $ 600 million deal to help develop the South Pars gas field in Iran .
Now , though , frustration over Iran ’s intransigence has spawned a growing , if still piecemeal , movement to more effectively use the power of the government purse to turn companies away from investing there .
Nineteen states — including New York , California and Florida — have rules that bar or discourage their pension funds from investing in companies that do certain types of business in Iran .
Congress is considering legislation that would have the federal government follow suit , by mandating that companies that invest in Iran ’s energy industry be denied federal contracts .
The provision is modeled on an existing law dealing with war - torn Sudan .
Obama administration officials , while indicating that they were open to the idea , called it only one variable in a complex equation .
Right now , the president ’s priority is on breaking down Chinese resistance to the new United Nations sanctions , which apply across borders and are aimed squarely at entities that support Iran ’s nuclear program .
But Representative Ron Klein , a Florida Democrat who wrote the contracting provision moving through Congress with the help of a lobbying group called United Against Nuclear Iran , said it offered a way forward with or without international agreement .
“ We need to send a strong message to corporations that we ’re not going to continue to allow them to economically enable the Iranian government to continue to do what they have been doing , ” Mr. Klein said .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Corey Haim , a Hollywood teen star of the 1980s who became as famous for his struggles with substance abuse as his acting , died in Los Angeles of an apparent drug overdose , police said on Wednesday .
He was 38 .
Haim , who rose to the fame alongside fellow teen star Corey Feldman and became known for his hard partying ways , was pronounced dead at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank early on Wednesday , according to Los Angeles police .
“ It was an apparent overdose , ” said Sergeant Frank Albarren of the Los Angeles Police Department ’s North Hollywood Station , adding the “ type of medication ” was unknown .
In the 1980s , the Canadian - born Haim first came to international prominence in the 1986 movie “ Lucas , ” alongside Charlie Sheen and Winona Ryder , followed by his biggest hit , “ The Lost Boys , ” with Kiefer Sutherland , Jason Patric and Corey Feldman , as well as “ License to Drive , ” also with Feldman .
He became known for his on - screen partnership and off - screen friendship with Feldman , who also struggled with drug abuse and they often were called “ The Two Coreys . ”
The pair starred in a reality TV series of the same name on American cable television in 2006 , but it was canceled before finishing the second season .
According to U.S. media reports , Haim was found unresponsive in his apartment and an investigation is continuing .
After battling a drug habit for years , he openly talked about overcoming his addictions around the time he was promoting his reality television series and said that he had become clean and sober .

A stain on the history of videogames .
Valve has declared that Portal 2 is its greatest triumph yet , even though it 's not even finished .
Speaking with 1UP , Gabe Newell stated that it's " pretty clear " to his internal team that the long - awaited sequel is absolutely amazing .
" One of the nice things about The Orange Box was it allowed us to try out a couple of different things , and Portal really seemed to resonate , " explains Newell .
" We got the signals that we wanted -- this is what people liked ; this is what people did n't like .
And to us , it was like , ' OK now we know how to take this big , ' so that 's what we 're going to do with Portal 2 .
" Oh Portal 2 's great .
It 's the best game we 've ever done . "
Usually I 'd warn against hype , but if any company is good at making games live up to the PR nonsense , it 's Valve .
I can't wait to see what the team manages to do with Portal 2 .
If it 's the best thing Valve 's ever done , it 's probably going to be really , really good .

Over the course of American history , there has been no greater conflict of visions than that between Thomas Jeffersons voluntary republic , founded on the natural right of peaceful secession , and Abraham Lincolns permanent empire , founded on the violent denial of that same right .
That these two men somehow shared a common commitment to liberty is a lie so monstrous and so absurd that its pervasiveness in popular culture utterly defies logic .
After all , Jefferson stated unequivocally in the Declaration of Independence that , at any point , it may become
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natures God entitle them
And , having done so , he said , it is the peoples right
to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Contrast that clear articulation of natural law with Abraham Lincolns first inaugural address , where he flatly rejected the notion that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed .
Instead , Lincoln claimed that , despite the clear wording of the Tenth Amendment ,
no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union ; [ and ] resolves and ordinances [ such as the Declaration of Independence ] to that effect are legally void
King George III agreed .
The Real Lincoln : A Ne ... Dilorenzo , Thomas J. Best Price : $ 4.25 Buy New $ 7.48 ( as of 07:05 EST - Details )
Furthermore , Lincoln claimed the right of a king to collect his federal tribute , by violence if necessary .
Without even bothering to pretend such authority existed in the Constitution , Lincoln offered ( and eventually carried out ) a thinly veiled threat that
beyond what may be necessary for [ collecting taxes ] , there will be no invasion , no using of force against or among the people anywhere .
In the words of Tony Soprano , pay up and nobody gets hurt .
But perhaps , as some have said , Jefferson intended his Declaration merely as a political tool to justify American independence from Britain .
He surely would never have acknowledged or defended an individual states right to secede from the very union he helped to found .
Except that he did , in his own first inaugural .
Upon assuming the presidency in 1801 , amidst severe political and sectional turmoil , Jefferson said
If there be any among us who wish to dissolve the Union or to change its republican form , let them stand undisturbed , as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it .
In light of these facts , no serious student of history or politics could believe that Jefferson and Lincoln possessed similar visions for America .
Or that Jefferson would have condoned the violent subjugation of a single sovereign state ( let alone 11 of them ) , or thought Lincolns disregard for the Constitution in any way legal or justified .
Rather , he would have known at once that what Lincoln spawned through his belligerence was a government capable of violating its own fundamental law at will ; of using illegal force to prevent the governed from withdrawing voluntary consent ( regardless of their motivation ) , and thereby destroying consent altogether .
Such a government is incapable of liberty , and antithetical to the very existence of Jeffersons America .
For that reason , it is not possible to truly understand , and yet still admire , the words and deeds of both men .
Despite his occasional use of the Declarations language , Lincoln himself despised Jefferson ; demonstrating by his policies that they occupied polar opposite ends of the ideological spectrum , as do their political descendants today .
Mr. Jefferson Nock , Albert J. Best Price : $ 4.24 Buy New $ 15.99 ( as of 11:15 EST - Details )
But , after decades spent trying to ignore or deny the irreconcilable disconnect between these two figures , the political class has succeeded only in perpetuating the contradictory and inherently dishonest character of modern American government .
Though our system is ostensibly rooted in the rule of law and the ideals of liberty , its current nature is really embodied much more accurately by the lawless despotism of our 16th president .
We can not continue to have it both ways .
The preposterous dichotomy between Americas founding principles and the actions of her government , from the War Between the States to the War on Drugs , has predictably eroded that governments moral standing at home , and its credibility around the world .
As a society , we cannot both revere a man whose fierce dedication to the right of political self - determination formed the philosophical foundations of our republic , and at the same time worship a dictator whose arrogant and bloody denial of that right transformed our republic into an empire .
It is time to choose .
If Americans truly are heirs to the Jeffersonian legacy , than it has always been and must always be , not only our right , but our duty as citizens to withdraw consent from any government that becomes destructive of life , liberty , or the pursuit of happiness .
If , however , We the People believe ourselves incompetent to judge when that line has been crossed , then we will continue to find no shortage of political masters eager to carry on Lincolns legacy of contempt for our Constitution , and violent suppression of self - government .
Either way , one thing is certain : America will never regain the principles of her founding until her people muster the courage and clarity to finally separate libertys friends from its foes .

Sometimes we ’re so excited to have President ’s Day off work that we forget what it ’s really about .
President ’s Day honors the birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln .
You might be interested in these Abraham Lincoln facts and trivia .
What follows are some mind - blowing facts about Abraham Lincoln .
Hold on to your stovepipe hats …
10 . Lincoln Under - Utilized his Pockets
Speaking of top hats , Lincoln ’s stovepipe top hat served as more than fashionable headgear .
He used it to store and carry notes , letters , even bills .
Why do they call it a stovepipe hat ?
Well , the rise is so tall and straight with no flair that it resembles a length of pipe .
They ’re hard to come by nowadays , the traditional top hat being much more current , but still pretty “ retro ” .
Best you go to a custom haberdashery to get one made just for you .
9. Lincoln was Really Tall
That stovepipe hat just made a tall guy a whole lot taller .
Lincoln was 6 ’ 4 ” , making him our country ’s tallest president .
That of course raises the question , who was our shortest president ?
That would be our 4th president , James Madison , who stood a stately 5 ’ 4 ” , making him an entire foot shorter than Honest Abe – even without his hat !
8. Lincoln has No Living Heirs
Despite the fact that the marriage between Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln yielded 4 sons , there are no living heirs .
Three of the four sons died before their 20th birthdays : Edward died at 4 years of age , Willie at 12 years , at Tad at 18 .
Robert was the only child who lived into adulthood and his last descendant died sometime in the 1980’s .
7. Lincoln ’s Son was a Death - Magnet
Robert Lincoln was sort of a magnet for tragedy .
More specifically , presidential assassination tragedy .
While he was not present when his dad was killed , he was an eyewitness to Garfield ’s assassination , and at the same World ’s Fair where McKinley was assassinated .
Another interesting fact about Robert , he was saved from a train accident by Edwin Booth , the brother of his father ’s killer , John Wilkes Booth .
6. Lincoln Like to Tinker
Lincoln really liked machines and gadgets .
He liked to take them apart to see how they worked and try to put them together again .
He even tried his hand at inventing , and in 1849 had a patent issued for “ A Device for Buoying Vessels Over Shoals ” .
The machine never made it , but the patent was a new thing for a president , and no president has held a patent since .
5. Lincoln & Kennedy
You did n’t think we ’d leave it out , did you ?
There are some pretty bizarre coincidences between Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy .
Here are a couple :
Both were shot in the head with one bullet on a Friday .
Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846 , Kennedy in 1946 .
Lincoln ’s successor ( named Johnson ) was born in 1808 .
Kennedy ’s successor ( also named Johnson ) was born in 1908 .
4. Lincoln was Kind of Psychic
In the weeks before his death , Lincoln was extremely melancholy .
He had seen portents of his own death , and had been dreaming of death as well .
On one occasion looked in the mirror and saw a double reflection , one image much paler and blurrier than the other .
He told his wife that he thought it meant that he had survived his first term , but would n’t survive his second .
The week prior to his death , Lincoln had a dream of hearing crying in a distant room of the White House .
He sought out the room and found that it had a coffin in it .
He asked the weeping person who had died and the person responded that it was the President .
In his dream , Lincoln looked into the coffin and saw himself .

3. Lincoln Dabbled in the Occult
Not only did he get premonitions , he also believed in the occult .
Well , if he did n’t believe then he was at least willing to go along with it .
Because he and Mary had lost little Edward and Willie at such young ages , they actually held seances in the White House trying to contact their dearly departed .
Mrs. Lincoln also attended seances at the homes of famous mediums of the day .
Whether or not they made contact is unknown .
2. Lincoln was Spiritual , not Religious
Despite the last two facts , Lincoln said he was still a Christian .
He did n’t , however , feel it necessary to subscribe to a particular brand of Christianity .
Though many different sects try to claim him , Lincoln was 100 % non-denominational .
He never joined a church , did n’t say grace before meals , and spoke on a more spiritual level , rather than religious .
He did read the Bible quite often , and did have a highly developed spiritual governance .
When asked if he thought the Lord was on the side of the North in the Civil War , Lincoln responded , “ I am not at all concerned about that …
But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord ’s side . ”
1. Lincoln had a Way with Words
Not only was Lincoln spiritual and intelligent , he was also a heck of a speech writer .
He wrote his own speeches , and it is said that his famous Gettysburg Address was n’t even the best one !
Rumor has it that the speech Lincoln made to the Illinois Republican Convention on May 29 , 1856 was his best , but it was either so enthralling that nobody remembered to take notes , or it was so controversial that nobody was allowed to print them .
Either way , no record of it exists .

THE neat streets of Oslo are not a natural setting for crime fiction .
Nor , with its cows and country smells , is the flat farming land of Sweden 's southern tip .
And Reykjavik , Iceland 's capital , is now associated more with financial misjudgment than gruesome murder .
Yet in the past decade Nordic crime writers have unleashed a wave of detective fiction that is right up there with the work of Dashiell Hammett , Patricia Highsmith , Elmore Leonard and the other crime greats .
Nordic crime today is a publishing phenomenon .
Stieg Larsson 's Millennium trilogy alone has sold 27 m copies , its publishers ' latest figures show , in over 40 countries .
The release this month in Britain and America of “ The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ” , the film of the first Larsson book , will only boost sales .
The transfer to the screen of his sprawling epic ( the author died suddenly in 2004 just as the trilogy was being edited and translated ) will cement the Nordics ' renown .
The more unruly subplots have been eliminated , leaving the hero , a middle - aged financial journalist named Mikael Blomkvist ( Michael Nyqvist ) , and an emotionally damaged computer hacker , Lisbeth Salander ( Noomi Rapace , pictured above ) , at the centre of every scene .
The small screen too has had a recent visit from the Swedish police .
Starting in 2008 , British television viewers have been treated to expensive adaptations of the books of Henning Mankell , featuring Kenneth Branagh as Kurt Wallander .
The BBC series has reawakened interest in Mr Mankell 's nine Wallander books , which make up a large slice of his worldwide sales of 30 m in 40 languages .
Larsson and Mr Mankell are the best - known Nordic crime writers outside the region .
But several others are also beginning to gain recognition abroad , including K.O. Dahl and Karin Fossum from Norway and Ake Edwardson and Hakan Nesser of Sweden .
Iceland , a Nordic country that is not strictly part of Scandinavia , boasts an award winner too .
Arnaldur Indridason 's “ Silence of the Grave ” won the British Crime Writers ' Association Gold Dagger award in 2005 .
“ The Devil 's Star ” by a Norwegian , Jo Nesbo , is published in America this month at the same time as a more recent novel , “ The Snowman ” , is coming out in Britain .
A previous work , “ Nemesis ” , was nominated for the prestigious Edgar Allan Poe crime - writing award , a prize generally dominated by American authors .
Three factors underpin the success of Nordic crime fiction : language , heroes and setting .
Niclas Salomonsson , a literary agent who represents almost all the up and coming Scandinavian crime writers , reckons it is the style of the books , “ realistic , simple and precise … and stripped of unnecessary words ” , that has a lot to do with it .
The plain , direct writing , devoid of metaphor , suits the genre well .
The Nordic detective is often careworn and rumpled .
Mr Mankell 's Wallander is gloomy , troubled and ambivalent about his father .
Mr Indridason 's Inspector Erlendur lives alone after a failed marriage , haunted by the death of his younger brother many years before in a blizzard that he survived .
Mr Nesbo's leading man , Inspector Harry Hole — often horribly drunk — is defiant of his superiors yet loyal to his favoured colleagues .
Most important is the setting .
The countries that the Nordic writers call home are prosperous and organised , a “ soft society ” according to Mr Nesbo .
But the protection offered by a cradle - to - grave welfare system hides a dark underside .
As Mary Evans points out in her recent study , “ The Imagination of Evil ” , the best Scandinavian fiction mines the seam that connects the insiders — the rich and powerful — and the outsiders , represented by the poor , the exploited and the vulnerable .
Larsson is a master at depicting the relationship between business , social hypocrisy and criminal behaviour , and his heroes do not want to be rescued through any form of conventional state intervention .
Analysing Scandinavia and its psyche is nothing new ; Henrik Ibsen did it over a century ago .
But the greatest influence on these rising writers has been Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall , a Swedish couple .
Journalists and committed Marxists , they coauthored the ten-volume Martin Beck series between 1965 and 1975 with the aim of criticising the country 's welfare state .
The central character is a likeable and dedicated policeman with a dry sense of humour .
But the books , which closely study police procedure , feature an ensemble of his colleagues , all believable characters drawn with the lightest of touches .
By turn entertaining and funny examinations of the day - to - day work of policemen , they are also gripping and complex thrillers .
The quality and popularity of crime fiction has given Nordic novelists a prestige that authors from other countries do not enjoy .
This , in turn , has drawn in new writers .
The next potential blockbuster could well be Leif G.W. Persson 's “ Fall of the Welfare State ” — though a more enticing title is planned for its English - language debut .
First published in Sweden in 2002 , it is written by a professor of criminology who has been involved in many of Sweden 's high - profile crime cases and is an epic and ambitious tale spanning several decades of Swedish history .
The cold , dark climate , where doors are bolted and curtains drawn , provides a perfect setting for crime writing .
The nights are long , the liquor hard , the people , according to Mr Nesbo , “ brought up to hide their feelings ” and hold on to their secrets .
If you are driving through Norway at dusk and see a farmhouse with its lights on and its doors open , do not stop , he warns , only half jokingly .
You are as likely to be greeted by a crime scene as a warm welcome .

Andre Agassi , cashing on on the world wide market for a juicy story , hits upon a weakness of the anti-doping fight :
The ability of star power to overcome the rules .
Where is Agassi 's image now - as he says ' Image is Everything " -- when he reveals himself as a drug user and a liar to his sports authorities ?
Agassi's new book reveals that he submitted a urine sample tainted with meth that should revealed to his suspension for a drug of abuse , not a PED .
However , Agasi lied about the meth , a lie which was bought by the tennis anti-doping establishment .
Stories abound about star power tainting the doping fight :
1. Barry Bonds and other MLB stars appear to have been tipped off by someone with deep knowledge of MLB steroids testing
2. Willy Voet 's book -- Breaking the Chain -- documents the skill in the cycling stars to avoid doping tests in events such as the Tour de France .
3. Star Russian track athletes including world champion Yelena Soboleva were tipped off to doping tests , prior to the olympics .
One wonders the extent of the cheating based on star power throughout sports ( and society in general ) .
Obviously the playing field is not equal .
Little guys are going to face more sanctions that the stars ( generally speaking ) .
The truth of the corruption ( which it is ) often does n't come out , as the stars reap the rewards .
Kinda like the man said about the NCAA ...
Trees frame life , providing shade , oxygen , food , homes , heat and of course , building materials .
Trees are universal , they house our swings and tree houses ; they overlook our first kisses and marriage proposals .
There are an estimated 100,000 different species of trees comprising a quarter of all living plant species around the world .
Spread among the billions of trees around the globe are a few special ones , especially worthy of attention .
Here are seven of the world 's most amazing trees .
1 of 9 Giant Sequoia : General Sherman Photo : Bryan Siders / flickr General Sherman makes the list for being ... huge !
This redwood tree is located in Sequoia National Park in California and is believed to be between 2,300 and 2,700 years old .
It towers about 275 feet above the ground , is the largest non-clonal tree in the world by volume , and is more than 100 feet around at the base .
2 of 9 Quaking aspen : Pando Photo : Ken Lund / flickr Pando , or the Trembling Giant , is a remarkable massive colony of a single quaking aspen trees spread over more than 100 acres in Utah .
Every tree in the area shoots from a single organism , and they share a giant underground root system .
It 's estimated that Pando collectively weighs 6,615 tons , making it the heaviest living organism on the planet .

It measures more than 119 feet around but is only 116 feet high ( To put that in perspective , the General Sherman is 275 feet high and 102 feet around ) .
It 's believed that the tree is about 2,000 years old .
Local legend holds that the tree was planted 1,400 years ago by a priest of the Aztec storm god .
According to National Geographic , it is the inspiration for an annual festival in Oaxaca celebrated on the second Monday of October .

The world 's tallest known tropical tree — the height of 20 London double - decker buses or 65 people standing on each other 's shoulders — was discovered recently in a rain forest in Malaysia .
Nearly 294 feet high , the yellow Meranti tree is a species that can be grown in the computer game Minecraft .
The only way to measure the exact height of a tree that tall is to climb it .
Tree expert Unding Jami ran into problems when he reached the top , according to the University of Cambridge , which led the expedition .
Jami confirmed his measurement , then texted , " I do n’t have time to take photos using a good camera because there ’s an eagle around that keeps trying to attack me and also lots of bees flying around . ”

The massive tree had the ignoble fate of having a tunnel carved through its base more than 60 years ago and is now the centerpiece of a 200 - acre grove of redwoods .
For $ 3 , you can drive your car through the tree — unless you are driving a Winnebago — and set up a picnic at its base .

The Tree of Life in Bahrain is one of the world 's loneliest trees .
The mesquite tree sits at the highest point in the barren desert of Bahrain , hundreds of miles from the another natural tree and is thought to have tap roots reaching hundreds of feet down to aquifers .
The exact age of the tree is unknown though it 's generally believed to be more than 400 years old .
7 of 9 Wollemi pine Photo : J Brew / flickr The Wollemi pine in Australia is a living dinosaur .
The oldest Wollemi tree fossil has been dated to 200 million years ago .
When a living Wollemi — which is n't technically a pine tree — was discovered in 1994 , scientists were stunned .
The exact location of the pines has been kept under wraps to protect the fewer than 100 trees known to be growing in the wild .
In a bid to keep the trees from slipping into extinction , a propagation program was started in 2006 that allowed the general public to purchase a Wollemi sapling and they can be seen in various botanical gardens .
Australia 's New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage calls it an " insurance policy " to save the species .
The program appears to be successful .
In 2018 , " some 83 percent of the insurance Wollemi pines are surviving and have increased in size by up to 37 percent — making them mature enough to produce potentially viable seeds much earlier than expected , " NSW Environment Minister Gabrielle Upton told NDTV .

This famous tree near Natal , Brazil , is a 177 - year - old cashew tree covering nearly 2 acres of ground .
It was planted in 1888 by a fisherman who was unaware that the tree had a genetic mutation that would allow it to eventually take over so much space .
When the branches of the Pirangi tree touch the ground , it puts down roots and keeps growing , unlike a typical cashew tree .
Today the tree is a tourist attraction and park located a few hundred yards from the beach .
This 3D image , obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope , shows a single isolated atomic vacancy .
The scientists identified the presence of a sharp resonance peak on top of individual vacancies , which can be associated with a magnetic moment .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Physicists have found that , by removing individual atoms from a graphite surface , they can create local magnetic moments in the graphite .
The discovery could lead to techniques to artificially create magnets that are nonmetallic and biocompatible , as well as cheaper and lighter than current magnets .
The scientists , Miguel Ugeda , Ivan Brihuega , and José Gómez - Rodríguez , all from the Autonomous University of Madrid , along with Francisco Guinea from the Institute of Materials Science of Madrid , have published the results of their study in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
“ It is a pressing challenge of nanotechnology to be able to integrate graphene in real electronic devices , ” Brihuega told PhysOrg.com .
“ To this end , it is mandatory to understand how the presence of single atomic defects modifies its properties .
In our work , we use a scanning tunneling microscope in ultra-clean environments to address such a fundamental question for a graphene - like system , a graphite surface .
Our main result is our capability to examine at the atomic scale the intrinsic impact that each single carbon atom removed from the surface has in the electronic and magnetic properties of the system . ”
As the scientists explain , creating atomic vacancies in graphene - like materials by removing atoms has a strong impact on the mechanical , electronic , and magnetic properties of the materials .
In previous studies , researchers have investigated the effects of atomic vacancies on the properties of the material as a whole .
In the current study , the scientists wanted to probe deeper and see what happens at each individual vacancy .
In their experiments , the physicists used highly ordered pyrolytic graphite , which consists of stacked graphene sheets that follow the AB - AB stacking sequence .
This means that one graphene sheet ( B ) is slightly shifted with respect to the upper layer ( A ) in such a way that half of the carbon atoms of the upper sheet A have a carbon atom located exactly below them , while the other half do not .
First , the researchers peeled off some upper graphene sheets in ultra-clean environments in order to ensure that the top graphene sheet , i.e. the graphite surface , was completely free of impurities .
Then they created single vacancies by applying low - energy ion irradiation , using just enough energy to displace the surface atoms and produce atomic point defects .
Using a homemade low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope , the scientists could identify the presence of a sharp resonance peak on top of individual vacancies .
The resonance peaked around the Fermi level , which has been predicted in many theoretical studies but has never been experimentally observed before now .
As the scientists explain , the resonance at a vacancy can be associated with a magnetic moment .
The vacancies cause nearby electron spins to align due to repulsive electron - electron interactions , which leads to the formation of the magnetic moments .
In addition , vacancies at different sites induce different kinds of magnetic moments , which can interact with each other .
This interaction points to the possibility of inducing a macroscopic ferromagnetic state in the entire graphite material simply by removing random individual carbon atoms .
“ In a pristine carbon system , one would never expect to find magnetism because of the tendency of its electrons to couple in pairs by forming covalent bonds , ” Brihuega explained .
“ The association of electrons in pairs runs against the existence of a net magnetic moment , since the total spin of the electronic bond will be zero .
By removing one carbon atom from the graphite surface , what we do precisely is to break these covalent bonds and as a result we create a localized state with a single unpaired electron that will generate a magnetic moment . ”
Overall , the results not only confirm the accuracy of theoretical models , but also have further implications .
For example , the observed resonances may enhance graphene ’s chemical reactivity .
In terms of applications , the results could lead to innovative magnets .
“ To create a magnet from a pure carbon system is a tantalizing possibility since this would be a metal - free magnet and thus optimal for applications in biomedicine , ” Brihuega said .
“ In addition , it should be much cheaper to produce than conventional magnets since , to give some numbers , a ton of carbon costs around a thousand times less than a ton of nickel ( $ 16 vs. $ 16,000 ) , a commonly used material in actual magnets .
In the case of graphene systems , one would also have flexibility and lightness as additional advantages ; but to date , the total magnetization reported for these systems is very low when compared with the strongest existing magnets .
“ In my opinion , ” he added , “ the brightest future in terms of applications stems in the emerging field of spintronics , i.e. in trying to exploit the ' spin ' of the unpaired electron for creating new spin - based devices . ”

( I 've already seen the questions on Nick
> Wedd 's page , what I want now is some answers to check my ideas against )
Here is something I posted a while back , explaining the ( IMHO ) three most convincing arguments for 1/3 .
Attached at the end are some details for the objective advisor setup .
[ From the postings of mine on Nick 's page , you could probably tell that I was a halfer .
I am now a thirder . ]
Conditionalization Argument
Summary : After waking , if Beauty learns that the day is Monday , then she should think P[ heads ] = 1/2 .
( There is a simple argument for this based on the fact that knowledge of the day was exactly the piece of information she lost by the drug , and she thought P[ heads ] was 1/2 before she lost that information ) .
On the other hand , if she learns that the day is Tuesday , then she should obviously think P[ heads ] =0 .
If she does n't know the day , then the probability must lie somewhere in - between .
Objective Advisor Argument
Summary :
We can arrange for Beauty to meet with an objective advisor to discuss the probability of the coin toss .
We can do it in such a way that the advisors presence can't influence Beauty 's assessment of the coin toss , while the advisor , through Beauty being awake , does gain information supporting a particular outcome of the toss .
Through standard probability techniques the advisor will compute that the probability of heads is only 1/3 , and advise Beauty as such .
If the situation is setup correctly , this can be the case even if Beauty and the advisor disclose every piece of information they have to each other .
* For the record , all attempts to get Beauty to meet with an advisor who thinks that P[ heads ] =1/2 have resulted in Beauty getting new information .
( and that information always allows her to agree with P[ heads ] = 1/2 ) New Information Argument
Summary :
The situation can be modified so that Beauty does seem to receive new information .
Instead of waking her more times when the coin lands tails , instead wake her the same number of times regardless of the toss outcome , always without memory of any other wakening .
Clearly , by symmetry , she should think that heads and tails are just as likely upon waking .
So , suppose that we wait five minutes and then put her back to sleep unless the coin landed tails or it is her first day up .
When she finds that she has not been put back to sleep she has new information which leads her to P[ heads ] = 1/3 .
Further , the cases in which she is awake after five minutes are exactly the cases in the original problem .
-- Details for the Objective Advisor argument --
One day , Sleeping Beauty visits the Institute of Memory Loss to be part of an experiment .
She will be put to sleep on Sunday night , and a coin will be tossed .
If the coin lands heads , then Beauty is woken either on Monday or Tuesday at random .
On tails , she is woken on both Monday and Tuesday , subject to usual memory loss .
In this experiment , Dr. Blue and Dr. Green , the world 's foremost authorities on statistics , are hired to assist Beauty in her probability reasoning .
If the coin landed heads , then one of the Statisticians is chosen randomly to help assist her .
If the coin landed tails , then one of the PhDs gets her on one day , at random , and the other gets her on the other day .
Now , using this setup , lets analyze the situation from Beauty 's perspective in a random wakening .
Clearly , after she wakes up and before she finds out which doctor she will visit , her probability assessments will be just as they are in the original Sleeping Beauty situation .
Now , at that point , she knows that she will either meet with Dr. Blue or Dr. Green , but does n't know which .
Can her probability assessment change when she finds out which will advise her ?
Clearly not .
Both men are , by symmetry , equivalent to her .
One is not any more associated with heads or tails than the other .
Hence , her probability assessment of the coin toss should be the same when she visits her advisor as it was when she woke .
So , what will her advisor say about the probability of heads ?
Well , if the coin had landed heads , then he would only have had a 50 % chance of meeting Beauty .
On the other side of the coin , his meeting her would have been a certainty .
Since he does get to meet her , he will believe that the probability of heads is only 1/3 , when Beauty and him discuss the probability of heads in the coin toss , he will be quite insistent about this ( you know how these Ph.D. types can be ) .
As it stands , it is possible that the Statistician has been able to more accurately assess the situation with the piece of information that he has which she does n't  he knows the day .
Well , lets have him tell Beauty the day .
How can this affect her probability assessment ?
Again , in this variant , it can't .
By symmetry , neither Monday nor Tuesday is more indicative of heads or tails than the other .
After this disclosure , Beauty and her advisor have exactly the same relevant information .
It stands to reason that if they do n't agree on the probabilities at this point , then one of them is wrong .
ARLINGTON , Texas --
Fighting on the star , Manny Pacquiao showed once again why he is such a star .
With the biggest fight crowd in the U.S. in 17 years cheering him on at Cowboys Stadium , Pacquiao dominated a strangely passive Joshua Clottey from the opening bell Saturday night to retain his welterweight title and cement his status as the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world .
The fight was n't close , and it was never in doubt .
It was so one - sided that even those in the cheap seats among the crowd of 50,994 could tell without looking at the giant video screens over the ring that Pacquiao was in total command .
One ringside judge gave Pacquiao every round , while the two others gave him all but one .
The Associated Press scored it a shutout for the Filipino sensation .
It was n't as flashy as his knockout of Ricky Hatton or as savage as the beating he gave Oscar De La Hoya , but there was no doubt Pacquiao was in command the entire way against a fighter who kept his gloves up high in front of his face and chose to engage him only in spurts .
Clottey 's strategy worked to keep him upright , but he was never competitive in the biggest fight of his career .
" He 's a very tough opponent , " Pacquiao said .
" He was looking for a big shot . "
Pacquiao was supposed to have been fighting Floyd Mayweather Jr. instead of Clottey , but the megafight fell apart over a dispute over blood testing .
He took out any frustrations over losing the biggest fight of his career by beating up Clottey on the biggest stage of his career .
" I want that fight , the world wants that fight , but it 's up to him , " Pacquiao said .
" I 'm ready to fight any time . "
That time wo n't come soon .
Mayweather is fighting Shane Mosley on May 1 , and the earliest the two could get together would be in the fall and only if Mayweather backs off his demands for blood testing .

Renting a car at home and abroad – how this guide can help
Most Americans have no idea what to do when offered collision damage waiver ( CDW ) , the expensive add - on coverage offered – often forcefully – by rental car agents , particularly when abroad .
Given the tricky exclusions listed in the fine print of most credit card policies , chances are , you ’re even more confused about what your credit cards cover and if you can get credit card coverage for rental insurance .
We have answers to your big questions – and the questions you need to ask – so you can make an informed decision about whether to pay for the rental company ’s coverage the next time you rent a car , whether you ’re at home or abroad .
General benefits of rental insurance
Some form of rental coverage can be a wise investment because it can offer complete peace of mind .
In other words , you can protect yourself in the event that your auto insurance deductible ends up being more expensive than rental car insurance .
Rental car insurance can also help protect you from a rate increase from your insurance company if you do end up getting a fender - bender while on vacation .
Also , your personal car insurance may not cover the type of rental car you have , so this adds additional protection .
Do your homework ahead of time so you can rest easy , whether you ’re headed to the beach in Florida or zipping around Japan in a Nissan Note .
Traditional car rentals
To find out whether your auto insurance company or credit card company can cover you , start by doing some in - depth sleuthing .
The first thing you need to do is pick up the phone and talk to your auto insurance company , then your credit card company .
It ’s better to have these conversations with an actual agent so you can be sure you ’re getting the right answers for your personal situation .
Personal existing auto insurance
The best part of using your personal auto insurance is that you ’re tapping into something you already have , so you do n’t have to splurge on extra rental insurance .
You might find that :
Your liability insurance would pay up to your policy limits for the damages to other cars or property if you cause an accident .
Collision coverage on your regular policy would pay for accident - related damages to a rental car .
Your comprehensive coverage would cover damages to the rental vehicle not related to a traffic accident , such as theft or vandalism .
There are some potential exclusions , however .
Most auto insurers wo n’t cover you if you rent a car overseas , for example , or if you use the rental for business .
Be sure to specifically ask about these exclusions .
Many policies also decline to pay some of the additional fees that rental car companies typically tack onto the collision bill , potentially leaving you on the hook for hundreds of dollars .
You ’ll also be responsible for paying the deductible .
Utilizing a credit card
The perk of using your credit card for rental car protection is that you already have the card and can automatically get the coverage – no additional coverage is needed .
Generally speaking , credit cards do not cover personal injury or personal liability , although you may have that coverage through your auto insurance and health insurance .
But they do typically cover collision damage and theft protection .
For most credit cards , the coverage is secondary , meaning that if you have car insurance , you have to file a claim there first .
But your credit card should step in and pick up where your auto insurer leaves off , paying the tab for your deductible , towing charges and other fees .
Credit card companies have their own restrictions and exclusions and they , too , often refuse to pay some types of fees levied by car rental companies .
Your credit card company may offer coverage only in certain countries , so before you book your rental , give your credit card company a call to find out if you ’re headed to a country that is n’t covered .
For all these reasons , it ’s important to check your coverage in advance .
Based on all of the information and factors above from both your credit card company and your existing personal insurance company , that ’s when you ’ll need to do some critical thinking in order to determine whether you need more coverage .
Determine whether you want more coverage
If you do decide you need additional coverage , you do n’t have to buy your rental car insurance at the counter .
You can also buy your own separate rental car insurance policy , called a standalone policy .
You must decline the rental car company ’s insurance offer in order to do this .
Finding your own insurance company
If you do decide to get a standalone policy , the benefit is that you can research for a policy at your own pace .
This way , you do n’t have to give a rental car agent an answer about whether you want to purchase insurance within minutes .
Three popular options for standalone policies are Allianz , Bonzah and Insure My Rental Car .
Through a rental car company
Getting car insurance through your rental car company could mean that you pay up to $ 40 per day for coverage , which is pricey compared to a standalone policy or just sticking with your existing auto insurance or credit card company .
The benefit of purchasing right at the counter , however , is that insurance is immediately available to you so you do n’t have to do any research or digging into various policies .
Seriously consider purchasing rental car insurance through your rental car company if you ’re mixing business and pleasure , you do n’t have car insurance or you ’re abroad .
Finally , if you want complete assurance that you ’re insured , opt for the rental car insurance .
Here are the different types of coverage you should know about broken down by carinsurancecomparison.com , no matter which type of insurance you opt for :
Collision Damage Waiver ( CDW ) or Loss Damage Waiver ( LDW )
The CDW is a damage waiver that will pay for all of the repairs to a rental car when it is damaged or stolen .
The loss must happen when an authorized driver is operating the car and during the period when the waiver is valid .
Personal Accident Insurance Pays for emergency medical transport and medical benefits if the renter or their passengers are injured in an accident .
Supplemental Liability Protection
Car insurers are required to provide a limited amount of liability cover , but you can buy a supplemental amount of liability protection that covers you if you are sued .
Anything that is carried by the rental agency is there to protect them and not necessarily you .
Personal Effects Coverage
You most likely will travel with valuable items .
If you lose something of value , Personal Effects Coverage will pay to replace up to $ 500 of your valuables per person .
Make sure you know how your property insurance works first .
Insurance for car - sharing services
Car - sharing services involve getting a car from a neighborhood or your surrounding area for just a few hours .
The nation ’s largest car - sharing service is Zipcar , and insurance is provided to members automatically with its hourly or daily rate .
Zipcar offers combined single limit ( CSL ) of $ 300,000 per accident for drivers 21 and older .
CSL is a third - party liability coverage that covers the cost of injuries or property damage if a Zipcar member is at fault in an accident .
Drivers get personal injury protection ( PIP ) for injuries that you sustain in an accident and the Zipcar is also covered by comprehensive insurance .
The insurance offered by all car - sharing services may not be the same as Zipcar ’s , so read each car - sharing service website carefully , or even better , call the company ’s customer service line .
Insurance for peer - to - peer renting
Peer - to - peer ( P2P ) car sharing means that you rent another person ’s vehicle , typically when the owner is n’t using the car very often .
It can be likened to VRBO – for cars .
As for whether you or the car are insured through a P2P , you ’ll have to check with your insurance provider and determine whether you need to upgrade to have a guest policy .
Note that many car insurance companies have excluded all types of coverage ( liability , medical , physical damage , uninsured motorist coverage ) if you use a P2P vehicle .
Two of the most popular companies in the P2P business are Turo and Getaround .
Did n’t get coverage and it ’s too late now ?
Did you slam on your brakes as fast as you could but an accident happened anyway ?
Rather than beat yourself up about not getting rental car insurance , know which steps you ’ll need to take next .
After you ’ve made sure everyone ’s okay , exchange contact and insurance information with the other party involved in the accident .
Contact your rental car company to inform them of the accident .
Call your own insurance company .
Ask if they will file the accident report with the police or if you will need to do that .
Ask questions about what type of insurance the company offers and what the deductible will be .
Your insurance company will only pay for the results of the damage if it offers first - party coverage .
You ’ll pay rental expenses for the length of time it takes to fix the car , and be sure to ask questions about the costs you ’re responsible for .
It ’s best to never put yourself in a situation where you ’ll need to pay out of pocket unnecessarily .
Prior to getting a rental car , always call your credit card company and auto insurance agent to discuss how you ’re covered .
Also , as soon as you first get the rental car , do n’t drive away immediately .
Write down all flaws , or even better , take pictures of the car and the gas gauge .
You do n’t want to be held responsible for dings or road rash you did n’t cause .
Your vision for Africa 's future is a controversial one .
Do you really believe that aid is dead ?
If aid were a private - sector business or a political system , it would definitely have gone by now .
But here we have a system that has been going on and on and not delivering .
So what 's your solution ?
There is no evidence anywhere on earth that aid has delivered long - term growth .
The countries that have moved hundreds and millions of people out of poverty in our lifetime - China , India , South Africa , Botswana - have not relied on aid to the extent that some African countries do .
Can we have a discussion about that ?
How do you answer those who say aid is essential to development ?
Behind closed doors , pretty much every international aid minister says that there is a fundamental problem with the system .
Many African leaders are on record saying that it does n't work , including Paul Kagame [ of Rwanda ] and Raila Odinga [ of Kenya ] .
What about in a case like Haiti ?
People need jobs .
There is no magic trick .
You need investment and job creation .
Haiti can't come out of this disaster dependent on aid -
it 's not viable .
What do you think of Barack Obama 's attitude to the developing world ?
It is too early to tell .
But , as Africans , we can't continue to depend on the US .
When America has double - digit unemployment , the government 's priority is to provide for its people .
Do n't developing countries need the help of rich ones to mitigate the effects of climate change ?
The people at the forefront of this agenda are not going to be the aid agencies .
In the past , the big development issues were led by western governments and the emerging markets were silent .
But now , we 've got a situation where they are taking much more of a lead .
Do you aim to influence African policy ?
No .
Most of what needs to be done in Africa should be spearheaded by African leaders .
The fundamental problem is that the aid industry has become so pervasive that governments abdicate their responsibilities .
Would you ever get involved in politics ?
I 'm not a politician - it 's not my cup of tea .
I would n't be surprised if I ended up in finance again .
Perhaps in developing markets .
Is there a plan ?
No plan whatsoever .
Life expectancy in Zambia is 39 , so I am just happy to be here .
Has the financial crisis exposed the western economic system as unworkable ?
Quite the contrary .
Unfettered capitalism does not work , but over the past 300 years capitalism has created jobs and reduced poverty .
To turn around and say that it is defunct is really a stretch .
The banks did n't do anything illegal .
It 's completely simplistic to say that they are bad .
As an ex-banker , can you sympathise with the public fury over bank bonuses ?
I do n't think it 's misplaced .
If you are a taxpayer , you should be outraged .
But it requires a more nuanced discussion .
You 're now writing a book on " how the west was lost " .
Can you give us a preview ?
Standard models of economic development have three ingredients : capital , labour and technology .
I 'm looking at how government policies on these have yielded bad outcomes .
What 's your vision of the future ?
By 2027 , China will be the biggest country in the world .
This year is the first year that Europe 's population will decline .
Our populations are changing .
If you want to keep in the game , you have to do something transformational .
Do you want to go back to Zambia ?
Absolutely .
My family is there .
Educated Africans wo n't stay if they are not getting paid what they think they are worth .
But we have seen it in Ghana and Uganda - when things get more transparent , droves of people go home .
Do you vote ?
You would be hard - pressed to find an African - born woman who does n't .
Is there anything you regret ?
I do n't think so .
I am fortunate : my parents told me the world was my oyster , when they could have said I would n't make it for a lot of reasons - rural , girl , small African country .
So , no regrets .
Do some Africans lack that self - belief ?
Many Africans succumb to the idea that they can't do things because of what society says .
Images of Africa are negative - war , corruption , poverty .
We need to be proud of our culture .
Are we all doomed ?
Not at all .
I am an eternal optimist .
Look at me : I 'm from the bowels of Africa , from a country without a coastline .
I could n't even have swum here .
It would be impossible for me to think that we are doomed .
I 'm here , are n't I ?

NDP MP Charlie Angus has shaken up the copyright reform process today with a pair of proposed measures .
The first is a private member 's bill that would expand the scope of the private copying levy to include digital audio recorders ( DARs ) such as iPods .
Bill C-499 comes as a response to earlier court cases that ruled that DARs are beyond the scope of the current law .
The second is a motion ( M - 506 ) that calls for support to reform the Copyright Act 's fair dealing provision by adding the words " such as " to make the current list of fair dealing categories illustrative rather than exhaustive .
In addition , the motion codifies the six criteria discussed in Canadian caselaw for determining whether a particular use of a work qualifies as fair dealing .
I 'm certainly supportive of Angus ' effort to push copyright issues into the spotlight .
I 'm particularly supportive of the motion on fair dealing .
The motion states :
Fair Dealing Provisions within the Copyright Act
That , in the opinion of the House , the government should amend section 29 of the Copyright Act in such a way as to expand the Fair Dealing provisions of the act ; specifically by deleting section 29 .
and inserting the words ,
29 .
Fair dealing of a copyrighted work for purposes such as research , private study , criticism , news reporting or review , is not an infringement of copyright .
29.1
In determining whether the dealing made of a work in any particular case is fair dealing , the factors to be considered shall include ,
( a ) the purpose of the dealing ;
( b ) the character of the dealing ;
( c ) the amount of the dealing ;
( d ) alternatives to the dealing ;
( e ) the nature of the work ; and
( f ) the effect of the dealing on the work .
This approach is precisely what thousands of Canadians supported during last summer 's copyright consultation .
It strikes the right balance – it's fair dealing , not free dealing – and it is based on current Canadian jurisprudence .
Greater fair dealing flexiblity benefits creators , innovators , educators , and the broader public .
The motion deserves strong support from all parties .
The attempt to expand the private copying levy in Bill C-499 is more problematic .
I am not as opposed to private copying as some , but I think expanding the system in this manner raises real concerns .
First , I think we need to work on fixing the system before we work on expanding it .
There are ongoing concerns about distribution of proceeds , copying vs. making available , and overbroad coverage of the levy that should be addressed .
Second , the bill expands the levy to audio recording devices , defined in C - 499 as " a device that contains a permanently embedded data storage medium , including solid state or hard disk , designed , manufactured and advertised for the purpose of copying sound recordings , excluding any prescribed kind of recording device . "
This covers everything – iPods , iPhones , Blackberries , Androids , iPads , personal computers .
While the CPCC ( the private copying collective ) may not target all of these devices , there is nothing in the bill that prevents them from doing so .
Third , the bill deals solely with sound recordings , but there have already been calls to extend to video and other forms of content .
Expanding the levy in this manner without addressing those issues leaves open the prospect of an even bigger levy in the future .
Fourth , the competitive concerns associated with levies on devices cannot be ignored .
The last attempt to place a levy on iPods led to charges as high as $ 75 per device .
That market distortion leads consumers to purchase outside Canada , which means no levy , no sales taxes , and lost retail sales .
Fifth , we need to think about the interaction between private copying and anti-circumvention rules .
The industry is pushing for anti-circumvention rules that would prohibit Canadians from picking the digital lock on copy controls found on CDs .
If Canadians have paid for the right to copy via the levy , surely those rights should not be trumped by the use of DRM .
Yet that is precisely what both Bills C - 60 and C - 61 proposed .
Sixth , the industry cannot have the levy and continue to claim that Canada is an illegal downloading haven .
Canadians have paid more than $ 250 million in fees associated with the levy and the Angus bill would ratchet that up dramatically .
Angus ' comments in the House of Commons this morning are posted below :
Mr. Speaker ,
I rise today to submit a bill to update the Canadian copyright Act , which extends the Private Copying Levy to the next generation of devices that consumers are using for copying sound recordings for personal use .
The private copying levy is a long - standing Canadian solution that has compensated artists for some of the enormous copying that is taking place .
At the same time , updating the levy will provide legal certainty for fans to copy songs onto an i-Pod or MP3 player .
The levy is a compromise that works .
In a world of endless downloading and copying , it provides a monetizing stream for the artists who create such phenomenal cultural works .
Mr. Speaker , there are two dead end roads on the copyright debate .
The first dead end is the belief that digital locks , predatory lawsuits and zero tolerance on access can push consumers back in time .
The other dead end is the belief that all the great works of film , music and art can be looted at will .
If we are going to move down the right road we must get serious about securing a monetizing stream for creators .
Canada has a chance to strike the right balance :
No. 1 : artists have a right to get paid .
This is why I am bringing forward the bill on updating copying levy .
No .
2 . Consumers , educators and researchers have a right to access those works – which is why I will be tabling a motion on defining fair dealing to protect those rights .
Mr. Speaker , the New Democratic Party will continue to work to ensure that copyright laws are updated to protect artists while ensuring access to these amazing works .
Banks named as “ co-conspirators ” in municipal bid-rigging
By Andre Damon
31 March 2010
As states and cities throughout the United States slash social spending to pay their debts , major Wall Street firms have been accused of conspiring to drive up prices on loans to local governments .
Lehman Brothers , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , and UBS , together with over a dozen other financial companies , colluded to drive up interest rates on bonds to states and cities , according to a class - action lawsuit filed by the State of Mississippi , together with other local governments .
The group alleges that these financial companies assigned negotiated bids amongst themselves to limit competition and ensure that cities , states , and small foundations paid them high interest rates on municipal bonds .
Last week , U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero refused a request to block the lawsuit , which was re-filed with more details and fewer defendants , after being tossed out last year .
The case “ is replete with detailed allegations regarding the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy , ” the judge said in allowing the case to go forward .
The accusation by the State of Mississippi overlaps with a criminal investigation into CDR Financial Products Inc. , a financial advisor for local governments .
Charges were filed against the firm alleging that it took kickbacks from major banks in exchange for advising local governments to do business with them .
The alleged payments , ranging from $ 4,500 to $ 475,000 , were paid out between 2001 and 2005 .
Bloomberg News said that the names of co-conspirators was submitted by defense lawyers for a former employee of CDR Financial Products Inc. , which was indicted last year on charges of bid-rigging .
The attorneys specified in their filing that the government had provided the document , which was titled “ list of co-conspirators . ”
In addition to JPMorgan Chase , Lehman and UBS , Bloomberg reported that the list contains the names of more than two dozen bankers at firms including Bank of America Corp. , Bear Stearns Cos. , Societe Generale , two of General Electric Co. ’s financial businesses and Salomon Smith Barney , the former unit of Citigroup .
Defense attorneys for CDR filed a motion to withdraw the filing on March 25 , however , saying the document had been filed “ inadvertently . ”
The request was granted by Judge Victor Marrero , whose office declined to comment on Bloomberg ’s report .
The class - action lawsuit and case against CDR correspond to an ongoing investigation by the SEC and Justice Department , which has thus far subpoenaed over a dozen banks in relation to price - fixing in the municipal bond market .
The document submitted in the case against CDR represented the first time the largest banks were explicitly named as “ co-conspirators ” by the government , the Wall Street Journal wrote .
A representative from the Department of Justice said that its ongoing investigation into the municipal bond industry has resulted in three guilty pleas so far , all from former CDR employees relating to charges filed in October 2009 .
She declined to comment further on the list of co-conspirators .
JPMorgan admitted last year that it was under investigation for “ possible antitrust and securities violations in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteed investment contracts and derivatives to municipal issuers . ”
JPMorgan fired the managing director of its municipal derivatives service in March 2008 after learning he was the subject of an investigation .
Allegations of bid-rigging in the municipal market are emerging as states and municipalities slash spending to meet their debt payments .
As tax revenues have plunged , states have faced extensive budget shortfalls .
These have raised the perceived risk of their defaulting , and consequently the rates charged by banks for financing their debt .
Last week , New York City ’s Health and Hospitals Corporation said it would reduce its workforce by ten percent over the next two years , in an effort to address its budget deficit of over $ 1 billion .
The job cuts , amounting to 2,600 positions , will come on top of reductions of 1,300 jobs this year .
The budget proposed by New York Governor David Paterson would cut over $ 1 billion from state assistance to health care , a quarter of which will come from hospitals .
Such cuts are emblematic of overall actions by states , which have frantically sought to cut costs in order to maintain their credit ratings .
States , led by California and New York , have turned to furloughs , layoffs , and wage freezes in an effort to keep Wall Street from downgrading their credit ratings .
The New York Times , commenting on the danger of state government defaults , wrote that “ states are showing many of the same signs of debt overload that recently took Greece to the brink — budgets that will not balance , accounting that masks debt , the use of derivatives to plug holes , and armies of retired public workers who are counting on benefits that are proving harder and harder to pay . ”
About $ 5 billion in municipal bonds are currently in default .
A series of state failures would far eclipse that amount .
“ The fact that the states ’ debts are n’t as big as Greece ’s does n’t mean [ state defaults ] can’t happen , ” Kenneth S. Rogoff , an economics professor at Harvard and a former research director of the International Monetary Fund , told the Times .
The Best Political Team On Television
Erickson calls Michelle Obama a " marxist harpy wife . "
In a blog post headlined , " Is Obama Shagging Hookers Behind the Media 's Back ? "
Erickson stated , " I assume not .
I assume that Obama 's marxist harpy wife would go Lorena Bobbit on him should he even think about it , but I ask the question to make one simple point : Barack Obama , like Elliott Spitzer , is a creation of the liberal media and , as a result , could be a serial killing transvestite and the media would turn a blind eye . "
Erickson calls Souter a " goat fucking child molester . "
On his Twitter account , Erickson responded to Souter 's retirement from the Supreme Court by stating , " The nation loses the only goat fucking child molester ever to serve on the Supreme Court . "
Erickson : " At what point do the people ... march down to their state legislator 's house , pull him outside , and beat him to a bloody pulp ? "
In a March 31 , 2009 , post on RedState.com discussing a Washington county 's ban on certain kinds of dishwasher detergent , Erickson wrote : " At what point do the people tell the politicians to go to hell ?
At what point do they get off the couch , march down to their state legislator 's house , pull him outside , and beat him to a bloody pulp for being an idiot ? "
Later in the post , Erickson added : " Were I in Washington State , I 'd be cleaning my gun right about now waiting to protect my property from the coming riots or the government apparatchiks coming to enforce nonsensical legislation . "
Erickson : Purpose of Bachmann rally is " to tell Nancy Pelosi and the Congress to send Obama to a death panel . "
In a post on RedState.com , Erickson wrote : " Today , thousands will pour into Washington to tell Nancy Pelosi and the Congress to send Obama to a death panel ( that 's section 1233 of the original legislation ) .
If you need details on where to go in D.C. or if you can't go , but want to show up at your Congresscritter 's local office , go here . "
Erickson later " [ c] larifi[ed ] " that " Americans are sending Obamacare , " not Obama , " to a death panel "
Erickson on Obama 's Nobel Peace Prize : " I did not realize the Nobel Peace Prize had an affirmative action quota . "
In a RedState post discussing Obama 's Nobel Peace Prize , Erickson wrote , " I did not realize the Nobel Peace Prize had an affirmative action quota for it , but that is the only thing I can think of for this news .
There is no way Barack Obama earned it in the nominations period . "
The Department of Defense already has omnipresent eyes in the sky , underwater and , of course , on the ground .
It 's only when you start going underground that the surveillance powers of the Pentagon begin to wane – at least until now .
Just last month , the Pentagon 's risk - taking research arm , DARPA , announced plans for a program called ' Transparent Earth ' .
They 're spending $ 4 million this year on preliminary plans for a digital , 3D map that would display “ the physical , chemical and dynamic properties of the earth down to 5 kilometer depth . ”
But Geospatial Corporation is already doing it .
The company , started in 2005 by longtime water - pipeline manufacturer Mark Smith , uses a proprietary gadget called ' Smart Probe ' to map deep earth via underground pipes .
The company 's probe can be inserted into pipes as small as 1 1 / 2 inches , and then travel their length while taking super - speedy coordinates – 800 per second – and saving them onto a USB key .
The probe is removed , the data extracted , and a 3D map of the underground region is created .
The probe can travel through pipes that are empty , or contain fluid or gas .
Geospatial got started by mapping telecommunication lines for cable companies , and has since moved on to mapping oil and gas lines , waterways and sewage tunnels .
They 're also planning to map entire municipalities , to enable cheaper , faster fixes of infrastructure problems .
Smith tells Danger Room that the company is creating a " mega- map " geographic information system ( GIS ) platform , called GeoUnderground .
" Underground , " he says .
" Is truly the final frontier . "
And the company 's growing a library of data has caught the military 's eye .
The Pentagon has already contracted Geospatial to create 3D maps of the deep earth beneath their " critical facilities . "
The data would be useful in case of terrorist attack , natural disaster , or , of course , a power outage or sewage leak .
Little surprise , then , that homeland security firms are also interested .
Geospatial announced a partnership today with Ridge Global , a firm founded by former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge , which " provides strategic and operational services that advance the security and economic interests of businesses and governments worldwide . "

If you have been in the Rails community for a little while , you have more than likely noticed the love / hate relationship that is entertained by the community vis-à - vis the Enterprise .
Some people hate the enterprise and publicly tell it to go f*ck itself ( 49:39 ) , on the other hand , these same people are also proud to mention that some major players in the industry use Ruby and Rails .
The truth is that even though Ruby and Rails could still be more Enterprise ready , it is already a great combo that big corporations can start using today , and lots of then already do !
Let 's look at the state of Rails and the Enterprise .
So where are we at ?
First things first , Rails was not designed for the enterprise or for the enterprise 's needs .
It was extracted from a successful startup project and has grown with the contribution of people using Rails daily .
But Rails is also based on Ruby which became very popular and started to be used in different places , including NASA , for instance .
37signals still does NOT need " Enterprise features " and therefore do n't expect any 37signals engineers to write an Oracle Adapter or a SOAP layer for ActiveResource and push for their adoption .
Rails is far more than a framework used by 37signals .
It is an Open Source project with code being contributed daily by people on other projects .
Most of the code does not directly benefit 37 signals .
The Enterprise is evolving : economic crisis , a new generation of developers , new management , insane deadlines .
Ruby and Rails have quickly become very attractive for the Enterprise and having big companies acting as startups is often something a lot of managers dream of .
As a matter of fact , here is a quote from Sony Computer Entertainment America 's President & CEO , Jack Tretton : " Be like a multi-billion dollar company on the outside , and act like a startup on the inside " .
This change has taken a while because the Enterprise is a big mammoth ( or insert another of your favorite gigantic , slow - starting animal here ) , but it 's happening .
Communication with / in big companies is not as straight forward as when dealing with startups who need / thrive for the outside attention and who do n't have all the red tape of a PR department , etc .
Here is a simple example : I work for Sony Playstation .
My job description mentioned Redis , MongoDB , EventMachine and many other technologies I did not know Sony was using in production .
I did not realize that my default production stack would be built on Ruby 1.9 .
Communicating when you 're a part of a big company is more challenging than when you are a team of 5 engineers working on a cool project , and therefore a lot of people do n't know what technologies are being used by Company X or Company Y .
Rails is used by lots of big companies .
It might not be obvious and you might have to look at the job offers but people like AT&T , Sony and many others are always looking for talented Ruby developers .
And , even though Java and .NET are still ruling the Enterprise kingdom , dynamic languages are slowly but surely catching up .
Rubyists are climbing the social ladder and are now in positions to push the language they love .
Understanding the Enterprise 's needs
reliability
support
performance
advantage over the competition
integration and transition path
Reliability
It 's kind of hard to define " the Enterprise 's needs " , however I can testify that the needs and requirements of a so called " Enterprise app " are slightly different than those encountered when you work on a startup app .
What the Enterprise needs / wants :
I think that it was proven many many times that Rails scales and can be very reliable as long as you know what you are doing .
We are not talking anymore about a buzz framework that just got realized and that cool kids play with but rather , a stable platform used by some of the most popular web applications out there .
Support
This point is something the Rails community can be proud of .
We have lots of forums , blogs , books , local meetings , conferences ...
Yes , Rails is OpenSource and you can't buy yearly support from the core team but you will find all the help you need out there .
( If you can't , feel free to contact me and I 'll direct you to people who can help , and if you are new to Rails , take a look at http://railsbridge.org/)
Performance
Based on my own experience , the level of performance we have using Ruby and Rails is more than enough for the Enterprise world .
This is especially true with Ruby 1.9 greatly improving performance and Rails3 optimizations .
If you really need part of your code to run as fast as C code , writing a C extension for Ruby is actually quite easy and will solve your speed issues .
Advantage over the competition
Rails comes with certain ways to do things , conventions that will get you up and running in much less time .
Ruby as a language is natural , intuitive and easy to maintain .
By choosing the right tools for your project , you will definitely be able to get more done in less time and increase your business value faster .
Let 's not forget the strong value of testing in the community that will push your team to write tested code and more than likely improve the overall code quality of your products .
Integration and transition path
This is probably the part that is the most challenging when you live in the Enterprise and look into using Ruby & Rails .
I was recently talking to someone from Google who used to do a lot of Ruby before joining the Mountain View - based company .
We were talking about how he loves Ruby but had such a hard time integrating with existing Enterprise solutions .
He mentioned how he got frustrated by the lack of great XML tools , bad / complicated SOAP libraries and a few others I can't remember .
The truth is that when my friend was using Ruby this all was true .
REXML and soap4r are useful but might not perform that well .
Luckily as the community has grown , new tools have come up and today Nokogiri ( developed and maintained by AT&T engineer 's Aaron Patterson ) can easily be used instead of REXML and many libraries are known to be better than soap4r such as savon , handsoap and others .
The other good news is that major IT companies such as Apple , Microsoft and Sun( RIP ) have adopted Ruby and you can now write your code in Ruby and use native libraries from other languages such as Java , .NET or Objective - C .
The transition path can be done smoothly without having to commit to a total rewrite .
Database - wise , Oracle is still a viable option for Rails developers thanks to the Oracle ActiveRecord adapter ( by R.Simanovskis ) .
Note that your DBA might curse you for not doing optimized queries using bind variables and all the Oracle Magic spells , in which case you can use Sequel , a great ORM supporting Oracle , and some of its unique features .
Deployment - wise , you can deploy on IIS , Tomcat , Glassfish , Apache , Nginx , or almost anything mainstream you are already using .
Using Passenger , deployment is as easy as deploying a PHP app and you also get a series of great tools such as Capistrano , Vlad etc ...
So basically , thanks to passionate Rubyists working ' for the man ' such as Aaron Patterson , Raimonds Simanovskis and others , using Ruby in the Enterprise is much much easier .
Ruby and Rails were not initially designed with the Enterprise in mind but with time , the integration has become smoother and both parties can now enjoy reciprocal benefits .
Speed is not a word typically associated with trees ; they can take centuries to grow .
However , a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found evidence that forests in the Eastern United States are growing faster than they have in the past 225 years .
The study offers a rare look at how an ecosystem is responding to climate change .
For more than 20 years forest ecologist Geoffrey Parker has tracked the growth of 55 stands of mixed hardwood forest plots in Maryland .
The plots range in size , and some are as large as 2 acres .
Parker 's research is based at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center , 26 miles east of the nation 's capital .
Parker 's tree censuses have revealed that the forest is packing on weight at a much faster rate than expected .
He and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute postdoctoral fellow Sean McMahon discovered that , on average , the forest is growing an additional 2 tons per acre annually .
That is the equivalent of a tree with a diameter of 2 feet sprouting up over a year .
Forests and their soils store the majority of the Earth 's terrestrial carbon stock .
Small changes in their growth rate can have significant ramifications in weather patterns , nutrient cycles , climate change and biodiversity .
Exactly how these systems will be affected remains to be studied .
Parker and McMahon 's paper focuses on the drivers of the accelerated tree growth .
The chief culprit appears to be climate change , more specifically , the rising levels of atmospheric CO2 , higher temperatures and longer growing seasons .
Assessing how a forest is changing is no easy task .
Forest ecologists know that the trees they study will most likely outlive them .
One way they compensate for this is by creating a " chronosequence " -- a series of forests plots of the same type that are at different developmental stages .
At SERC , Parker meticulously tracks the growth of trees in stands that range from 5 to 225 years old .
This allowed Parker and McMahon to verify that there was accelerated growth in forest stands young and old .
More than 90 % of the stands grew two to four times faster than predicted from the baseline chronosequence .

By grouping the forest stands by age , McMahon and Parker were also able to determine that the faster growth is a recent phenomenon .
If the forest stands had been growing this quickly their entire lives , they would be much larger than they are .
Parker estimates that among himself , his colleague Dawn Miller and a cadre of citizen scientists , they have taken a quarter of a million measurements over the years .
Parker began his tree census work Sept. 8 , 1987 -- his first day on the job .
He measures all trees that are 2 centimeters or more in diameter .
He also identifies the species , marks the tree 's coordinates and notes if it is dead or alive .
By knowing the species and diameter , McMahon is able to calculate the biomass of a tree .
He specializes in the data - analysis side of forest ecology .
" Walking in the woods helps , but so does looking at the numbers , " said McMahon .
He analyzed Parker 's tree censuses but was hungry for more data .
It was not enough to document the faster growth rate ; Parker and McMahon wanted to know why it might be happening .
" We made a list of reasons these forests could be growing faster and then ruled half of them out , " said Parker .
The ones that remained included increased temperature , a longer growing season and increased levels of atmospheric CO2 .
During the past 22 years CO2 levels at SERC have risen 12 % , the mean temperature has increased by nearly three - tenths of a degree and the growing season has lengthened by 7.8 days .
The trees now have more CO2 and an extra week to put on weight .
Parker and McMahon suggest that a combination of these three factors has caused the forest 's accelerated biomass gain .
Ecosystem responses are one of the major uncertainties in predicting the effects of climate change .
Parker thinks there is every reason to believe his study sites are representative of the Eastern deciduous forest , the regional ecosystem that surrounds many of the population centers on the East Coast .
He and McMahon hope other forest ecologists will examine data from their own tree censuses to help determine how widespread the phenomenon is .

BioShock 2 was released yesterday , and it 's great , but some members of the community have voiced disapproval over a widescreen issue that they 've detected .
Apparently the aspect ratio is off and ... wait a minute , was n't this the exact same issue that 2 K had to patch with the original BioShock ?
Apparently so .
For some reason , BioShock 2 managed to import the glitch from its predecessor .
Just like with the last game , 2 K has now had to promise a patch to fix the game 's aspect ratio .
Customers , naturally , are finding this hard to believe .
" How many millions of pounds have you just made from this game ?
You were intending ?
I got aspect ratios working correctly in my first , very basic , very amatuer 3D engine years ago , " complains one forum member .
" It was one of the first things I did as it was fundamental to ' everything else that followed ' .
You already HAD the solution in Bioshock 1's patch . "
2 K has confirmed that , " Yes , there 's a problem , yes , a fix is on the way , yes the view will expand horizontally for you widescreen gamers . "
Weird that 2 K would make the same mistake twice .
Seems to me that 2 K Marin copied a load of code from BioShock and totally forgot that some of the code was borked .
Now we 've all been reminded .

Un príncipe es despojado de su reino y acude con un duque para que le ayude a recuperarlo .
Durante su estancia en los aposentos del duque , el príncipe se enamora de las dos hijas de su anfitrión y ellas , a su vez , del huésped en cuestión .
Así comienza un juego en donde ellas lucharán por el amor del susodicho , mientras que el príncipe deberá decidirse por una de las dos .
La anterior es la premisa de la obra
El príncipe ynocente de Lope de Vega , que reinicia temporada este lunes 5 de febrero en el teatro La Capilla , producida por la compañía Efe Tres , dirigida por Allan Flores , Fernando Memije y Fernando Villa , con la actuación de Fernando Villa y Salvador Petrola .
Allan Flores ahonda sobre el proyecto :
Es de las menos conocidas de Lope de Vega , incluso no hay registro de que se haya montado y eso fue un aliciente .
Entre Fernando Memije , Fernando Villa y yo seleccionamos el texto y montamos el proyecto .
Buscábamos un texto que tuviera un juego interesante a nivel de escena , y que no tuviera corridas de versos largos , sino que fueran cortos y dinámicos .
En el montaje de Allan , la historia presenta una variación interesante : Todo inicia con dos personajes que están en la cárcel y que no tienen nada que hacer , y entonces se ponen a contar la historia del príncipe .
Así que entre los dos , con los recursos que tienen en su celda , interpretan cerca de 16 personajes , en un estilo que se conoce como ñaque .
Los actores están vestidos como presos y los objetos que tiene a la mano son los elementos que utilizamos para el público entienda que interpretan a un personaje determinado : vamos planteando de que la baraja de cartas que usan en prisión se parece al abanico de las damas , así que cuando interpretan a las damas , pues traen su abanico ; el que use un gorrito es el rey ; el recogedor es el bastón del viejito del pueblo , por ejemplo .
Es decir , cada personaje tiene cierto elemento y ayuda para que el público sepa de qué personaje estamos hablando , nos dice Allan .
Para la compañía Efe
Tres , el interés de realizar este montaje responde a la inquietud de ofrecer una obra clásica alejada de todo convencionalismo y de falsos conceptos sobre este tipo de teatro .
Y es que los directores están convencidos de que los temas que se abordan son universales .
Se habla de amor , de abuso de poder y justicia :
El príncipe hace y deshace , y al final es perdonado porque es príncipe , porque es de la realeza y se le puede perdonar todo lo que haga .
La historia tiene sentido para el público actual porque son dos presos que están encerrados injustamente , y cuentan la historia de un príncipe que bien puede ser un político un empresario o un presidente , que roban , que dan pruebas falsas de VIH o tratamientos de quimioterapias que no funcionan y final no les pasa nada , como ocurre con el príncipe .
Los dos presos que llevan años encerrados , son personas normales que no tiene un dedo mágico que los señale y los salve de todas las injusticias , nos dice Allan .
Hace tres meses en el teatro
El granero , El príncipe Ynocente cumplió 100 representaciones , lo que se volvió una sorpresa para todos los que integran la obra :
Es un éxito para un proyecto independiente .
No tenemos a ningún actor súper famoso ni un texto fácilmente digerible , tampoco es la súper producción , pero le apostamos a la teatralidad , a la diversión y a jugar con el texto e involucrar al público .
Posteriormente , lz obra se ha presentado en el foro La gruta ( Centro Cultural Helénico ) y en el foro Antonio López Mancera ( CENART ) .
El príncipe ynocente se presentará todos los lunes de febrero a las 8 de la noche en el teatro La Capilla .

Ramming And Scoring
In short , Republicans like Graham are insisting that the majority - elected Obama must temper his ambitions because of fluctuating and ambiguous polls about health care .
So what if Obama 's approval rating has never fallen below 47 percent in the daily Gallup tracking polls .
Contrast this with Bush in 2001 , who took office with only 51 percent of the American people in a CBS poll believing that he was elected legitimately .
But because Bush was ( wait for it ) a " conviction politician , " he was entitled to pursue his expansive and expensive ( in budget terms ) agenda starting with massive tax cuts .
As Rove writes with almost an audible sneer in his words that the Democrats " were surprised that he did n't come to them on bended knee . "

Things being such a hit with the Netflix viewers , this fictitious sci- fi horror series has successfully made the audience wait anxiously post each of its seasons for its next season .
similar is with Season 4 .
The story revolves around a boy , Will , who goes missing under the most unreal circumstances and there is no clue about his whereabouts .
An unrelated girl named Eleven , with psychokinetic powers is helping in the search of the boy .
The Story so far
Eleven is a girl who is being experimented upon by scientists for their various gruesome research .
Also , there is the presence of a deathless evil monster Mind Flayer , who is taking on to destroy the whole town .
The story so far has proceeded to the rescue of the Will with the help of his friends , accompanied by Eleven , his mother ( Joyce ) and the police chief officer ( Jim Hopper ) .
Eventually , Will is rescued from a surreal place called the Upside Down but Eleven vanishes by the end of season 3 .
Is Eleven the villain with a new face ?
Very recently , confirmation has been announced regarding season 4 and almost immediately begins the analysis of the story as to what is expected in season 4 .
The biggest among them being , “ Will Eleven be seen as the new villain in season 4 ? “
According to the theory and the analysis that has been made , there is a strong possibility that Eleven is the villain .
As seen in Season 3 , everyone remembers the gruesome scene where MindFlayer bites and rips apart part of eleven ’s flesh from her leg .
This is conclusive that Eleven is now open to infection and is very vulnerable to MindFlayer ’s vile actions .
This can be assumed here that it will make Eleven stay under the influence of MindFlayer and make handicapped and unable to use her powers .
MindFlayer may govern all her actions , making her the villain with a new face .
There are many more theories that can be discerned out of the story so far , but all these are just assumptions .
To know what really is in store for the audience , we have to wait for the release of the next season .
The legal high drug mephedrone will be banned within weeks , Alan Johnson , the home secretary , announced today .
Emergency legislation classifying mephedrone as a class B drug comes after Johnson 's expert drug advisers disclosed that the drug has been implicated in 25 deaths in England and Scotland .
The ban is expected to gain cross-party support to be rushed through both houses of parliament in the four remaining sitting days before the general election .
The decision to push ahead with legislation comes despite the resignation of a further member of the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , which left a legal question mark .
Johnson has brushed aside the effects of the latest resignation , that of Dr Polly Taylor , a consultant veterinary surgeon , whose decision to quit leaves the ACMD inquorate and technically unable to make a recommendation to the home secretary .
Home Office lawyers are confident that the ban can go ahead .
Taylor 's term on the council was due to end shortly and candidates have already been interviewed for her place .
The decision to classify mephedrone as a class B drug alongside the amphetamines it imitates will also extend to other cathinones which have been synthesised by south - east Asian chemists from the active ingredient in the plant qat .
Professor Les Iversen , who chairs the ACMD , said that the rise in popularity of mephedrone – also known as meow meow or drone – was unprecedented : " I have never experienced such a widespread use in such a short space of time .
There is no question this is the drug of the moment , " he told the ACMD meeting today in London .
" It is being taken by young people who have never taken drugs before in their lives because they think it is legal and it is safe .
It is neither legal nor safe . "
He said the figure of 18 possible mephedrone - related deaths in England was based on data from the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths , which collates information from police forces and forensic labs .
Iversen said they were regarded as the most reliable source but cautioned he was only saying the drug was possibly implicated in those deaths .
Full postmortems have yet to be carried out .
A further seven cases have been reported in Scotland , although only one so far has been confirmed as a mephedrone - related death and the heroin substitute methadone was also reported to be a factor in the case .
How can Super Surfaces be implemented .
Common methods for implementing tiling engines .
Use cases for Super Surfaces
pygame already has a sub- surface , which is part of a larger surface .
Sub -surfaces refer to the same pixels as the surface they come from , and share the same Interface as a Surface .
It 's good for doing sprite sheets , where you save one file with many smaller images - but then being able to manipulate them as if you loaded the images as smaller separate surfaces .
However , sometimes we would like to operate on a whole bunch of smaller surfaces stuck together .
This is what I 'd like to call a Super Surface - a collection of smaller surfaces which can act as one big surface .
It 's a complementary idea to the sub - surface , and intuitively it should be there ... but it 's not yet .
Unfortunately it 's a lot harder to code a Super Surface compared to a sub-surface .
Since a Super Surface would need to have all the surface affecting routines changed to work with it .
For example , everything in the draw modules would need to be redone .
So would all of the surface methods .
So when you draw a line on a super surface , it should affect all of the sub - surfaces .
Still trying to think of a simple / clever way of implementing it efficiently , without having to recode all of the drawing / blitting routines .
However , just like how sub - surfaces in pygame can simplify code immensely - so too will Super Surfaces .
One method , might be to do a rect translation , and then broadcast the translated method calls over the sub surfaces of the Super Surface .
So we translate the rects into the sub - surface coordinate space from the Super Surfaces coordinate space .
I'm not so sure if we can get a function pointer to a method from within the function pointer itself with the python C API .
This would simplify it , because the translate - and - broadcast functionality could be implemented in one place and reused within all of the various surface affecting routines automatically .
Something to research ... Super Surfaces share a lot of the same properties a tiling engine .
So how are tiling engines implemented ?
A common way for tiling engines to work is to have the images being placed in a grid , and for each of the sub - surfaces to be the same size .
So the image at [ 0 ] [ 0 ] in the array is at those coordinates .
This simplifies the implementation , but is not very flexible .
A slightly more complex way to implement it is to have each sub surface have its position stored relative to the super surface .
This complicates the clipping a little , and for speedy use it really requires a spatial hash ... like a quadtree .
So I 'm thinking of doing the more free form implementation ... probably just a naive implementation to start with ... then perhaps a quatree version as an improvement .
It would be better to use a spatial hash more efficient at moving elements - but that could be a third improvement .
Use cases include viewing massive images .
Much graphics hardware has texture size limits , so it is common to combine many smaller textures when drawing larger images .
Another common use case is for ' tile engines ' .
Where tile engines show a larger image made up of many smaller images .
To allow using different image formats for different parts of an image is another use case .
For example , a piece of the image which is just black only needs a few bytes to represent the image ... it does not need 32 bits per pixel .
Whereas the part of the image which includes a persons face with 50 % transparency will require 32 bits per pixel for sure .
This will save memory , and increase speed .
It increases speed , because it is possible less memory bandwidth means faster operations .
Also , less complicated blending - or more optimized blitting can happen ( eg , fast 8 bit Run Length Encoding blitters ) .
This should be possible with no extra effort from the programmer too .
Finally , by using smaller sub - surfaces it in effect becomes a tiling engine automatically .
Tiling in graphics is used to split operations up easily .
This gives memory , and speed advantages .
By processing a tile at a time - you only need to have those tiles in memory at that time .
It also gives easy parallelism , since the separate tiles are a form of data parallelism ( which is the easiest type ) .
For some hardware , it is possible to use parallelism when the surfaces are kept separate .
I'm interested in any comments , especially if you 've made a tiling engine like this before ?

Acid attacks are becoming more and more common in Cambodia
Som Bunnarith adjusts his wrap - around sunglasses , turns on the Casio and gives the keys an experimental tinkle .
Satisfied that everything is working as it should , he fires up the drum machine and , as his hands move across the instrument , he starts to croon in an easy - on - the - ear tenor .
Yet Bunnarith is not a professional musician .
He only took up keyboards and singing as therapy after what he calls " the incident " .
It seems an innocuous word for such an horrific and life - changing event .
Bunnarith 's wife believed that he had been having an affair with another woman ; in a fit of jealousy she threw acid over her husband .
Feeling his skin burning , Bunnarith ran to a nearby river to try to wash off the acid .
But it was too late for his eyes ; when he emerged from the water he realised that he was blind .
That was four years ago .
Only now , thanks to music and help from CASC , the Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity , has Bunnarith started to come to terms with what happened to him .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In the immediate aftermath of the attack , the future looked bleak .
" I felt that I had lost everything ; I did not want to live any more , " he says .
" Because I was blind I stayed at home , and nobody took care of me .
My wife and children went out to work and study - but I felt like I was in prison . "
Before the attack , Bunnarith had worked in marketing for a soft drinks company .
He enjoyed a decent salary and his children went to good schools .
But the terrible scars on his face and body , along with his blindness , brought his career to an end .
In a society which places great emphasis on " face " , Bunnarith 's no longer fitted .
Acid attack survivors frequently suffer in this way .
Their injuries are compounded by discrimination and stigmatisation - particularly for women .
Until recently acid attacks typically involved aggrieved wives attacking their husband 's mistresses , or vice versa .
That meant many victims would have to endure comments about their moral conduct , and whether they were the authors of their own misfortune .
But over the past few months , the nature - and number - of attacks has changed .
The 11 incidents reported in the first two months of 2010 almost equalled the total for the whole of the previous year .
And where Bunnarith used to stand out as a rare male at survivors ' meetings , an increasing number of men have joined him .
" It has become a lot more democratic , " says Jim Gollogly , a British - born doctor who founded CASC .
" Some husbands have poured acid over their wives ; some wives have poured acid over their husbands . "
" And we have two young girls here who were clearly not in any love triangle - but their mother was involved in a business dispute . "
No justice
The consequences are horrific .
Dr Gollogly is brisk and businesslike as he conducts his rounds in a cramped ward at the Children 's Surgical Centre in Phnom Penh , one of the few places in Cambodia which is equipped to treat acid burns .
But a first - time visitor would wince at the array of twisted skin , melted eyes and gnarled limbs which the patients are waiting to have treated .
Acid attacks leave the victims in need of long - term medical care Dr Gollogly thinks that a relatively simple measure would prevent many future acid attacks from taking place .
" What they have to do here is control the sale of acid , " he says .
" Here you buy a car battery in the market , and the seller has to put acid in it .
So the acid is there and it is very cheap .
Although there are laws governing it , they do not seem to be enforced . "
The recent spate of incidents has at least prompted the government to review the laws which cover acid attacks .
It is proposing some restrictions on the sale of acid , as well as stronger penalties for those who carry out attacks .
Such preventative action would be too late to help people like Bunnarith .
The best he can hope for is a better quality of life ; the music lessons he has been getting , courtesy of CASC , may eventually allow him to become a professional performer and earn an income once again .
CASC has also constructed a centre on the outskirts of Phnom Penh where it is helping survivors with physical therapy and vocational training .
But for many of them , a sense of injustice is as deeply ingrained as their scars .
Thong Kham describes herself as the victim of Cambodia 's first acid attack , in 1990 .
Sitting at a shady table in the garden of the CASC centre , she fights back the tears to get her message across .
" I do not think the courts have seriously punished the perpetrators , " she says .
" That is why the number of acid attacks has increased . "
" The authorities should arrest and punish the perpetrators - following the model of other countries .
The government should implement the law . "

At the heart of Apple 's very serious charges against HTC -- among the most prominent manufacturers of Android - based phones today -- is whether the methodology Android uses to run Java programs using a specialized derivative of the Java Virtual Machine , called Dalvik , actually borrowed ( or stole ) ideas directly from the NeXT operating system .
NeXTSTEP , you may recall , included radical innovations to the system kernel enabling inter-application communication ( IAC ) , on a level far beyond anything Macintosh had used at the time .
It was Steve Jobs ' revenge against the company that had spurned him , and as history has borne out , Jobs was the victor in that little skirmish .
One of the ten patents Apple is defending in its lawsuit against HTC , drafted yesterday and filed this morning in US District Court in Delaware , deals specifically with NeXT 's methodology .
Apple acquired NeXT at the end of 1996 , which is how Jobs re-entered the universe of Apple -- many believe , to have saved the company .
Earlier that year , NeXT received a patent on a framework for IAC designed to compete with COM / DCOM and CORBA , the two other leading object methodologies of the time .
Though the complaint Apple filed with the US International Trade Commission this morning was officially under seal , it managed to get posted to Scribd this afternoon .
Advertisement
Apple 's complaint describes the concept behind the first of its ten defended patents briefly : " As a general rule , separate processes execute independently ( even when they may be executed simultaneously ) , and software within one process cannot directly access resources from or make calls on software within another process .
Conventional methods for inter-process communication often required the software programmer to understand and utilize low - level operating system functionalities .
The ' 721 patent describes a more efficient method for inter-process communication by way of a proxy object , which exists in a local process and acts as a local representation of objects that are located in a different process . "
The typical problem with objects , or object - oriented components , in an operating system is that they do n't really speak each other 's language -- or more accurately , that they do n't have a common language to speak .
In Microsoft 's COM , still at the heart of Windows , that problem is resolved through the System Registry .
Windows components all share a few common functions , whose sole purpose is to enable them to discover one another .
Once they 've done that , they can share information from the Registry to connect them with each other 's interfaces , and from there , they acquire each other 's vernacular of functions they can perform .
I 've often said it 's not so much like two foreign objects learning a common language , as much as deciding what storage room they can meet in that contains enough other objects they can point to , so they can identify what it is they want for now .
NeXT handled this problem differently , innovating new concepts that would replace COM 's mutual interface exchange with what many at the time felt to be a more elegant methodology .
The kernel of the NeXT operating system ( and successors based on it , including the current MacOS X ) is called Mach .
Instead of relying upon binary interfaces , Mach let developers write IAC messages using Objective - C -- a language that for many years has been Apple 's ace - in - the - hole .
Mach handled all the translation , into streams of primitives that are shared with other objects using Internet - like communications protocols .
Although objects still communicated with each other by way of proxy , as was the case with COM , the stream they set up with one another was a port .
All the objects that have rights to communicate on that port , formed a domain .
From Apple's/NeXT's US Patent # 5,481,721 , which is central to the dispute : " The present invention provides a means for implementing an extensible , distributed program in which one task is responsible for creating other tasks to communicate with .
This is a master / slave relationship ; the master can provide the slave with send rights to the master 's port as part of the creation process .
When the slave starts executing , it sends a Mach message containing send rights to its port and a token for its first proxy back to the master .
The master then replies with an indication of whether the connection is granted , and what token to use for the first proxy .
This ' bootstrap - meta - protocol ' results in both tasks knowing about each other , allowing communication to ensue . "
What the objects say to one another over this shared port is almost immaterial to the patent ; it 's the method through which the port is negotiated and managed around which Mach 's technology , and its associated patent , are based .
The concepts you 've just read about up to this point may become the critical points of debate over the next few years , assuming Apple 's case against Android goes to trial , and also assuming ( quite likely ) that it will involve more competitive manufacturers than HTC .
It 's one thing to be open , but you can't open somebody else 's ideas .
But did Android do that ?
Even prior to today 's case , there 's actually been considerable debate among developers over why Android did not appear to take the Objective - C route .
Android 's runtime interpreter is a kind of Java that is n't really Java .
That is to say , Android 's Dalvik runs Java code , but it compiles it down to a different bytecode than a true Java virtual machine ( VM ) .
The Android Developers ' forum explains that the system does this for relative efficiency : " Every Android application runs in its own process , with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine .
Dalvik has been written so that a device can run multiple VMs efficiently .
The Dalvik VM executes files in the Dalvik Executable ( .dex ) format which is optimized for minimal memory footprint .
The VM is register - based , and runs classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into the .dex format by the included ' dx ' tool . "
Certainly it may seem efficient from the point of view of a developer who simply wants to get his app built .
But in terms of processing efficiency , there 's considerable complaint that Dalvik is actually inefficient , evidence for which appears in Google 's own benchmark results for Dalvik apps compared to Sun Java and complied C .
While NeXT 's patented IAC process adopts an elegant communications scheme , Dalvik approaches the problem of sharing via a more direct , if costly , route -- efficient in the sense that it does n't appear to require a patent to explain it .
Seattle - based mobile software engineer Koushik Dutta cast a sharp spotlight on what he considered Android 's inefficiencies , in a post for his personal blog in January 2009 , comparing Dalvik to what he perceived as the much more efficient scheme adopted by Mono , the open source , cross- platform work - alike to Microsoft 's .
NET : " The two line summary is that Dalvik is designed to minimize memory usage by maximizing shared memory .
The memory that Dalvik is sharing are the common framework dex files and application dex files ( dex is the byte code the Dalvik interpreter runs ) .
The first thing that bugged me about this design , is that sharing the code segments of dex files would be completely unnecessary if the applications were purely native .
In Linux , the code segments of libraries are shared by all processes anyways .
So , realistically , there is no benefit in doing this .
" If the battery is the primary constraint on the device , why is Dalvik so concerned with minimizing memory usage ? "
Dutta continued .
" I am by no means a VM design guru ... but I can say the following with certainty ... Battery life is primarily affected by how much you tax the processor and the other hardware components of the device , especially the use of 3G / EDGE and Wi-Fi radios .
Interpreting byte code will tax the processor and thus the battery much more than native / JIT [ just - in - time ] code ... Modern ( Dream / iPhone comparable ) hardware running Windows Mobile is rarely memory constrained , and they do n't have a fancy memory sharing runtime ...
If all applications can suspend and restore at the system 's whim , then memory consumption is trivialized . "
Dutta 's explanation , in summary , appears to contrast the architecture of operating systems that adopt the principle of minimizing their memory footprints ( Android ) against those that take the more direct approach of suspending some apps for others to run ( iPhone ) .
Here 's where it is important to note that Apple does not appear to be defending its iPhone , but rather technologies that are actually more relevant to MacOS .
Nevertheless , it may be the very inefficiencies that Dutta pointed out , that could be Android 's saving grace in its upcoming battle against Apple .
If Android is indeed as inefficient as some say it is , it may not be violating anyone 's patent at all .

From the Greeks on down , strategic planning has often been seen as what ’s needed whenever the future is worth contemplating .
While the model has changed a bit over time , the iteration we are most familiar with is :
Vision ( preferred future )
Goals ( needed to achieve that future )
Strategies ( the big steps we will take to achieve the goals )
Tactics ( the little steps that get the big steps accomplished )
Then we plot all these along a three to five year time frame and go to work .
And , just as we get started something changes .
We get the big grant , or we do n’t get the big grant ; the artistic director announces they are leaving ; or staying ; someone invents the internet ; the economy crashes ; our city starts losing 50,000 people a year .
And in the midst of all this we ’re stuck with our strategic plan .
We ca n’t just throw it away , we spent so much time on it .
We paid consultants to help us , the Board chair is really proud of her efforts to get it done .
We ’ve already sent it to the foundation with our grant application .
Yes , we have our roadmap , but this does n’t feel like the interstate any more .
It ’s more like a rafting trip on the Colorado , wild , unpredictable , invigorating .
With no rest stops , just rapids , boulders , spray , and a lot of screams — some of sheer terror , and occasionally of sheer glee !
Stress is high , control non-existent .
The last thing we need is a roadmap .
So , what is required on such a wild and compelling ride ?
1 . A unifying belief the journey is worthwhile
What do we , as an organization , care about and why does it matter to each of us ?
2. Trust :
When someone points starboard and says , “ There ’s a boulder ! ”
There probably is one .
How can we learn to listen and hear the views of all those who are committed to our vision ?
3 . An acceptance of the power of external forces , and our lack of control over them
What is happening in the world around us and how should we respond ?
4 . A collective determination to meet those forces and maneuver through them
What commitments are we making to each other in order to see this through ?
5 . A willingness to take stock , to learn quickly from each maneuver
What lessons are we learning and how rapidly are we changing in response to those lessons ?
A few hours , maybe a couple of days wrestling with these questions can prove more beneficial that six months of trying to predict the future through classic strategic planning .
Gather together , ask hard questions , then jump back in the whitewater .
Enjoy the ride !

Kakabeka Falls is the Niagara Falls of the North
Kakabeka Falls is a large powerful waterfall that drops some 130 feet in two drops along the Kaministiquia River in the Canadian Province of Ontario that is often called the Niagara Falls of the North .
Image Source
In addition to dropping 130 feet Kakabeka Falls is well over 200 feet in width and the flow of water here is quite impressive even though a large part of the water flow that used to go over Kakabeka Falls is now diverted for hydroelectric power generation .
Compare the two photos directly below to see the difference in water flow .
The 2nd photo is after rain and shows what Kakabeka might have been like all time before much of the water being diverted for energy production .

The real Niagara Falls also has a large part of its water flow diverted for power generation .
During the peak tourist season at Niagara Falls half the water flow is required to go over the falls and not be diverted to the hydroelectric power plants during daylight hours .
But after midnight until dawn 75 % of the water flow over Niagara Falls is allowed to be used for power generation .

Kakabeka comes from an Ojibwa Indian word that means " water over a cliff " or " waterfall over a cliff " .
There is an interesting and entertaining Ojibwa legend concerning Kakabeka Falls .
An Ojibwa princess named Greenmantle was captured alone in the woods by an invading force of Sioux warriors and they tried to force her to lead them to the main Ojibwa camp .
Greenmantle lead the warriors down the Kaministiquia River towards the Ojibwa camp and as they approached Kakabeka Falls Greenmantle at the last second diverted her canoe towards shore and jumped out and swam to safety and ran to warn her tribe of the invaders .
Many of the Sioux warriors unaware of Kakabeka Falls went right over the waterfall and plunged to their deaths and the remaining Sioux forces were soon defeated at a battle on the Welcome Islands near Thunder Bay .
In other versions of the story Greenmantle went over the falls herself and perished while saving her people .

Kabeka Falls is located in the Kabeka Falls Provincial Park which was established to protect the falls in 1955 and is managed by the Ontario Parks Department .
The Kaministiquia River was used for centuries beginning back in the late 1600's by fur trappers and hunters known as Voyageurs to reach the interior sections of the northwest parts of North America and Canada but they had to take a 1 mile portage to get around Kakabeka Falls .

Famed Canadian landscape painter Lucius Richard O'Brien and female English painter Frances Anne Hopkins both painted famous pictures of Kakabeka Falls back in the 1800's .
O'Brien 's painting of Kakabeka Falls is on display at the National Gallery of Canada and you can see Hopkins painting below .

Regulator Ofcom has told Sky it must cut the price it charges rival cable , terrestrial and internet broadcasters to show its premium sports channels .
The broadcaster will have to sell Sky Sports 1 and 2 for up to 23 % less than the current wholesale price .
The decision - part of the result of a three - year inquiry - aims to offer viewers more choice of pay - TV services .
Sky said it would appeal against the " unwarranted intervention " , arguing it would be to the detriment of consumers .
" This is a marketplace where customers are well served with high levels of choice and innovation , " Sky said .
" Consumers will not benefit if regulators blunt incentives to invest and take risks . "
Sky will have to sell Sky Sports 1 and 2 for £ 10.63 a month each - 23.4 % less than at present .
If the two channels are sold together , Ofcom has set a price of £ 17.14 - a discount of 10.5 % on current wholesale charges .
' Ill - judged ' Bodies representing football , rugby and cricket - which rely on lucrative TV rights deals - fear the decision will mean less money going into sport and will impact their ability to invest in grassroots participation .
ANALYSIS For Ofcom , the goal is to increase the availability of live sport ... and in movies to see the development of on - demand services on broadband
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
It may force sports , football in particular , to finally confront a threat far greater than any media watchdog - namely the exorbitant sums of money paid to players
David Bond , BBC sports editor
Q&A : What it means for you Send us your comments Richard Scudamore , chief executive of the Premier League , criticised Ofcom 's decision as " ill - judged and disproportionate " .
He said : " [ Ofcom 's ] proposed action will strip out competition for sports rights and hugely reduce the incentives of all bidders , Sky included , to invest in sports rights .
" The effect will be to subsidise companies that have shown little appetite for investing in our content and fundamentally damage the investment models that have helped sport become a successful part of the UK economy and made sport so attractive to UK consumers .
" Of course , we will be considering Ofcom 's findings in full and do not rule out a challenge to protect the interests of fans , clubs and the wider game , " he added .
The Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) said it was seeking legal advice on the ruling .
" Ofcom 's proposed approach effectively confiscates our rights and donates them to organisations who have consistently declined to invest in sports rights despite having balance sheets that dwarf Sky's , " RFU chief executive Francis Baron said .
' Not far enough ' Ofcom said its decisions would come into effect immediately , meaning consumers should start to see new TV packages in time for the start of the next football season .

BT Vision said it hoped to offer Sky Sports 1 and 2 cheaper than Sky by then .
But it added : " Ofcom should have gone much further than it did .
" They should have included all Sky Sports channels , not just two .
The wholesale price for the two sports channels is higher than the regulator had previously suggested . "
It also complained that Ofcom had not set a regulated price for HD channels .
' Innovative services '
As part of what could be a major shake - up of the pay - TV industry , Sky has also been given permission to offer pay - TV services on Freeview , replacing Sky 's current free channels .
This , however , is conditional on Sky implementing the wholesale part of the deal , Ofcom said .
If it decides to offer movie channels on digital terrestrial , it must also offer these to competitors such as BT vision and Top Up TV , the regulator added .
The move could mean 10 million Freeview - only homes having access to Sky 's premium sport channels for the first time .
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
Ofcom estimates this could lead to up to two million more people subscribing to premium TV channels in the next five years .
" Consumers will in the future enjoy a greater range of innovative services following fresh investment by competing pay - TV providers , " it said .
The broadcast regulator also found that Sky 's dominance in the supply of premium movies was restricting viewer choice , particularly when it comes to video - on - demand services .
However , it said it did not have the necessary powers to address these concerns and proposed referring the matter to the Competition Commission for them to look into .
Competitors had hoped that Ofcom would also set lower wholesale prices for film channels .
Ofcom 's inquiry began in 2007 after BT , Virgin , Top Up TV and the now defunct Setanta , expressed concerns about Sky 's dominance of the pay - TV industry .
It has an estimated 85 % of the market .
Sky shares were the biggest risers on the FTSE by midday , up almost 3 % at 599 pence .

Elite Few Can Multitask Driving And Cell Phone
Are you a member of the 2.5 % cognitive elite who can talk on the cell phone while driving without suffering reduced driving ability ?
SALT LAKE CITY , March 29 , 2010 
A new study from University of Utah psychologists found a small group of people with an extraordinary ability to multitask : Unlike 97.5 percent of those studied , they can safely drive while chatting on a cell phone .
These individuals  described by the researchers as " supertaskers "  constitute only 2.5 percent of the population .
They are so named for their ability to successfully do two things at once : in this case , talk on a cell phone while operating a driving simulator without noticeable impairment .
The study , conducted by psychologists Jason Watson and David Strayer , is now in press for publication later this year in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review .
This finding is important not because it shows people can drive well while on the phone  the study confirms that the vast majority cannot  but because it challenges current theories of multitasking .
Further research may lead eventually to new understanding of regions of the brain that are responsible for supertaskers ' extraordinary performance .
Researchers at the University of Minnesota have created a molecular image of a system that moves electrons between proteins in cells .
The achievement is a breakthrough for biology and could provide insights to minimize energy loss in other systems , from nanoscale devices to moving electricity around the country .
The research , led by Carrie Wilmot , an associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences , is published in the March 12 issue of Science .
" Evolution has been fine - tuning electricity in organisms for a lot longer than humans have been using it , " Wilmot says .
" We can learn a lot from nature about how to use it more efficiently .
This new glimpse at how the body uses electricity could lead to nanotechnology to shrink electronic circuitry even further or a more efficient grid to provide power to homes and businesses . "
Energy generated by intracellular movement of electrons is the fundamental power source that enables humans to exist .
As electrons move within cells , energy is channeled to create complex molecules , such as protein and DNA .
These are the building materials that enable organisms to grow , maintain themselves , and store energy .
Wilmot 's images , obtained using x-ray crystallography , will advance the effort to understand this process better .
" Obtaining a crystal structure of a complex cellular electron transfer system is like being behind stage at a magic show , " says Vernon Anderson , who oversees biochemistry grants at the National Institutes of Health 's National Institute of General Medical Sciences .
" We have always known there was a trick , but now the Wilmot group has provided a unique view of how this extraordinary chemical feat is accomplished . "
Wilmot , an associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences , is known in the scientific community for pioneering a technique to freeze biological catalysts ( enzymes ) as they accelerate and orchestrate chemical reactions .
This produces snapshots at different points during the reaction that can be viewed as frames in a movie that defines the molecular and structural changes that occur as the chemistry unfolds .
Turkeys , the only domesticated animals from the New World that are now used globally , were actually domesticated twice -- once in Mesoamerica as was previously believed and once in what is now the southwestern United States .
The new findings , reported this week by Canadian and American researchers in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , come from a DNA analysis of ancient turkey bones and coprolites , the polite name for fossilized excrement .
Surprisingly , the researchers found that both strains of domesticated turkeys now are extinct , replaced by more highly inbred strains .
The turkeys we eat today , moreover , are not descendants of the North American turkeys , but of those from Mesoamerica , which in a convoluted journey were taken to Europe by Spanish explorers , then re-exported to North America .
The findings " have really helped to clarify some of the questions archaeologists have been wondering about for a long time , " said archaeologist Jonathan C. Driver of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby , Canada , who was not involved in the research .
It shows that the wild turkeys in the Southwest and Mesoamerica now " have nothing to do with the domestic turkey , that they are neither ancestor nor descendant . "
It also shows that there was only one breed of turkey in the Southwest , " that it was traded quite widely , and that its breeding was carefully controlled , " he said .
The history of turkeys is highly unusual in the context of other domesticated animals because it does not appear that they were originally raised in either region for their food value , as was the case with cows , sheep , pigs and other animals , said archaeologist Natalie Munro of the University of Connecticut , who has studied turkeys extensively .
She too was not involved in the research .
Evidence of turkey domestication in the Americas appears in remains from at least 2,000 years ago , but evidence from the first 1,000 years of that period suggests that the birds were raised for their feathers and ritual value , not for their meat .
Middens -- essentially garbage dumps -- from the period contain " lots and lots of turkey poop and very few turkey bones , " said archaeologist Brian M. Kemp of Washington State University , a co-author of the study .
Bones found from the period are typically of intact birds buried under houses and elsewhere .
All the evidence suggests , Munro said , that turkeys were raised for ritualistic purposes and for the use of their feathers for ornaments and in clothing , robes and blankets .
" It gets really cold at night in the Southwest , " Kemp said , " and turkey feather blankets are thermally superior to rabbit fur . "
A major change began in about the year 1100 .
Turkey bones began appearing much more commonly in middens .
Archaeologists believe that this change was associated with the increasing population density of the region and the hunting to near extinction of desirable prey animals such as deer and antelope .
By the 1200s , " turkey completely dominates the animal bones in middens , " Driver said .
The Pueblo people " were turning to an already domesticated animal and creating a new purpose for it . "
The dynamic changed again 250 years later after the Spanish arrived and introduced sheep and chicken .
Turkeys began disappearing from the middens and soon were replaced almost entirely by the imported animals , which required less care .
The new research came from two groups .
Kemp and his colleagues at Washington State were studying DNA in coprolites from the two regions , while archaeologists Camilla F. Speller and Dongya Y. Yang of Simon Fraser were studying it in bones .
They joined forces , and both approaches yielded the same results : that domestication was occurring simultaneously in the Southwest and Mesoamerica .
The researchers concluded that domestication occurred at least twice : once in Mesoamerica , probably in south - central Mexico , involving the South Mexican wild turkey , and once in the Southwest involving the Rio Grande / Eastern wild turkey populations .
They found no evidence that the two strains had ever intermingled .
Analysis of DNA from turkeys purchased in stores in the United States and Canada showed that these were descended from the Mesoamerican strain and arrived in the continent via Europe , confirming what most experts already believed .
Driver cautioned that these two strains were probably not similar to modern turkeys , which have been bred to bear so much meat that they can no longer fly .
" They would be more like wild turkeys in terms of body shape .
They would n't be very large or very fat ... but there was a reasonable amount of meat on them . "

Professor 's arrest sends shock waves around the University of Alabama in Huntsville .
Students paid tribute to the professors who died .
B. Dill / AP
The close - knit biology community in Huntsville , Alabama , is reeling after a professor allegedly turned a 9 - millimetre pistol on her colleagues in a 12 February faculty meeting at a University of Alabama campus .
Three professors were killed and three other people wounded .
Amy Bishop , a neuroscientist who earned her PhD at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , was denied tenure by the University of Alabama in Huntsville ( UAH ) last spring .
She allegedly opened fire in a meeting of a dozen people in a small conference room .
The three people killed were Gopi Podila , the biology department 's chairman ; Maria Ragland Davis , an expert in plant pathology ; and Adriel Johnson , a cell biologist .
Luis Cruz - Vera , a molecular biologist , was wounded but discharged from hospital a day later .
Microbiologist Joseph Leahy remained in critical condition from the shooting as Nature went to press , and Stephanie Monticciolo , a staff assistant and the departmental linchpin , was in a serious condition .
Bishop is in police custody , charged with murder .
The shootings stunned the Huntsville campus , where many of the 7,400 students read science or engineering .
The tragedy effectively halved the biology department 's full - time faculty .
" When you look at the fact that there are 13 professors and half have passed away or are in the hospital or in jail , and the other half witnessed the shootings , I just do n't know how we pick up the pieces , " says a departmental graduate student , who asked not to be identified .
University president David Williams called the shootings " a terrible tragedy " .
The shock waves extended beyond the campus in a city where biotechnology has thrived in the past decade , and where the links between university and off - campus research are unusually tight .
" They are our colleagues , our friends .
And this is devastating , " says Richard Myers , president and director of the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology , a non-profit academic centre that opened its doors in 2007 some 5 kilometres from the UAH .
Myers , a former chair of genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto , California , is also an adjunct professor at the UAH .
The university 's biology department was built in recent years by Podila , whom colleagues and students described as an affable man with an easy - going nature coupled with a deep devotion to his department and to the broader biology community in Huntsville .
Podila was a pivotal member of the Partnership for Biomedical Research , a group that works to support and draw research to the area .
Colleagues remembered
Chris Gunter , director of research affairs at the HudsonAlpha Institute , an adjunct biology professor at the UAH and a former senior editor at Nature , recalls Podila presenting a seminar at the institute last June on his speciality : symbiosis between fungi and tree roots .
" He gave a great analogy about the fungi and roots seeking each other out and how this was like dating , " she says .
" You could tell he was very gifted at teaching undergraduates . "
All three professors " cared about students , and they cared about producing good researchers and good scientists " , another graduate student in the department says .
Gunter attended a 5 February biology faculty meeting with Bishop , Podila , Davis , Johnson and others to talk about the interdisciplinary graduate programme that also involves the chemistry and chemical engineering departments .
" They were trying to invest in the students and make this programme work , " she says .
Davis in particular was trying to figure out ways to answer complaints about the programme 's qualifying exam .
Davis " was always very passionate about her research and very enthusiastic for students to be involved " , adds the second graduate student .
Johnson was remembered as a teacher who was excellent because he was exacting .
One student recalls him counselling people to be ready for bumps in the academic road : " ' I 'll give you a KimWipe to wipe your tears and then we 're going to move forward , ' he would say . "
Johnson also required students in a once - weekly lab to come in for extra nights each week , encouraging them to design their own experiments and " get their money 's worth " .
Bishop had garnered local attention after she and her husband , computer engineer and biologist James Anderson , co-invented a device that is essentially a sealed Petri dish .
Bishop had grown frustrated with repeated contamination of the plates on which she was growing nerve cells .
The device drew US $ 1.25 million from local angel investors , and is expected to make it to the market this summer .
A local company , Prodigy Biosystems , was founded to commercialize the invention .
Prodigy Biosystems chairman Dick Reeves calls Bishop " extremely smart " and outspoken : " You never had any doubts about where Amy was on an issue . "
He says that Bishop often got involved in issues beyond her laboratory , such as helping the family of a Huntsville entrepreneur whose son has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis understand the disease .
Reeves says that Bishop was " frustrated " by her failure to receive tenure and that she felt the university 's decision was unfair .
Anderson told media outlets over the weekend that he had no hint the shootings were going to occur .
In 1986 , Bishop shot and killed her teenage brother in Braintree , Massachusetts .
The death was deemed accidental .
The Boston Globe newspaper has also reported that Bishop and Anderson were questioned in the 1993 investigation of a mailed pipe - bomb received by Paul Rosenberg of Boston Children 's Hospital , where Bishop worked in the human - biochemistry lab .
No one was ever charged .
UNAWARE OF THE CONTRADICTION … .
There ’s an old joke that goes something like this : my neighbor went to public schools before joining the military .
He went to college on the G.I. Bill , bought his first home through the FHA , and received his health care through the V.A. and Medicare .
He now receives Social Security .
He ’s a conservative because he wants to get the government off his back .
I mention the joke because a surprising number of right - wing activists do n’t seem to appreciate the humor .
We talked the other day , for example , about a radical libertarian activist who encourages his allies to throw bricks through the windows of Democratic offices to protest the Affordable Care Act .
He hates government involvement in the lives of citizens — but his main income is taxpayer - financed disability checks sent to him every month by the federal government .
This is not uncommon .
The NYT reports today on some of the well - intention folks who ’ve been caught up in the Tea Party nonsense .
Take Tom Grimes , for example .
In the last year , he has organized a local group and a statewide coalition , and even started a “ bus czar ” Web site to marshal protesters to Washington on short notice .
This month , he mobilized 200 other Tea Party activists to go to the local office of the same congressman to protest what he sees as the government ’s takeover of health care . [ … ]
“ If you quit giving people that stuff , they would figure out how to do it on their own , ” Mr. Grimes said .
When Grimes lost his job 15 months ago , one of his first steps was contacting his congressman about available programs that might give him access to government health care .
He receives Social Security , and is considering a job opening at the Census Bureau .
But in the meantime , Grimes has filled the back seat of his Mercury Grand Marquis with literature decrying government aid to struggling Americans .
The same article noted the efforts of Diana Reimer , considered a “ star ” right - wing activist in her efforts against government programs , a campaign she describes as her “ mission . ”
Reimer , of course , currently enjoys Social Security and the socialized medicine that comes with Medicare .
The cognitive dissonance is rather remarkable .
They perceive the government as the source of their economic distress — which itself does n’t make sense — and then rely on the government to give them a hand , all the while demanding that the government do less to give people a hand .
Their reflexive hatred for public programs is so irrational , they do n’t even see the contradiction .
“ After a year of angry debate , ” the Times article noted , “ emotion outweighs fact . ”
That ’s no doubt true .
But that does n’t change the fact that we ’re talking about a reasonably large group of people who are deeply , tragically misguided .
This is important to the extent that there are still some who believe the political mainstream should do more to listen to the Tea Party crowd and take its hysterical cries seriously .
But how can credible people take nonsense seriously and hope to come up with a meaningful result ?
How can policymakers actually address substantive challenges while following the advice of angry mobs who reject reason and evidence ?
The bottom line seem inescapable : too many Tea Party activists have no idea what they ’re talking about .
Their sincerity notwithstanding , this is a confused group of misled people .
Condom use cuts the risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease
The growing resistance to antibiotics threatens to make gonorrhoea extremely difficult to treat , a Health Protection Agency official has warned .
Current drugs are still effective but signs of emerging resistance mean treatments may soon need to be revised , Professor Catherine Ison says .
It could mean multiple - dose treatments instead of single doses , she says .
Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the UK .
Professor Ison says there is a very real possibility that strains of gonorrhoea - causing bacteria that are resistant to all current treatment options could emerge in the near future .
She has raised the issue at the Society for General Microbiology 's spring meeting in Edinburgh .
Pregnancy risk
The Health Protection Agency has been keeping a close watch on antibiotic resistance among strains of gonorrhoea for some time and says there is an urgent need for the development of new treatments .
If left untreated , gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease , and women can become infertile or have ectopic pregnancies .
If this problem is n't addressed then there is a real possibility that gonorrhoea will become a very difficult infection to treat
Professor Catherine Ison , Health Protection Agency
The current treatment to use is either ceftriaxone or cefixime .
These antibiotics are administered as a single dose .
Professor Ison said : " Choosing an effective antibiotic can be a challenge because the organism that causes gonorrhoea is very versatile and develops resistance to antibiotics very quickly .
" Penicillin was used for many years until it was no longer effective and a number of other agents have been used since .
" The current drugs of choice , ceftriaxone and cefixime , are still very effective but there are signs that resistance , particularly to cefixime , is emerging and soon these drugs may not be a good choice . "
Bad news
She added : " There are few new drugs available and so it is probable that the current use of a single dose may soon need to be revised and treatment over several days or with more than one antibiotic will need to be considered .
" If this problem is n't addressed then there is a real possibility that gonorrhoea will become a very difficult infection to treat . "
Hugh Pennington , emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University , said it would be bad news from a public health point of view if people had to be given several doses .
Whilst recognising that this might prove necessary , he said the downside was that some patients would not go back to a clinic for later treatments and so would not get rid of the infection .
" This could make resistance , which could lead to a superbug situation , " he said .
The Health Protection Agency says there is no need to change treatment at the moment , but it is important for doctors to be vigilant .
It says the high number of cases of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) such as gonorrhoea reinforces the need for people to use condoms with new and casual partners .
Jason Warriner , Clinical Director at Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " As levels of STIs continue to rise , we will see drug - resistant strains develop .
This just shows how crucial it is for those who have been at risk to go for regular sexual health check - ups .
" We recommend people who are sexually active get checked out at least once a year .
Most modern tests involve a simple urine sample or self - administered swab .
They are quick , easy , and a good way to achieve peace of mind . "

Wenger should stick with veteran even when former skipper returns to fitness
If Arsenal are going to win the Premier League title this season then Sol Campbell should remain in the first team even when William Gallas returns to fitness .
Sol Campbell was only brought into the Arsenal squad in January as back - up , but his dominating , no - nonsense playing style has made him a better and more complementary defensive partner for Thomas Vermaelen than the Frenchman .
Vermaelen has proved to be one of the signings of the season , so there is no question that he should always take one of the two centre - back spots .
Sol Campbell , on the other hand , is 35 and had played League Two football earlier this season before Arsene Wenger re-signed him in the January window .
Perhaps it is this dalliance with other , less well - organised and prestigious clubs that has inspired Campbell ’s insatiable appetite for the game in recent weeks .
His commitment to the Arsenal cause has been second to none and he has repeatedly thrown his aging body into challenges where others who are less brave might baulk .
His contribution in defence has understatedly helped the side go on their current unbeaten run .
In the three Premier League games that Campbell has played a major part in since Aston Villa away at the end of January , Arsenal have conceded just two goals .
Meanwhile statistics appear to suggest that Arsenal are better without William Gallas than with him .
With or without you |
Win percentage up without Gallas
Of course , it ’s very hard to compare Campbell and Gallas ’s two seasons when the Frenchman has played 26 Premier League matches including tough games against Manchester United , Chelsea and Liverpool .
But that is the challenge that will face Arsene Wenger should the Frenchman return to fitness in the coming weeks .
The latest news is that Gallas ’ calf problem is only minor , but a couple of set - backs have delayed his return to the squad .
If he gets back to full fitness soon , however , Wenger should resist the temptation to return him to the starting line - up .
There is no denying William Gallas ’s quality .
He twice won the league with Chelsea and twice was picked for the PFA Team of the Year .
Yet , Arsene Wenger has struggled to get the balance right at the back for a number of seasons and Arsenal have long been vulnerable to the threat of physical strikers and set - pieces .
That is where Sol Campbell steps in .
He offers the towering presence at the back that Arsenal have lacked since ... well , since he left the club in 2006 .
Admittedly Vermaelen has been phenomenal .
Far stronger in the air than anyone imagined when it was revealed that Wenger had signed a 5ft 11in centre - back in the summer rather than the ‘ giant ’ that the fans craved .
Yet there is no substitute for height and strength when it comes to tussling with the likes of West Ham United ’s Carlton Cole and Blackburn Rovers ’ Christopher Samba - as the Arsenal defence will have to in the coming weeks .
Campbell is a heavyweight by anyone ’s standards , at 6ft 2in and weighing in at 91 kilos .
Gallas , in comparison , is just 5ft 11in and 71 kilos .
Campbell is faster than he looks , too .
Despite his advancing years , last season Castrol measured the fastest Premier League players and incredibly the Englishman came second with a top speed of 22.5 m ph .
Only Theo Walcott was faster .
The pace and strength of the man were illustrated in the game against Hull City last weekend , when Campbell tackled and left injured the Tigers ’ defender Kamil Zayatte .
Despite being off the blocks late , Campbell ’s pace meant that the tackle was entirely fair but the power of the challenge left the Guinea man crocked .
With so many lightweight Arsenal players getting injured because of hefty tackles of late , it must have been refreshing for Gunners fans to see the roles reversed .
Arsene Wenger ’s team , made up of so many smaller , mobile players , need a bodyguard in the side and Campbell is fulfilling that role perfectly right now .
The writer George Orwell once said ‘ Sport is war without bullets ’ , and with tough fixtures against Birmingham City , Tottenham Hotspur and Blackburn coming up , the Gunners will have to win battles if they are to capture the Premier League crown .
But just think , who would you rather go into battle alongside : hard man Campbell or the stroppy William Gallas ?

President Obama urged congressional Democrats today to pass a major health care bill in the next few weeks , and to disregard the warnings of Washington " pundits " who say it will hurt the party in November elections .
" My question to them is , ' when is the right time ? "
Obama told a supportive crowd at Arcadia University , near Philadelphia .
" If not now , when ?
If not us , who ? "
Rather than worry about the next election , Obama said lawmakers should be more concerned about a " health care crisis " that he laid largely at the feet of insurance companies .
The president said they jack up premiums , and " continue to ration health care based on who 's sick and who 's healthy , on who can pay and who can't pay . "
" We can't have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people , " Obama said .
The Obama administration and House Democratic leaders are lobbying wavering party members to endorse a health care plan approved last year by the Senate , the first step towards approval of a final , Obama - backed package .
The White House hopes the House acts before Obama leaves March 18 for a swing through Guam , Indonesia , and Australia .
Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for America 's Health Insurance Plans , attributed rising health care bills to the costs of medical care , which are pushing up insurance premiums .
He added that the insurance industry supports efforts to guarantee coverage for consumers with pre-existing conditions , which are another part of Obama 's health care plan .
But , Zirkelbach said , " much more needs to be done in the current legislation to address the skyrocketing cost of medical care , which is making health care coverage unaffordable for working families and small businesses . "
In his Pennsylvania speech , Obama repeatedly criticized the Washington " pundits , " " columnists , " and " echo chamber " participants who claim that a big health plans is a political loser , and are " obsessed with the sport of politics . "
He cited Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , who said the issue will help the GOP make big gains in Congress .
" Now , first of all , I generally would n't take advice about what 's good for Democrats " from the GOP leader , Obama said .
" But setting aside that , that 's not the issue here .
The issue here is not the politics of it . "
McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said the Kentucky senator has also said that " listening to constituents would be thinking about the politics , AND thinking about doing the right thing . "
McConnell says the Obama health care plan is too expensive and too bureaucratic , and that Congress should take a step - by - step approach to the nation 's health care problems .
To be sure , upcoming health care votes will not be easy , Obama assured his fellow Democrats .
But they wo n't any be any harder than the higher health care bills faced by most Americans , and he appealed to the crowd to " to help us get us over the finish line these next two weeks . "
" The need is great , " Obama said .
" The opportunity is here .
Let 's seize reform .
It 's within our grasp . "

The Senate 's top Republican says he did n't like a recent GOP appeal to party donors that was based on stoking fear and negative feelings toward President Barack Obama and other Democrats .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky says he does n't understand why anyone thought such an appeal would help the GOP .
The pitch last month to Republican fundraisers included a direct call to exploit " extreme negative feelings " toward Democrats .
In the presentation , Obama was depicted as " The Joker " and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Cruella De Vil .
McConnell tells ABC's " This Week " that it's up to the Republican National Committee to hold someone responsible for the controversial appeal .
He says , " I do n't like it and I do n't know anybody who does . "

In his hundred - word inquiry to Steve Jobs as to whether or not the iPad will tether to the iPhone , Jezper Söderlund started by saying , " I 'll keep it short . "
Steve 's response kept it really short : " No . " Updated : Is Jobs wrong ?

OK , Steve 's answer hardly comes as a surprise , but I 'm always tickled when there 's a report of Steve Jobs responding personally to someone 's e-mail .
I imagine him sitting on the can , flicking idly on his iPhone , and finally deciding to open that massive folder of his inbox where all the e-mail from the plebs gets redirected .
Oh , what 's this ?
I 'll keep it short .
I'm Jezper from Sweden , a long time Apple fan , currently about to replace the very last computer at home with a brand spanking new iMac i7 .
I 'm also awaiting the release of the iPad .
However , I have one question :
Will the wifi-only version somehow support tethering thru my iPhone ?
Two devices , based on the same OS , with already built - in technology to share one data plan suggests a secondary contract could possibly be redundant .
From the look of your keynote , where the iPad sits well between my MacBook Pro and my iPhone , I was hoping the three of them could interact as seamless as possible .
All the best ,
Jezper Söderlund
Whether or not he knew that Jezper was a Swedish DJ of some acclaim ( he did n't ) , King Steve could n't be bothered to type more than a single word before he rose up off his throne .
No .
Sent from my iPhone
What do we learn from this ?
1 . You wo n't be able to skimp on an iPad data plan by tethering to your iPhone .
2 . There 's still the outside chance that someday " sjobs@apple.com " will pop up before your eyes , delivering a disappointingly terse ( but change of pants - requiring nonetheless ) message directly to your inbox . [ 9 to 5 Mac ]

Update : Assuming his response is the real deal , we 're wondering if Steve might be a little bit confused about how his precious gadgets actually work .
The iPhone officially supports tethering , just not in the United States .
But we can't see any reason why the iPhone should n't be able to share its connection with the iPad on international carriers that do support tethering ( seeing as DJ Jezper is from Sweden , he could well be a costumer of one of them ) .
In any event , it seems like Steve 's answer is n't only short but perhaps just plain wrong .

Liverpool have accepted an offer of around £ 6 m from CSKA Moscow for their outspoken midfielder Albert Riera and hope to conclude the sale of Rafael Benítez 's critic by the end of this week .
The Spain international is due to return to training at Melwood today having served a club suspension for last week 's public criticism of Benítez 's management style .
Whether the 27 - year - old gets as far as the training pitch is debatable , however , with Liverpool now willing to cash in on the marginalised winger and to allow Riera to discuss personal terms with CSKA .
Liverpool are hopeful of a swift deal for Riera , who has cut an increasingly frustrated figure in a season where he has been restricted to 16 appearances and whose desire for first - team football ahead of the World Cup arguably prompted his outburst on Radio Marca .
The winger , signed for £ 8 m from Espanyol in 2008 , described Liverpool as a " sinking ship " in the interview and was scathing in the assessment of Benítez , who he claimed held a personal grudge against him and had zero dialogue with players .
Russia 's transfer window is open until 8 April and Benítez will have made a profit of approximately £ 12 m through sales this season should Riera follow Andrea Dossena and Andrei Voronin out of Anfield .
Even that surplus is not guaranteed to be reinvested in the Liverpool squad this summer , however , with Champions League qualification , or the lack of , determining how much can be spent .
The Rhône Group has made provisions for a transfer budget as part of its £ 100 m offer for a 40 % stake in Liverpool , with a decision yet to be made by the owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett , although Benítez 's spending power will be reduced should they fail to secure a top - four finish .
Despite the financial uncertainty at Anfield , Benítez insists he has been encouraged by recent contract talks with Javier Mascherano and is confident the Argentina captain will be the latest component of Liverpool 's first - team to commit his long - term future to the club .
" We were talking , progressing and we 're closer now .
Still we need to talk a little bit but we are closer , " the manager said .
" It would be very important for the club .
We have some important players with some years left on their contracts and this could be another one .
It 's very important that we 're keeping the spine of the team . "
Meditation # 17 By John Donne From Devotions upon Emergent Occasions ( 1623 ) , XVII :
Nunc Lento Sonitu Dicunt , Morieris
( Now this bell , tolling softly for another , says to me , Thou must die . )
Perchance , he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill , as that he knows not it tolls for him ; and perchance I may think myself so much better than I am , as that they who are about me , and see my state , may have caused it to toll for me , and I know not that .
The church is catholic , universal , so are all her actions ; all that she does belongs to all .
When she baptizes a child , that action concerns me ; for that child is thereby connected to that body which is my head too , and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member .
And when she buries a man , that action concerns me : all mankind is of one author , and is one volume ; when one man dies , one chapter is not torn out of the book , but translated into a better language ; and every chapter must be so translated ;
God employs several translators ; some pieces are translated by age , some by sickness , some by war , some by justice ; but God 's hand is in every translation , and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again for that library where every book shall lie open to one another .
As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher only , but upon the congregation to come , so this bell calls us all ; but how much more me , who am brought so near the door by this sickness .
There was a contention as far as a suit ( in which both piety and dignity , religion and estimation , were mingled ) , which of the religious orders should ring to prayers first in the morning ; and it was determined , that they should ring first that rose earliest .
If we understand aright the dignity of this bell that tolls for our evening prayer , we would be glad to make it ours by rising early , in that application , that it might be ours as well as his , whose indeed it is .
The bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth ; and though it intermit again , yet from that minute that this occasion wrought upon him , he is united to God .
Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises ?
but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out ?
Who bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings ?
but who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world ?
No man is an island , entire of itself ; every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main .
If a clod be washed away by the sea , Europe is the less , as well as if a promontory were , as well as if a manor of thy friend 's or of thine own were : any man 's death diminishes me , because I am involved in mankind , and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee .
Neither can we call this a begging of misery , or a borrowing of misery , as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves , but must fetch in more from the next house , in taking upon us the misery of our neighbours .
Truly it were an excusable covetousness if we did , for affliction is a treasure , and scarce any man hath enough of it .
No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and ripened by it , and made fit for God by that affliction .
If a man carry treasure in bullion , or in a wedge of gold , and have none coined into current money , his treasure will not defray him as he travels .
Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it , but it is not current money in the use of it , except we get nearer and nearer our home , heaven , by it .
Another man may be sick too , and sick to death , and this affliction may lie in his bowels , as gold in a mine , and be of no use to him ; but this bell , that tells me of his affliction , digs out and applies that gold to me : if by this consideration of another 's danger I take mine own into contemplation , and so secure myself , by making my recourse to my God , who is our only security .
Since the last hurricane related post , some news has occurred on the hurricanes front .
Nature Geosciences article by Knutson et al. ( 2010 ) discussing the linkages between tropical cyclones and climate change / global warming — as an update to the IPCC AR4 statements
Whether the characteristics of tropical cyclones have changed or will change in a warming climate — and if so , how — has been the subject of considerable investigation , often with conflicting results .
Large amplitude fluctuations in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones greatly complicate both the detection of long - term trends and their attribution to rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases .
Trend detection is further impeded by substantial limitations in the availability and quality of global historical records of tropical cyclones .
Therefore , it remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity have exceeded the variability expected from natural causes .
However , future projections based on theory and high - resolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms , with intensity increases of 2 – 11 % by 2100 .
Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones , by 6 – 34 % .
Balanced against this , higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones , and increases of the order of 20 % in the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre .
For all cyclone parameters , projected changes for individual basins show large variations between different modelling studies .

A Mississippi school board was grossly discriminatory and mean - spirited when it told Constance McMillen that she could not attend her high school prom with her girlfriend .
A ruling by a federal judge that Ms. McMillen ’s constitutional rights had been violated is a welcome sign that gay people are continuing to make progress toward equality .
It should also be a warning to school districts nationwide about the cost of discrimination .
Ms. McMillen , a senior at Itawamba Agricultural High School , has identified herself as a lesbian since the eighth grade .
After the school learned that she was planning to take her girlfriend to the prom , it told her that the two could attend alone or with male dates but not as a couple .
When Ms. McMillen asked if she could wear a tuxedo , she was told that she would have to wear a dress .
The American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter protesting those decisions and the district responded by canceling the prom .
It was a move that called to mind the school districts across the South that canceled their proms during the civil rights era rather than open them to black and white students on an equal basis .
The A.C.L.U. sued on Ms. McMillen ’s behalf .
The north Mississippi courtroom of Judge Glen H. Davidson , a former Tupelo city prosecutor named to the bench by Ronald Reagan , might not seem like the most hospitable forum for Ms. McMillen .
But Judge Davidson ruled last week that the First Amendment right of self - expression is denied when students are prohibited from attending the prom with a same - sex date .
Similarly , he said , Ms. McMillen ’s right to communicate a message  that women should not be required to wear traditionally female clothing  was infringed when she was prohibited from wearing a tuxedo .

Editor ’s note : Get Ventura ’s book , American Conspiracy , that the libs at Huffington Post would rather you not read .
As I noted in an item yesterday , Jesse Ventura has a new book out , co-authored with Dick Russell , called American Conspiracies , which includes an excellent chapter on election fraud and its connection to the likely murder of Mike Connell .
Jesse Ventura is the former governor of Minnesota and author of several bestselling books , including Do n’t Start the Revolution Without Me !
He lives in Dellwood , Minnesota and Baja , Mexico .
Well , this morning , Jesse had a front - page piece on 9/11 up at HuffPost : a front - page piece that quickly slipped off that front page — and then completely disappeared .
Here ’s what you ’ll find there now ( or will , until they take that down as well ) :
Jesse Ventura
Author , American Conspiracies
Posted : March 9 , 2010 11:00 AM
Editor ’s Note : The Huffington Post ’s editorial policy , laid out in our blogger guidelines , prohibits the promotion and promulgation of conspiracy theories — including those about 9/11 .
As such , we have removed this post .
All that ’s up there now are the comments left by 65 of HuffPost ’s readers .
It ’s worth noting that HuffPost already ran an excerpt from another chapter of American Conspiracies , about the US “ war on drugs , ” and they had no problem with that subject .
But this one is , as we all know , taboo .
Clearly , even to question the official story of 9/11 is to engage in “ conspiracy theories ” ( as if the official story is not itself a “ conspiracy theory , ” and a preposterous one at that ) .
Such is always the response of the US mainstream media ( the foreign media tends to be more open - minded ) — and it ’s also the response of our left / liberal media , as this amazing act of censorship makes clear .
So here is the offending piece .
Please read it ; and let ’s all try to locate the particular points that are so obviously wild and baseless that HuffPost had to kill the whole piece insantly .

Huffington Post / Jesse Ventura – Article # 2 ( “ American Conspiracies ” )
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 11TH ?
You did n’t see anything about it in the mainstream media , but two weeks ago at a conference in San Francisco , more than one thousand architects and engineers signed a petition demanding that Congress begin a new investigation into the destruction of the three World Trade Center skyscrapers on 9/11 .
That ’s right , these people put their reputations in potential jeopardy – because they do n’t buy the government ’s version of events .
They want to know how 200,000 tons of steel disintegrated and fell to the ground in 11 seconds .
They question whether the hijacked planes were responsible – or whether it could have been a controlled demolition from inside that brought down the Twin Towers and Building 7 .
Richard Gage , a member of the American Institute of Architects and the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9 - 11 Truth , put it like this : “ The official Federal Emergency Management [ Agency ] and National Institute of Standards and Technology reports provide insufficient , contradictory and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the towers ’ destruction . ”
He ’s especially disturbed by Building 7 , whose 447 stories came down in “ pure free - fall acceleration ” that afternoon – even though it was never hit by an aircraft .
This is a subject I take up in my new book , American Conspiracies , published this week by Skyhorse .
An excerpt follows :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Some people have argued that the twin towers went down , within a half hour of one another , because of the way they were constructed .
Well , those 425,000 cubic yards of concrete and 200,000 tons of steel were designed to hold up against a Boeing 707 , the largest plane built at the time the towers were completed in 1973 .
Analysis had shown that a 707 traveling at 600 miles an hour ( and those had four engines ) would not cause major damage .
The twin -engine Boeing 757s that hit on 9/11 were going 440 and 550 miles an hour .
Still , we are told that a molten , highly intense fuel mixture from the planes brought down these two steel - framed skyscrapers .
Keep in mind that no other such skyscraper in history had ever been known to collapse completely due to fire damage .
So could it actually have been the result of a controlled demolition from inside the buildings ?
I do n’t claim expertise about this , but I did work four years as part of the Navy ’s underwater demolition teams , where we were trained to blow things to hell and high water .
And my staff talked at some length with a prominent physicist , Steven E. Jones , who says that a “ gravity driven collapse ” without demolition charges defies the laws of physics .
These buildings fell , at nearly the rate of free - fall , straight down into their own footprint , in approximately ten seconds .
An object dropped from the roof of the 110 - story - tall towers would reach the ground in about 9.2 seconds .
Then there ’s the fact that steel beams that weighed as much as 200,000 pounds got tossed laterally as far as 500 feet .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) started its investigation on August 21 , 2002 .
When their 10,000 - page - long report came out three years later , the spokesman said there was no evidence to suggest a controlled demolition .
But Steven E. Jones also says that molten metal found underground weeks later is proof that jet fuel could n’t have been all that was responsible .
I visited the site about three weeks after 9/11 , with Governor Pataki and my wife Terry .
It did n’t mean anything to me at the time , but they had to suspend digging that day because they were running into heat pockets of huge temperatures .
These fires kept burning for more than three months , the longest - burning structure blaze ever .
And this was all due to jet fuel ?
We ’re talking molten metal more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
Probably the most conclusive evidence about a controlled demolition is a research paper ( two years , nine authors ) published in the peer - reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal , in April 2009 .
In studying dust samples from the site , these scientists found chips of nano - thermite , which is a high - tech incendiary / explosive .
Here ’s what the paper ’s lead author , Dr. Niels Harrit of the University of Copenhagen ’s chemistry department , had to say about the explosive that he ’s convinced brought down the Twin Towers and the nearby Building 7 :
“ Thermite itself dates back to 1893 .
It is a mixture of aluminum and rust - powder , which react to create intense heat .
The reaction produces iron , heated to 2500 degrees Centigrade .
This can be used to do welding .
It can also be used to melt other iron .
So in nano - thermite , this powder from 1893 is reduced to tiny particles , perfectly mixed .
When these react , the intense heat develops much more quickly .
Nano - thermite can be mixed with additives to give off intense heat , or serve as a very effective explosive .
It contains more energy than dynamite , and can be used as rocket fuel . ” [ i ]
Richard Gage is one of hundreds of credentialed architects and structural engineers who have put their careers on the line to point out the detailed anomalies and many implications of controlled demolition in the building collapses .
As he puts it bluntly : “ Once you get to the science , it ’s indisputable . ”

Via : AP :
The retirement nest egg of an entire generation is stashed away in this small town along the Ohio River : $ 2.5 trillion in IOUs from the federal government , payable to the Social Security Administration .
It ’s time to start cashing them in .
For more than two decades , Social Security collected more money in payroll taxes than it paid out in benefits — billions more each year .
Not anymore .
This year , for the first time since the 1980s , when Congress last overhauled Social Security , the retirement program is projected to pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes — nearly $ 29 billion more .
Sounds like a good time to start tapping the nest egg .
Too bad the federal government already spent that money over the years on other programs , preferring to borrow from Social Security rather than foreign creditors .
In return , the Treasury Department issued a stack of IOUs — in the form of Treasury bonds — which are kept in a nondescript office building just down the street from Parkersburg ’s municipal offices .
Now the government will have to borrow even more money , much of it abroad , to start paying back the IOUs , and the timing could n’t be worse .
The government is projected to post a record $ 1.5 trillion budget deficit this year , followed by trillion dollar deficits for years to come .
Social Security ’s shortfall will not affect current benefits .
As long as the IOUs last , benefits will keep flowing .
But experts say it is a warning sign that the program ’s finances are deteriorating .
Social Security is projected to drain its trust funds by 2037 unless Congress acts , and there ’s concern that the looming crisis will lead to reduced benefits .
“ This is not just a wake - up call , this is it .
We ’re here , ” said Mary Johnson , a policy analyst with The Senior Citizens League , an advocacy group .
“ We are not going to be able to put it off any more . ”

Did the Nazis target lesbian women as harshly as they went after gay men ?
We were n’t there , so we do n’t know !
But smarter historians than we say the answer is , flatly , no , so they do n’t want the Holocaust memorial in Berlin to suddenly start recognizing lesbian attacks .
As with anything involved with the Holocaust and questioning history , this is a touchy subject .
Currently the monument , installed in May 2008 next to the Jewish memorial , lets visitors peer into a concrete block to watch an infinitely - looping video showing two men kissing .
It ’s to honor the estimated 15,000 gay men imprisoned by the Nazis ; some 60 percent of them are believed to have died during detainment .
But the original plans for the memorial called for the video to be swapped out every two years , with a video of two women kissing .
Cue controversy .
Under the original plans , the video is to change every two years to feature two women locked in an embrace , meaning the switch is due in May .
But Alexander Zinn , a board member of the foundation that maintains the former Nazi concentration camps near Berlin , said such a move would distort history as there were no known Holocaust victims targeted for being lesbian .
“ Historical truth must remain the focus , ” Zinn told AFP .
He has banded together with other Holocaust experts and fired off a letter of protest to Culture Minister Michael Neumann and Berlin ’s openly gay mayor , Klaus Wowereit .
Neumann defended the plans as true to the original concept of the memorial in addressing present - day discrimination against lesbians and gays as well as the plight of homosexuals at the hands of the Nazis .
“ The option of using a lesbian film motif in the memorial is in no way meant to put on the same level the persecution of homosexual men and women under the Nazi regime , ” he said in a statement .
“ Research shows that the persecution of lesbian women by the Nazi regime was not comparable to that of homosexual men .
This is also clearly explained in a plaque on the memorial . ”
This is the video currently playing since the memorial ’s debut :
Listen .
Were some lesbian women targeted by the Nazis ?
Almost certainly .
Were they targeted as heavily as gay men ?
Perhaps not .
Does that mean we should these women from history and deny them remembrance ?
Of course not .
Give the gals their two years .
SALT LAKE CITY —
It was standing room only Friday as a House committee passed a controversial resolution calling for an end to affirmative action in Utah .
Democrats tried to delay the proposal to provide more time for discussion , but Republicans dismissed their concerns .
Rep. Brian King , D - Salt Lake , said it was " irresponsible " to approve the resolution without more information .
" I 'm surprised the first time we 're talking about this is in a committee , " he said .
" This is not an adequate fact - finding context to talk about amending the constitution . "
Opponents pushed the bill 's sponsor , Rep. Curtis Oda , R - Clearfield , to provide specific examples of preferential treatment in the state .
He replied , " I could n't name names , but I think we all know people who have dealt with this . "
Under the proposed HJR24 , state entities " may not discriminate against , or grant preferential treatment to , any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity , or national origin with respect to public employment , public education , or public contracting . "
African - American activist Ward Connerly helped Oda present the proposal and has worked on similar resolutions around the country .
" Diversity is an amorphous idea that is simply in the eye of the beholder " and should not be an end unto itself , he argued .
House Minority Leader David Litvack , D - Salt Lake , attended the hearing and said the resolution is based on false assumptions .
" They assume that diverse means unqualified , " he said .
" Diversity is part of the quality at our institutions . "
The legislation , which was proposed two days ago , is moving too quickly , Litvack said .
" This is an issue that will divide our community , " he said .
" Having a dialogue once the amendment is on the ballot is having a dialogue with a gun to you head . "
NAACP spokeswoman Jeanetta Williams said the measure would be detrimental to opportunity in Utah .
" We 've fought against Connerly 's proposals in every state , " she said .
" We would oppose any such legislation here , even if it means we have to go to court . "
A constitutional review committee was scheduled to consider the proposal at noon Friday .

“ The Walt Disney Company also known simply as Disney , is the largest media and entertainment conglomerate in the world . ”
With the rapid change in many industries , Open Source Software has become a common foundation for many technologies .
Open Source has proved to be the best alternative for the beginners as well as developers .
Reviewing the facthas launched an open technology site ) where users will , for the first time , be able to access innovative technologies developed in house .
The available softwares are WDAS 's texture mapping system , Ptex , which was made available on January 15 , 2010 at http://ptex.us/ and a test generator program , Pythoscope .
WDAS has also compiled a set of papers available on the site for sharing additional technical innovations that will benefit the industry .
The WDAS technology team has contributed to such software in many ways within both the studio and the industry and now aims to contribute back to the community by establishing this platform .
With the increase in render complexity requirements in animated film , the WDAS team found that standard texture - mapping methods being utilized had become inefficient and complicated for artists to use .
In an effort to increase the efficiency and quality of texture mapping on complex and intricate geometry , the Ptex developer , Burley , spent a year developing the Ptex software .
The Ptex system has already been licensed to multiple vendors and studios .
It is now being utilized on all current and future projects at WDAS .
“ Today , technology is fundamental to the creation , distribution and consumption of entertainment ; therefore , being a premiere entertainment brand means creating premiere technology .
” “ Ptex from Disney Animation is one of those premiere technologies that can only reach its full potential by releasing it as open source , ” Hendrickson continues .
“ It is a revolutionary idea , and though some would characterize it as a Disney competitive advantage , it has more value to the corporation as an industry standard in solving the time - consuming computer graphics problem of assigning textures to geometry .

Ptex introduces a new texture mapping method that has extraordinary benefits for film production .
It eliminates the need for tedious and labor - intensive UV assignment by applying a separate texture to each face of a subdivision or polygon mesh .
The Ptex file format can efficiently store hundreds of thousands of texture images in a single file , resulting in a significant reduction in server load .
The Ptex API , which WDAS is releasing as open source , provides cached file I/O and high quality filtering - everything that is required to easily add Ptex support to a production - quality renderer or texture authoring application .

With the open source touch , lets hope to get a better experience of animated movies with higher qualities at an affordable price .
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) is a far - reaching proposal that the U.S. government has insisted was too sensitive to be exposed to the public .
Now that the 44 - page document ( PDF ) has been leaked , it 's easy to see why the U.S. wanted to keep it a secret .
( Source : die - linke.de )
ACTA , in its present form , is heralded by the Film and Music industries and their fight against piracy .
However , if upheld , citizens will pay a heavy price for their privacy .
Gov't Can Search , Seize and Destroy Electronics
Former President George W. Bush and current President Barack Obama both favor ACTA , which is a result of countless millions of dollars in international lobbying money from the media industry .
ACTA was designed to enact the constant monitoring of everyone 's online activities -- both legitimate and non-legitimate -- and gives border agents in the U.S. and other member states the power to search and seize your equipment without a warrant .
Effectively , it gives these officials the power to destroy U.S. citizens ' laptops , iPods or CDs if the agents suspect they might contain copyright - infringing content .
( Source : dailytech.com )
The worst part about giving border patrol agents the power to search and seize your electronics is that the U.S. citizens will be paying for it without their knowledge .
U.S. Keeps ACTA Secret from Public
Surprisingly , there are only a few nations named in the treaty that support the U.S. government 's intentions of keeping the terms of ACTA secret .
Dutch officials ' accidently ' leaked a memo from a secret ACTA negotiation meeting in Mexico detailing who supported keeping ACTA secret from citizens of member nations .
Belgium , Portugal , Germany , Denmark , South Korea and Singapore all supported keeping ACTA secret , with Denmark being the most vocal supporter of secrecy .
ACTA Secrecy Raises Questions
The Netherlands , Sweden , Finland , Ireland , Hungary , Poland , Estonia , Austria , the UK , and Japan all supported releasing ACTA details to the public .
Japan and the UK were particularly vocal about transparency .
Canada , Australia , and New Zealand were n't listed in the memo , but have also advocated transparency .
The U.S. fought to keep the terms of ACTA secret , and with the help of a few nations supporting secrecy , successfully prevented ACTA details from being aired .
Despite their best attempts at secrecy , much information about ACTA had already been made public due the the whistleblower websites like Wikileaks.org .

This is a special PDF hack : I managed to make a PoC PDF to execute an embedded executable without exploiting any vulnerability !
I use a launch action triggered by the opening of my PoC PDF .
With Adobe Reader , the user gets a warning asking for approval to launch the action , but I can ( partially ) control the message displayed by the dialog .
Foxit Reader displays no warning at all , the action gets executed without user interaction .
PDF viewers like Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader do n’t allow embedded executables ( like binaries and scripts ) to be extracted and executed :
But I found another way to launch a command ( / Launch / Action ) , and ultimately run an executable I embedded using a special technique .
With Adobe Reader , a launch action needs to be approved by the user :
But I can partially control the message displayed by this dialog box :
I can use this to social - engineer users to “ Open ” the file :
Do you believe this could this mislead some of your users ?
Or maybe you can come up with a better message to fool your users .
With Foxit Reader , no warning is displayed :
I ’m not publishing my PoC PDF yet , but you can download a PDF that will just launch cmd.exe here .
Use it to test your PDF reader .
With Adobe Reader , the only thing preventing execution is a warning .
Disabling JavaScript will not prevent this ( I do n’t use JavaScript in my PoC PDF ) , and patching Adobe Reader is n’t possible ( I ’m not exploiting a vulnerability , just being creative with the PDF language specs ) .
I shared my PoC with Adobe ’s PSIRT .
Maybe they will come up with a solution to prevent this , should they consider that the protection offered by the warning dialog is not sufficient .
BTW , preventing Adobe Reader from creating new processes blocks this trick .
In this case , Foxit Reader is probably worse than Adobe Reader , because no warning gets displayed to prevent the launch action .
My PoC PDF requires some changes for Foxit Reader , because ultimately , the executable does n’t run .
But that ’s probably due to some variation in the PDF language supported by Foxit Reader .
Tested with Adobe Reader 9.3.1 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 .

The number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the U.S. climbed this week as producers ramped up drilling activity despite sagging natural gas prices .
The number of oil and gas rigs climbed to 1,427 , up 20 rigs from the previous week , according to data from oilfield - services company Baker Hughes Inc. ( BHI ) .
The number of gas rigs was 939 , up 12 rigs from last week , while the oil rig count was 474 , an increase of eight rigs .
The number of miscellaneous rigs was unchanged at 14 rigs .
The number of gas rigs in use peaked at 1,606 in September 2008 .
Gas producers began scaling back drilling activity as gas prices plunged from their 2008 summer highs above $ 13 a million British thermal units .
But they began putting more rigs back to work as winter heating demand boosted prices .
Prices , however , have now slipped as spring approaches and the market anticipates rising production .
U.S. gas inventories climbed to an all - time high last November as producers unlocked vast new supplies of the fuel from prolific onshore natural gas fields known as shales and the economic downturn undermined demand .
Natural gas for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was recently up 3.5 cents , or 0.86 % , at $ 4.12 a million British thermal units .
The front - month contract sank to $ 4.05 / MMBtu in earlier trading -- the lowest intraday level in nearly six months .
" We 're not believers that gas price is sustainable this low but rig count strength is a real overhang on both gassy stocks and natural gas prices right now , " analysts with the Houston - based energy investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Friday .

The most remarkable and revealing speech of the health care debate was delivered by Paul Ryan , the new right - wing idol .
In the preceding weeks , Ryan had largely cast his opposition to health care reform in the wonkiest of terms , assailing the administration 's claims to fiscal responsibility .
This time he did so in the language of first principles :
Should we now subscribe to an ideology where government creates rights , is solely responsible for delivering these artificial rights , and then systematically rations these rights ?
Do we believe that the goal of government is to promote equal opportunity for all Americans to make the most of their lives ?
Or , do we now believe that government 's role is to equalize the results of peoples lives ?
The philosophy advanced on this floor by this Majority today is so paternalistic and so arrogant .
This is the expression of a fundamental philosophical divide .
Liberals do not believe in equality of outcome in most spheres of life .
There are myriad punishments for the losers of the free market that liberals can accept : less money , less vacation time , lower social status , more uncomfortable , dangerous , or physically draining work .
But the denial of medical treatment should not be among those punishments .
Conservatives generally have n't challenged this premise head on .
They may object to Democratic health care reform on the grounds that covering the uninsured can be done more cheaply and efficiently using other ( more conservative ) means , or on the grounds that we can't afford to cover the uninsured until health care costs have first been reduced .
Ryan was challenging this view .
He believes that access to medical care is a matter of personal responsibility -- something we should have the opportunity to acquire for ourselves , but not actually to have as a matter of right .
Medical care is like a flat - screen television -- a nice thing if you can get it , but not society 's responsibility to provide .
A couple weeks ago , I wrote about the radical opposition to redistribution that sits at the heart of Ryan 's worldview .
Ross Douthat objected that I was engaged in " caricaturing and misrepresentation . "
Douthat 's conceded my most important points , brushing them aside by restating them in weakened form .
I pointed out that Ryan would transform the federal tax code from a slightly progressive instrument into a sharply regressive one , a change that would " amount to the greatest shift of resources from the non-rich to the rich in the history of the United States , by far . "
Douthat replies , " Ryan ’s proposed changes to the tax code — his reduction in the highest rates , and his addition of a consumption tax — would shift the tax burden down the income ladder , just as Chait says . "
Yes , that 's a fairly big deal , is n't it ?
These concept headphones feature a build - in camera , projector and wireless device so you can live - stream your life to the internet .

Comfy !

These actually look wearable !
But I do n't know why the hell there 's a projector on there .

Nearly 300 Bills Have Passed in House Since Current 111th Congress Took Office Nearly 14 Months Ago -- Many With Broad Bipartisan Support --
Only to be Tied Up by Unprecedented Brick Wall of Republican Filibusters in Senate ; Minority Party Has No Constitutional Authority to Hold All Legislation Hostage by forcing 60 - Vote ' Super Majority ' in 100 - Member Chamber
( Posted 5:00 a.m. EST Monday , March 1 , 2010 )
= ==================
By SKEETER SANDERS
= ==================
In a scathing editorial published two weeks ago on my blog site , The ' Skeeter Bites Report , this writer argued forcefully that the minority Republicans in the U.S. Senate were engaging in an unprecedented -- and unconstitutional -- abuse of power with their blanket use of the filibuster to block passage of virtually every piece of legislation proposed by the Obama administration and the Democratic majority in Congress .
" Senate Republicans . . . are vowing to use their newly - bolstered filibuster power to stymie virtually every domestic policy initiative that [ President ] Obama proposes , " the editorial thundered .
" To say that this would paralyze the Senate would be a gross understatement .
This is nothing less than a declaration by the Republicans of an insurrection against the administration and the majority party in Congress intended to make it impossible for the president to govern effectively .
" This is a flat - out abuse of power that imposes a tyranny of the minority , " the editorial continued , " a tyranny that is clearly unconstitutional and violates the most precious tenet of democracy :
That within the parameters set by the Constitution , the majority rules . "
In the two weeks since that editorial was published , solid evidence has emerged to back up that conclusion .
NUMBER OF FILIBUSTERS SOAR SINCE OBAMA'S INAUGURATION
For starters , the McClatchy Newspapers , in an analysis on the performance of the Senate since the current 111th Congress took office 14 months ago , reported that Senate Republicans " are using the filibuster to limit and often derail Democrats ' initiatives , paralyzing the Senate and making it nearly impossible to accomplish even the most routine matters . "
McClatchy noted that in the more than 13 months since President Obama took office , the number of filibusters -- and the cloture votes to kill them -- have risen dramatically .
And they have come on a range of issues so broad as to be without precedent .
To date , there have been 42 votes to invoke cloture , of which all but four were successful .
McClatchy estimates that if the partisan warfare continues , by the time the 111th Congress ends its term in December 2012 , there could be as many as 153 cloture votes -- an all - time record high .
After Thursday 's health - care reform summit between Obama and congressional leaders , in which both parties essentially dug in their heels , there is absolutely zero evidence that the warfare wo n't end any time soon .
On the contrary , it is certain to solidify even further .
The bickering has tied up the Senate in knots -- and the GOP minority has made it abundantly clear , both privately and publicly , that a filibuster - proof 60 - vote " super majority " will be required to pass " not only major Democratic programs , but also many routine proposals . "
The 100 - member Senate 's 58 Democrats and two allied independents -- Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut -- ostensibly lost their filibuster - proof majority on February 4 with the swearing - in of Senator Scott Brown ( R- Massachusetts ) , although Brown quickly broke ranks with his fellow Republicans to cast his first vote in favor of a $ 15 billion job - creation bill .
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT AUTHORIZE 'SUPER MAJORITY ' TO PASS BILLS
However , the Senate Republicans ' determination to impose a 60 - vote requirement in order to pass bills is not supported by the Constitution .
The filibuster is a creature of the Senate itself .
It is employed under the internal rules of the Senate .
Under Article I of the Constitution -- which spells out the legislative authority of Congress -- each house is free to create its own rules for parliamentary procedure .
But Senate Rule 22 , which establishes the filibuster , is neither part of the Constitution nor is it a statute .
Nowhere does the Constitution grant the minority party in either chamber of Congress any authority to impose a requirement that a super - majority of votes be reached in order to pass legislation .
To the contrary , in only three instances does the Constitution specifically require a super - majority : the passage of amendments to the Constitution itself ; the ratification by the Senate of treaties ; and the override of presidential vetoes of legislation approved by Congress .
In each case , a two - thirds majority ( 67 votes in the 100 - member Senate , 290 votes in the 435 - member House ) is required .
290 BILLS PASSED BY HOUSE STALLED IN SENATE BY GOP FILIBUSTERS
That Senate Republicans have imposed an unconstitutional " tyranny of the minority " was made even more evident last Tuesday , when House leaders made public a list of 290 bills that passed in the lower chamber -- only to be stalled in the Senate by the Republicans ' blanket use of the filibuster .
Many of those bills passed the House with broad bipartisan support , including a critically - needed measure aimed at bolstering the security of the Internet .
That bill passed by an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority of 422 to five .
Another is a bill to crack down on predatory mortgage lending .
That measure passed in May by a 300 - 114 margin , with 60 Republicans voting " aye . "
Still another is a measure to stimulate job growth by increasing opportunities for small - business entrepreneurs .
That bill also passed the House in May by a whopping 406 - 15 margin , with 159 Republicans voting in favor .
In September , the House passed , by a lopsided 406 - 18 -- with 161 Republican " ayes " -- a measure to prohibit increases in medicare part B premiums charged to millions of senior citizens who do not receive their annual cost - of - living increase in their Social Security benefits .
GOP ALSO BLOCKED CONFIRMATION OF SCORES OF OBAMA NOMINEES
But legislation is n't the only thing that Senate Republicans have been tying up for months .
They 've also stymied the confirmations of scores of nominees to high - level positions in the Obama administration by placing holds on their nominations -- preventing the Senate from holding confirmation votes .
The Republicans did an about - face and allowed confirmation votes on the president 's nominees only after Obama threatened to take advantage of Congress ' week - long Presidents Day break to invoke his executive authority to make recess appointments .
The Senate confirmed 27 of the president 's nominees on February 12 after Obama made his threat in a testy exchange with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Kentucky ) during a White House meeting with congressional leaders .
An unusually high number of nominees to top positions in the Obama administration -- 63 in all -- " had been stalled in the Senate because one or more senators placed a hold on their nomination , " the president said in a statement .
" And so . . .
I told Senator McConnell that if Republican senators did not release these holds , I would exercise my authority [ under Article II of the Constitution ] to fill critically - needed positions in the federal government temporarily through the use of recess appointments . "
HOYER BLAMES SENATE GOP INTRANSIGENCE FOR PARALYSIS ON CAPITOL HILL
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Maryland ) put the blame squarely on Republicans for the ongoing paralysis in the Senate .
Appearing on MSNBC , Hoyer accused the Senate Republican leadership of having decided that " failure and gridlock are to its political benefit , and as a result , we 've had more requests for cloture or filibuster votes than at any time in history . "
The result , said Hoyer , is that the blanket filibusters by GOP senators " has brought , in effect , the Senate 's ability to do its business to a standstill sometimes and to a slow walk at others . "
SENATE GRIDLOCK A FACTOR IN BAYH'S RETIREMENT
And that paralysis is a major reason why Senator Evan Bayh ( D - Indiana ) has decided not to seek re-election .
In an op - ed column published February 20 in The New York Times , Bayh wrote that the filibuster , which " historically . . . was employed to ensure that momentous issues receive a full and fair hearing " has instead " come to serve the exact opposite purpose -- to prevent the Senate from even conducting routine business . "
Bayh noted that the Senate last fall " had to overcome two successive filibusters to pass a bill to provide millions of Americans with extended unemployment insurance . "
Even though there was no opposition to the measure -- it passed unanimously , with two senators absent -- " some senators saw political advantage in drawing out debate , thus preventing the Senate from addressing other pressing matters . "
Historically , filibusters have been employed in the Senate most often to block passage of reform legislation , ranging from the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s to the post - Watergate clean - government measures of the 1970s .
It was as a result of massive public outrage against the use of filibusters to block reform bills aimed at curbing abuses of government power under the administration of President Richard Nixon in the 1970s that prompted a change of Senate rules in 1975 to to reduce the number of votes required to kill off filibusters from 67 -- the same two - thirds majority required to override presidential vetoes , ratify treaties and pass constitutional amendments -- to the present 60 .
But who would have thought back then that a move aimed at curbing abuses of power by the executive branch would one day pave the way for abuses of power by the minority party in the legislative branch ?
' MINORITY TYRANNY ' AN AFFRONT TO REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY
What was originally intended to protect the minority party 's right to debate and push for a compromise on legislation is now being used by the minority party to totally stymie the agenda of not only the majority party , but also that of the president .
This wholesale use of the filibuster by minority Senate Republicans is totally without precedent and is in no way supported by the Constitution .
Indeed , the U.S. Senate is the only freely elected legislative body in the world in which the minority party can thwart the will of the majority party , unless the majority party can muster 60 votes .
It is an affront to representative democracy and the clearly expressed will of the American people who voted for the majority party in the last general election .
The time is past due for the majority Democrats in the Senate to break the logjam by either invoking the reconciliation process to get those 290 House - passed bills to the president 's desk for his signature , or by invoking the so - called " nuclear option , " in which Vice President Joe Biden , in his constitutional capacity as president of the Senate , declares the GOP 's blanket filibuster unconstitutional .
Enough is enough !
Either way , this " tyranny of the minority " in the Senate must be brought to an end -- now .

The economic slump has yet to damp innovation in Silicon Valley , at least not by one widely followed measure : patent production .
Silicon Valley denizens received 13,231 , or 7.9 % , of the total 167,350 " utility " patents granted in the U.S. in 2009 , according to IFI Patent Intelligence , a unit of Wolters Kluwer Health that analyzes patent data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .
That is on par with Silicon Valley 's share of patents nationwide in 2008 and 2007 , according to IFI .

One of Romania 's most powerful criminals has warned his country must do something to stop the wave of Gypsy child crime that is sweeping Europe or face a backlash against Romanians .
Simply known as Breliant , he freely boasts a pedigree rich in thieves .
But this week on Four Corners he explains that unless gangs run by his countrymen stop using children to rob and steal , the Romanian Gypsies will be driven out of other EU countries .
" ( In the past ) they stole because it was a necessity , they did n't steal to make fortunes or turn it into a business , as they do nowadays , " he said .
" This is something that I disapprove of and that 's why I recommend that they should set a limit , they should calm down because the thieving - what they are doing now - it 's no longer a national problem .
It 's happening on an international scale . "
Any tourist in Europe knows the threat of street crime is a major problem .
Some people are targeted by pickpockets while others are harassed at cash teller machines .
Most of the thieves are young children below the age of 14 .
In many countries they cannot be held criminally responsible until they pass 14 years .
Lucrative
One of the children spoken to by Four Corners is 13 - year - old Daniela .
She has little or no education but pickpocketing in Madrid can earn her up to $ 500 for a successful robbery .
If she gets away with her scam she takes the money to her mother .
It is used to buy food and some of it is repatriated to Romania to buy a house .
This week 's Four Corners reveals that while some children steal to survive , many are part of a network of organised groups that rob tourists and locals , passing the money back to crime bosses in Romania .
The wave of crime perpetrated by Gypsy children began in earnest when Romania was admitted to the EU .
It is now so bad that authorities in the major Italian city of Milan have declared a state of emergency .
The city officials authorised police to set up an undercover operation that used hidden cameras and telephone taps to arrest dozens of people .
In all , 19 adults were jailed for theft and the abuse of children .
The investigation found some children were generating up to $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 a month from their criminal activities .
That did not mean the children were well - treated .
In one raid , police broke into a farmhouse and found children locked in a cupboard .
They were unwashed and malnourished .
Mistreatment
The raids and the prosecutions have not stopped the crime wave .
Producer Liviu Tipurita used hidden cameras to film children in several locations stealing from locals and tourists .
He then tracked the children back to the slums that are their homes .
What he found is shocking .
While the rest of Europe boasts an expensive public education and welfare system , a majority of Gypsy children do not attend school .
Many live in tin sheds next to rubbish dumps with no running water or official power sources .
The Four Corners report also details the Gypsy practice of selling female children into marriage .
Secret filming shows a 13 - year - old girl 's wedding celebration underway .
She has been sold for nearly $ 10,000 .
In the first instance she is valuable because she is a virgin , but her major selling point is her ability to steal up to $ 600 a day .
Her husband fully expects she will quickly provide him a return on his investment .
The response to the crime wave varies .
Some right - wing political activists want the Gypsies killed .
Other groups are trying to socialise them by educating children and encouraging the older Roma , as they are also called , to take jobs .
Whatever the response has been , so far it is clear more needs to be done and if governments do not react in a positive way there may be violence and possibly even deaths as citizens take the law into their own hands .

Over the weekend , NASA engineers will conduct additional tests to determine if Discovery can launch “ as is ” or have to be rolled back for repairs — which would mean a three - month delay for the STS - 131 mission .
Helium regulator assemblies downstream from a failed isolation valve in the shuttle ’s right rear maneuvering engine pod must work perfectly to provide a system redundancy that would justify proceeding with the flight .
If they do n’t , then the regulator assemblies and the valve would need to be repaired or replaced , and neither can be done at the launchpad – meaning Discovery would have to be rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building , de-mated from the SRBs and external tank , and sent to the Orbiter Processing Facility for repairs .
But if the regulators check out , and no other problems arise , mission managers could give the ‘ go ’ to launch Discovery as is on April 5 , 2010 .
Today on the launchpad , said NASA Payload Manager Joe Delai was optimistic about the tests .
“ It ’s looking good , ” he said .
“ They will do a test on Saturday to make sure the two valves farther down the line work , and if that looks good , we ’ll put the payload on board . ”
Engineers will evaluate the data and discuss options at a readiness review Tuesday morning .
In anticipation of a good report on the regulator tests , the canister carrying the payload for Discovery ’s STS - 131 mission to the International Space Station was brought to Launch Pad 39A early on March 19 .
Later , reporters were allowed an unusual visit right on the pad and close to Discovery to see the work in progress and talk with Delai and Boeing payload flow manager , Mike Kinslow .
Enjoy these great close - up images by Universe Today photographer Alan Walters of Discovery on the on launchpad , with the Rotating Service Structure rolled back , allowing a view of the payload canister .
STS - 131 will be a three - spacewalk space station assembly and resupply mission .
The Leonard Multi- purpose Logistics Module that will be installed in Discovery ’s payload bay will bring up 5,000 kg ( 11,000 lbs ) of food , water , clothes , parts , science experiments , supply units for the oxygen generation system , and five science utilization racks .
Other very interesting additions to the ISS on this flight include : , the fourth crew sleep station ( CQ4 ) – which is a phone booth - like small crew quarters , the MARES ( Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System ) – which Delai compared to a Bowflex for the ISS crew , a new Minus Eighty - degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS ( MELFI ) which will be used to support science experiments , and a “ dark room ” for photography called WORF – Window Observational Research Facility , allowing for better images to be taken from the observation window in the US lab Destiny .
10:36 am - History is the Present in the Age of Broken Hearts
I 'm rewatching the X - Files .
On VHS tapes , which means that instead of a complete season , have a set of selected episodes " chosen by fans " most of which have to do with the larger story arc- government collaboration with aliens to create a hybrid species ( or , later , humans immune to the black oil ) that can survive colonization .
The house only has the first three seasons , which while foundational , do n't get particularly far into the mythology .
There are more meaningful silences - or , since the series was always stagey , Meaningful Silences with scare caps - than explanations , more ominous coincidence than closure .
I 'm also reading Marge Piercy 's Gone to Soldiers which I know seems like the kind of non-sequitur , but bear with me .
Sci - fi ages faster than war stories , and a decade - old series is usually enjoyable as much for the technological and predictive absurdities as for the plots .
Plus , look at their hair !
Look at the funny cars !
When did you last check your email on an 80 - column amber - screen monitor ?
Both the series and the novel occupy similarly dated , but similarly familiar locations in my historical imagination , and can be enjoyed as a commentary on the American view of American history .
More importantly , they represent the up - slope and down - slope of the Great American Master Narrative of the 20th century .
Gone To Soldiers is the story of several Americans , French Jews , and refugees , during the prodrome of WWII and continuing into and through the war .
Some become soldiers or partisans , others work in merchant marine or other war industries , but a significant cluster are involved in the formation of the OSS and the development of the modern government - technology interconnection later dubbed the military industrial complex .
Soldiers captures well the story of the forties ( and later the fifties ) as an exciting time in which American engineering and science could , with government direction , recreate the world for better .
This narrative seems to have been appealing after the depression and war for two reasons .
First , ridiculously , for the utopia it promised , but secondly , because it gave smart kids a master narrative - an idea that there was a larger project , in with which they could throw their lot , which would give their lives meaning and their future a taste of the security their parents had never seen .
Technocracy , which I use to include not just electricity too cheap to meter and crops from fencerow to fencerow , but also the foreign aid idea ( that experts could fix the rest of the world too ) and the end - of - history triumphalism about democratic political systems , mirrored the twentieth century 's other master narrative , communism , which also gave individuals a way to contextualize the aches and pains of the day to day as part of a multi- generational project for a better world .
By 1994 and the X - files , though , while the gantries and pylons of the technocratic narrative still loom at the corners of Americans ' peripheral vision , the gossamer edifice of a better world no longer hangs compelling between them .
We believe the government could coordinate massive resources , keep incredible secrets , and develops world - changing technologies - we just do n't like them very much .
The X - files and similar late - twentieth - century science fiction succeeded because they told , over and over again , the darkest version of the Manhattan Project .
What remained of the master narrative was hostile , paranoid , and unrelentingly pessimistic .
Its worth remembering that Gone To Soldiers was written in 1987 , seven years before the X - Files went on the air .
They do n't actually record two ends of a historical arc , they record how people at one moment in time saw two ends of a historical arc , both of which must be percieved simultaneously to understand the sense of betrayal .
The X - Files mythos does n't grab us unless we also believe in the naive optimism of Gone To Soldiers , and the cautious exuberance of the characters of Soldiers is n't poignant unless we also recognize Mulder screaming at his father for collaborating with former - nazi scientists .
My point is , the technocratic arc is n't actually the narrative of the middle of the century as much as historiography of the collapse of the technocratic arc is the narrative of the turn of the century .

In another non-sequitur - like jump , I 'm going to move to a new story for a moment .
The guy who shot up the Pentagon had something in common with the guy who flew an airplane into the IRS building in Austin .
Does anybody know what it is ?
[ pause for response ]
No , it was n't politics - both were failed high - tech small business owners .
The pentagon shooter , John Patrick Bedell , was CEO of a biotech startup .
The IRS crasher , Joseph Stack , had founded and lost a software company .
In this , they have most in common with Amy Bishop or Malik Nadal Hassan - both of whom were also batshit crazy , by the way , and set off scads of alarm bells throughout their careers , and there 's an interesting essay on the difference between the public interpretation of Hassan ( radicalized muslim ; investigate his mosque ! ) and Bishop ( crazy lady ; investigate her husband ) - in that all were highly educated and groomed for successful professional careers , and went violently over the edge at the point where those careers became untenable .
All saw themselves acting against a coordinated , secretive and insidious enemy that had stifled them :
Bedell felt the military was covering up all manner of conspiratorial bad behavior against Americans , Stack felt the IRS was undermining America and the American idea , Bishop felt her tenure committee was working against her , Hassan felt he was being asked to participate in a religious war against his own religion .
Stack and Bishop had first acted against their own families .
Hassan , Bedell and Stack had all tried to argue their points in public and felt that only apocalyptic violence would make anyone listen .
All had been significantly alienated for a period prior to their explosions .
All were wildly self - destructive .
Ran Prieur , who I will continue to quote and correspond with even as the message board he founded lists ( without him ) into free - floating paranoia and casual anti-semitism , suggested this is the age of broken hearts .
The trajectory from hard work to education to success is illusory , and a certain kind of person raised to believe in it is becoming the violent casualty .
Those of us who were raised in a fundamentally stable world , have been asked since childhood to prepare for when we grow up , have carried around in our heads the stories of our own futures .
We can not live easily without them .
For every paranoid person who shoots up their former factory line or office , there are a hundred news stories correlating a certain size uptick in the foreclosure rate with an increase in family violence .
The fact is that people who are hungry will not burn down their own house in frustration , but people who have lost the narrative thread of their lives will - despair is more violent than starvation , and stories are more dear than bread .
In a sense , the eschatological mood in public discourse and politics , which is deemed partisanship but is perhaps more complex than that , is the same phenomenon write large .
Unemployment , foreclosure , and a waning prominence in international politics are facts , but the stories we tell ourselves about them are neither disprovable nor fixed .
Right now , the most common story seems to go like this : in our collective imagination , we the nation believed , in the forties and fifties , that our engineers and science and democracy would make the world a better place , but our best efforts were betrayed by the intrigues of shadowy cabals .
In our collective imagination , we have been robbed of our future , and there is no clear future story of America .
Beyond this point we will embrace anything - the rapture , the fraudulent election of a socialist muslim nazi to throw us into UN camps , an unusual number of zeros in an odd , local and otherwise poorly - understood Central American calendrical system - to return to our lives a narrative context of insight , struggle , and future triumph .
There are variations , differences in the apportioning of blame , arguments about the permanence of the present economy , but pessimism seems uniformly predominant .
In a sense , a national abruption is the master narrative into which foreclosed , fired , or frustrated individuals can contextualize their personal misfortunes .
We 've seen what this sort of abruption can do to a paranoid individual .
We 've seen ( yes , we have ) what it can do to a nation in certain circumstances .
Stack , Bedell , Bishop and Hassan all had selected a single enemy ; the US has not yet decided which shadowy cabal should bear the blame for its troubles .
We are losing our inhibitions around vengeance - today the US captured the first American charged with death - penalty treason since the Rosenbergs - and around class - aggregate punitive restraints , but we have shown no signs of either impending civil war ( despite the Huffpost comment crowd ) or military conflict with China ( the other side . )
But , we do seem to like our dystopian sci-fi .

So nice to read your words again !
" . . . this is the age of broken hearts : "
When I suggested something like this a year ago , you said that , in fact , all of these murder / suicide rampages were indistinguishable from any other time in history .
Do I have that right ?
Am I misreading what you had said ?

Well I do n't know .
I feel busted here .
Murder - suicide rampages are not new , not by a long stretch , nor is their sensational reception ( penny - dreadfuls and murder ballads make that clear ) but ... there 's a sort of weird , isolated paranoiac theme here ?
Maybe this is just the human narrative tendency , the need to see everything in terms of agents and actors , and any time personal misfortune overtakes an individual , or national misfortune overtakes a country , there 's a certain proportion who seek violent revenge ?
Definitely the story is that this is a new surge in the phenomenon , but perhaps that 's always the story ?
Maybe my point in this article is that one consequence of self - exculpatory persecution fantasies is redemptive violence ?
Do you have a link to the other conversation ?
I may have changed my mind .

For instance , in 1949 , a WWII vet named Howard Unruh developed paranoid fantasies about his neighbors which , combined with his probable PTSD and possible closeted - ness , prompted him to kill thirteen people in Camden , NJ .
In his own neighborhood .
Whom he knew .
The immediate reaction was what you 'd expect : lots of news coverage , exploration of Unruh 's past , sensational descriptions of the killings , interviews with survivors , etc .
It was thrilling .
The longer - term consequences are more interesting .
By some accounts , this triggered , or certainly accelerated , the decline of that particular neighborhood of Camden .
There were other factors , of course , including suburbanization and the arrival of the post - industrial age , but Unruh 's actions , anti-social in the most basic sense of the word , are significant .
I do n't know if there is more redemptive violence now than there used to be .
We have fewer legitimate outlets for our violent tendencies , access to more , and more deadly , weapons than we used to , and greater access to information about individual people and events that happen far from home .

I hope this post works , most of the instructions appear to be in Russian ( at least I think it 's Russian )
A lot of the Crash Advice we 've heard over the last few years has centered around the basic idea that we will need to find a way to defend ourselves from the great unwashed masses when they go hungry - but what you 're saying is that it 's the alienated professionals that we 're going to have to look out for , people in expensive clothes with a crazed look in their eye .

There 's also a self - fulfilling prophecy at work in the LATOC vision of the future - if people become so convinced that the mutant zombie bikers are coming for them that they stash buttloads of food and start shooting at strangers they will , indeed , become the kind of dangerous and unwelcome individual that the rest of the world does n't want around .
I 'm not actually worried about a wave of heavily armed ex-engineers storming the neighborhood .
Each of the individuals I wrote about had checked out of reality a long time ago .
What they were acting out , though , was violent resentment and despair which , even if it does n't reach the point of a shooting rampage , certainly impedes the functioning of a community .
Every day I depend on dozens , maybe hundreds of people making tiny , unnoticeable sacrifices to get along - from someone asking the bus driver to wait on the person running down the block waving , to picking up dog poop in baggies , to smiling and telling jokes at the free book shelf .
We live as if other people matter .
There are a lot of ways to lose touch with that besides shooting up your employers .
I worry - and certain " crash advice " websites do n't reassure me - that prosocial behavior is an obligation certain crashbloggers can't wait for an excuse to escape .

In re # 4 ( the rest will have to wait for chores ) -
Part of why this entry is so obtusely written is that I could n't actually decide where I fell on this question .
One possibility is what you say .
The other , though , is that we have a strong , potent , and possibly explosive narrative , which is this : " we have no narrative ; we lost it through diffidence , and our own weakness in the face of active subversion . "
That there is an internal contradiction in this story makes it all the more dangerous .
What you say - cheap goods and escapism - are the scourges with which the penitent have flogged themselves since anyone started writing things down , certainly the < a href = " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mara>Mara</a> fits this description .
This ambivalence in my thinking is why the fact that < u> Gone To Soldiers < /u > was written comparatively recently matters - along with our sense of cataclysm , we need to construct a peak from which we have slipped .
Was it real ?
Are we more aimless now than in the forties ?
Or is " aimlessness " merely a self - reproach we use to expiate what we now believe are our sins ?
Collective self - reproach for percieved failure goes terrible places , historically , just as individual self - reproach went to a terrible place in the minds of Bishop , Stack , Bishop and Hassan .
I am worried that what we are seeing in Sen .
Bunning 's shutdown of the highway department , or Sarah Palin 's rejection of scientific authority , are the beginnings of an apocalyptic atonement that will become the struggle our culture feels it needs to justify its sense of meaningfulness .
A metaphorical shooting rampage , if you will .
Because , to bastardize Chekhov , if there are scourges in the first act , in the third act someone will bleed ...

Do I have your number anywhere ?
Ответить ) ( Parent ) ( Thread From : joanhello Date : Март 11 , 2010 02:55 pm ( Link ) Hi. I got to this LJ from Ran Prieur 's site .
Very impressed .
Okay if I friend you ?
Speaking of broken hearts :
Last fall there was a longish essay in the Washington Post about the development of a formula in American post - apocalyptic movies .
It 's down now , as usual with WashPost content more than a couple of weeks old , but I 'll try to summarize .
The formula goes like this : civilization is brought down by some sort of McGuffin and an ordinary man has to cope , alone at first .
Most of those around him are violent , crazy or both , but he meets an ordinary woman and rescued a lost child and the three fall directly into traditional family roles .
Whatever happens in the movie after that , the family unit stands strong and is still together when the movie ends .
The author saw the formula as wish - fulfillment for the kind of materially competent but interpersonally inept men who long for traditional family life , where all they would have to be is protectors and providers , without the stress - inducing modern requirement that they concern themselves with their wives ' emotional needs .
Something similar has been projected as the underlying emotional rationale for LATOC predictions .
I have noticed myself that the kind of society the Transition Towners and their allies are advocating , characterized by less competition and consumption , more cooperation and neighborliness , is the same one that 's been advocated by followers of E. F. Schumacher and Christopher Lasch ever since this country urbanized in the 1950s on the grounds that humans are happier in the latter sort of society .
I 'm sure the advocates really would be happier in that sort of society , that they do find corporate jobs and shopping for manufactured goods at malls empty and meaningless .
They are frustrated that the general public does n't share their assessment and rise up to demand the small - is - beautiful society .
However , since the majority seems disinclined to do so ( being supposedly brainwashed into acquiescence ) they look forward to a change in circumstances beyond human control that will finally force the world to conform to their fantasies .
The TTers and permaculturalists and anti-civilization people ( not the misanthropists but the anarcho - primitivists who do n't think the neo- agrarians go far enough and want to return to tribal life ) are the only ones I am aware of these days who seem to have some hope .

I agree - actually , that 's one of my favorite ways to read Aliens - there 's a lot of chaos and death and then suddenly look !
Its Ripley , Bishop and Newt , a postmodern nuclear family .
Oddly enough there 's a similar strain in women 's fiction ; I read , in a row , Ruth Ozeki's All Over Creation , Barbara Kingsolver 's The Bean Trees , and Kingsolver 's Prodigal Summer all of which focus on women whose narrative arcs begin with frustrated solitude and end with unexpected fatherless children ( though there may be a male partner somewhere in the picture . )
I 'm not sure that women 's emotional needs are a modern requirement for relationships !
I think the story of male selfhood as unconcerned with same is fairly recent , but I also think we do a terrible job raising boys to anticipate and respond to anybody 's emotions , even their own .
However , I wonder if the LATOC narrative is n't more concerned with professional and materialist failure than loneliness and the search for family .
LATOC seems quite male , and grepping the word " wife " suggests ... well , its ugly .
Users seem confident that surviving a collapse will increase their appeal ( the " provider / protector " role , as you describe ) but there 's nothing like the fire that burns against people who " have things " now but do n't realize how their comfort is based on " lies . "
Women , and relationships with women , seem to be in the apocalyptic imagination one more spoil of war , one more reward tomorrow for detachment and correct belief today .
The primary drive seems to be " freedom " from comparison to people who have done more , or better , in the current society , by the current culture 's methods of accounting .
The transition town thing ?
Love it , actually .
Has a bit of the airdrop - utopia problem , in common with permaculture , but that 's a very fine grain of criticism .
I was involved with an Ohio TT group when I was out there , and in fact wrote a series of essays for them that I 've lost track of and wish I could import here .
I feel like seeking a way for groups people to be happier is a much better goal than seeking a way for individuals to be the last one left alive .
I 've always used the evaluative criterion " would it be good to live that way now ? " which falls heavily in favor of TT ideas , heavily against doomers , but perhaps another would be " if you could bring about this way of living at the cost of your own life , would you ? "
By the way , of course you can friend .

Israeli troops charged over use of boy as human shield
Israel and Hamas were accused of war crimes in the 22 - day war in Gaza The Israeli military has charged two of its soldiers with endangering the life of a Palestinian boy during Israel 's offensive against Hamas in Gaza .
The army said the soldiers , who had been searching a building , had instructed the nine - year - old to open bags they suspected were booby - trapped .
This practice , banned by the Israeli military , is known as using someone as a human shield .
Use of civilians as human shields is widely considered a war crime .
The Israeli rights organisation , B'Tselem welcomed the indictments .
But the group repeated its call for an independent investigation of the army 's operation in Gaza .
The war lasted for 22 days starting on 27 December 2008 .
' Breach military norms '
The soldiers , both staff sergeants , were charged with " engaging in unauthorised conduct in a way that endangered life and health " , military sources said .
The bags the Palestinian boy was forced to open turned out to be harmless .
DIFFERENT DEATH TOLLS
Palestinians killed during Israeli military offensive in Gaza , 27 Dec to 18 Jan - Palestinian claims followed by Israelis claims : Total dead : 1,434 / 1,166 Fighters : 235 / 710-870 Non-combatants : 906 / 295-460 Women : 121 / 49 Children under 16 : 288 / 89 Sources : Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and Israeli Defence Intelligence Research Dept Israel ' understated ' Gaza deaths UN receives Goldstone responses Israel condemns UN's Gaza report Full Goldstone report
The Israeli military has opened about 150 investigations into alleged misconduct during the operation , which was named " Cast Lead " .
About 40 of these are criminal investigations .
This is the second to lead to an indictment .
In the first , a soldier was jailed for seven months for using a credit card he stole from a Palestinian in Gaza to withdraw money in Israel .
Also , in January , the Israel military said it had reprimanded two top army officers for authorising an artillery attack using white phosphorus shells which hit a UN compound in Gaza last year .
Critics have said it is not sufficient for the military to investigate itself .
B'Tselem called again for an independent investigation into the war in a statement : " Military police investigations are not the appropriate instrument to investigate allegations regarding operation Cast Lead . "
" Israel must appoint an Israeli body , external to the army , to conduct an independent and effective investigation , " it added .
In September 2009 , South African judge Richard Goldstone delivered a report to the UN Human Rights Council that concluded that war crimes had been committed by the Israeli military and Hamas , the Islamist militant group that runs Gaza .
He accused Israel of deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure during the conflict .
Hamas 's use of indiscriminate rocket fire was judged a war crime .
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields by conducting military operations from densely populated areas .
Human rights groups say about 1,400 Palestinians were killed in the fighting , though Israel puts the number at about 1,100 .
Thirteen Israeli also died during the conflict .

Magnolia Solar Brings Nano - Engineered , Non-Toxic , Low Cost Thin Film to the Table
March 6th , 2010 by Tina Casey
Fresh on the heels of IBM ’s breakthrough in low cost solar , Magnolia Solar Corporation has announced that its low cost thin film technology maybe coming soon to a solar array near you .
The company has just won a $ 1 million Department of Energy grant for advancing the technology in partnership with the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany in New York .
[ social_buttons ]
Like IBM , Magnolia Solar is focused on delivering genuinely clean ( as opposed to “ clean coal ” clean ) , high efficiency solar energy that can compete on the market with fossil fuels , while helping to shift photovoltaic technology away from a reliance on heavy metals .
Magnolia Solar , Q - Dots and Thin Film Technology
According to Magnolia , the company ’s thin film technology is capable of capturing a larger span of the light spectrum while using inexpensive substrates based on non-toxic materials .
The secret is in the quantum dots ( qdots ) and quantum wells .
Qdots are nanoscale crystals that were initially developed using heavy metals such as cadmium .
Next - generation qdots are being developed using nontoxic materials including nanodiamonds .
Quantum wells operate sort of like flower presses .
They force particles to move in a plane instead of a three - dimensional space , which results in high - density states and creates the potential for higher efficiency .
Many Roads to High - Efficiency Solar
Breakthrough photovoltaic technology such as Magnolia ’s is one piece of the solar energy puzzle .
There are a number of other pathways , such as new high tech coatings that boost solar efficiency by cutting down on dust and reflection , and the the use of more efficient solar tracking frames .
Another model that will boost solar ’s market - competitiveness is the development of solar power that is integrated into building elements including solar walls , and solar roofs that produce both electricity and hot water .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Although any T. Rex–enthralled kid will tell you that a gigantic asteroid wiped the dinosaurs off the planet , scientists have always regarded this impact theory as a hypothesis subject to revision based on further evidence gathered from around the globe .
Other possible causes , such as volcanism and smaller , multiple asteroid strikes , never actually went away , and over the years researchers raised important points that did not fully jibe with a history - changing celestial impact near the Yucatan peninsula one awful day some 65.5 million years ago .
A group of 41 researchers have pored over the evidence and decided that — in accordance with the original postulate put forth 30 years ago by a team led by father and son researchers Luis and Walter Alvarez — it was , indeed , a massive asteroid that slammed into Earth , creating Chicxulub Crater on Mexico 's Gulf Coast , that killed off many of the species on the planet , including the non-avian dinosaurs .
The review , published online March 4 in Science , evaluated the whole picture , according to Kirk Johnson of the Research and Collections Division at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and co-author of the paper .
And that meant assessing the other theories that have been put forth about what spelled death for the dinosaurs .
Fiery failures
The researchers dismiss the theory that the volcanism that produced the great Deccan Trap formation in western India at the end of the Cretaceous period might have produced enough sulfur and carbon dioxide to initiate a massive shift in climate .
They note that pinpointing the times when the heavy volcanism occurred is sketchy , and it likely kicked off some 400,000 years before the extinction event .
In fact , as Johnson noted in a March 3 conference call with reporters , the emissions from these volcanoes likely warmed the planet slightly , actually making life easier for many animals and encouraging diversification and dispersion over wider geographical areas .
Some scientists have pointed to multiple layers of impact residue as evidence that there was more than one asteroid involved in generating the extinction .
This theory did not seem to measure up , either .
Johnson says they see " no evidence for multiple impacts , " and sites that had turned up these various layers were so close to Chicxulub itself that the chaotic event likely churned the layers into different locations in the sediment .
An assertion that the impact occurred hundreds of thousands of years before the extinctions also failed to hold water with the researchers .
Evidence of Cretaceous period shells on top of the impact crater are likely not a sign that the animals persisted after the impact , but rather that they got " washed into the hole , " Johnson noted .
Global ground zero
The researchers assessed reports from some 350 sites all over the globe that had evidence of the impact — whether it was a dusting of iridium ( an element much more common in extraterrestrial objects ) or bits of shocked quartz — and could be traced back to the Chicxulub location .
In some areas near the crater , the layer was 80 meters thick , pointing to one single devastating day for life on the planet .
" That 's the single best explanation for the extinction of so many groups , " says Neil Landman , a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and was not involved in the review , about the single impact theory .
" We 've examined sites around the world , " he notes of his study of ammonoids , which are shelled cephalopods that went extinct after the Cretaceous .
And from the work he and his colleagues have done , he says , the evidence for the Chicxulub asteroid impact is the most consistent .
" I 'm very comfortable with this explanation . "
A massive blow
Based on the size of material from rocky shrapnel and the crater diameter , researchers have estimated the dino - demolishing object to be some 10 kilometers across .
And when it struck — at about 20 kilometers per second — it created an instant crater about 100 kilometers wide and 25 to 30 kilometers deep " almost piercing the crust of the Earth , " Johnson noted .
The final crater that formed after the initial impact was about 180 kilometers across and two kilometers deep , which is still close to the depth of the Grand Canyon , Johnson pointed out .
The impact spewed rock so high , some of it likely was shot into orbit , whereas other pieces entered the upper atmosphere , reheating as they fell back to the ground .
The jolt would have spurred massive earthquakes — some surpassing magnitude 11 — tsunamis and landslides .
While examining ammonoid fossils in southeastern Missouri , Landman says , he found a shallow water site that was " just immediately covered over by a jumble of stuff , " he says .
" I think what we 're seeing is a tsunami , " which might have reached as far from the Yucatan impact site as southern Illinois .
Perhaps most devastating , however , the crash would have caused acid rain and darkness , as particulate matter blocked sunlight , prohibiting photosynthesis in both land and water ecosystems , effectively shutting down large swaths of the food chain .
Directly after the extinction event , ferns ( which reproduce from spores ) proliferated and species that depended on detritus seemed to survive .
From Landman 's study of ammonoids , he points out that even for groups that eventually went extinct after the collision ( producing the so - called K–T boundary in the fossil record ) , the asteroid 's impact did not mean sudden eradication .
" There seems to be some suggestion of some survival for awhile after the event , " he says .
Fossils found above the iridium layer show that ammonoids might have survived " for tens to possibly hundreds of years afterward " perhaps because " things in the marine realm were a little more insulated , " he explains .
Although these estimates might seem rough for such a dramatic event , revealing details on the resolution of years and months " was unimaginable " in decades past , he says .
" It 's one of the best studied intervals of the geologic record , " he notes .
And all of this attention has led to increasing nuance in the timeline .
" This is not geologic time — this is instant time , " Johnson said , acknowledging that it is a very tricky task to pin down a single event from 65.5 million years ago .
But , judging from the chemical , geochemical and geochronological evidence , he said , " The Chicxulub Crater really is the culprit . "
WHEN times are hard , many people are tempted to let their credit cards take the strain for a while .
And when economies fall into recession , many governments are happy to let their budget deficits widen , to tide the economy over .
Sensible as this may be , deficits in several countries have increased so much and so fast during the economic crisis of the past 18 months or so that it is generally agreed that remedial action will be needed in the medium term .
Deficits of 10 % or more of GDP cannot be sustained for long , especially when nervous markets drive up the cost of servicing the growing debt .
Market pressure explains why deficits have come to the fore in southern Europe .
Greece and Portugal , in particular , have seen a sharp rise in their cost of finance and some investors have questioned their ability to roll over their debt .
But deficits will also be at the centre of the forthcoming British election campaign , and in America the “ tea party ” movement has launched a populist campaign against rising government spending .
There is no absolute rule on when deficits or public debts are too high relative to an economy 's size .
Prior to the crisis the general consensus was that rich countries could safely have public debts worth 60 % of GDP .
Yet although Japan 's debt has exceeded its GDP for many years , the government has yet to suffer a financing crisis , perhaps because it has a large number of willing domestic buyers of its bonds .
But when the markets do lose confidence in a government 's fiscal rectitude , a crisis can arise quite quickly , forcing countries into painful political decisions .
Plainly , economic growth makes policymakers ' lives much easier .
Growth reduces deficits automatically by increasing tax revenues and cutting spending on unemployment benefits and so forth .
As the economy grows , deficits fall , debts become more sustainable , lightening the adjustment burden and reassuring investors .
Nations have recovered from huge debt burdens in the past , often in the aftermath of wars , when men and resources were released from conflict and put to more productive work .
When politicians turn to today 's deficit problems , it is vital that they choose policies that enhance long - term growth prospects .
They will not lack opportunities : in several countries , for example , increases in statutory pension ages and other reforms that make labour markets more flexible are anyway overdue .
It would , however , be unwise to assume that a burst of rapid and prolonged growth is imminent in many rich economies .
Ageing or even shrinking populations make sluggish growth more likely .
Growth also tends to be weak in the aftermath of financial crises .
In a recent book on sovereign debt , “ This Time is Different ” , Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard conclude that “ the evidence offers little support for the view that countries simply grow out of their debts . ”
So , short of debt default or implicit default via inflation , that leaves two other ways of closing the deficit .
Spending must be cut or taxpayers must pay more .
Many political battles of the next few years will be fought on these simple lines , with taxpayers on one side and the beneficiaries of public spending on the other .
One imminent battle will be between taxpayers and public - sector workers .
In some countries , one party can be seen as representing taxpayers ( the Conservatives in Britain and the Republicans in America ) and the other the workers ( Labour and the Democrats , respectively ) .
Another of these fights will be between generations .
In America the biggest medium - term budget busters are pensions and health care for the old .
A big deficit may ease the economic pain in the short term but risks saddling the next generation with a growth - sapping burden of higher taxes and interest payments .
The battles are also intertwined : taxpayers finance the pensions of public employees which are , by and large , more generous and predictable than in the private sector .
The outcome of these battles will vary from country to country .
Both sides have potent weapons .
Many of the biggest taxpayers are political donors and have access to people in power .
If they are ignored , they may pack up and move to a more friendly jurisdiction .
In Europe especially , public employees , together with recipients of public services , probably have numbers on their side .
They are certainly better organised , via their trade unions , and they are political donors too .
As French workers have often shown , public - sector unions can intimidate governments with strikes and demonstrations .
Their Greek brethren have been trying to emulate them .
The case for cuts
Experience suggests that governments should focus on spending cuts rather than tax increases .
An NBER study of 1996 concluded that “ fiscal adjustments which rely primarily on spending cuts and the government wage bill have a better chance of being successful and are expansionary .
On the contrary , fiscal adjustments which rely primarily on tax increases and cuts in public investment tend not to last and are contractionary . ”
A paper by António Afonso of the European Central Bank and Davide Furceri of the OECD found that increases in government spending as a proportion of GDP tended to be correlated with slower economic growth .
And a paper published by Policy Exchange , a right - of - centre British think - tank , concluded that successful debt consolidations had put 80 % of the emphasis on spending cuts ( see table ) .
Some of the more successful deficit - cutting programmes were accompanied by falls in inflation and interest rates .
These made it easier for economies to rebound and helped shore up governments ' electoral support .
But today inflation is already low , as are most countries ' bond yields .
So cutting spending may not bring much reward from the markets in the shape of lower interest rates .
Yet the thought that spending might not be cut may bring punishment in the form of higher ones .
Cutting public spending is , however , a hard slog .
Spending on welfare rises automatically in a recession ; pension payments continue to grow as the population ages .
Western countries used the end of the cold war to slash defence budgets in the 1990s , but given continued military action in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism , further big reductions are hard to envisage .
Nor are there the easy , one - off gains to be made through privatisation of big industries pioneered in Britain in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher .
Barack Obama 's promise to freeze discretionary spending ( excluding defence and homeland security ) saves $ 250 billion over ten years — not much when annual deficits are $ 1 trillion or more .
So government will have to tackle much more politically sensitive areas .
Changes to Social Security ( pensions ) , which are not part of discretionary spending , are likely to form part of any fiscal reform in America .
Should the Conservatives win the British election , they may change eligibility for welfare payments .
Many governments have boxed themselves in by rewarding their own supporters with jobs or subsidies .
In Greece , the right - wing New Democracy party came to power in 2004 pledging a liberalisation of the economy .
When it left office in 2009 , it had more civil servants than when it started .
Such “ clientilism ” tends to lead to an ever bigger presence for the state in the economy , with more and more citizens depending on the government for employment and income .
These people then vote in favour of the status quo .
It may take a crisis to force governments to act in ways that hurt their core supporters .
When a crisis does occur , the markets tend to insist on public - expenditure cuts as a kind of test of the government 's machismo .
In a recent paper Ms Reinhart and Mr Rogoff say : “ Even countries that are committed to fully repaying their debts are forced to dramatically tighten fiscal policy in order to appear credible to investors and thereby reduce risk premia . ”
Governments may thus find their political decisions driven by the need to keep markets onside .
That is why the choice is so stark for the southern European countries , which are tied into the single - currency zone .
No longer do these countries have the option of devaluing their currencies , which they have resorted to many times in the past .
Nor can they combine tighter fiscal policy with loose monetary policy , because they do not control the latter .
Voters or creditors ?
If the cuts demanded are particularly painful , governments may simply be unwilling to bear the political cost of pushing them through .
A classic example occurred in 1931 when Britain was trying to remain on the gold standard .
The then Labour government was told that cuts in the budget deficit , in particular unemployment benefits , were required to appease the markets ; otherwise the Bank of England 's gold reserves would run out in two weeks .
The cabinet split .
Ramsay Macdonald , the prime minister , took charge of a ( largely Conservative ) coalition and has been reviled in left - wing circles ever since .
And after all that effort , the austerity plan failed to do the trick ; Britain left the gold standard within months .
The 1931 episode was viewed in Labour Party history as a “ bankers ' ramp ” in which financiers tried to bounce a government into hurting the poor .
Modern governments can also be tempted to blame “ speculators ” , a category covering everyone from bankers to hedge - fund managers , for their own failings .
The idea that creditors might be concerned about the governments ' ability to pay their debts — and thus insist on a higher interest rate — seems to be hard for politicians to accept .
At the Davos economic forum in January George Papandreou , Greece 's prime minister , said : “ This is an attack on the euro zone by certain other interests , political or financial , and often countries are being used as the weak link , if you like , of the euro zone . ”
Even so , the Greek government has accepted that its deficit needs to be trimmed .
In the politics of deficit reduction Mr Papandreou has some crucial advantages : opinion polls suggest that Greeks accept the need for austerity ; he won a substantial election victory last year ; the opposition is being supportive ; and his Pasok party has strong links with the trade unions .
It may be easier for a left - wing party to push through budget cuts .
Supportive social cohesion may explain Sweden 's successful fiscal tightening after the banking crisis of the early 1990s .
The Social Democratic government turned a budget deficit of 9.3 % of GDP in 1994 into a surplus of 1.2 % by 1998 .
Spending fell by more than five percentage points as a proportion of GDP and tax revenues rose by almost as much .
Growth averaged 3.2 % in 1994 -98 and unemployment was lower at the end than at the start — surely a political as well as an economic boon .
Politics within the government can help or hinder deficit reduction .
Canada had three failed attempts at fiscal reform before a successful austerity programme was unveiled in the Liberal Party 's budget in 1995 .
Earlier efforts had been blocked by government departments .
On the fourth attempt departments were encouraged to suggest sacrifices — and told that budgets would be cut by 10 % across the board if they failed to agree .
Cuts were made in several areas , including defence , farm subsidies and unemployment benefits .
The budget went from a deficit of 6.7 % of GDP in 1994 to a small surplus in 1997 .
It may be that tax hikes , particularly for the better off , are politically necessary to ensure popular acceptance that pain is being shared .
But big tax increases can do economic damage .
In the 1990s some of the more remarkable success stories were associated with countries that reduced taxes in order to attract business and capital .
Ireland , which became known as the Celtic tiger because of its growth rate , has a corporate - tax rate of just 12.5 % and chose not to raise it when it tightened its belt last year .
The corporate - tax trend over the last 30 years has been remorselessly downward .
A survey by Robert Carroll of American University in Washington , DC , found that the top rate in OECD countries ( excluding America ) had fallen from 51 % in the early 1980s to 32 % by 2009 ( see chart ) .
If businesses are attracted by low taxes , they may leave if rates rise .
High - tax European governments have complained in the past about competition from countries like Ireland ; the current crisis may lead to more calls for co-ordination of tax policies .
Indeed , many countries will be raising taxes simultaneously , which may reduce the temptation for businesses to shift .
Much depends on where countries start ; it should be easier for those with lower tax burdens to increase their take .
High earners can also be mobile .
So many French professionals moved to London in the past decade that Nicolas Sarkozy , France 's president , pleaded with them ( and offered tax deals ) to come back .
Britain is gradually losing its appeal to high - earning foreigners .
Calculations by PricewaterhouseCoopers , an accounting firm , show that British authorities will take a bigger tax bite out of the pay packet of a married executive earning £ 250,000 ( $ 373,000 ) than any other G20 nation except Italy .
The need for countries to maximise their take from their citizens has caused a renewed interest in preventing tax evasion .
Countries in the G20 have been pushing hard for low - tax countries such as Switzerland to provide information on foreign depositors .
Nevertheless , there are plenty of legitimate ways for businesses and individuals to move to countries with more favourable tax regimes .
So the temptation will be to impose taxes that will be difficult to escape , in particular sales or value - added taxes .
The political drawback of such levies is that they fall more heavily on the poor than the rich .
This will be unpopular , especially because many people regard this crisis as the fault of high - earning bankers .
Furthermore , if higher taxes eat into demand , economies may slip back into recession .
A Japanese consumption - tax increase in 1997 is still blamed for derailing its recovery .
European governments have accordingly produced a mix of measures in their austerity packages .
Greece , Ireland , Portugal and Spain have all promised to attack the public - sector wage bill by cutting or freezing wages or by reducing the number of staff .
Greece announced a new round of cuts on March 3rd .
But the packages have also contained tax rises ( motorway tolls in Portugal , fuel taxes in Greece ) and assaults on tax evasion .
In Greece , tax evasion seems to be rife among the professional classes , with very few citizens declaring high incomes ; one response from the government has been to try to encourage the use of receipts .
High earners claiming the personal tax allowance of € 12,000 ( $ 16,270 ) will need to provide receipts of at least that value .
Despite this attempt to spread the pain , the Greek government has been confronted with a wave of strikes by public - sector workers .
Governments can use outside financial pressure as an excuse to push through reforms that might otherwise be politically unacceptable .
But it is a fine balance .
Voters may be more resistant if harsh measures are seen as being dictated by foreigners , whether from the EU or the IMF .
The people are n't revolting
Lord Salisbury , a British prime minister , and other 19th - century conservatives feared that democracy would lead to the overthrow of private property rights .
Debtors tend to outnumber creditors , and thus can outvote them .
Such pessimism has yet to be proved right .
Sometimes , irresistible force meets immovable object .
In California , for instance , voters have the right to vote on specific fiscal policies in referendums .
The result has been a cap on taxes with no apparent limit on spending .
Iceland is about to provide a specific test of this theory in a referendum , in which voters are being asked to accept or reject the terms for compensating foreign depositors in failed Icelandic banks .
However , the efforts of Canada and Sweden suggest progress can be made , if the crisis is acute enough .
And dictatorships are unlikely to be better than democracies .
Military regimes in Latin America ( except Chile ) had poor economic records ; they saw the state as a source of cushy jobs for officers and subsidies for arms factories .
In addition , their very lack of legitimacy may tempt autocracies to bribe influential sections of the electorate .
Nevertheless , democracies face awkward decisions in the years ahead .
One of the biggest problems is pensions , which will dwarf the cost of the recent bank bail - out .
When state pensions were introduced in 1889 by Otto von Bismarck , the German chancellor , life expectancy was 45 ; the idea was to provide an income for those who simply could not work any longer .
Women who make it to 65 these days can expect 20 years of retirement .
Even that tricky calculation relies on people working to 65 in the first place .
Many employers , particularly in the public sector , developed the habit of letting workers retire in their late 50s or early 60s .
Germans , who will soon face a state retirement age of 67 , will resent being asked to bail out Greeks , who are only just being asked to work to 63 .
In Britain , most public - sector workers are still members of final - salary , or defined - benefit , schemes , whereas new employees in private companies are usually placed in defined - contribution schemes with uncertain benefits .
The difference in cost may be as much as 30 % of payroll .
Raising the retirement age , probably to 70 , and cutting the public - sector pension bill will deliver only modest savings in the short run , but will immensely improve the long - term picture .
It will , however , be staggeringly unpopular .
The proportion of the population in or nearing retirement is increasing ; and older people are much more likely to vote than younger citizens .
Without reform , however , those apathetic young voters face a crippling tax burden .
There are many battles over deficits to come : taxpayers against public - sector workers ; old against young .
Well - chosen policies that foster growth may make them less fierce .
They may be bloody even so .

FBI whistleblower Colleen Rowley says in a new interview that she was " minded " during her testimony to the Joint Intelligence Committee investigation of 9/11 .
Specifically , she said that " FBI minders " listened to her every word , to trail her and make sure that she did n't tell government personnel with top secret clearance even higher than her own anything which the FBI did not want to be told .
While this might sound fantastic , it is nothing new .
Rowley said the same had happened to Daniel Ellsberg went to members of Congress with the Pentagon papers .
As I wrote a year ago :
9/11 Commission chair Thomas Kean points out that if " minders " had been present during the Commission 's investigation , that would have been intimidation , which would have stemmed the flow of testimony from the witnesses :
I think the commission feels unanimously that it ’s some intimidation to have somebody sitting behind you all the time who you either work for or works for your agency .
You might get less testimony than you would .
However , that 's exactly what happened to Kean 's own 9/11 Commission .
Specifically :
A recently released 9/11 Commission memo [ released in January 2009 from the Commission to the National Archives ; referenced in the The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States , Finding Aid : Series Descriptions and Folder Title Lists , page 52 , " Memo Concerning Minders Conduct " *] highlights the role of government “ minders ” who accompanied witnesses interviewed by the commission .
It was added to the National Archives ’ files at the start of the year and discovered there by History Commons contributor paxvector .
The memo , entitled “ Executive Branch Minders ’ Intimidation of Witnesses , ” complains that :
* Minders “ answer[ed ] questions directed at witnesses ; ”
* Minders acted as “ monitors , reporting to their respective agencies on Commission staffs lines of inquiry and witnesses ’ verbatim responses . ”
The staff thought this “ conveys to witnesses that their superiors will review their statements and may engage in retribution ; ” and
* Minders “ positioned themselves physically and have conducted themselves in a manner that we believe intimidates witnesses from giving full and candid responses to our questions . ”
The memo was drafted by three staffers on the commission ’s Team 2 , which reviewed the overall structure of the US intelligence community .
One of the drafters was Kevin Scheid , a senior staffer who led the team .
His co-writers were Lorry Fenner , an air force intelligence officer , and lawyer Gordon Lederman .
The complaint was sent to the commission ’s counsels , Daniel Marcus and Steve Dunne , in October 2003 , about halfway through the commission ’s 19 - month life .
The memo makes clear that the problems were not occurring only with witnesses talking to Team 2 , but also in “ other teams ’ interviews . ”
A hand - written note on a draft of the memo says , “ not one agency or minder – also where we ’ve sat in on other Teams ’ interviews . ”
According to the memo , some minders merely policed prior agreements between the commission and their parent agency about what the commission could ask witnesses , and others were simply there to make a list of documents the commission might want based on a witness ’ testimony .
However , some minders saw their role differently .
Intimidation through Physical Positioning
The three staffers argued minders should not answer questions for witnesses because they needed to understand not how the intelligence community was supposed to function , but “ how the Intelligence Community functions in actuality . ”
However : “ When we have asked witnesses about certain roles and responsibilities within the Intelligence Community , minders have preempted witnesses ’ responses by referencing formal polices and procedures .
As a result , witnesses have not responded to our questions and have deprived us from understanding the Intelligence Community ’s actual functioning and witnesses ’ view of their roles and responsibilities . ”
The memo also describes the minders ’ conduct in detail : “ … [ M ] inders have positioned themselves physically and have conducted themselves in a manner that we believe intimidates witnesses from giving full and candid responses to our questions .
Minders generally have sat next to witnesses at the table and across from Commission staff , conveying to witnesses that minders are participants in interviews and are of equal status to witnesses . ”
The staffers also worried about minders taking “ verbatim notes of witnesses ’ statements , ” as they thought this “ conveys to witnesses that their superiors will review their statements and may engage in retribution . ”
They believed that “ the net effect of minders ’ conduct , whether intentionally or not , is to intimidate witnesses and to interfere with witnesses providing full and candid responses . ”
Another problem with the verbatim notetaking was that it “ facilitates agencies in alerting future witnesses to the Commission ’s lines of inquiry and permits agencies to prepare future witnesses either explicitly or implicitly . ”
Proposals
In response to this , the three staffers proposed not that minders be banned from interviews , but a set of rules governing minders ’ conduct .
For example , minders were to keep a “ low profile , ” sit out of witnesses ’ sight , not take verbatim notes and not answer any questions directed at the witnesses .
Perhaps the most remarkable proposal is that the number of minders be limited to one per witness .
The memo indicates that where an interviewee had served in multiple agencies , more than one minder would accompany the witness .
The memo therefore requests , “ Only one minder may attend an interview even if the witness served in multiple agencies , ” meaning a witness would at least not be outnumbered by his minders .
As the Family Steering Committee ( made up of 9/11 victims ' family members ) wrote in 2003 :
The FSC [ Family Steering Committee ] is shocked with the use of “ minders ” in the interrogatory process .
And , despite the Commissioner 's similar objection to “ minders ” , as stated at the last press conference , “ minders ” continue to be present during witness examination and questioning .
The FSC does not want “ minders ” present during any witness examination and questioning ; it is a form of intimidation and it does not yield the unfettered truth .
Indeed , even 9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton admitted that " it is very difficult to tell when a witness is being intimidated by a minder . "
Not only did the Bush administration adopt Communist torture techniques geared towards extracting false confessions , it also appears to have adopted Communist intimidation tactics .

Mike Mayo is a veteran of six Wall Street banks .
In the wake of the street ’s disaster , he found refuge at a boutique brokerage and has lately taken to startling his peers with the question “ What part of Goldman Sachs is good for the country ? ”
Regular people will be tempted to answer , “ None of it , ” but the question reminds us that , at least in theory , Wall Street serves society ( not the other way around ) .
And as opposed to Harrah ’s , Trump Casino and their ilk , Wall Street is endorsed and regulated — with marked restraint — so as to let it perform an important task .
Because some people have savings and others need capital , some unifying force must bring the two together .
Royalty once taxed its citizens and chartered corporations .
Wall Street privatized this function , aggregating the savings of disparate individuals through the sale of stocks and bonds .
Industry thus gained access to capital ; what ’s more , public markets performed a miracle of equivalence .
Quotations on the stock exchange effectively calibrated , down to the penny , how many hours ’ worth of wages would afford a share of General Motors .
Since the street stood at the intersection of capital and savings — or , if you will , of insiders and Main Street — the potential for conflict was rife .
No firm better resisted the temptations than Goldman , which , from its founding in 1869 through recent decades , epitomized , with only rare slip - ups , the best of American finance .
Serving the client was its lodestar , and its bankers were pillars of society , more conversant in literature than in the vagaries of , say , mortgage securities .

The four European candidates must be reduced to two A Belgian , two Frenchmen and a Colombian - Italian have agreed to be locked away in steel containers for 18 months to simulate a mission to Mars .
Their self - imposed exile will test the physical and mental requirements of ultra-long duration spaceflight .
The Europeans will join a predominantly Russian crew for the Mars500 project , which is due to start in May .
All the food and water needed for the " journey " will have to be loaded into the " spacecraft " before " departure " .
There will even be a simulated landing .
After about 250 days , the crew will be split in two , and three " cosmonauts " will move into a separate container to walk on the " surface of the Red Planet " wearing modified Russian Orlan spacesuits .
Mars is the ultimate destination

" I think you 've got to be a little bit crazy to undertake this venture , but it 's a healthy craziness , " said Diego Urbina , a 26 - year - old electronic engineer from Italy .
" I will definitely miss my family and friends , and Nature itself - all the things we take for granted here on Earth , such as the internet .
And girls - that 's something I 'll definitely miss , " he told BBC News .
Urbina joins the Belgian Jerome Clevers ( 28 ) and the Frenchmen Arc'hanmael Gaillard ( 34 ) and Romain Charles ( 30 ) as the European Space Agency ( Esa ) candidates on the project .
Their number will shortly be reduced to two .
The selected pair will then join three Russians and a Chinese individual in the simulation spacecraft .
The experiment is being run by Russia 's Institute of Biomedical Problems ( IBMP ) with the key participation of Esa .
Home for 18 months :
The facility is a series sealed containers
The Mars500 facility , which is located on the IBMP site in Moscow , comprises four sealed interconnected modules .
The total interior volume is about 550 cubic metres .
There are no windows .
The walls in the living quarters have been covered with a wooden panelling to make them feel slightly less austere .

Another module holds the Red Planet landscape .
Looking after the participants ' needs will be a mission control - room sited just outside the containers .
But the experiment 's designers are determined to make the training exercise as realistic as possible , so they will introduce a time delay in communications after two months .
Because it can take about 20 minutes for a message to travel from Mars to Earth , it will take this amount of time in the simulation , also .
Message delay
The crew and their ground controllers will send text and voice messages to each other and then have to wait for the replies .
Please turn on JavaScript .

It means there can be no real - time conversations , not even with friends and family - and , in moments of crisis , it will mean the crew will have to make crucial decisions themselves .
" Daily life , I hope , will be quite busy , " said auto - industry engineer Romain Charles .
" First , when we wake up , we will do some medical checks ; and from there we 'll all go to different tasks from cooking to cleaning and experiments .
And we 'll have some spare time to maybe read or watch videos or write to our relatives . "
Mid -way through the mission , half the crew will go down to the " surface " Martin Zell heads up the International Space Station ( ISS ) utilisation department at Esa .
He believes the Mars500 experience will be extremely taxing .
" It is literally isolated compared to ISS where you have a lot of arriving and departing vehicles , and at least three of the crew being exchanged every two or four months at least .
" [ On the ISS , ] you have basically unlimited contact with the ground and you always have new experiments .
Whereas on the Mars simulation , you will depart with a certain set of experiments , consumables and equipment - and the door never opens . "
Global challenge Scientific investigations during the " voyage " will asses the effect that isolation has on various psychological and physiological aspects such as stress , hormone levels , sleep quality , mood and the impact of dietary supplements .
The organisers say that if a crew - member decides halfway through the simulation that he really cannot cope with the separation anymore and wants to leave , he will be allowed to do so ; although every effort will be made to try to persuade the individual to stay .

Another group of experimental cosmonauts completed a shorter mission of 105 days in the same facility last year and came through unscathed .
Scientists have every reason to hope the new crew will fare just as well .
The Mars500 is so called because it simulates the duration of a possible human Mars mission in the future using conventional propulsion : 250 days for the trip to the Red Planet , 30 days on the martian surface and 240 days for the return journey , totalling 520 days ( in reality it would probably take a lot longer than this ) .
" Mars is the ultimate destination where we will one day live and work , " said Simonetta Di Pippo , the director of human spaceflight at Esa .
" What we 're doing right now is working with 13 other space agencies .
We have put together a framework for future global endeavour because it 's clear this challenge cannot be undertaken by one nation alone .
It is , by definition , a global challenge . "
It will not happen for many decades , however .
The technology does not currently exist to send people to Mars and bring them home safely .
In recent months , the Americans have talked about a " flexible path " out into the Solar System .
This would involve sending humans to targets that are progressively further away and more challenging .
These targets might include a return to the Moon and visits to asteroids .

Networking can really suck for introverts .
I know because I 'm one of them .
You 're probably thinking , " Of course !
Introverts are shy and have trouble with social interactions . "
However , introversion is much more complex and encompasses an overlapping spectrum of feelings .
Here 's my take on it :
In general , the terms " introvert " and " extrovert " describe social preferences , not social capabilities , and it 's important to remember that there 's nothing wrong with tending toward one side or the other .
Both have advantages and disadvantages ( many that you can overcome with practice or adrenaline ) .
These observations stem largely from the software - related meet - ups I 've attended in NYC ( Hackers & Founders , Hadoop , Android , etc ) , so they may only be applicable to technically - oriented introverts .
" The weather sure is ____ . "
When introverts hear this , we immediately disengage .
It 's a struggle for us to realize that a little upfront investment in small talk can lead to a great conversation .
Small talk is all about finding something to have a deeper conversation about , but often times , introverts get stuck in small talk ruts or completely blank on what to talk about , leading to awkward pauses .
I 've been a party to plenty of awkward pauses , both on the " caused " and the " affected " side .
Awkward pauses happen for two reasons : struggling with turn taking or blanking on what to talk about .
Blanking on what to talk about can happen because introverts have other interesting ideas we 're mulling or we 've run out of conversation topics .
In the past , I 've thought about keeping notes on conversation topics , but it 's pretty weird to see someone whip out a notebook in the middle of a conversation , so I have n't done it .
If an introvert can't get out of the small talk stage or genuinely has no interest in the person they 're talking to ( imagine getting stuck talking to a someone from a recruitment agency that snuck in to a MySQL meetup ) , the conversation is over .
Time to escape .
The polite introverts needlessly stick with the conversation , trying to think of a way to break it off nicely .
From personal experience , these dreaded conversations can last up to half an hour .
All the while , you 're catching bits and pieces of interesting conversations all around you .
The less polite introverts either have " I do n't care " plastered across their faces or just walk away .
I have seen both .
The latter is much more entertaining .
If there 's a type of conversation that introverts love , it 's 1 - on - 1 conversations .
It 's nerdy , but it 's great to get into an intellectual property debate with one other person .
However , at most " networking events " it 's tough to get a 1 - on - 1 conversation .
Often times you 're stuck with a group .
Introverts have a lot of trouble with group conversations .
We feel like we can't get a word in - other people are always talking !
We feel like we have to keep up with the main conversation and all the little side conversations that keep splitting off .
And a lot of times , it 's hard to even join a group conversation .
Joining a group conversation is hard because everyone already involved is participating in the conversation .
It 's hard for them to include someone who has just popped in .
It sounds strange , but I 've seen people walk up to a group conversation , stand there for 10 minutes , and then walk away without ever saying anything .
I 've resolved to help fix these problems for a subset of introverts in a subset of networking situations .
I want to help software engineers , who are definitely more introverted than the general population , network to find jobs and meet companies .
To accomplish this goal ( and others - a subject of another post ) , I 'm introducing Hirelite.com : Speed Dating for the Hiring Process
At a Hirelite event , software engineers will go on 5 - minute " speed interviews " with companies .
Making small talk and creating awkward pauses will be less of an issue because the conversations will be short and focused on how each party can help the other .
Starting new conversations and politely leaving conversations of no interest will be of little concern due to the 5 - minute time limit and rotation to the next conversation .
And group conversations will be minimized : one company ( possibly two people ) speaking with one software engineer .
Hirelite is having its inaugural event on March 16th in New York City .
For this event , there is only space for 20 companies and 20 software engineers , so let us know early if you would like to attend .
After more than a decade of struggle
African - American farmers win compensation
Published Feb 25 , 2010 9:37 PM
On Feb. 18 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the latest settlement to provide compensation and resources to African - American farmers .
An organization that represents African - American farmers , the Federation of Southern Cooperatives / Land Assistance Fund — founded in 1967 — welcomed the announced settlement .
Demonstrations took place during February in support of the demands put forward by African - American farmers seeking an end to land loss and the racist policies of the USDA , which have driven millions of people from the rural areas of the South for decades .
Rallies were held in Washington , D.C. ; Little Rock , Ark. ; Memphis , Tenn . ; Jackson , Miss . ; Montgomery , Ala. ; Columbus , Ga. ; Columbia , S.C. ; and Richmond , Va .
The farmers were demanding a resolution to the 1999 legal settlement which was supposed to provide compensation for decades of systematic discrimination by the USDA .
However , the federal bureaucracy placed enormous roadblocks to the farmers receiving settlement funds .
Only 15,000 African - American farmers were able to navigate the complicated paperwork to collect compensation reported to have averaged a mere $ 50,000 per family .
Most of the farmers were excluded , and in 2008 the U.S. Congress acknowledged the problems and granted additional time for another 70,000 people to apply for compensation .
Despite this supposed commitment to speed up the processing of applications for compensation , Congress cut $ 1.5 billion in funding that President Barack Obama had included in the first budget of the current administration and specifically designated for Black farmers .
Obama has included a similar amount in the budget for the next fiscal year that is now going before the Congress .
According to Rep. Mel Watt , D - N.C. , a member of the Congressional Black Caucus , “ The primary issue now , I think , is that there ’s not money appropriated to pay the successful claimants . ”
Despite the fact that the Democratic Party controls both houses of Congress , there is no real commitment to address the problems of African - American farmers .
In a demonstration outside the USDA on Feb. 15 , John Boyd , the National Black Farmers Association president , presented legislators with 538 ears of corn and packets of forget - me - not seeds , demanding that each member of the House of Representatives and Senate include the $ 1.5 billion in the 2010 budget for compensation .
“ Our long journey to justice should now come to a successful close , ” said Boyd .
Boyd continued by stating , “ We have endured many hardships , waited many years and traveled many miles .
Now it ’s time for Congress to do its part and fund fairness for black farmers .
Thousands of farmers who ca n’t be in Washington showed their support by traveling long distances through snow and rain to join our rallies .
We ’re here to represent them and get the job done . ”
( PRWEB , Feb. 15 )
In a Feb. 4 press conference , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responded to a question related to the ongoing plight of African - American farmers .
Gibbs said , “ Clearly , it ’s something important to him [ Obama ] .
It ’s been an issue that has been worked on by the federal government now in several different administrations and dating back many years .
Obviously , ensuring that justice is done is important in this situation . ”
( PRWEB , Feb. 15 )
Fund spokesperson Heather Gray said of the recent settlement : “ After years of negotiations and questions , for Black farmers who have never been able to have their claims of discrimination against the United States Department of Agriculture settled , there is finally some hope .
The Obama administration and attorneys representing Black farmers have reached a settlement in the second phase of the lawsuit originally filed by Black farmers against the USDA in 1999 . ” ( The Federation / LAF , Feb. 18 )
According to the Fund executive director , Ralph Paige : “ The long - awaited settlement in this second phase of the Pigford lawsuit is a major step forward .
The $ 1.25 billion settlement proposed by the Obama administration is a vast improvement over the $ 100 million offered by Congress in the 2008 Farm Bill .
Now there is hope that the thousands of black farmers whose cases have been pending can receive awards and damages after decades of discrimination . ”
A history of discrimination and land loss
The plight of African - American farmers is by no means a new phenomenon and the claims against the federal government did not originate in the lawsuit filed during the 1990s .
This problem stems from the legacy of slavery , the failure of reconstruction and the ongoing discriminatory practices of the USDA and the banks .
Although the abolitionist movement fought for decades to end slavery , it would take a bloody 4 - year Civil War to bring about the collapse of this institution rooted in the extreme exploitation and oppression of four million people of African descent .
The question of what provisions would be made for the former slaves , as well as for so - called free Africans , was discussed during the war but was never formally settled .
In 1862 some Union army generals began to break up plantations in liberated areas of the South and provide settlements for small African farmers .
In 1865 the first Freedmen ’s Bureau Act developed plans for 40 - acre plots of land to be sold to former slaves at cheap rates .
This land would have come from evacuated plantations and areas that were unsettled during this period .
Nonetheless , by late 1865 , President Andrew Johnson halted these initiatives by the Union army to allocate small farm settlements for the former slaves .
Another agreement that was adopted in 1866 also made proposals for land redistribution , but these actions lacked an effective enforcement mechanism and consequently went largely unimplemented .
With the lack of governmental commitment to land redistribution in the South , the acquisition of farms by African Americans took place on a largely individual basis .
Many African
Americans were able to acquire land as a result of the dire economic conditions prevailing in the South after the Civil War .
In a study issued by Bruce J. Reynolds in 2002 entitled “ Black Farmers in America , 1865 - 2000 : The Pursuit of Independent Farming and the Role of Cooperatives , ” Reynolds says that “ W.E.B. DuBois estimated 19th century progress in land ownership by black farmers : 3 million acres in 1875 , 8 million in 1890 , and 12 million in 1900 .
The Census of Agriculture shows a steady increase in the number of farm operators owning land in the South from 1880 to 1890 and again in 1900 , but does not distinguish between white and nonwhite owners until 1900 .
Census figures show 1920 was the peak year in the number of nonwhite owners of farmland in the South .
In terms of acreage owned , the census shows 1910 as the peak year for the South .
More than 12.8 million acres were fully and partly owned , respectively , by 175,290 and 43,177 nonwhite farmers . ”
Yet the rise of terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan and the abandonment of reconstruction by the federal government left African - American farmers and their families open to systematic campaigns by the racists that drove many people off their farms through force of arms and the implementation of state laws that favored the former slave - owning elites .
This process would continue well into the 20th century , resulting in the loss of millions of acres of land acquired by African Americans in the South .
These efforts to drive independent African - American farmers off their land was coupled with the systematic denial of credit and the corporatization of agricultural land that took hold during latter years of the 20th century .
More farmers began to look toward cooperative agriculture as a means to maintain their livelihoods and access to land .
However , as Reynolds points out : “ The population of independent farmers is declining through farm consolidations and through contracting systems that diminish decision - making requirements of farmers .
As this trend continues , the usefulness of cooperatives , as well as the capacity of farmers to organize them , will decline . ”
By 1992 , the U.S. Census of Agriculture reported that there were only 18,000 African - American farmers remaining and land ownership was down to 2.3 million acres .
Since the early 1990s the conditions for African - American farmers have worsened with the burgeoning economic crisis that has disproportionately affected nationally oppressed groups in the U.S .
The plight of African - American farmers constitutes an integral part of the overall question of national oppression in the U.S.
It is inextricably linked to the economic crisis and its impact on African Americans , resulting in millions of job losses and home foreclosures .
Consequently , the fight for justice for African - American farmers must be raised alongside other demands , including a real jobs program to employ the tens of millions of workers who are bearing the brunt of the deepening economic crisis in the world capitalist system .

Putting male names before female names in writing is a remnant of sexist thinking .
This is the finding of a study published online March 15 2010 , in the British Journal of Social Psychology by Dr Peter Hegarty and colleagues of the University of Surrey .
Dr Hegarty said : " In the 16th century , naming men before women became the acceptable word - order to use because of the thinking that men were the worthier sex .
This grammar has continued with ' Mr and Mrs ' , 'his and hers ' and the names of romantic couples like Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet .
While the original sexist ideas behind this grammar are no longer accepted , we wanted to investigate whether the sexist habit of male names coming before female names still holds true and the psychological reasons why this might be .
Firstly , the team investigated the modern written context of the internet .
Using 10 popular British boys and girls names and 10 popular American boys and girls names , the team searched the internet using each of the possible male - female name pairs as search terms , for both the male name first -- i.e. ' David and Sarah ' , and then female name first -- ' Sarah and David ' .
The results of this search found that for the British name pairs , the male - first name pairings accounted for 79 per cent of the mentions , and female - first pairs only 21 per cent .
For the American names this was 70 per cent of the mentions were male - first and 30 per cent for female - first .
Dr Hegarty said : " These results were found to be statistically significant , and support the idea that gender stereotypes still affect the written language .
It has been argued that the male - first effect is n't down to sexism but that it is due to phonological attributes of male names , or because male names come more readily to mind as they are popular and familiar .
We therefore carried out further studies to investigate whether the male - first finding was a gender stereotyping effect . "
One hundred and 21 people were asked to imagine a heterosexual couple who were either ' quite traditional and who conform strictly to gender scripts about how the two genders should behave ' or ' non-traditional who deviate radically ' .
They were then asked to write down five name - combinations for their imaginary couple .
Participants named the imagined ' traditional couples ' men- first more often than chance , but this effect was not seen for the naming of ' non-traditional ' couples .
In a third study , 86 people were asked to write down names of an imagined lesbian or gay couple .
Participants were then asked to assign attributes such as annual earnings , interest in fashion , interest in sport and physical attributes to each individual -- for example Simon is physically stronger than John .
Participants assigned significantly more of the masculine attributes and fewer of the feminine attributes to the person they named first .
Dr Hegarty said : " The results of our studies suggest that people tend to put men , or male qualities , before women .
As this is a remnant of the sexist grammar of the 16th century , it would seem that psychologically , we are still sexist in writing . "
However , Hegarty cautions that the effect is likely to occur only among couples that we do n't know well .
" When people address greeting cards to couples , for example , they often put the person that they know best first , whether female or male . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An investigation is underway into why a young child , apparently under an adult ’s supervision , was allowed to direct air traffic at New York City ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport , U.S. authorities said on Wednesday .
In transmissions broadcast by local media , the young child -- whose age is unknown -- can be heard directing pilots for departure , apparently under the supervision of an adult .
The incident reportedly happened two weeks ago .
At one point an adult voice can be heard telling a pilot : “ This is what you get guys when the kids are out of school . ”
The pilots receiving instructions from the child did not appear too concerned with one pilot saying “ awesome job . ”
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) said that pending the outcome of its investigation the employees involved in the incident were not controlling air traffic .
“ This behavior is not acceptable and does not demonstrate the kind of professionalism expected from all FAA employees , ” the FAA said in a statement .
Nearly 48 million passengers pass through John F. Kennedy airport annually .
Senator Kay Hutchison – in conjunction with Representatives Suzanne Kosmas and Bill Posey – has produced a 37 page Bill that proposes major refinements to NASA ’s FY2011 proposal , and NASA ’s forward plan .
The Bill is centered around a shuttle extension to 2015 , in support of fully utilizing the International Space Station ( ISS ) , along with saving elements of Constellation – such as Orion and a Heavy Lift Launcher ( HLV ) .
Shuttle Extension :
Efforts to reverse the 2010 retirement date of the shuttle fleet have been ongoing for a few years , without being realized – partly due to a lack of support from successive NASA administrators .
Former NASA boss Mike Griffin even worked directly against extension – mainly via protection of the Ares I launch vehicle ’s budget – often citing safety concerns which had no basis in post Return To Flight reality .
With a level of support for an extension of the shuttle manifest – in tandem with the development of a Shuttle Derived HLV – gained at the Augustine Committee review into NASA ’s Human Space Flight program , the door was opened for building on a 2008 Senate Bill that had already actioned pre-emptive measures to protect shuttle - related assets from decommissioning .
Central to the new Bill – also known as the “ Human Space Flight Capability Assurance and Enhancement Act of 2010 ” – is a solution to the short and mid term issue of “ the gap ” for US manned space flight capability , by extending the operational lifetime of the shuttle – as outlined in a series of instructions to current NASA administrator Charlie Bolden , pending the approval of the Bill .
“ The Administrator shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all Space Shuttle Program ( SSP ) activities and operations are able to continue , or to be resumed , including flight operations and support , pending the completion of the reviews , requirements , and reports of this section , ” noted the Bill .
“ The Administrator shall take all steps necessary to ensure shuttle launch capability through fiscal year 2011 to enable launch , at a minimum , of all payloads manifested as of February 28 , 2010 .
“ In fulfillment of this requirement , the Administrator is prohibited from terminating any contractor support which will endanger or inhibit the launching of shuttle payloads manifested as of February 28 , 2010 , should launches be required after the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 . ”
Such instructions hold their own difficulties , with numerous shuttle contractors already shut down via the current budget plan .
However , it goes some way to protect the shuttle manifest from hitting a gap of its own , as SSP would enable the construction of the three spare tanks currently located at the Michoud Assembly Facility ( MAF ) , for example .
Recertification of the orbiters is not deemed to be a problematic issue , as previously confirmed by SSP management , and recently repeated by Mission Management Team ( MMT ) chair Mike Moses – who noted the fleet could ‘ technically ’ keep flying to 2020 .
A large level of recertification was already carried out on the fleet during the Return To Flight period .
However , in order to satisfy the likes of the ASAP ( Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel ) – who testified last year that it was their opinion an extension would require a recertification effort , the Bill calls for a short consultation period , in which a certification review would be carried out on the ability for the shuttle operations to continue for an additional five years .
“ No later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act the Administrator shall ask the National Academies of Science to appoint a Flight Certification Review Committee , consisting of individuals with appropriate engineering expertise and experience in certification of space flight vehicle hardware , systems , and equipment testing and validation procedures , to review space shuttle certification activities undertaken or initiated after February , 2003 .
“ The Committee shall provide an assessment regarding the adequacy of those validation procedures in assuring vehicle durability , flight - worthiness , and sustainability for continued operations through a period of up to 5 years beyond the space shuttle flight manifest planned as of February , 2010 ( see left for STS manifest as of March 2 , via L2 ) .
” The Committee shall take into account current and historical trends in anomaly detection and resolution within major components of the space shuttle systems .
“ The Committee appointed under subsection ( b ) shall complete its task within 90 days of its appointment and shall provide its findings and determinations concurrently to the Administrator and to the committees of jurisdiction no later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act . ”
The extension scenario – as outlined in the Bill – calls for two flights per year , which would allow NASA to retire at least one orbiter , likely to remain at the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) as a parts donor for her sisters .
Two flights per year would also help remove the threat of a gap during the extended manifest , as contractors “ catch up ” with providing for the additional flights .
“ Notwithstanding any other provision of law , to the extent practicable NASA shall operate the Space Shuttle program at a flight rate of no more than 2 missions in any consecutive 12 - month period beginning during the fiscal years for which appropriations are authorized under section of this Act .
“ The Administrator shall ensure that hardware components in existence as of March , 2010 , remain available for use in connection with any additional flights required beyond those on the current flight manifest schedule . ”
The Bill also outlines instructions and rules for the eventual termination of shuttle operations , closely associating the needs of the ISS – now extended to 2020 – with the priority of the shuttle ’s unique payload capability .
Dependant on the translation of the Bill ’s language , it also appears to hint towards additional payloads – other than just resupply logistics – could return to the shuttle manifest .
“ The Administrator shall immediately upon enactment of this Act , conduct an in - depth assessment of all essential modules , operational systems and components , structural elements , and permanent scientific equipment on board or planned for delivery and installation aboard the International Space Station , including both United States and international partner elements , to determine anticipated spare or replacement requirements to ensure complete , effective , and safe function and full scientific utilization of the ISS .
“ The identification of spare or replacement elements and parts currently produced , in inventory , or on order , and the state of readiness and schedule for delivery to the ISS , including the planned transportation means for such delivery .
Each element identified shall include a description of its location , function , criticality for system integrity , and specifications regarding size , weight , and necessary con1figuration for launch and delivery .
“ The identification of anticipated requirements for spare or replacement elements not currently in inventory or on order , a description of their location , function , criticality for system integrity , the anticipated cost and schedule for design , procurement , manufacture and delivery , and specifications regarding size , weight , and necessary configuration for launch and delivery , including available launch vehicles capable of transportation of such items to the International Space Station . ”
Full utilization of the ISS , and support of the outpost through to 2020 , is the key for the extension of the shuttle ’s upmass – and downmass – capability , with several pages outlining the importance of the “ National Laboratory ” .
However , such a supporting extension of the shuttle will remain a moot point unless additional funding is found – or cuts are made from other programs .
On the topic of costs , the funding for an extension , the first two years are costed at an extra $ 1.2B in 2011 , followed by an extra $ 2B in 2012 .
These figures are much less than previously touted , and may have a good selling point for the huge jobs – and more so skill set – savings a shuttle extension would provide .
Commercial Systems :
This latest Bill has been worked on since last year , with consultations and inputs from throughout the industry , including the United Space Alliance , NASA and even SpaceX and Lockheed Martin , with the latter heavily involved .
While the current plan aims to all - but hand over the role of US space flight to the Commercial sector , the new Bill dilutes the role – without U - turning on the FY2011 proposal .
The Bill aims at answering the critics who claim the commercial sector are unproven when it comes to human space flight , with the language aiming to steer commercial companies into successfully demonstrating their ability of providing logistical support to the ISS , prior to being handed over the keys to launching humans .
“ The Administrator shall take steps to ensure that the development of space transportation vehicles , systems , and infrastructure shall occur in such a way as to ensure the availability of complementary and , where necessary , redundant transportation systems capable of delivering crew and cargo to low - Earth orbit , in particular to the International Space Station , and to destinations beyond low - Earth orbit .
“ Systems developed and operated by the United States Government shall be the primary means for delivering crew and cargo to destinations in low - Earth orbit until such time as commercial entities demonstrate , through a successful flight regime , as determined by established milestones within current Space Act Agreements , that they have the capability to deliver cargo to destinations in low - Earth orbit , including the International Space Station .
“ Systems developed and operated by the United States government shall be the primary means for delivering crew and cargo to destinations beyond low earth orbit .
Commercially developed launch systems , such as those being developed under NASA ’s Commercial Orbital Transportation System , for which the United States government will serve primarily as a customer , shall be the primary means for delivering cargo to the International Space Stations once they have successfully demonstrated that capability . ”
Referenced as a “ National Space Transportation System ” , the Bill also addresses the question of the need for launch vehicle redundancy .
This is where the Bill tips its hat to a potential use of the Orion and Ares I launch vehicle – from at least a technology standpoint .
“ The Administrator is directed to develop a plan , no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act , for the establishment of a National Space Transportation System .
“ The National Space Transportation System shall include ( 1 ) an architecture of government developed and operated space transportation systems , including one or more launch vehicles and associated crew and cargo carriers .
“ ( 2 ) a streamlined approach to development and acquisition of such systems funded and overseen by the United States Government , including possible adoption or modification of effective acquisition practices utilized by the Department of Defense , where appropriate , to more effectively meet civil space transportation requirements ; ( 3 ) an operational concept that utilizes existing government and industry personnel and infrastructure in an efficient and cost effective manner ;
“ ( 4 ) continuation or modification of ongoing programs , associated contracts , and testing and evaluation plans initiated under the Constellation Program , including the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares - 1 Crew Launch Vehicle , to the extent that such elements are determined to be cost effective and operationally effective .
“ ( 5 ) a plan for incrementally upgrading initially developed and deployed systems so that such systems can be made operational with existing technology at the earliest possible opportunity and then upgraded over time to fulfill more demanding missions and incorporate new technology as it becomes available ; and ( 6 ) a United States Government managed approach for overseeing and ensuring crew safety , including oversight of human ratings requirements . ”
A large section of the Bill is dedicated to the approach required by the commercial companies , including Human Rating , and makes an additional reference towards the ultimate NASA goal of concentrating on beyond Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) .
“ It is the sense of the Congress that the development of commercial capabilities for the use of space may be of value in maximizing the utility and productivity of the International Space Station by providing a commercial means of enabling crew transfer and crew rescue services for the International Space Station .
“ The Congress further believes that once such commercial services have demonstrated the capability to meet established ascent , entry , and International Space Station proximity operations safety requirements the United States should make use of domestic commercially - provided crew transfer and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable .
“ The Congress further believes that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should expedite , where possible , the use of domestic commercially provided International Space Station cargo missions , and that upon the certification by appropriate Federal agencies of operational flight readiness for the provision of commercial crew transportation capabilities , the Administrator should limit , to the maximum extent practicable , the use of a United States government crew transportation vehicle to missions carrying crew beyond low Earth orbit . ”
References are also made for a commercial effort to provide cargo return capability – which will be all - but lost when the shuttle ’s downmass capability ends with the orbiter ’s retirement .
HLV – and return of the SD HLV option :
NASA ’s long term focus has always related to exploration , with the central requirement of a large heavy - lifter underpinning the ambitions of a return to the moon and on to destinations such as Mars and its moon Phobos .
A HLV remains in NASA ’s plans via the FY2011 proposal , though it relegates its development to one of spending years researching “ game changing ” propulsion , as opposed to the previously preferred – at the study level at least – transition for shuttle hardware into an Ares V type launch vehicle .
New technologies do receive a passing mention in the Bill , aimed to satisfy those that wish for launch vehicle propulsion to move away from the shackles of the traditional LOX / LH2 - powered vehicles .
“ The Administrator shall develop and keep up to date a technology development plan to support the evolving requirements of the National Space Transportation System , both for low - Earth orbit requirements and for missions beyond low - Earth orbit .
“ Technology funding provided pursuant to this subsection shall be determined based on the specific mission benefits and the performance requirements needed to achieve clearly identified mission objectives , such as planning to reach destinations beyond low - Earth orbit .
“ There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator such amounts for technology funding for propulsion elements as may be necessary to advance the state of the art in propulsion elements as a priority over developments of current state of the art in propulsion systems . ”
However , the door is reopened by the Bill on the “ safer , simpler , sooner ” approach of building a HLV from shuttle legacy hardware – such as the External Tank ( ET ) , Space Shuttle Main Engines ( SSMEs ) , Solid Rocket Boosters ( SRBs ) and other areas of commonality .
Such an effort would still require a trade study , the Bill notes , which had already been conducted at the request of General Bolden himself – which found in favor of an inline SD HLV over a sidemount SD HLV , and the RP - 1 booster .
However , that study would be conducted again – likely taking in a range of HLV options , including Ares - legacy versions – and based on ambitious schedules listed in the Bill .
“ As part of the National Space Transportation system , the Administrator is directed to conduct a review of alternative heavy lift launch vehicle configurations that may be developed by the United States government to transport crew and cargo to low - Earth orbit and beyond .
“ The review shall : ( A ) include shuttle - derived vehicles which use existing United States propulsion systems , including liquid fuel engines , external tank , and solid rocket motor technology and related ground - based manufacturing capability , launch and operations infrastructure , and workforce expertise ; ( B ) take into consideration technologies developed under the Constellation Program , including those developed for the Ares I system ,
“ Include consideration of the degree to which alternative vehicles may be developed in an evolutionary fashion with the objective of supporting initial crew and cargo transportation to the International Space Station by the end of 2013 and missions beyond low - Earth orbit by the end of 2018 ; and ( D ) include comparative development and projected operational costs . ”
General Bolden would also be tasked with selecting one of the HLV options within six months .
“ The Administrator is directed to select a heavy lift launch vehicle and accompanying crew vehicle design concept and to initiate detailed design activities no later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act .
If ongoing program development elements and activities from the Constellation Program are to be included in such a National Space Transportation System , the Administrator shall take appropriate steps to extend or modify existing contracts to facilitate this objective . ”
The 37 page document is deemed a working draft – though it is the final version ( version 15 ) of the Bill ’s development , which is been classed as “ sponsored ” by Senator Hutchison , with a companion ( identical ) bill to be introduced in the House by Reps.
Kosmas and Posey , and possibly others .
The above covers certain – but not all – elements of the Bill .

Researchers think the geysers on one of Saturn 's moons , Enceladus , are formed from liquid water beneath the surface near the moon 's South Pole .
The vapor treks through little channels in the ice and condenses to form ice crystals that also move toward the moon 's surface .
That results in jets of water vapor and ice grains spewing from the surface .
Icy plumes of water vapor erupting from Saturn 's moonEnceladus have left scientists divided over whether a liquid ocean lies hiddenbeneath the icy surface .
Now evidence from a 2008 plume fly - through by NASA 'sCassini spacecraft has turned up short - lived water ions that suggest liquidwater does indeed exist inside the moon .
Negatively charged ions represent atoms that have moreelectrons than protons , and they seem relatively rare in the solar system .
Scientistshave found negative ions only on Earth , Saturn 'smoon Titan , the comets and now Enceladus .
But negative water ions appear onEarth 's surface only where ocean waves or waterfalls keep liquid water inmotion ?
a suggestive hint of liquid water also in motion somewhere insideEnceladus
Cassini's plasma spectrometer also turned up negativelycharged ions of hydrocarbons , or compounds made entirely of hydrogen andcarbon .
" While it 's no surprise that there is water there , these short - lived ions are extra evidence for sub - surface water and where there ' swater , carbon and energy , some of the major ingredients for life arepresent , " said Andrew Coates , a planetary scientist at the UniversityCollege London and lead author on the latest Cassini study .
The measurements came from samples collected duringCassini 's icy plunge into an Enceladus plume on March 12 , 2008 .
TheU.S. - European spacecraft first discovered the existence of such plumes in 2005 , which shoot thousands of miles into space .
Many of the icy particles and watervapor eventually escape the moon 's gravity entirely and help create Saturn ' shuge outermost ring , called the E-ring .
Cassini's repeateddips into the icy plumes of Enceladus have fueled debate about thepossibility of a saltyocean that lies hidden on Saturn 's sixth largest moon .
Many scientiststhink that the geysers not only represent good evidence of liquid water , butalso mark Enceladus as a possible world for life to arise .
Still , other studies challenged the liquid ocean idea byarguing that the water vapor in the plumes could have just as easilytransformed directlyfrom solid ice , in the process known was sublimation .
The new discovery of negatively charged water ions maytilt the balance of evidence once more in favor of a liquid ocean .
And at leastonce physicist , Brian Cox at the University of Manchester in the UK , hasalready handed out a wink and a nod to the group of Cassini scientists headedby Carolyn Porco .
" You always said to me that you 'd find water onEnceladus :-) " wrote Cox to Porco today via Twitter .
WASHINGTON — Ask Elizabeth Warren , scourge of Wall Street bankers , how they treat consumers , and she will shake her head with indignation .
She will talk about morality , about fairness , about what she calls their “ let them eat cake ” attitude toward taxpayers .
If she is riled enough , she might even spit out the Warren version of an expletive .
“ Dang gummit , somebody has got to stand up on behalf of middle - class families ! ” she exclaimed in a recent interview in her office here .
Among all the dramatis personae of post - financial crisis Washington , there is no one remotely like Ms. Warren , 60 , who has divided the town between those who admire her and those who roll their eyes at her .
She is an Oklahoma native , a janitor ’s daughter , a bankruptcy expert at Harvard Law School and a former Sunday School teacher who cites John Wesley — the co-founder of Methodism and a public health crusader — as an inspiration .
She brims with cheer , yet she is such a fearsome interrogator that Bruce Mann , her husband , describes her as a grandmother who can make grown men cry .
Back at Harvard , Ms. Warren ’s teaching style is “ Socratic with a machine gun , ” as one former student put it .
In Washington , she grills bankers and Treasury officials just as relentlessly .
PARIS ( Reuters Life ! ) - A French documentary film will attempt to show the power television holds over people when it presents the results of a fake television game show in which participants inflict pain on other people .
“ How Far Will Televison Go ? ” reproduces its own version of an experiment conducted by Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s , in which volunteers were ordered to inflict electric shocks on a student in order to improve memory .
The documentary -- due to be broadcast in France on Wednesday -- used the ruse of a TV show to explore how even a game show host had the authority to persuade participants to inflict horrendous pain on other people .
“ It ’s more about the notion of power than about the individual , ” the show ’s producer , Christophe Nick told Reuters Television .
“ When a person is alone , face to face with someone abusing their power , then he or she becomes completely malleable and obedient . ”
The fake TV contest was called “ Zone Xtreme ” ( Extreme Zone ) and the documentary says that 81 percent of those who took part were persuaded by the show ’s host to deliver intensifying electric shocks to victims , despite increasing howls of pain .
Some 69 candidates agreed to take part in the project , believing it was a pilot game show .
Once on set , the participants were told to put questions to a “ victim , ” played by an actor , and to punish any wrong answers by delivering increasingly violent electric shocks .
Urged on by the game show host , around 70 percent of contestants laughed at least once during the ordeal , the program producers said , and only 19 percent put a stop to the game before reaching the maximum charge of 420 volts .
“ There ’s the fact that in a game , the boundaries between reality and fiction are blurred , so that even if your partner screams and begs you to stop , you still think you ’re in a game , ” Nick said .
Milgram ’s study began a few months after the start of the Israeli trial against Nazi Adolph Eichmann for his role in organizing the transport and murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust and was meant to measure the willingness to obey an authority figure who instructed participants to perform acts that conflicted with their personal consciences .
By adapting the experiment to the television , Nick said serious issues were raised about the pervasive role TV has taken on in modern society , and the powerful influence it can have on human behavior when abused .
“ In Milgram ’s case 62 percent of participants obeyed abject orders ; with television it ’s 81 percent , ” he said .
“ Therefore you have to ask yourself a question which is more than about submission to an authority , but about the power of a system , a global system , which is television . ”
The U.S. charge d’affaires in Iceland was summoned to the country ’s foreign ministry over the leak of documents to website WikiLeaks , a foreign ministry spokeswoman claimed Tuesday .
“ He was asked to come here yesterday ( Monday ) and he came the same day , ” foreign ministry spokeswoman Urdur Gunnarsdottir said of charge d’affaires Sam Watson , who in the absence of a US ambassador to Iceland is the highest ranking US diplomat in the country .

Watson was asked to come to the foreign ministry to receive a formal objection from the ministry ’s director concerning the leak of profiles of high - ranking Icelandic officials to website WikiLeaks.org .
The profiles , of Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir , Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson , and Icelandic ambassador to the US Albert Jonsson , were briefing documents destined to US officials visiting Iceland .
The documents , marked confidential , appeared on WikiLeaks Monday and contain information such as biographical notes about the officials , descriptions of their personalities and working styles and milestones in their political careers .
“ This is the second time such a thing happens and this means that people are becoming more cautious in the relationship with other foreign services who behave like this , ” Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson told daily Frettabladid Tuesday .
He was referring to a February 18 leak on WikiLeaks of the details of conversations between high ranking Icelandic officials and US and British diplomats about the Icesave dispute .

WikiLeaks has in recent weeks complained of spying and harassment by the Pentagon , alleging that U.S. State Department employees traveling under diplomatic cover tailed the Web site ’s employees , one of whom was briefly detained .
The whistleblower site said it is planning to release a video that reveals what the U.S. “ cover - up ” of an incident in which numerous civilians and journalists were murdered in an airstrike , according to a recent media advisory .
The video will be released on April 5 at the National Press Club , the group said .

WikiLeaks also recently published a document drafted by a Central Intelligence Agency thinktank that proposes ways to manipulate European public opinion on the Afghan war , seeking to change French and German attitudes in particular .
The document does n’t propose any direct methods by which the CIA could achieve this — there are no references to planting propaganda in the press , for example — but it does lay out what it sees as the key talking points to changing hearts and minds on the war .
Among its proposals , the policy paper suggests playing up the plight of Afghan women to French audiences , as the French public has shown concern for women ’s rights in Afghanistan .

For the German audience , the document suggests a measure of fear - mongering about the possible fallout of NATO failure in Afghanistan .
“ GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exposure to terrorism , opium , and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , ” the document asserts .
“ The need for independent leaks and whistle - blowing exposures is particularly acute now because , at exactly the same time that investigative journalism has collapsed , public and private efforts to manipulate public opinion have proliferated , ” Glenn Greenwald wrote in a recent piece about how the United States and other governments plot to destroy WikiLeaks .
“ This is exemplified by the type of public opinion management campaign detailed by the above - referenced CIAÃ‚Â Report , theÃ‚Â Pentagon ’s TVÃ‚Â propaganda program exposed in 2008 , and the ways in which private interests covertly pay and control supposedly ‘ independent political commentators ’ to participate in our public debates and shape public opinion . ”

No , that 's not a typo .
According to a poll of registered Republicans last week , Congressman Alan Grayson has an enormous lead in the Republican primary for Florida Congressional District 8 ( FL - 8 ) .
Of course , Grayson is a Democrat .
Yet Grayson is far and away the leading choice among registered Republicans in FL - 8 .
In fact , he has almost twice as much support among Republicans as all his Republican opponents combined .
But then there 's this :
In 2009 , Grayson , who carries a copy of the Constitution with him , passed a resolution calling on schools to teach the document for one week in September each year .
Over half of the Republicans polled said that they were more likely to vote for Grayson because of the resolution .
He has distributed tens of thousands of copies of the Constitution throughout the district , including one to each high school senior .
This September , he said , he plans to go to high schools and teach the Constitution personally in the district .
Perhaps that could be called a " pull " poll ?
It would n't make sense to call it a " push poll . "
None of his opponents have any name recognition , so they could hardly get tarred by innuendo or misleading accusations .
Part of why Grayson did well might be a simple matter of name recognition .
At any rate , the Republicans are having none of it .
HuffPo contacted the NRCC for comment :
" This is the most bogus thing I 've ever seen in my life , " said Andy Seré , Regional Press Secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
I got emailed a link to ConnecticutMan1 at ePluribusMedia , who adds the following commentary :
That all mythical squishy middle centristy stuff that The Village preschoolers can not read or write beyond ?
The one that Obama keeps trying to to pander to and live off of while producing medicocre to pure crap legislation , IF he can get anything to pass at all , which is pissing everybody on all political sides off .
I would n't it put it quite so harshly myself .
But I do think there 's an important lesson in there for House and Senate races - upcoming primaries and in the fall as well .
Bill Halter could maybe address it in that Arkansas primary to good effect , for example .
On Friday , March 5 , MIT officially opens the Media Lab Complex , designed by Pritzker Prize - winning architect Fumihiko Maki and Associates in association with Leers Weinzapfel Associates .
The building marks a new era of innovation for the world - renowned Media Lab and for a range of art , design , and technology - related programs in the School of Architecture +
Planning , of which the Media Lab is a part .
Located on the corner of Amherst and Ames Streets in the heart of the MIT campus , the six - story , 163,000 - square - foot building is adjacent to and carefully integrated into the existing home of the Media Lab , known as the Wiesner Building , designed by MIT alumnus I.M. Pei .
Together , the two landmark buildings — connected on several floors — will create an exceptional environment for research , creativity , and discovery .
" In the best MIT tradition of inventing the future , the new Media Lab Complex expands a legendary workshop where creativity and innovation continually transform the intersection of people and machines , " said MIT President Susan Hockfield .
" This magnificent new facility unites researchers from across our campus in advancing technologies that amplify the human experience . "
The new six - story complex features an open , flexible , atelier - style layout designed to support the unique cross-disciplinary research style of the Media Lab and other academic units that will occupy the building .
Laboratories and workspaces are arranged around light - filled central atria , with spectacular views of the Charles River and the Boston skyline to the south .
Lecture halls and other public gathering spaces occupy the upper floors and serve to draw visitors up through the building .
“ The magic of the Media Lab is its ability to bring together researchers from an eclectic range of disciplines — engineers , computer scientists , artists , musicians , and others — who work together collaboratively to invent technologies that improve people 's lives and transform society , ” says Frank Moss , Director of the Media Lab .
“ The openness and transparency of this incredible new building will support the Lab ’s unique style of research and allow us to take on the major challenges that confront the world in the 21st century , such as human health , education and sustainable cities . "
The building ’s several double - height , glass - enclosed research laboratories — home to research groups such as Camera Culture , Lifelong Kindergarten and Tangible Media — are vertically offset from one another .
This makes possible long and often surprising vistas through the building — horizontally , vertically , and diagonally — that will serve to make the research work highly visible .
It will also enhance the sense of community in the building .
The aluminum and glass curtain walls that surround the steel - framed building extend the feeling of openness and transparency to the exterior and make the building appear like a luminous jewel at night .
“ Fumihiko Maki is one of the world ’s most elegant designers , ” says Adèle Naudé Santos , dean of the MIT School of Architecture +
Planning .
“ The precision of his vision and his exacting attention to detail lend his work a rare clarity and serenity .
This exquisite building is one of his best , and we are privileged to have it on our campus . ”
Now celebrating its 25th anniversary , the MIT Media Lab has long been at the vanguard of new technology .
Many of the Lab ’s inventions — such as electronic ink , wearable computers , and early platforms for social networking — helped ignite the digital revolution .
More recently , the Lab has expanded its focus into “ human adaptability , ” with research projects involving affective computing , 6 - D imaging and the future of the automobile .
The Media Lab Complex will also become home to the Jerome Lemelson Center for Inventive Thinking and to the Okawa Center for Future Children , funded by Isao Okawa , the late chairman of CSK Corporation and SEGA Enterprises , Ltd .
The center will focus on transforming the ways in which children live , learn and play in the digital age .
The complex will also house several programs in the School of Architecture +
Planning , including the newly formed Art , Culture and Technology Program .
The Media Lab Complex builds on an MIT tradition of architectural excellence , from the neoclassical design of its original architect , William Welles Bosworth , to the mid-20th - century modernism of Alvar Aalto and Eero Saarinen .
An ambitious new building program , begun a decade ago , added nearly one million square feet to the Cambridge campus and utilized the talents of some of the world ’s finest architects and planners , including Charles Correa , Frank Gehry , Steven Holl and Kevin Roche .
Other buildings currently under construction include the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT , designed by Ellenzweig ; and a new building for the Sloan School of Management , designed by Moore Ruble Yudell Architects & Planners in association with Bruner / Cott Architects .

With the House and the Senate still at loggerheads over their health care bills , the White House hinted on Tuesday that President Obama might post his own bill on the Internet before the bipartisan health care summit he is planning at Blair House next week .
In the nearly a year since Congress began debating a health care overhaul , Mr. Obama has yet to make his own priorities explicit .
He said at the outset that he would set broad parameters for the measure and leave the details to lawmakers .
Now , with the bill stalled on Capitol Hill in the wake of the Republican Senate victory in Massachusetts , Mr. Obama has announced the health summit as a high - stakes gambit to breathe life back into the legislation and has promised to put the Democrats ’ bill online before the session .
During a news conference last week , Mr. Obama said he envisioned posting a merged House - Senate bill that would address his goals of controlling costs and expanding coverage .
“ Now , we have a package , as we work through the differences between the House and the Senate , and we ’ll put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time , that meets those criteria , meets those goals , ’’ the president said .
But Mr. Obama may be running out of time .
His press secretary , Robert Gibbs , was asked Monday if the president would simply post his own bill if the House and the Senate cannot come to terms .
“ Stay tuned , ’’ Mr. Gibbs said .
He declined to elaborate .

There 's two bits of Ubisoft news today , one of which we 're still investigating .
First up , the company apparently payed attention to the outrage of gamers who discovered the DRM in the PC version of Assassin 's Creed II would throw them out of game without saving if they lost an Internet connection in a single - player game .
AC2 wo n't be released until March 16 , but the company has already issued a patch thatallow gamers to resume playing in the event of a connection break , rather than forcing them back to the last saved game .
The second ( and amusing ) snippet of news is that Ubisoft debuted this new controversial DRM system with the release of Silent Hunter 5 , only to have it allegedly cracked within 24 hours of launch .
We 're currently in the process of confirming this and will report back with our findings .
Ubisoft does get a point or two , however grudgingly , for acknowledging supreme customer unhappiness and patching its ridiculously penalizing DRM scheme but unfortunately neither the medical community nor gaming developers have ever found a way to patchBased on available evidence , we have no choice but to conclude that there are several high - ranking suits at Ubisoft afflicted with this serious condition .
It does n't matter if we 're writing TPS Reports , downloading files , surfing the Internet , or playing a game — we ( by which I mean , every human on Earth old enough to hammer their face into a keyboard ) collectively HATE losing data or our place in it .
This is why nifty features like autosaving documents , web browsers that can remember where you were , and resume download functionality were invented in the first place .
It 's why DVDs have scene selection , and tape recorders can rewind / fast forward .
If you actually pause and think about it , humanity has pumped out a consistent level of nerdrage over losing our place for a pretty damned long time .
The card catalog and Dewey Decimal System were simultaneously developed in 1876 ( by two different people ) because the previous library organization system consisted of throwing all the books into random heaps around the room and it was pissing people off .
It was n't thirty minutes after Gutenberg put his first book on display in 1440 that a disgruntled competitor invented the dog-ear .
The transition from scrolls to codices ( books ) , which began in the 1st century , was driven partly by a desire to better organize , protect , and preserve data , and included the invention of both the bookmark and the index .
We can trace this desire all the way back to the very first civilizations and even into prehistoric times .
What did our forebears variously paint , chisel , or drag a lot of into geometric shapes ?
Why ?
Because it was n't going anywhere .
You can bet that when Khufu was watching the Great Pyramid rise from the Egyptian desert , he was n't asking himself : " What happens if I lose my place ? "
Skip ahead 4,576 years ( give or take a decade ) , and it 's Khufu 's pyramid .
This is why Khufu is sometimes surreptiously worshipped as the Lord of Saved Games ( hieroglyphs drawn in Cheetos grease by caffeine - jittered hands depict him as an Egyptian Pharaoh in his prime , with a Legend of Zelda cartridge for a head . )
Somehow The Powers That Be at Ubisoft forgot this cultural imperative .
We 'd like to be the first to sincerely thank Ubisoft for doing the right thing and patching out this particular aspect of its new DRM system .
We 're still left asking the same question we did last week , however :
Who , exactly , thought this was a good idea ?
Google and Microsoft are fierce rivals in the handset market
Microsoft has made an application that works with Google 's Android phone .
Called Tag , the free software uses a handset 's camera to turn it into a mobile barcode reader .
It is the first application Microsoft has made for the Android operating system - one of the key rivals to Windows Mobile .
Android is among the last to get the Tag application which is available on Windows phones , the iPhone , Blackberry and Symbian handsets .
Using Tag and similar programs , barcodes can become coupons that link people to websites , pass on information or give visitors a discount in an online store .
Releasing the application for Android continues Microsoft 's program of making software for rival phone firm .
In December 2008 it produced its first iPhone app , called Seadragon , and followed it up in early 2009 by releasing Tag for the Apple handset .
Apple has the most mature mobile apps store .
In early January , Apple said more than three billion applications had been downloaded from its store .
Microsoft 's launch is made against a background of greater co-operation among operators on phone software .
In February , 24 of the worlds largest mobile network phone operators banded together to create the Wholesale Applications Community .
This will try to make it easy for application developers to make and sell phone applications .
It is widely seen as a move by operators to wrest control of the lucrative apps market away from software firms and phone makers .
Microsoft recently unveiled a revamp of its mobile operating system called Windows Phone 7 Series , which will be publicly launched later in 2010 .

When President Barack Obama ’s jobs bill passed the House in early March , it contained a little - noticed provision to recover part of its $ 35 billion price tag by cracking down on offshore tax evasion , which costs the US some $ 100 billion a year in lost revenue .
The provision , which requires foreign financial institutions to report more data to the Internal Revenue Service , was likely prompted by a 2008 Senate investigation that revealed the systematic efforts made by Swiss bank UBS to help moneyed Americans hide massive sums from the IRS .
The insider information that formed the backbone of the investigation — insight that eventually helped the feds recover billions in unpaid taxes — was provided by a former midlevel executive at UBS , American - born Bradley Birkenfeld .
Birkenfeld is the only international banker who has ever blown the whistle to the US government on Switzerland ’s legendarily secretive banking practices .
He is also the only person connected to UBS ’ massive tax evasion scheme to have been sent to prison : Birkenfeld is currently serving a four - year sentence for fraud .
Whistleblower advocacy groups warn that this punishment could have a “ chilling effect , ” discouraging other financial whistleblowers from coming forward .
Did Obama ’s Department of Justice ( DOJ ) exact retribution that could cost US taxpayers billions ?
Birkenfeld first raised alarms about UBS ’ banking practices in a series of emails to his superiors in 2005 , after a colleague allegedly brought to his attention a year - old memo that forbade soliciting Swiss banking services while either the banker , client , or prospect were on American soil .
“ When I read it , ” Birkenfeld said in an October 2007 Senate deposition , “ I was very concerned about what was going on in the bank because this contradicted entirely what my job description was . ”
From at least 2001 until he resigned from UBS in 2005 , Birkenfeld had worked to help rich people hide millions in taxable assets from the US government .
Birkenfeld claims he only realized that what he was doing was criminal after reading the memo .
Two years later , Birkenfeld began providing the US government a cache of UBS internal documents , business emails , and insider knowledge .
The US used this information to extract a plea agreement from the Swiss government and UBS , in which the bank agreed to pay a $ 780 million penalty and to release the names attached to 4,450 of its 19,000 undisclosed US accounts .
Those accounts hold a significant portion of the estimated $ 20 billion in previously hidden assets held by UBS ’ US clients .
This agreement , which is now pending in the Swiss parliament , could be a model for indicting other banks in offshore tax havens — countries with low ( or no ) taxes on banking assets , and strict secrecy laws to conceal the identity of their depositors .
That is , provided the US can convince more whistleblowers with evidence of financial crimes to speak up .
In the wake of the Birkenfeld conviction , whistleblower advocacy groups say that ’s unlikely to happen anytime soon .
Jesselyn Radack , the national security director at the Government Accountability Project , says that her organization has been in contact with at least four financial whistleblowers — including clients and employees of major Swiss banks — that “ saw what happened to [ Birkenfeld ] and are not going to come forward . ”
She adds , “ I ca n’t in good conscience tell someone to go to the government given its treatment of Birkenfeld . ”
When Birkenfeld was locked up , whistleblower advocates mounted a campaign to commute his sentence — which they referred to as “ an American tragedy ” and “ a disgraceful miscarriage of justice . ”
Stephen Kohn , the director of the National Whistleblowers Center , says the message sent by the US government was : “ If you come forward , you will go to jail and have your life ruined . ”
But the story is a bit more complicated than that .
Birkenfeld was n’t indicted simply because he was involved in the illegal activities at UBS that he helped expose .
The primary reason was his failure to disclose in his initial June 2007 meetings with DOJ the longstanding relationship he had with a former client named Igor Olenicoff , a billionaire real estate developer then on trial for tax evasion .
In April 2008 , Olenicoff was sentenced to work 120 hours of community service , put on two years probation , and forced to pay a $ 52 million fine for dodging $ 7.2 million in taxes .
The DOJ argues it could have won a harsher judgment against Olenicoff had Birkenfeld been more forthcoming .
In May 2008 , when the DOJ claims to have first discovered the connection between the banker and billionaire , it charged Birkenfeld with conspiracy to defraud the US government .
During his trial , Birkenfeld pled guilty and admitted to , among other things , smuggling diamonds into the US in a toothpaste tube for Olenicoff .
“ Oh , it was just a way of carrying them so I would n’t lose them , ” Birkenfeld told 60 Minutes .
“ Where would you put two diamonds ? ”
In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder asking him to reconsider Birkenfeld ’s case , his attorneys argue that because he mentioned his relationship with Olenicoff to Senate investigators , as well as other inquiries that were being conducted by the IRS and Securities and Exchange Commission , Birkenfeld was not trying to shield his client from the law .
They also contend that Birkenfeld would have been more forthcoming had he been offered the full immunity from prosecution that he ’d requested .
That explanation did n’t wash with Holder .
The attorney general ’s office , which did not directly respond to Birkenfeld ’s complaints , said in a written statement that his case had been “ carefully considered ” by the district court .
Gerald Lefcourt , the former president of the National Association of Criminal Lawyers , agrees with Holder .
“ The Senate is politics , ” he explained .
“ What ’s important is making a deal with the US attorneys … the other stuff is icing on the cake . ”
Lefcourt adds that the sentence simply indicates the DOJ ’s low tolerance for witnesses who are not entirely cooperative .
Notorious mafia informant Sammy “ the Bull ” Gravano “ got five years for 19 murders , ” he points out .
“ It ’s in the public interest to see that if you cooperate , you will get just rewards . ”
But even taking into account Birkenfeld ’s failure to be fully frank with the DOJ , the whistleblower groups contend that he got a disproportionately harsh punishment .
Judge William Zloch of Florida ’s Southern District Court handed him a sentence 10 months longer than the 30 months the prosecution had requested .
Whistleblower advocates say there ’s one thing the government could do to encourage other Wall Street insiders , accountants , or corporate financial officers to expose fraud : Cut Birkenfeld a big check .
Under an IRS whistleblower reward program , informants are eligible for 15 to 30 percent of the collected tax proceeds resulting from any details they provide on a scam that they were n’t directly involved in creating .
But the program has n’t awarded a payout since it was created in 2006 .
Kohn of the National Whistleblowers Center is one of two lawyers representing Birkenfeld in his application for the award ( and may earn a sizeable cut of the reward if it ’s successful ) .
The Government Accountability Project ’s Radack , a Bush - era whistleblower profiled by Mother Jones , noted that a payment from the IRS “ could hopefully defrost the current chill on whistleblowers coming forward . ”
The idea of imposing a lighter punishment — or making a hefty payout — to someone who has admitted breaking the law may sound distasteful .
But the economic crisis has illustrated that there ’s no shortage of financial malfeasance to be uncovered , and as Birkenfeld has shown , just one whistleblower can make a big difference .
There ’s no way to know whether the DOJ is working with other informants behind the scenes — but if it eventually turns out that Birkenfeld ’s prison sentence did dissuade more financial whistleblowers from coming forward , then he may be one fraudulent banker who did n’t belong behind bars .

Hardly a week goes by without a new health claim being made of eating oily fish .
But is it really as magical as we are told ?
If there were a top 40 of good foods , a chart rundown of the right things to eat , then anything containing omega - 3 fatty acids would have been number one for years .
They even have their own international awareness day , which takes place this Wednesday .
Omega - 3 is the name given to a family of unsaturated fatty acids found mainly in oily fish , such as salmon , herring , sardines and anchovies , and also in eggs , meat , milk and cheese .
There 's no evidence that omega - 3 reduces the risk of death or heart attack or stroke or anything like that in those of us who have not recently had a heart attack
Dr Lee Hooper
Oily fish ' can halt eye disease '
The naturally occurring acids of the omega - 3 family can apparently boost our brain power , keep our hearts healthy , strengthen our bones , and much more .
You can ingest the fatty acids by eating a lot of the right kind of fish or by taking fish oil supplements - little golden capsules rich in omega - 3 .
Hardly a week goes by without yet another media report on " The wonders of omega - 3 fatty acids " ( as a headline in Canada put it recently ) .
Last month it was reported omega - 3 can protect against psychotic disorders such a schizophrenia .
An international team of researchers gave a daily dose to 81 people deemed to be at risk from psychosis and found it seemed to cut the rate of psychotic illness - including schizophrenia - by 25 % .
But how much of this is hype , and how much reality ?
Is there a danger that a largely fish - derived fatty acid is being turned into a modern - day magic potion ?
Dietician Evelyn Tribole is a firm believer in their potency .
Packaging tag " While it can seem that omega - 3s do everything but wash your windows , it 's important to remember that they are essential nutrients " , says Ms Tribole , author of The Ultimate Omega - 3 Diet : Maximise the Power of Omega - 3s to Supercharge Your Health , Battle Inflammation , and Keep Your Mind Sharp .
Grass - grazing cattle have more omega - 3 , says Evelyn Tribole
She says modern forms of food production are reducing the amount of omega - 3 in our foods , " contributing to a global omega - 3 fat deficiency in the diets of most people " .
" For example , animals that graze on grass have higher omega - 3 contents in their meat - and the longer they are out to pasture , the more omega - 3s accumulate in their meat .
But today the great majority of animals dine on [ corn grain ] , which is devoid of omega - 3s . "
That is bad , she says , because " remarkable and consistent " scientific studies show us omega - 3 is good for brain function , mood disorders , heart health and more .
And she dismisses the claim that this is just a fad .
" Yes , food and nutrition seem to run in fashionable trends , with followers and believers .
In this case , however , there is a lot of good evidence for the benefits of omega - 3s . "
But others are sceptical .
Dr Lee Hooper , lead author of one of the most thorough studies on the apparent benefits of omega - 3 , published in the British Medical Journal in 2006 , urges people not to get " carried away " .
The interest in omega - 3 has snowballed over the past decade , giving rise to more and more scientific studies , books about how omega - 3 can make you super - healthy , and government - and corporate - funded omega - 3 promotion groups , such as the Omega - 3 International Awareness Day and The Omega - 3 Group in Scotland .
Evidence wanting
Over the past 10 years , about 12,500 scientific studies on the benefits of omega - 3 have been published , both reflecting and reinforcing the fashion for consuming this apparent super - food .
Today , everything from loaves of bread to frozen fish fingers come with a " RICH IN OMEGA - 3 " tag .
Yet the " systematic review " carried out by Dr Hooper 's team shows the claims are often as fishy as the omega - 3 - rich foods themselves .
Concentration enhancer ?
A review of the evidence says no " According to the evidence we have so far , omega - 3 does not seem to help for cancer prevention or treatment ; with children 's learning or behaviour ; with cognitive function ; or in preventing cognitive decline with age or mental health problems , including bipolar disease , schizophrenia . "
Similarly , there 's " no evidence that the fatty acids assist with cystic fibrosis , allergies , asthma , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , or kidney disease " .
Dr Hooper 's study found evidence omega - 3 improves children 's learning abilities and behaviour to be " very poor " .
On the plus side , " omega - 3 probably does help with arthritis , pain and stiffness , " she says .
And it definitely seems useful for people recovering from a heart attack .
" I would very much want anyone I know who has had a heart attack recently to be consuming omega - 3 . "
It 's beneficial for those who have had a heart attack because research shows that the " long - chain fatty acids " in the omega - 3 family get into the membranes of our cells , helping to " improve the heart 's electrical activity " and reduce blood pressure , among other things .
Trendy nutrient Crucially , though , this does n't mean those who have not had a heart attack can reduce their risk of having one by consuming omega - 3 , says Dr Hooper .
" There 's no evidence that omega - 3 reduces the risk of death or heart attack or stroke or anything like that in those of us who have not recently had a heart attack , " she says .
Dr Hooper says her aim is not to generate a backlash against a trendy nutrient , but simply to get to the truth about its limited benefits .
But if so many of the claims are just hype , how did it get to that stage ?
Why are so many benefits laid at the door of omega -3 ?
Dr Hooper says believes the fashion for omega - 3 betrays our herd - instinct - how , " as a group " , we periodically get overexcited about certain foodstuffs .
There always seems to be some " new food panacea " to our problems , she says .
Another doctor , Michael Fitzpatrick , says the omega - 3 fad is just the flipside of the anti-junk food campaign .
Just as see certain kinds of " junk food " as " morally and constitutionally corruptive " , we tend to elevate other foods as " saviours of human health " .
So much so , says Dr Fitzpatrick , GP and author of The Tyranny of Health , that today there is almost a " cult of omega - 3 " .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Why is it in the stories about Omega - 3 that we rarely see a discussion of Omega - 6 and the Omega - 3 to - 6 ratios ?
Similarly for Sodium , we rarely see discussions of Sodium / Potassium ratios .
Is n't it so in each case that the interaction of the two substances is as or more important than the dose of either alone ?
Steve Foster , Leiden , The Netherlands I support the view of the dietician on this subject .
There is a lot of robust evidence of its beneficial effects .
It is clear from the patients I see that there is little to no intake of omega - 3 in the diet - very little fish , organic chicken or nuts .
I disagree with Dr Hooper - every single child which has started omega - 3 capsules only without increasing intake of fish has shown improved concentration and behaviour ( more balanced blood sugar which reduces aggression , volatility etc ) .
In my experience there is a general improvement in depressive patients with the intake of omega 3 either in tablet form on natural fish intake .
Jennifer Hargreaves , Worthing , West Sussex
You seem to have missed the other scientific fact about omega 3 that no - one mentions .
Only fish - derived omega - 3 is proven to help with brain , heart and joint function , plant - derived omega - 3 does n't really help at all .
D Simpson , Edinburgh
Where is the science in this piece ?
You can't just dismiss various unnamed studies with another equally vague references to another study .
In the absence of scientific detail am I just supposed to take the journalist 's word for this ?
Jonathan Gay , London I think Dr Hooper should turn her attention to Aloe Vera next .
It seems there nothing that wo n't cure as well .
Will , Bristol I am sceptical about most things , in particular when they appear to be a fad , however , my son had some difficulties with concentration at school and also behaviour in the home .
After reading about the effects of Omega 3 and in particular a range of products , which contain omega 3 , 6 & 9 fatty acids , we decided that our son was going to try a course of the capsules .
After about a week we had comments back from the school re .
what had we done to change our sons behaviour ?
The level of concentration and cooperation in class had markedly improved in a short space of time .
That improvement is still there today , some six years after we first started him on the capsules although he has long since ceased taking them as it is always preferable to obtain nutrients from our normal diets rather than processed versions .

This story takes me back to the early fifties when I was in the local infant school .
Every moring we had to line up for our spoonful of malt and our cod liver oil .
Of course we were still living with rationing then and another item doled out was orange juice .
Modern diets seem deficient in a lot of good items - fruit and veggies especially ' I do n't see it as a " food fad " but more of the wheel turning a full circle and people are starting to realize that traditional food - meat and veggies etc. , is not all bad .

A son in the US who owns a large graphic arts prepress business , claims his total focus for doing this work which requires extreme attention to detail , is possible only because he takes Omega 3 daily .

I live in a fishing town .
Salmon is everywhere .
I eat lots of salmon on my doctors recommendation .
When I do n't , my arthritis gets worse very quickly .
When I eat it at least 6 - 8 oz of it 2 - 3 times a week , arthritic pain and other symptoms do seem to greatly diminish over 2 - 3 weeks .
I do n't know about Omega - 3 and all that , but if salmon has the highest concentrate of it , then maybe there 's something to it .

Programmer Discount
Are you a game programmer ?
Do you know what statements like x=x ++ ; mean ?
We used to offer a programmer discount but it has been discontinued .
You can still take the test though .
Simply click here to register and qualify .
Note :
The test is ten rather difficult questions .
Lawsuit Settlement
Update :
The lawsuit has been settled and payments have been mailed .
The following information is no longer current .
If you worked at Electronic Arts as an Associate Software Engineer or Software Engineer Level 1 - 3 between February 14 , 2001 and February 14 , 2006 then you may be entitled to participate in the settlement .
Preliminary court approval is scheduled for May 16 , 2006 .
If the court agrees to do so , notice will go out to the class members .
The notice will explain your rights under the settlement , how to submit a claim form and how to object or opt out of the settlement if you would like to preserve your right to sue EA individually .
The relevant web pages for the law firms representing the plaintiffs are :

http://www.schubert-reed.com/EAProgrammers.html
California labor law states that companies do not have to pay overtime to software engineers if they earn $ 41 per hour or more and engage in advanced work that is creative or intellectual in nature .
EA management certainly did n't treat me like my work was advanced , creative or intellectual but it 's unclear exactly what the settlement states .
My first computer was a Commodore VIC - 20 .
I received it as a Christmas present while I was in junior high .
Officially it was for me and my brother but my brother was n't nearly as interested in it as I was .
Within a couple days I had written my first computer program .
It did n't do much , all it did is count backwards from 10 like a rocket ship blasting off .
It was enough though , ever since then I knew I wanted to be a computer programmer .
Specifically , a computer game programmer .
Several of my college friends changed majors once or twice .
Not me , I knew exactly what I wanted to do .
In fact , I had my first game programming job lined up several months before I graduated .
I had n't even considered the possibility of doing something other than game development .
I remember having an interview with Microsoft scheduled .
This was before Windows so nobody but computer nerds knew who Microsoft was .
I thought to myself " Self , do you want a job programming a stodgy old operating system , or a job MAKING COMPUTER GAMES !!! "
At the time , the choice was obvious .
In hindsight , maybe I should have chosen differently .
Anyways , I spent the next decade as a game programmer .
The early years were a lot of fun .
I worked my way up from entry level through lead programmer , shipping many different titles in the process .
It 's thrilling to go to the store and see something you made on the shelves .
People were envious of my job on more than one occasion .
As an experienced software engineer , I was in big demand .
If my bosses ever pestered me I used to tell them I 'd quit and find a better job on the way home .
This was in the late 90's and back then there was a severe shortage of qualified programmers .
When I started , a game development team was anywhere from four to a dozen people .
Every single person on the team made a big difference in the look and feel of the game .
Nowadays , a development team can be 200 people or more .
Even a senior programmer has very little say on a project that large .
The entire process has become less creative and more industrial .
The hardest part about game development is the long hours .
Any time a deadline approaches the team will enter crunch mode .
During crunch mode it 's normal to spend 12 - 16 hours a day , 7 days a week working at a frantic pace .
The company will usually bring in dinner so that nobody has to leave .
I 've slept on the floor in my office on more than one occasion .
In the early years crunch mode would be maybe the last two or three weeks before a project shipped .
It eventually involved into two or three months at the end of a project plus several weeks at every milestone along the way .
There are a couple reasons for the grueling work environment .
First , the games industry is extremely competitive .
There are lots of bad games out there and not so many good ones .
If a game does n't look like it will be a top seller it will often get cancelled before it ever hits the shelves .
A really good game can make piles of money while all the others lose money .
Another reason is that most game developers do n't mind the long hours .
Gaming is their life .
Many people in the industry are savants at gaming and not interested in anything else .
They 'll do whatever it takes to work in the games industry .
Unfortunately , the games industry has evolved to take advantage of this young , eager , hard working labor pool .
As time moved on I became less and less tolerant of the long hours and endless deadlines .
The sexiness of game development had lost it 's luster for me .
Even working on atitle did n't do it for me any more .
I was near the top of my field but was unhappier than I had ever been .
So I quit .
I had tried to talk to management , to maybe fix things , but they were n't interested .
From their perspective there was a vast pool of eager replacements .
So I came into work one day , wrote " I quit " on a post - it note and left .
I had no idea what I was going to do next but I knew I did n't want to make games any more .
I was burned out .
Looking back at my college days , nobody ever would have expected that coffee farming was in my future .
In hindsight , I should have made the transition much sooner .
I 've always loved the outdoors .
I remember looking out my office window at EA and watching some construction workers pour concrete .
I actually envied them .
Sure they were working hard , sweating and getting dirty but at least they knew when their job would be done .
They 'd quit around 4 pm , go home and have a beer while my day was n't even half over .
Just recently , CNN and Money magazine published this article : Best Job in America Basically , they rated several different jobs and decided that software engineer was number one .
Among software engineering they decided that game programming was number one .
Among game programmers the person they interviewed worked upstairs from me at Electronic Arts .
Our jobs were very similar .
I did n't work with him directly but I saw him around the office plenty and I was friends with people that worked with him .
Let 's just say that the journalist could maybe have found someone a little more competent to interview .
To top it off , the guy is more of a manager than a programmer .
Someone in his position can earn a decent salary but certainly nothing spectacular compared to a doctor , lawyer or Alaskan crab fisherman .
This is n't the first time I 've been amazed at how wrong the press gets a story .
Articles like this often mean nothing except that the company has a well funded PR department .
I 'd say that is definitely the case here .
When choosing the best job in America , Money Magazine did n't bother to mention that the company in question had several class action lawsuits brought against it by it's employees concerning the bad work conditions and huge quantities of unpaid overtime .
I was n't the only one to quit the company when I did .
It was common for the company to give new employees a signing bonus if they agreed to stay for at least a year .
It was also common for employees to stay one year and not a day longer .
The starry - eyed newbies would quickly learn that their dream job was n't really all that dreamy .
In fact , it really sucked .
Shortly after I quit I heard rumblings about the beginning of the lawsuit .
I chose to not get involved .
Primarily because I hate all lawsuits and prefer to avoid them if at all possible .
Also because I was salaried and according to my understanding of California law I was considered exempt from overtime pay .
On April 25 , 2006 the lawsuit was settled .
Electronic
Arts agreed to pay $ 14.9 million for unpaid overtime .
$ 14.9 million sounds like a lot of money until you read this article which states that Lawrence Probst , the CEO of EA , earned $ 12.59 million last year .
Apparently he gets paid plenty for his overtime .
EA is a public company ( ERTS ) so bad press can hurt the stock price .
I 've heard that the company has made some changes since I left .
They now pay overtime to entry - level programmers , in exchange they took away their stock grants and bonuses .
All other programmers are still exempt from overtime pay so this change would n't have affected me .
I 've heard that the teams need manager approval before they can work on weekends .
Since it was management demanding the overtime in the first place , I do n't see how this will change anything .
They also moved major deadlines from Mondays to Fridays .
They used to love Monday deadlines because it implied working all weekend .
Even if the games industry really has turned into a 40 hour per week job I 'm still much happier as a Kona coffee farmer .
Sure , the pay 's not as good and I have an overwhelming amount of hard manual labor that needs to be done every day and when done with the day 's work I have a long list of paperwork and website work to do at night , but I actually get to see my wife and kids now .
If I get a strong urge to go jump in the ocean in the middle of the afternoon all I have to do is clear it with the boss : me !
Seeing a game I made on the shelves was thrilling but hearing people rave about coffee I grew is even more thrilling .
Just yesterday I was having some of our coffee milled and the miller , who sees lots and lots of coffee , kept telling me how good our beans are .
That 's a much better compliment than I ever got from company management .
I still have plenty of friends that make a good living as software engineers .
Most of them are happy with their jobs .
Deciding to quit " The Best Job in America " was n't an easy decision .
Being a computer programmer definitely has it 's good points .
But being a Kona coffee farmer in Hawaii ai n't so bad either .
I 'm happy with my decision .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have cracked the genetic code of a songbird for the first time , identifying more than 800 genes linked to song learning in a finding that may shed light on human speech disorders .
Baby zebra finches learn to sing in virtually the same way as human babies learn to speak -- by copying their elders -- which means the tiny bird should serve as a valuable model for understanding human learning and memory .
“ Song learning is an excellent paradigm for all types of learning , ” said Chris Ponting , a professor with the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit at University of Oxford , who was involved in the research .
“ There are experiments that can be done that immediately provide information as to what changes occur in neurons ( brain cells ) upon the learning of a song .
The zebra finch genome provides a tool that allows this exploration , ” he told Reuters .
The Australian zebra finch , which weighs less than half an ounce ( 14 grams ) , is only the second bird to have its genome sequenced , after the chicken in 2004 .
Baby finches , like human infants , start off by “ babbling ” before the young males learn to imitate their father ’s song and eventually pass it on to the next generation .
As they learn in such a predictable way and many of their genes are also found in humans , finches could provide a window onto the origins of speech disorders , such as autism , strokes , stuttering and Parkinson ’s disease .

It gives the zebra finch genome a “ unique relevance to human neuroscience , ” a team of international scientists led by Wes Warren of Washington University ’s Genome Center reported in the journal Nature Wednesday .
Still , untangling the vast web of genetic and molecular factors involved in learning will not be easy .
Experts previously thought there might be around 100 genes involved in zebra finch singing , however , the fact that at least 800 genes exist underlines the sheer complexity of learning .
Significantly , many of the genes activated by bird song do not act like genes in the usual way as code for making proteins .
Instead , they belong to the non-coding part of the genome , or what used to be known as “ junk DNA . ”
The analysis of the zebra finch genome adds to growing evidence that these stretches of DNA are not junk , but actually serve a key biological function .
They may have two birds in the bag , but scientists still want to learn more about these feathered descendants of the dinosaurs .
Next up is the parrot genome , which researchers hope to complete by the end of this year .

Topeka —
As President Barack Obama signed into law health care reform , the Kansas House rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that was aimed at blocking the federal legislation .
The measure received a 75 - 47 majority Tuesday but fell short of the two - thirds majority — 84 votes — necessary in the 125 - member House to put a constitutional amendment before voters .
The reforms “ will take us down the path of socialism , ” said Rep. Brenda Landwehr , R - Wichita .
But Democrats criticized the proposed state constitutional amendment , saying that federal health reform will be decided on U.S. constitutional issues regardless of what states approve .
They also argued that the state amendment would constrain the Legislature from making health insurance changes sought by consumers .
Read on ...
This is great news for the residents of Kansas , but could spell trouble for the Representatives who voted against it .
I think it would be wise for each member of the Kansas House who voted against this amendment to ask for increased security both at work and at home .
I do n't suggest this just because Democrats are being targeted by right wing extremists nationwide , but because it appears at least one Kansas militia nut has been following this issue very closely .
After further research of the above video I posted last year , it seems the man who gave the interview and posted it - gunnyranger2 - is a well - armed militia member who is n't shy about speaking his mind on YouTube and showing off his arsenal .

The national broadband network will come at much too high a cost .
THE opposition is doing the government a favour by blocking the legislation that will allow Telstra to be broken up - misleadingly called the Communications Legislation Amendment ( Competition and Consumer Safeguards ) Bill 2009 .
The legislation 's intent is to force households and businesses that rely on the copper network to take the service from the $ 43 billion national broadband network .
Why ?
The cost to telephone users will be at least double that of their existing service .
Users who want a high - cost , high - speed broadband network can get it now .
Telstra ( and others ) already supply such a service .
Large businesses , government departments and utilities , research institutes , universities and even schools have access to high - speed broadband on fibre because they can make productive use of this technology .
Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama has tapped a former Army general to lead the Transportation Security Administration , sources have told CNN .
Obama plans to nominate Robert A. Harding , a retired major general with 33 years in the Army , to become the TSA administrator , sources said .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will announce the nomination Monday with Harding by her side , according to one administration official .
" The TSA administrator is the most important unfilled post in the Obama administration , " one administration official said .
" Mr. Harding has the experience and perspective to make a real difference in carrying out the mission of the agency . "
" If there was ever a nominee that warranted expedited , but detailed , consideration in the Senate , this is it , " the official said .
In September , Obama nominated Erroll Southers , a Los Angeles airport police department official , to head the agency .
But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners .
Southers withdrew his nomination in January after lawmakers questioned his changing explanation about a personnel action taken against him decades ago .
Harding would be the TSA 's first African - American administrator .
Southers also is black .
Harding has served as CEO of Harding Security Associates , a defense and intelligence government contractor that he founded in 2003 and sold in July 2009 .
From 1996 to 2000 , Harding was director for operations at the Defense Intelligence Agency , where he was the Defense Department 's senior human intelligence officer .
Before that , he was director for intelligence for the Army 's Southern Command .
The TSA was created in the months after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and soon took over security at the nation 's airports , including screening commercial airline passengers and luggage .
CNN 's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .
" If they work for the state of New Jersey , is n't it logical to think they might want to live in the state of New Jersey , understand the problems we have ? "
O'Toole said .
" If their employer is the state - have the common decency to live within our borders . "
With the N.H.L. general managers meeting underway in Boca Raton , Florida , only one proposed change to the on-ice product surfaced .
General managers are leaning toward recommending a rule change that would penalize some , but not all , hits to the head under current NHL rules .
I italicized the words leaning toward to highlight the current language of the rule change .
The general manager ’s have n’t gone far enough .
To make the game safer , N.H.L. general manager ’s need to ban hits to the head .
The numbers on head hits in N.H.L. games are revealing .
According to Colin Campbell , the N.H.L. director of operations , and Gary Meagher , a league spokesman , noted about seven hits a game are shoulder - to - head hits .
Both studied 21 league games , which showed an average of 22 hits to the head per game , from a light brush with a glove to a heavy blow .
In all of those games , or 462 instances , there was one penalty called .
Matt Cooke Hit on Marc Savard – 3/7/10
Clearly , there is an issue here with needs to be fixed .
While the general managers do n’t want to see any of the physical aspect taken out of the game , the general managers need to institute a safer rule on head hits .
The N.H.L. Players Association proposed a rule change last season to ban shoulder checks to the head , such as in the Ontario Hockey League and the International Ice Hockey Federation did .
This was before hits like the one above and the one you can view below .
Mike Richards Hit on David Booth – 10/24/09
Hits like these are n’t a new problem .
With the players calling for a change last year , these problems have existed before .
With the speed of the game increasing , especially after the lockout , hits became more violent , and the chances of injury increased significantly .
But the league has been slow to respond , and they need to step up and address this issue .
The league needs to follow the call of the N.H.L. Players Association and ban shoulder - to - head hits .
Jeff Carter Hit on Anssi Salmela – 2/8/10
By banning shoulder - to - head hits , the N.H.L. can control the physical aspect of the game .
We all enjoy the big hit .
And it has its place in the game .
A big hit can change momentum or send a message to the other team .
But these hits should be delivered in a way that can still protect the players .
Without that insurance , we can continue to see players laying face down or back up , lost as to where they are .
As Doug Wilson , general manager of the San Jose Sharks said , “ We all like hitting ; it ’s a big part of this game .
But there ’s a line that gets crossed , and people are getting injured . ”
Chris Neil Hit on John Mitchell – 3/6/10
If general managers ban these hits now , they can be almost eliminated by the end of the season .
Yes , it ’s going to be difficult to adjust for players .
There may be an increase in penalties called , which can be frustrating .
But in the long run , it ’s better to be frustrated to make the game safer than blatantly allow a dangerous hit to continually take place .
The N.H.L. can also ease players into the transition .
Begin giving players a two - minute minor for hits to the head .
Creating a penalty would begin to eliminate the use of the hit throughout the lead .
I could even see giving a five - minute major for the hit as well .
Both would begin to transition the players into the new rules .
Starting next season , each hit to the head should carry a mandatory game suspension , with length depending on the severity and intention of the hit .
While this may not eliminate every hit , it will vastly reduce the number of instances these dangerous hits could possibly occur .
Limiting these hits would n’t take away from the physical nature of hockey .
Trust me , the N.H.L. wo n’t becoming a no - check roller hockey league .
Players can still take the body and make huge , earth - rattling hits .
Banning shoulder - to - head hits makes those hits , and the game overall , safer .
In the end , that ’s what players , coaches and fans want to see .
Members of Congress are being “ punished ” as a result of the notorious “ gate crashing ” security breach at the White House last year , according to a Texas Republican .
Rep. Louie Gohmert Louis ( Louie ) Buller GohmertHouse in near - unanimous vote affirms peaceful transfer of power House rebuffs GOP lawmaker 's effort to remove references to Democrats in Capitol Rep.
Dan Meuser tests positive for COVID - 19 MORE ( R - Texas ) took to the House floor Friday to give a lengthy complaint about having to walk a block in the rain through heavy security Thursday to visit the White House .

“ The member of Congress , like today in the rain , has to go down a block and then go through security there with double the number of guards and then come up and go through security again and go through guards again , ” Gohmert said .
Security is tighter “ not because Secret Service messed up or the armed guards that are now doubled in number , but because somebody in the White House staff screwed up , ” he said .
“ Now they ’re deciding to punish members of Congress and law - abiding citizens that normally just get in . ”
He described the White House as a “ circus ” run by “ clowns , ” and said lawmakers were being unfairly punished for Tareq and Michaele Salahi 's crashing a White House party last year .
He eventually worked healthcare into his comments , stating he did not want the people handling the Salahi incident to be handling healthcare reform .
Gohmert ’s comments come more than three months after the Salahis passed Secret Service security to attend President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE ’s first state dinner .
While the Secret Service officially accepted blame for the incident , many lawmakers pointed fingers at the White House ’s former Social Secretary Desiree Rogers .
Despite requests from Congress , the White House did not allow her to testify in hearings it held on the incident .
Rogers resigned from her position last month , saying she wanted to pursue other professional opportunities .
Gohmert called the White House ’s handling of the incident “ incompetent . ”
“ The point here is that this is a circus over there , ” he said .
“ Nobody seems to know what ’s going on and when accountability was demanded and the social secretary was requested by members of Congress to come testify , they said we ’re not going to let you come testify .
“ It is a circus going on over there and now the people of the circus want to be in charge of your healthcare .
Good grief , it ’s time to say we do n’t want clowns in charge of something as important as our healthcare .
I do n’t even want them in charge of algae blooms . ”
Gohmert said that before the “ gate crashing ” incident , the White House used to require 24 - hour notice from members of Congress to run security checks using their Social Security number and date of birth .
But since the incident , members of Congress have to provide 48 hours ' notice , he said .
A White House spokesman referred questions of its security measures to the Secret Service , which did not immediately return requests for comment .

In a time where nearly every mainstream development environment has the benefit of IDE support including source - level debugging , auto completion and even incremental compilation as we type , I think that there is still value in stripping things down to just a text editor and a compiler .
I have met developers who have been of the anti-IDE camp through - and - through , but the idea that I ’m putting forward here is not that IDEs be avoided , but that in the process of cementing new programming knowledge , there is value in doing it `without ropes ’ .
When rock climbers go without equipment to aid their ascent , it is called free climbing .
In this spirit , I ’m going to refer to coding without extended tool support `free coding ’ .
In free climbing , for safety , many climbers still use ropes and harnesses but they are never used to aid the actual ascent — only to prevent catastrophe in the event of a fall .
Likewise , in free coding we still have some tools that keep us from falling : the compiler as well as language support for stack traces and debugging statements .
I ’m not going to go as far as Charles Petzold and claim that advanced tool support is rotting our minds , but I am suggesting that by not forgoing the aforementioned occasionally , we are denying ourselves the opportunity to reflect contextually about the code that we are writing .
Instead of pounding away immediately on the keyboard , hoping that Intellisense will know what to do next , we can pause and think for a moment , or perhaps consult the documentation for insight .
One of the main advantages to free coding occasionally is that we can get over the initial panic of not knowing exactly what to do next .
I recently interviewed for a job where the first thing that they had me do was to code some simple algorithms in a text editor , without even a compiler to check the programs .
Even though the programs were simple , I still had a healthy dose of insecurity about what I was entering into the text editor !
I credit that I was able to perform well in this interview to my occasional free coding experiences .
There is another aspect of free coding that I will call `free designing ’ which is to approach the problem without referring to prior solutions .
I ’ll leave this one for another blog post , but I think you can see where I ’m headed with it : that others ’ solutions can become anchors in much the way that a salesperson ’s starting offer anchors a negotiation .
Everything is wide open before the anchor drops , and it is valuable to see where your own solution lands in relation to others ’ .
It is the comparison of the actual vs. expected that provides a huge opportunity for growth and understanding .

Well , there 's a bit of a bummer for the first full day of PAX East 10 .
Penny Arcade 's Mike Krahulik has confirmed that Penny Arcade Adventures , the episodic RPG starring Tycho and Gabe , has been discontinued as developer Hothead Games pursues other avenues .
" We 're actually not making a third episode of the game , " confirms Krahulik .
Penny Arcade 's other half , Jerry Holkins , explains the reason : " Hothead has DeathSpank and they have a chance to do something really cool with it , and they need to have an opportunity to make it incredible .
With a recently announced EA Partners ... uh , partnership , DeathSpank certainly has some weight behind it ...
They definitely could 've done both games .
I think they could 've made DeathSpank and Episode 3 but I think Episode 3 would 've suffered .
I mean , I know it would have suffered .
" So we 'd rather not do it than do it half - assed and so we 're going to finish that story but it 's going to be on our website . "
That 's a shame .
I was n't into Adventures that much ( despite being a fan of PA ) , but it was very popular with gamers .
Still , DeathSpank really is looking cool , and it's great that it 'll get to flourish with dedicated development time .

[ Update : See our updated story on what Displax forgot to say ] .
Displax is revealing a new plastic film with multitouch sensing .
It can be placed over any display or even non-display surfaces , making them into interactive devices .
Portugal - based Displax calls this a “ multitouch skin ” which can be thinner than paper .
The company has been working on it for the past decade and plans to launch commercial products in July .
If it works as billed , it could become an easy way to retrofit passive surfaces — glass , plastic or wood — so that they become interactive .
All it takes is glue the plastic onto the surface — flat or curved — and then use the inputs from touch sensing to control functions on a computer attached to the screen .
The surfaces range from 7 inches to nine feet , diagonally .
The plastic film is about 100 microns , or the width of a human hair .
It works like this .
Displax places a grid of nanowires that can detect the presence of up to 16 fingers ( on a 50 - inch screen ) at any given time ( that number will go up over time ) .
When you press your finger on the grid , which is embedded in plastic , the wires send a signal showing the exact location of your finger to a controller , which can then pass the data to a computer .
The plastic film can be applied to a liquid crystal display , even after the display is built .
Currently , capacitive multitouch sensors have to be built into the TV ’s glass during the manufacturing process .
The screens can even detect if someone blows on a surface .
The uses for the multitouch skins could be myriad .
You can put one over a flat - panel display in a museum to turn it into a multitouch kiosk .
And since it can detect up to 16 fingers , more than one person can interact with the screen at any given time .
The controller works with standard universal serial bus cables and ports .
“ This opens up new possibilities for applications of multitouch technology , ” said Miguel Fonseca , chief business
officer of Displax , in an interview .
Among the ideas are museum kiosks , multitouch flat - panel TVs , multitouch tables , and even interactive glass windows for storefronts .
You could wrap it around a globe and then point at certain countries to trigger a video or audio explanation of the region .
There are also expected applications in gaming .
Fonseca said there are a number of pilot projects using the technology in Europe .
Industries that could use it include telecom , retail , real estate , broadcast , pharmaceutics , finance and games .
The company works with partners who can make applications that take advantage of the technology .
It provides the software drivers that make the hardware work with Windows , Linux and Mac OS computers .
Displax will include several business applications with its products at no cost .
Those apps will let customers display photos and video , access Google Maps and social networks , and play games .
The project started as a research idea in 2000 .
The company started to work on a business plan in 2004 and has been working on its current products since 2004 as a division of the EDIGMA Group .
The company has 52 employees .
Partners on pilot projects include Accenture and IBM .
Pricing has n’t been set yet .
Investors include InovCapital , the Society of Risk Capital of reference of the Portuguese Ministry of Economy and Innovation .
The company has n’t disclosed how much money it has raised .
Rivals include Microsoft and 3M .

The tantalizing look of drizzled frosting over cakes , cookies and pastries is easier to create than you might think .
White drizzle frosting is generally made from either a powdered sugar mixture or from melted white chocolate .
Additional ingredients will change the taste or texture of either variety , but a basic , no - frills frosting works well for almost any dessert that needs a tasty and decorative drizzled topping .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Hundreds of computer geeks , most of them students putting themselves through college , crammed into three floors of an office building in an industrial section of Ukraine ’s capital Kiev , churning out code at a frenzied pace .
They were creating some of the world ’s most pernicious , and profitable , computer viruses .
Investigators with the Federal Trade Commission look at computer monitors in the FTC internet lab where cyber crime investigations take place , in Washington March 22 , 2010 .
The FTC filed a lawsuit seeking disbandment in U.S. Federal Court of scareware company Innovative Marketing Ukraine , or IMU .

According to court documents , former employees and investigators , a receptionist greeted visitors at the door of the company , known as Innovative Marketing Ukraine .
Communications cables lay jumbled on the floor and a small coffee maker sat on the desk of one worker .
As business boomed , the firm added a human resources department , hired an internal IT staff and built a call center to dissuade its victims from seeking credit card refunds .
Employees were treated to catered holiday parties and picnics with paintball competitions .
Top performers got bonuses as young workers turned a blind eye to the harm the software was doing .
“ When you are just 20 , you do n’t think a lot about ethics , ” said Maxim , a former Innovative Marketing programer who now works for a Kiev bank and asked that only his first name be used for this story .
“ I had a good salary and I know that most employees also had pretty good salaries . ”
In a rare victory in the battle against cybercrime , the company closed down last year after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit seeking its disbandment in U.S. federal court .
An examination of the FTC ’s complaint and documents from a legal dispute among Innovative executives offer a rare glimpse into a dark , expanding -- and highly profitable -- corner of the internet .
Innovative Marketing Ukraine , or IMU , was at the center of a complex underground corporate empire with operations stretching from Eastern Europe to Bahrain ; from India and Singapore to the United States .
A researcher with anti-virus software maker McAfee Inc who spent months studying the company ’s operations estimates that the business generated revenue of about $ 180 million in 2008 , selling programs in at least two dozen countries .
“ They turned compromised machines into cash , ” said the researcher , Dirk Kollberg .
The company built its wealth pioneering scareware -- programs that pretend to scan a computer for viruses , and then tell the user that their machine is infected .
The goal is to persuade the victim to voluntarily hand over their credit card information , paying $ 50 to $ 80 to “ clean ” their PC .
Scareware , also known as rogueware or fake antivirus software , has become one of the fastest - growing , and most prevalent , types of internet fraud .
Software maker Panda Security estimates that each month some 35 million PCs worldwide , or 3.5 percent of all computers , are infected with these malicious programs , putting more than $ 400 million a year in the hands of cybercriminals .
“ When you include cost incurred by consumers replacing computers or repairing , the total damages figure is much , much larger than the out of pocket figure , ” said Ethan Arenson , an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission who helps direct the agency ’s efforts to fight cybercrime .
Groups like Innovative Marketing build the viruses and collect the money but leave the work of distributing their merchandise to outside hackers .
Once infected , the machines become virtually impossible to operate .
The scareware also removes legitimate anti-virus software from vendors including Symantec Corp , McAfee and Trend Micro Inc , leaving PCs vulnerable to other attacks .
When victims pay the fee , the virus appears to vanish , but in some cases the machine is then infiltrated by other malicious programs .
Hackers often sell the victim ’s credit card credentials to the highest bidder .
Removing scareware is a top revenue generator for Geek Choice , a PC repair company with about two dozen outlets in the United States .
The outfit charges $ 100 to $ 150 to clean infected machines , a service that accounts for about 30 percent of all calls .
Geek Choice CEO Lucas Brunelle said that scareware attacks have picked up over the past few months as the software has become increasingly sophisticated .
“ There are more advanced strains that are resistant to a lot of anti-virus software , ” Brunelle said .
Anti-virus software makers have also gotten into the lucrative business of cleaning PCs , charging for those services even when their products fall down on the job .
Charlotte Vlastelica , a homemaker in State College , Pennsylvania , was running a version of Symantec ’s Norton anti-virus software when her PC was attacked by Antispyware 2010 .
“ These pop-ups were constant , ” she said .
“ They were layered one on top of the other .
You could n’t do anything . ”
So she called Norton for help and was referred to the company ’s technical support division .
The fee for removing Antispyware 2010 was $ 100 .
A frustrated Vlastelica vented : “ You totally missed the virus and now you ’re going to charge us $ 100 to fix it ? ”
AN INDUSTRY PIONEER
“ It ’s sort of a plague , ” said Kent Woerner , a network administrator for a public school district in Beloit , Kansas , some 5,500 miles away from Innovative Marketing ’s offices in Kiev .
He ran into one of its products , Advanced Cleaner , when a teacher called to report that pornographic photos were popping up on a student ’s screen .
A message falsely claimed the images were stored on the school ’s computer .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
“ When I have a sixth - grader seeing that kind of garbage , that ’s offensive , ” said Woerner .
He fixed the machine by deleting all data from the hard drive and installing a fresh copy of Windows .
All stored data was lost .
Stephen Layton , who knows his way around technology , ended up junking his PC , losing a week ’s worth of data that he had yet to back up from his hard drive , after an attack from an Innovative Marketing program dubbed Windows XP Antivirus .
The president of a home - based software company in Stevensville , Maryland , Layton says he is unsure how he contracted the malware .
But he was certain of its deleterious effect .
“ I work eight - to - 12 hours a day , ” he said .
“ You lose a week of that and you ’re ready to jump off the roof . ”
Layton and Woerner are among more than 1,000 people who complained to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about Innovative Marketing ’s software , prompting an investigation that lasted more than a year and the federal lawsuit that sought to shut them down .
To date the government has only succeeded in retrieving $ 117,000 by settling its charges against one of the defendants in the suit , James Reno , of Amelia , Ohio , who ran a customer support center in Cincinnati .
He could not be reached for comment .
“ These guys were the innovators and the biggest players ( in scareware ) for a long time , ” said Arenson , who headed up the FTC ’s investigation of Innovative Marketing .
Innovative ’s roots date back to 2002 , according to an account by one of its top executives , Marc D’Souza , a Canadian , who described the company ’s operations in - depth in a 2008 legal dispute in Toronto with its founders over claims that he embezzled millions of dollars from the firm .
The other key executives were a British man and a naturalized U.S. citizen of Indian origin .
According to D’Souza ’s account , Innovative Marketing was set up as an internet company whose early products included pirated music and pornography downloads and illicit sales of the impotence drug Viagra .
It also sold gray market versions of anti-virus software from Symantec and McAfee , but got out of the business in 2003 under pressure from those companies .
It tried building its own anti-virus software , dubbed Computershield , but the product did n’t work .
That did n’t dissuade the firm from peddling the software amid the hysteria over MyDoom , a parasitic “ worm ” that attacked millions of PCs in what was then the biggest email virus attack to date .
Innovative Marketing aggressively promoted the product over the internet , bringing in monthly profits of more than $ 1 million , according to D’Souza .
The company next started developing a type of malicious software known as adware that hackers install on PCs , where they served up pop -up ads for travel services , pornography , discounted drugs and other products , including its flawed antivirus software .
They spread that adware by recruiting hackers whom they called “ affiliates ” to install it on PCs .
“ Most affiliates installed the adware product on end - users ’ computers illegally through the use of browser hijacking and other nefarious methods , ” according to D’Souza .
He said that Innovative Marketing paid its affiliates 10 cents per hijacked PC , but generated average returns of $ 2 to $ 5 for each of those machines through the sale of software and products promoted through the adware .
ANY MEANS BUT SPAM
The affiliate system has since blossomed .
Hackers looking for a piece of the action can link up with scareware companies through anonymous internet chat rooms .
They are paid through electronic wire services such as Western Union , Pay Pal and Webmoney which can protect the identity of both the sender and the recipient .
To get started , a hacker needs to register as an affiliate on an underground website and download a virus file that is coded with his or her affiliate ID .
Then it ’s off to races .
“ You can install it by any means , except spam , ” says one affiliate recruiting site , earning4u.com , which pays $ 6 to $ 180 for every 1,000 PCs infected with its software .
PCs in the United States earn a higher rate than ones in Asia .
Affiliates load the software onto the machines by a variety of methods , including hijacking legitimate websites , setting up corrupt sites for the purposes of spreading viruses and attacks over social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
“ Anybody can get infected by going to a legitimate website , ” said Uri Rivner , an executive with RSA , one of the world ’s top computer security companies .
A scareware vendor distributed its goods one September weekend via The New York Times ’ website by inserting a single rogue advertisement .
The hacker paid NYTimes.com to run the ad , which was disguised as one for the internet phone company Vonage .
It contaminated PCs of an unknown number of readers , according to an account of the incident published in The New York Times .
Patrik Runald , a senior researcher at internet security firm Websense Inc , expects rogueware vendors to get more aggressive with marketing .
“ We ’re going to see them invest more money in that -- buying legitimate ad space , ” he said .
To draw victims to infected websites , hackers will also manipulate Google ’s search engine to get their sites to come up on the top of anyone ’s search in a particular subject .
For instance , they might capitalize on news events of wide interest -- from the winners of the Oscars to the Tiger Woods scandal -- quickly setting up sites to attract relevant search times .
Anti-virus maker Panda Security last year observed one scareware peddler set up some 1 million web pages that infected people searching for Ford auto parts with a program dubbed MSAntispyware2009 .
They also snare victims by sending their links through Facebook and Twitter .
Some rogue vendors manage their partnerships with hackers through software that tracks who installed the virus that generated a sale .
Hackers are paid well for their efforts , garnering commissions ranging from 50 to 90 percent , according to Panda Security .
SecureWorks , another security firm , estimates that a hacker who gets 1 to 2 percent of users of infected machines to purchase the software can pull in over $ 5 million a year in commissions .
Hackers in some Eastern European countries barely attempt to conceal their activities .
Panda Security found photos of a party in March 2008 that it said affiliate ring KlikVIP held in Montenegro to reward scareware installers .
One showed a briefcase full of euros that would go to the top performer .
“ They were n’t afraid of the legal implications , ” said Panda Security researcher Sean - Paul Correll .
“ They were fearless . ”
BANKING
One of Innovative Marketing ’s biggest problems was the high proportion of victims who complained to their credit card companies and obtained refunds on their purchases .
That hurt the relationships with its merchant banks that processed those transactions , forcing it to switch from banks in Canada to Bahrain .
It created subsidiaries designed to hide its identity .
In 2005 , Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait severed its ties with an Innovative Marketing subsidiary that had the highest volume of credit card processing of any entity in Bahrain because of its high chargeback rates , according to D’Souza .
Innovative Marketing then went five months without a credit card processor before finding a bank in Singapore -- DBS Bank -- willing to handle its account .
The Singapore bank processed tens of millions of dollars in backlogged credit card payments for the company , D’Souza said .
To keep the chargeback rate from climbing even higher , Innovative Marketing invested heavily in call centers .
It opened facilities in Ukraine , India and the United States .
The rogueware was designed to tell the users that their PCs were working properly once the victim had paid for the software , so when people called up to complain it was n’t working , agents would walk them through whatever steps it took to make those messages come up .
Often that required disabling legitimate anti-virus software programs , according to McAfee researcher Dirk Kollberg , who spent hours listening to digitized audio recordings of customer service calls that Innovative Marketing kept on its servers at its Ukraine offices .
He gathered the data by tapping into a computer server at its branch in Kiev that he said was inadvertently hooked up to Innovative ’s website .
“ At the end of the call , ” he said , “ most customers were happy . ”
Police have had limited success in cracking down on the scareware industry .
Like Innovative Marketing , most rogue internet companies tend to be based in countries where laws permit such activities or officials look the other way .
Law enforcement agencies in the United States , Western Europe , Japan and Singapore are the most aggressive in prosecuting internet crimes and helping officials in other countries pursue such cases , said Mark Rasch , former head of the computer crimes unit at the U.S. Department of Justice .
“ In the rest of the world , it ’s hit or miss , ” he said .
“ The cooperation is getting better , but the level of crime continues to increase and continues to outpace the level of cooperation . ”
The FTC succeeded in persuading a U.S. federal judge to order Innovative Marketing and two individuals associated with it to pay $ 163 million it had scammed from Americans .
Neither individual has surfaced since the government filed its original suit more than a year ago .
But Ethan Arenson , the FTC attorney who handled the case , warned : “ Collection efforts are just getting underway . ”
The Republican abuse of the filibuster is finally even getting to the American people .
Think Progress :
One of the greatest obstacles to passing progressive legislation in Congress has been the use of the filibuster in the Senate .
With upwards of “ 40 cloture votes since the start of the 111th Congress in January , this Senate is on pace to record the second - largest number of filibuster roll calls , ” transforming what was intended to be a seldom - used procedural tactic into an all - out tool for obstructionism .
Now , a new CBS / New York Times poll finds that more Americans support ending the filibuster and requiring legislation to pass by a simple majority :
As you may know , the Senate operates under procedures that effectively require 60 votes , out of 100 , for most legislation to pass , allowing a minority of as few as 41 senators to block a majority .
Do you think this procedure should remain in place , or do you think it should be changed so that legislation is passed with a simple majority ?
Should remain 44 Should be changed 50 [ Do n't Know ] 6
I would bet you that on January 1 , 2009 , most American had no idea what the filibuster even was .
The constant abuse of this practice is not escaping the notice of our citizens .
And you know the only reason why Americans are getting fed up with the filibuster is because the liberal blogosphere has been getting this information out there to the American people .

During a Saturday broadcast , lifestyle television diva Martha Stewart panned former lawmaker Sarah Palin , calling her a “ dangerous person ” who Stewart “ would n’t watch … if you paid me . ”
Speaking to CNN , the host of Martha Stewart Living said Palin is “ very boring to me . ”
Having someone so “ confused ” in government is unsafe , she said .
That makes Palin a “ dangerous person . ”

“ She ’s so confused , ” Stewart said .
“ Anyone in government like that is a real problem .
Reacting to the massive first - day sales of Palin ’s new book , she added : “ Good for her .
Good for her . … I would n’t watch her if you paid me . ”
This video was broadcast by CNN on Saturday , Nov. 21 , 2009 .
Meanwhile , Palin ’s book tour is officially off and running , but not without a few early speedbumps .
At a stop in Noblesville , Indiana on Thursday , she ignored a crowd of fans cheering her to finish her scheduled book signing .

Instead , Palin left , turning her back on the group as they jeered her departure .

The report in China Business News suggests that while Google might close its Google .cn search engine , it may not signal a complete end to its business and operations in the country .
Experts believe that were Google to exit the Chinese search market , they would be unable to return at a later date , even if rules on web censorship changed .
It would mean that Google could miss out on establishing a presence in a country with 384 million web users , leaving the way clear for local rival Baidu to dominate the search market in China .
Enlarge 2002 AP photo Robert Culp , who gained fame in the landmark 1960s TV series I Spy , died Wednesday , He was 79 .
Robert Culp 's leading - man looks and suave demeanor marked a varied six - decade film and television career , but he 'll forever be remembered for his iconically hip '60s TV hit , I Spy .
Culp , 79 , died Wednesday after hitting his head in a fall while walking outside his Hollywood home , his manager told the Associated Press .
The versatile Culp had more than 150 roles starting in 1953 , including military officers , gunslingers and assorted bad guys .
But the globe - trotting 1965 - 68 show I Spy helped make him a household name , as it did for Bill Cosby , the first African - American co-star of a TV drama series .
As Kelly Robinson , the debonair spy masquerading as a tennis pro , Culp received Emmy nominations three years straight .
Each time , he lost to Cosby , whose cover was Robinson 's trainer , Alexander Scott .
( Culp was a gifted tennis player . )
Their characters had a sly , bantering relationship that extended off - screen .
In a statement through spokesman David Brokaw , Cosby cited Culp 's professionalism and enduring friendship , calling Culp " the big brother he never had . "
Culp and Cosby co-starred in 1972 movie Hickey and Boggs , which Culp directed , and reunited in a 1987 episode of The Cosby Show .
Though TV dominated his career , Culp 's many movies included Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice , Hannie Caulder , PT 109 and The Pelican Brief ( as the president ) .
Culp 's quick wit led to stints on game shows such as Hollywood Squares , and he starred as an FBI agent in 1980s series The Greatest American Hero .
His last recurring role was on Everybody Loves Raymondas Raymond 's father - in - law .

THE Sunshine Coast ’s population has passed 330,000 , rising 35,000 in less than four years .
That number is the equivalent of two towns the size of Gympie .
Expected growth over the next 20 years will lift the population to 515,000 , higher than the Gold Coast is now .
Greenfield sites at Caloundra South - Bellvista , Palmview and Maroochydore would accommodate a minimum 67,000 if the State Government does not alter its growth direction .
There is also allowance for a combined 25,000 in greenfield areas at Kawana and Beerwah and a further 128,000 through existing development approvals and planning scheme capacity .
Data released this week showed the Coast ’s population was 295,000 at the 2006 Census , climbing to 312,000 by 2008 .
The Sunshine Coast council has commissioned consultants to undertake a lot - by - lot analysis to look at the population potential for the whole of the region .
Chief planning officer Warren Bunker told the council ’s Sustainability Advisory Taskforce that the analysis would provide a population model by May .
On Wednesday , population policy advocate Kelvin Thompson , the Federal Labor member for the Victorian seat of Wills , said growth brought problems and rather than solving the housing affordability crisis simply made it harder for people to buy a home .
Mr Thompson will speak at a Sustainable Population Forum at Kawana on Sunday .
He heads a line up that includes Coast Mayor Bob Abbot , Professor Tor Hundloe from Bond University , Dr Jane Sullivan from Sustainable Population Australia and author of Overloading Australia , Mark O’Connor
Sponsored by Sunshine Coast Environment Council and South - East Queensland conservation groups , it will provide an opportunity for those concerned about rapid population growth to hear what can be done .
Mr Thompson said it had been shown over a long period in Australia that increasing supply was not the answer to addressing housing affordability .
He proposes reducing demand by cutting Australia ’s immigration intake to 70,000 , annually , ending the skilled migration intake , and ending the $ 1.4 billion baby bonus and instead invest the money in education .
Mr Thompson said rather than importing skilled labour , Australia should boost training to deliver those skills from its existing population .
The free forum will be held at Lake Kawana Community Centre from 2 pm to 4.30 pm on Sunday .
( CNN ) -- Deaths from pregnancy and childbirth in the United States have doubled in the past 20 years , a development that a human rights group called " scandalous and disgraceful " Friday .
In addition , the rights group said , about 1.7 million women a year , one - third of pregnant women in the United States , suffer from pregnancy - related complications .
Most of the deaths and complications occur among minorities and women living in poverty , it noted .
Amnesty International issued a report Friday that calls on President Obama to take action .
" This country 's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful , " said Larry Cox , executive director of Amnesty International USA .
" Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors .
Women should not die in the richest country on earth from preventable complications and emergencies , " Cox said in a news release .
The report , " Deadly Delivery : The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA , " notes that the lifetime risk of maternal deaths is greater in the United States than in 40 other countries , including virtually all industrialized nations .
The report also noted that severe pregnancy - related complications that nearly cause death -- known as " near misses " -- have increased by 25 percent since 1998 .
Up to 40 percent of near misses are considered preventable with better quality of care , according to a 2007 study in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology .
Minorities , women living in poverty , Native Americans , immigrants and those who speak little or no English are particularly affected , Amnesty International said .
" The thing that really struck us was that these problems hit women of color , low - income , particularly hard , " said Nan Strauss , researcher and co-author of the Amnesty report .
" But every woman who is going through pregnancy in this country is at risk . "
Figures compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia , show that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts .
White women have a mortality rate of 9.5 per 100,000 pregnancies , the CDC said .
For African - American women , that rate is 32.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies .
" This has been known for a while and no one has a good handle on it , " said Dr. Elliot Main , chairman and chief of obstetrics at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco .
" This is a national disgrace and a call to action .
Both numbers are a call to action -- maternal mortality and racial disparity . "
The CDC analysis shows that deaths during pregnancy and childbirth have doubled for all U.S. women in the past 20 years .
In 1987 , there were 6.6 deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies .
The number of deaths had climbed to 13.3 per 100,000 in 2006 , the last year for which figures were available .
A report called " Healthy People 2010 " by the Department of Health and Human Services says that number should be around four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies .
Statistics for other highly industrialized countries show that the U.S. goal of four deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies is attainable .
Great Britain , for example , has fewer than four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies , Main said .
" Women 's health is at risk , " said Strauss .
" We spend the most , and yet women are more likely to die than in 40 other countries .
And that disconnect is what makes it such a problem . "
Amnesty International points out that nearly 13 million U.S. women of reproductive age ( 15 to 44 years old ) , or one in five , do not have health insurance .
Minorities account for 32 percent of all women in the United States but 51 percent of uninsured women , the rights group said .
Furthermore , Amnesty International said , one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care , starting in the first trimester .
The number rises to about one in three for African - American and Native American women , the human rights group said .
Amnesty International also cited what it called " burdensome bureaucratic procedures in Medicaid enrollment [ that ] substantially delay access to vital prenatal care for pregnant women seeking government - funded care . "
In addition , the group said , a shortage of health care professionals poses a serious obstacle to timely and adequate care , especially in rural areas and inner cities .
In 2008 , 64 million people were living in " shortage areas " for primary care , Amnesty International said .
" Obstacles to care are widespread , even though the USA spends more on health care than any other country and more on pregnancy and childbirth - related hospital costs , $ 86 billion , than any other type of hospital care , " the rights group said .
In its call for Obama to take action , Amnesty International said a health care reform proposal before Congress does not address the issue .
" Reform is primarily focused on health care coverage and reducing health care costs , and even optimistic estimates predict that any proposal on the table will still leave millions without access to affordable care , " said Rachel Ward , one of the authors of the " Deadly Delivery " report .
" Mothers die not because the United States can't provide good care , but because it lacks the political will to make sure good care is available to all women , " said Cox , Amnesty International USA 's executive director .
Medical professionals and researchers note that although the percentage of maternal deaths is increasing , the overall number still remains low .
" They are low in absolute number sense , " said Main in San Francisco .
" These are rare events .
They serve as a canary in the mine shaft -- tell us that we need to look more carefully at the system of maternity care .
Overall , childbirth is very safe . "
More of an alarm is not sounded , analysts said , because most practitioners do n't see many -- if any -- deaths each year .
There is now approximately one death for every 6,000 to 10,000 births , Main said .
A typical hospital has about 1,500 births a year , so any hospital can go years without a maternal death , he said .
" It 's still , thank heavens , quite rare , " said Debra Bingham , executive director of California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative .
But that does n't mean there 's not a problem , she said .
" When you see trends worsen in such a short period of time , it requires thoughtful examination , " said Bingham .
" And you ca n't just dismiss that . "
Rivka Gordon , director of strategic initiatives at the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals , also believes something should be done .
" It 's unacceptable in a resource - rich country like the U.S. that we are seeing maternal - and pregnancy - related deaths trending upward , " she said .
" We have to look very , very carefully at this . "

I keep flailing the American press for not showing people what East Jerusalem looks like ; how far settlements like Gilo and Ramat Shlomo are from the Old City .
Well the Times has a pretty good editorial supporting Obama over Netanyahu here , and it is accompanied by a map of East Jerusalem that goes a long way in the direction I want .
I wish the wall were n’t indicated by a faint gray line ; this conveys nothing of the real sense of the wall .
Also it would be good to have photographs of the carving - up of Jerusalem , so you understand what it is like to look at Gilo from the village of Wallajeh just to the southeast , how Gilo towers over the village whose land it is gobbling .
Still , it is great that the Times created this map .
EU - Innenkommissarin Malmström will Websites mit kinderpornographischem I nhalt europaweit sperren .
Offensichtlich hat die Schwedin nicht die Diskussion in Deutschland verfolgt .
Cecilia Malmström , auf den Spuren von Ursula von der Leyen .
( Foto : REUTERS )
Kampf gegen Kinderpornographie ist wichtig .
So wichtig , dass jetzt auch von EU - Innenkommissarin Cecilia Malmström eine Richtlinie vorgestellt wurde , wie die Mitgliedsstaaten mit dem Problem im Internet umgehen sollen .
Nach Vorstellung der liberalen Politikerin sollen einschlägige Seiten gesperrt werden , verpflichtend für alle 27 EU - Mitgliedstaaten .
In Deutschland sind die Entscheidungsträger bekanntlich bereits viel weiter : Löschen ist effektiver als sperren .
Ein Grundsatz , der inzwischen breite gesellschaftliche und politische Unterstützung findet .
Dementsprechend zurückhaltend reagiert die Bundesregierung auf den Vorstoß der EU - Kommission : Die zukünftig vorgesehene Löschung gehe ohnehin weiter als eine Sperrung , das geplante EU - Recht werde damit " relativ automatisch erfüllt " , so der stellvertretende Regierungssprecher Christoph Steegmans .
Die dunklen Ecken werden geschwärzt
Nach der EU - Richtlinie zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung , die im Herbst womöglich ganz gekippt wird , ist auch das Papier der schwedischen Kommissarin zweifelhaft .
Die aufkommende Kritik , nach Ursula " Zensursula " von der Leyen habe man es nun mit Cecilia " Censilia " Malmström zu tun , ist vertretbar .
Datenschützer befürchten , dass die Sperrung von Internetseiten einer möglichen Zensur anderer Inhalte Vorschub leisten könnte , deren Einordnung in die Kategorien legal und illegal nicht eindeutig ist , oder Strafverfolgungsbehörden schlicht nicht in den Kram passen .
Wesentlich effektiver ist das Löschen zudem , weil die Produzenten von Kinderpornographie weniger Möglichkeiten hätten , Inhalte an ihre Konsumenten zu bringen .
Wer kriminell ist , lässt sich nicht durch ein simples Stoppschild abhalten .
Cecilia Malmström will nach eigener Aussage mit Hilfe ihrer EU - Richtlinie " mit den dunklen Ecken des Internets aufräumen " .
Mit ihrer Richtlinie würden diese Refugien komplett in Schwarz verschwinden .
Proxy - Server , verfälschte IP - Adressen , Internet - Cafés – es ist ein Leichtes , sich der Beobachtung durch Dritte zu entziehen .
Ein Anruf genügt
Zwar soll den einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten selbst überlassen werden , wie sie die Richtlinie umsetzen .
Doch der Vorschlag muss noch von EU - Parlament und Europäischem
Rat abgesegnet werden .
Das wird nicht passieren .
Warum sollten Politiker einer verpflichtenden Regelung zustimmen , die keine oder gar gegensätzliche Wirkung entfalten würde ?
Cecilia Malmström sollte bei ihrer deutschen Kollegin Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger anrufen .
Das würde der EU - Innenkommissarin viel Arbeit ersparen .

Have you passed by an organic food store on your way home from work and wondered if organic food is healthier for you than other types of food ?
Well , if you are asking such a question , then you may have been filled with a number of false premises by critics of organic food .
That is , there are those that make statements along the lines of “ It is all the same ” or “ You can still lose weight with ‘ regular ’ food . ”
Such statements are made by people that truly do not understand the actual value of such foods or the reasons why they can improve the help .
Conversely , they may not know the seriously problematic components associated with eating a diet loaded with processed ingredients .
And there are most definitely a number of serious problems associated with eating non-organic foods loaded with processed chemicals and foreign substances .
To understand why organic food is healthier than processed items , one needs to understand the basic definition of an organic food item .
Basically , this would be a food source that has not been modified or altered from its original , natural state in any way .
It is , instead , presented in its most pure form .
Processed elements are added into non-organic food for a number of reasons .
Probably the most common reason would be to keep the items on the shelf as long as possible .
if they spoiled to quickly , then the product would have to be thrown out which would cost a lot of money to the store .
To prevent such a problem , a number of foreign elements can be added to the mix .
When you eat such foods , you ingest the foreign elements and they can possess a lot of free radicals .
Free radicals do a number of things to the body and the prime thing that they are guilty of is the ‘ theft ’ of electrons from the body ’s molecules .
To say this would have an enormously negative impact on the body would be a serious understatement .
The loss of the molecules can lay the foundation for cancer later in life .
Various other processed items can cause multitudes of negative health problems .
Refined sugar is used to replace natural and organic brown sugar and this leads to huge spikes of glucose in the bloodstream which can lead to diabetes .
And , of course , refined sugars can turn to fat quicker than anything else .
To list the problems that obesity can cause would require several volumes of text to cover .
Meats and poultry that are not organic can come with all manner or hormones and steroids and antibiotics that will be ingested by the humans that end up eating those items on their dinner plate .
From this , all manner of havoc can be wrought on the body .
When your diet is one that is made up of purely organic substances , you will discover that these elements are not present and you will not feel the negative effects of their impact .
And this is most certainly what you will want .
Simply eating a diet that comprises organic foods eliminates a number of the serious health problems that might be incurred when eating processed food sources .
Going organic improves health – that is a fact !

Take that power nap - you could end up smarter
It may not make you popular with your boss but a snooze in the middle of the day dramatically boosts your brain power .
Medical researchers have shown that the power naps favoured by Winston Churchill , Albert Einstein and Margaret Thatcher not only refresh the mind , they also make people smarter .
They found snoozing for just one hour in the day is enough to increase the brain 's ability to learn new facts in the hours that follow .
Medical researchers have shown that power naps not only refresh the mind , they also make people smarter
Dr Matthew Walker , a psychologist at the University of California , who led the study , said : ' Sleep not only rights the wrong of prolonged wakefulness but , at a neuro - cognitive level , it moves you beyond where you were before you took a nap . '
While many people will ridicule the idea of taking 40 winks at lunchtime , some of the most influential people on the planet were keen cat nappers .
Lady
Thatcher claimed she got by on just four hours of sleep each night but had a short sleep in the day , while Bill Clinton famously took a 30 - minute nap after lunch .
Famous daytime dozers also include John F Kennedy , Ronald Reagan and Florence Nightingale .
Many sleep researchers argue that the British habit of trying to stay awake from morning until night is inherently unhealthy .
They point to countries such as Spain where most people traditionally go for a post - lunch siesta .
In the Californian study , the researchers split 39 healthy students into two groups and asked them to carry out a learning task - linking faces with names - intended to tax the hippocampus , the region of the brain that helps store facts .
At 2 pm , half the group took a 90 minute siesta , while the rest stayed awake .
At 6 pm , the students were asked to carry out a new round of learning exercises .
Those who had a siesta performed
much better than those who remained awake throughout the day .
Overall , the nappers improved their capacity to learn in the evening session , the researchers told a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , in San Diego , California .
The researchers say sleep is needed to clear the brain 's short term memory and make room for new information .
' It 's as though the email inbox in your hippocampus is full and , until you sleep and clear out those fact emails , you 're not going to receive any more mail , ' said Dr Walker .
' It 's just going to bounce until you sleep and move it into another folder . '
Using ECG tests of the brain 's electrical activity the scientists found that this memory - refreshing process takes place in a period between deep sleep and the dreaming state known as REM , or rapid eye movement .
The average person spends half their sleeping hours in this transitional sleep period , which is known as Stage 2 non-REM sleep .
' I can't imagine Mother Nature would have us spend 50 per cent of the night going from one sleep stage to another for no reason , ' Dr Walker added .
' Sleep is sophisticated .
It acts locally to give us what we need . '
The same study also found that students who have all - night revision sessions in the run up to exams , reduce the brain 's ability to cram in new facts by a staggering 40 per cent .
EXCLUSIVE : Warner Bros is trying to ready its DC Comics stalwart Superman to soar again on the Big Screen , and the studio has turned to Chris Nolan to mentor development of the movie .
Our insiders say that the brains behind rebooted Batman has been asked to play a “ godfather ” role and ensure The Man Of Steel gets off the ground after a 3 1/2 - year hiatus .
Nolan ’s leadership of the project can set it in the right direction with the critics and the fans , not to mention at the box office .
Besides , Nolan is considered something of a god at Warner Bros and has a strong relationship with the studio after the success of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight .
Though he was n’t obligated to do so , he gave the studio first crack at his spec script Inception , and Warner Bros was able to buy it before other studios even got a sniff .
While Nolan completes that Leonardo DiCaprio - starrer for a July 16th release , he ’s also hatched an idea for Warner Bros ’ third Batman installment .
Now his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan “ Jonah ” Nolan , and David Goyer who co-wrote Batman Begins and penned the story for The Dark Knight , are off scripting it .
( See ‘ FlashForward ’ Showrunner Exits For Features ) .
Legendary Pictures will partner with Warner Bros on the next installment of Superman .
Legendary also co-produced / co - financed Superman Returns in 2006 .
Legendary was partnered with Warner Bros as a co-producer / co- financier on the recent Batman films including Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and will be involved in Nolan ’s 3rd Batman film .
Let us emphasize that Superman 3.0 is in the early stages of development .
And we doubt Nolan would direct .
This would n’t be a sequel to Superman Returns but a completely fresh franchise .
As one of our insiders reassures : “ It would definitely not be a followup to Superman Returns . ”
Nolan coming on board follows a hiatus period for Superman after that 2006 reboot as the studio tried to figure out whether or not to make a sequel to that version starring Brandon Routh directed by Bryan Singer .
As recently as this summer , Warner Bros was still contemplating how to proceed .
That ’s when we were told that “ Bryan or Brandon are not completely out of it yet .
But Warner
Bros does n’t have a handle yet on it , either .
[ Producer ]
Jon Peters is trying to make something happen since he stands to benefit financially .
But they [ the studio ] need to hear a great story that makes sense . ”
Another insider explained to us , “ We know what we do n’t want to do .
But we do n’t know what we want to do .
We learned a lot from the last movie , and we want to get it right this time . ”
Fans have long been yearning for Superman to finally get the big screen Nolan - ized treatment this classic superhero deserves .
Warner Bros clearly has learned from all five Superman movies .
Superman : The Movie and Superman II starring Christopher Reeve and produced by Ilya and Alexander Salkind , were critical , fan , and financial successes .
Their 1983 Superman III was mediocre .
Then came a real dud in 1987 , Superman IV : The Quest For Peace which continued wth Reeves but unfortunately was made by Golan - Globus ’s Cannon Films in association with Warner Bros .
The inbetween period between that pic and 2006 ’s Superman Returns was plagued by long delays and budget troubles and script misses .
In 1997 , original Batman director Tim Burton tried to make a Superman movie starring Nicolas Cage .
Around 2004 , J.J. Abrams wrote a film that was the first leg of a trilogy .
Abrams wanted to direct , but had only directed episodes of his TV series ( and would n’t make his feature directing debut until 2006 ’s Mission : Impossible III .
McG and Brett Ratner separately were attached to that film .
Ratner got closest , but Warner Bros was wary of a budget that swelled to $ 250 million , and which seemed risky after established star Josh Hartnett turned down the 3 - picture deal that could have brought him $ 100 million in salary .
After that , Warner Bros bosses did n’t embrace Ratner ’s s choice of soap opera actor Matt Bomer to star .
Other prominent filmmakers were reportedly in the loop , but Warner Bros never pulled the trigger on the picture until Bryan Singer ’s involvement .
Singer ’s Superman Returns was respectably reviewed for the genre .
But it turned in only $ 52 million opening weekend , and $ 391 million worldwide gross .
Problem was it cost too much ( the budget was reportedly $ 270 million ) , and the promotion was lousy ( Joel Silver was brought in at the last minute to inject macho into the marketing campaign ) .
Worse , it left diehard fans only “ meh ” about a sequel starring Routh .
Singer fared better , but it seems doubtful he ’ll be asked for an encore now .
After all , Singer is now developing the spinoff X - Men : First Class for 20th Century Fox whose bosses were furious when he took on The Man Of Steel reboot instead of helming X - Men 3 .
But Singer and the studio subsequently made peace and he ’s back in the Fox fold and on board .
The restructuring of Warner Bros ’ business with DC Comics became Warner Bros Pictures Group president Jeff Robinov ’s first priority since having his contract reupped by Time Warner last summer .
Problems have plagued the DC Comics - Warner Bros relationship for more than a decade .
But the biggest failure has been to leave the most valuable DC Comics characters in movie development limbo by chaotically starting and stopping development on the high profile live action pics .
Most recently , Warner Bros and DC Comics are finally getting their act together as evidenced by the progress on Green Lantern .
Superman 3.0 would test Warner Bros veteran executive Diane Nelson , the head of DC Entertainment Inc , that new company founded to fully realize and integrate the power and value of the DC Comics brand and characters across all media and platforms into Warner Bros Entertainment ’s content and distribution businesses .
Nelson especially was charged with suping up Superman again because it ’s way too valuable to leave dormant like this .
Besides , the clock is ticking .
Attorney Marc Toberoff , who keeps suing Warner Bros on behalf of creative rightsholders , warns that , in 2013 , the Jerome Siegel heirs along with the estate of co-creator Joe Shuster will own the entire original copyright to Superman — “ and neither DC Comics nor Warner Bros will be able to exploit any new Superman works without a license from the Siegels and Shusters ” .
He ’s also pointed out that , if Warner Bros does not start production on a new Superman sequel or reboot by 2011 , the Siegels could sue to recover their damages on the grounds that the deal should have contained a clause in which the rights returned to the owners after a given time if no film was in development .
The heirs of Siegel have already been awarded half the copyright for Superman .
And in 2013 the heirs of co-creator Joe Shuster get the remaining half .
After that , neither DC Comics nor Warner Bros will be able to use Superman without a financial agreement with the heirs .
There are also stipulations on what parts of the origins story can be used in future Superman movies and which require re-negotiations with the creators ’ heirs or estates .
At first , Warner Bros felt no pressure to rush out another Superman pic .
As Warner Bros chairman Alan Horn told a court hearing about rights to Superman , he hoped to make another Superman movie but no film was in development , no script had been written , and the earliest he foresaw another Superman film released would be 2012 .
He told the judge : “ We had hopes to keep the character alive and to once again reinvent Superman .
Our hope is to develop a Superman property and to try again .
What hurt us is that the reviews and so on for the Superman movie did not get the kind of critical acclaim that Batman got , and we have other issues with Superman that concern us . ”
So Warner Bros is now bringing in Batman ’s saviour .
What Nolan would do with the Superman character and story is intriguing to say the least .
And he has the experience necessary of prepping and pepping a played - out franchise .
The 2005 Batman Begins grossed $ 373 million worldwide on a reported $ 150 million budget .
And of course 2008 ’s The Dark Knight crossed the $ 1 billion worldwide gross mark on a reported $ 185 million budget ( and Heath Ledger posthumously won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor ) .
Batman was rebooted according to Frank Miller ’s film noirish take on Batman .
But there ’s a big difference between Superman ’s cinematic incarnations and comic book version .
Warner Brothers and DC Comics for a long time were n’t sure which version they liked better .
The cinematic version has been squeaky clean , occasionally campy , and has more - or - less unlimited power except when confronted with Kryptonite .
The comic book version has some limits on his powers , can be darker , and fights aliens a lot more .
Shortly after Dark Knight hit it big , fans assumed that Superman would be taken to the “ dark ” side as well .
That ’s because Warner Bros mogul Jeff Robinov stressed post - Dark Knight that “ we have to look at how to make these movies edgier ” .
One of our insiders interpreted this to say : “ He meant more sophisticated . ”
A more comic - accurate Superman seems like the way to go .
No need to worry : Chris Nolan knows what he ’s doing .
The federal government has made clear its strategy for cracking down on potential terrorist attacks in airplanes : more sophisticated scanners and increased scrutiny of passengers at crowded airports .
But now the nation ’s flight attendants say the government needs to ratchet up security measures inside airplanes .
The Assn. of Flight Attendants has been lobbying Congress for the last month or so to adopt its strategy for stronger counter - terrorism measures .
The group hopes that lawmakers will include money to put some of their ideas into action under an upcoming funding bill for the Federal Aviation Administration .
The group , which represents more than 55,000 attendants at 20 airlines , wants to implement a four - point plan :
Advertisement
* Institute mandatory hand - to - hand combat training for all crew members .
* Equip flight attendants with portable communications devices so they can speak to the pilots during emergencies .
* Standardize the size of carry - on luggage so that flight attendants can look for suspicious passengers instead of struggling with oversized bags .
* Shut down onboard wireless Internet during high - threat periods to prevent terrorists from communicating with collaborators on the ground .

“ For better or for worse , once the cabin doors close , the flight attendants are the last line of defense , ” said Corey Caldwell , a spokeswoman for the association .
She pointed out that combat training for flight attendants is now voluntary , with employees who take it attending the lessons on their own time .
A portable communications system would have allowed flight attendants to talk with the pilots during the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas Day , she added .
On that flight from Amsterdam to Detroit , a Nigerian national allegedly tried to ignite an explosive hidden in his underwear .
The nation ’s airlines have not agreed on a maximum size for carry - on luggage because the overhead bins vary in size according to airplane model .
The group suggests the standard size be no bigger than 22 inches by 9 inches by 14 inches -- the same limit already in place at American , Continental and Delta airlines .
Virgin America , Southwest and Hawaiian airlines allow bigger carry - on bags .

“ By having uniform standards , everybody would be on the same page , ” she said .
As for shutting down the onboard Internet , she said the Transportation Security Administration would determine when the airlines are at a high risk for a terrorist attack .
Caldwell said the association has not come up with a price tag for the changes and is not seeking raises for flight attendants as part of the deal .
“ We are not taking on more responsibility , ” she said .
“ We just want more tools to make the plane safer . ”

Reading possible terrorists ’ clues
When it comes to airport security , an Israeli company has proposed an intriguing technology designed to read the minds of would - be terrorists .
WeCu Technologies ( as in “ we see you ” ) claims it has devised a method to identify airline passengers with bad intentions by reading the reactions of passengers to certain “ stimuli . ”
In the system being tested in Israel , projectors at airport terminals would flash different images associated with a certain terrorist group or symbols that only a would - be terrorist would recognize .
Advertisement
The assumption is that people cannot hide their reactions to certain images , just as anyone might react to a photo of a close relative suddenly appearing on a wall .
The technology would use hidden cameras aimed at the passing face to capture and analyze even the most subtle reactions .
Even an averted glance or a slight increase in heart rate could signal a passenger ’s intentions .
If the cameras pick up suspicious looks or movement , the passenger can be pulled aside for further screening .
“ One by one you can screen out from the flow of people those with specific malicious intent , ” WeCu Chief Executive Ehud Given told the Associated Press .
Looking beyond the on - time rates
Advertisement
Because of a steep drop in passenger demand , most airlines are running fewer flights , and as a result are getting in and out of airports on time .
Statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation show that the nation ’s airlines have the best overall on - time arrival rate since 2003 .
But that does n’t make a difference to FlyersRights .
org , an airline consumer rights group that issues an annual airline report card based on different statistics .
In a report card issued last month , the group handed out nearly three times as many F’s as A’s .
Advertisement
According to the FlyersRights report card , JetBlue , Comair and Delta airlines were among 11 carriers that received the worst marks for on - time performance , while Alaska and Hawaiian were among four that earned A’s .
One set of grades was based on the frequency of flights being delayed more than three hours .
The group graded each airline based on delays per total flights .
So , JetBlue got an F for having one flight delayed for every 2,776 flights , while Alaska earned an A for one three - hour - plus delay for every 137,322 flights .
New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport won the dubious distinction of having the most flights -- 195 flights -- delayed more than three hours .
An airline ’s on - time performance has taken on new importance since federal regulators adopted penalties last year for airlines that leave passengers stranded on the tarmac too long .
Advertisement
Under new federal regulations that take effect next month , airlines must give passengers the option to disembark if a flight is stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours .
Airlines that fail to comply could be fined up to $ 27,500 per passenger .
That could amount to $ 5.5 million for a jet carrying 200 people .
Most airline representatives are tight - lipped about how they plan to avoid the fines .
But at least one major U.S. airline has devised detailed plans for every airport to ensure that passengers are unloaded from the plane before the three - hour mark , according to an airline representative .
He asked not to have himself or his airline identified because he was not authorized to speak on the subject .
In cases in which a delayed plane cannot pull back to the terminal because of congestion , he said , the passengers could be asked to climb out of the plane via a portable staircase onto the tarmac .
This could be a nasty scene at Kennedy airport in the dead of winter , he said .
“ It ’s going to be pretty ugly . ”

We wrote about Google 's Liquid Galaxy project back in December , one of the more interesting 20 % projects in which a series of eight LCD panels surround the viewer in a wraparound view of Google Earth or Street View .
We had a chance to get a live demo of the system from its creator , software engineer Jason Holt , who used an off - the - shelf controller device to virtually fly us around the world ( and under the sea ! ) .
Check out the video below ( be cautious if you 're prone to motion sickness ) and let us know what you think :
Would you want this setup in your own home ?
In thinking about what is so compelling about certain new technologies that have emerged in recent years , a common theme is starting to emerge .
The best technologies do n’t just do something useful , but they make the user think about the right things that lead to better designs and more robust software .
Lets start by thinking about some of the most compelling technologies or techniques that have had a lot of buzz in the last couple years :
Dependency Injection
Dependency injection is a great technique for being able to manage coupling .
At least it is in practice .
But there is nothing that would stop you from using dependency injection to , say , create a giant class and inject thirtyteen - hundred dependencies in it and giving yourself a maintenance nightmare .
What is important about dependency injection , is that it makes you think about dependencies .
When I am writing code , I want creating a dependency from one class to another to hurt .
Not a lot , but enough that it makes me put an entry in a file somewhere – be it an xml config , or a module , or something .
A DI tool that wires everything up for me without me having to explicitly think about it each time – well , that is to me like an HR management tool that does not have an “ are you sure ” prompt on the “ fire employee ” button .
Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration tools do some nifty things , one of the most important being providing some visibility to the state of the code .
When properly implemented , the benefits are pretty staggering .
However , in my experience , one of the most important benefits is that Continuous Integration forces you to think about how to automate the deployment process .
You ca n’t continuously integrate if some person has to flip the bozo bit in order for the build to work .
CI promotes a model that makes tools that require human intervention to install seem obsolete .
I ca n’t see this as a bad thing .
Functional Programming
Most anyone who knows me in a professional context knows I am a big fan of functional programming .
I have grown to like the syntax and expressibility of languages like F# , and there are a great many reasons why the language is important .
But to me , the most striking is that functional languages make you think long and hard about state .
You can do state in F# ( through the mutable keyword ) – even in pure functional programming languages like Haskell if you implement a state monad .
But the important thing here is that you have to do significant work to create state in these languages .
That leads to choices about state that tend to be more mindful than in languages where state is the default .
I could talk through more examples , but I think you get the picture .
The opposite tends to hold true as well – my main issue with a technology like ASP .
NET Webforms is that it makes certain things easy ( ViewState , notably ) that it should not , in order to help you avoid having to think about the fact that you are running an application over a stateless medium .
When you are considering a new technology that is emerging – do n’t think features , think “ What choices is this technology forcing me to make ? ”
KBR is still at it .
The defense contractor is now appealing the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a lower court ’s ruling in the case of Jamie Leigh Jones , asking for permission to force Jones and any other sexually assaulted employees into arbitration rather than allowing the victims to seek justice through the courts .
In the petition , KBR says that it will “ vigorously contest Jones ’s allegations ” that she was raped , drugged , beaten and confined to a shipping container by fellow KBR employees while working in Iraq .
The firm accuses her of being a liar and a publicity hound .
KBR ’s callous , five - year fight to keep Jones out of court and confined to one - sided , binding , secret arbitration proceedings shows a company desperate to escape accountability – and should show Congress how desperately legislation to protect Americans ’ access to the civil justice system is needed .
Congress took the first major step in the right direction in December by passing an amendment sponsored by Sen .
Al Franken ( D - Minn. ) that withholds defense contracts from companies that use forced arbitration against employees that have been the victims of sexual assault , harassment or discrimination .
More must be done to broaden the scope of protection from abusive forced arbitration practices .
Two bills now face Congress that would do this :
The bipartisan Arbitration Fairness Act ( S. 931 / H.R. 1020 ) , sponsored by Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) and Rep. Hank Johnson ( D - Ga. ) , which would ensure that the decision to enter arbitration is made voluntary , and the bipartisan Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act ( S. 512 / H.R. 1237 ) , sponsored by Sen. Herb Kohl ( D - Wis. ) and Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - Calif. ) , would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts .
As Slate ’s Dahlia Lithwick writes , KBR ’s petition gives a whole new meaning to the politics of blaming the victim : “ You can holler about trial lawyers all you want , but nobody wants to be told their legal disputes ought to be worked out in secret , off the books , and in dark rooms , just so the justice system can be preserved for other people .
And nobody wants to be called out publicly as a liar before they have found a safe place to try to tell their truth . ”
Kristen Augeri , 23 , and Thomas Way , 22 , face several charges including risk of injury to a child .
It turns out that letting your 3 year old take rips off of your glass pipe is frowned upon .
The fat tub of shit white trash mom tried to defend herself by saying the following :
“ There were just things around that should n’t have been around .
He was n’t smoking anything ”
Is that so ?
I guess when the video evidence clearly shows a 3 year old taking a hit from your pipe , while you were taping it and giggling , it could have just been a jar of bubbles right ?
This is what happens when we let stupid people have sex .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Usually this blog focuses on larger national or international issues , but over the weekend , Long Island in general , and specifically Wantagh where I live , was in the news for two reasons .
First , an evangelical leader in Wantagh took on Glenn Beck who was going after any religion that preached “ social justice ” with a sign .
Frustratingly , though I pass the sign walking back home a few times a week , CNN got the story before I did .
Then , a massive storm hit Long Island .
Driving home on Saturday night was a matter of literally dodging fallen trees and power lines hanging down across the road .
The National Guard was apparently out setting flares and doing emergency work as cop cars blocked off especially dangerous roads and set up flares and emergency tape .
Of course , I decided to go out and take a few pictures , mainly of the massive tree downed in front of Wantagh Elementary School before the rain and wind drove me back indoors :

Sunday morning , I woke up to a tree in my backyard crashing onto the house and snapping :

By Sunday , almost every road was blocked by a fallen tree , including this one just around the block from me on Island Road near Wantagh Avenue :

Walking to work this morning , the tree down in front of Wantagh Elementary was being taken care of , with Channel 12 with a live correspondent there .
( Notice the camera to the right of the picture on a tripod . )
I saw Erin Colton of Channel 12 in her car watching it next to the news van .

Personally , I thought these leaning trees at the train station were a bit more dramatic :

Chris Corradino took some more dramatic photos in the immediate aftermath of properties destroyed ( when I was further east instead of in Wantagh . )
News reports indicate several fatalities around Long Island , but none in Wantagh .
Property damage though is another story .
It always seems like it happens to be those storms you do n’t hear about that actually do the damage – while the ones hyped by the weather stations and local news end up fizzling .

Some analysts attribute the failure to an inherent flaw in the design of the chosen solution  arguing that a cap - and - trade approach is too unwieldy and difficult to put in place .
Moreover , these critics add , the financial crisis that began in 2008 shook the world ’s confidence in the use of any market - based solution .
But there are two big problems with this critique :
First , there is no readily apparent alternative that would be any easier politically .
It is difficult to imagine a globally harmonized carbon tax or a coordinated multilateral regulatory effort .
The flexibility of a global market - based policy  supplemented by regulation and revenue - neutral tax policies  is the option that has by far the best chance of success .
The fact that it is extremely difficult does not mean that we should simply give up .
Second , we should have no illusions about the difficulty and the time needed to convince the rest of the world to adopt a completely new approach .
The lags in the global climate system , including the buildup of heat in the oceans from which it is slowly reintroduced into the atmosphere , means that we can create conditions that make large and destructive consequences inevitable long before their awful manifestations become apparent : the displacement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees , civil unrest , chaos and the collapse of governance in many developing countries , large - scale crop failures and the spread of deadly diseases .
It ’s important to point out that the United States is not alone in its inaction .
Global political paralysis has thus far stymied work not only on climate , but on trade and other pressing issues that require coordinated international action .
The reasons for this are primarily economic .
The globalization of the economy , coupled with the outsourcing of jobs from industrial countries , has simultaneously heightened fears of further job losses in the industrial world and encouraged rising expectations in emerging economies .
The result ?
Heightened opposition , in both the industrial and developing worlds , to any constraints on the use of carbon - based fuels , which remain our principal source of energy .
The decisive victory of democratic capitalism over communism in the 1990s led to a period of philosophical dominance for market economics worldwide and the illusion of a unipolar world .
It also led , in the United States , to a hubristic “ bubble ” of market fundamentalism that encouraged opponents of regulatory constraints to mount an aggressive effort to shift the internal boundary between the democracy sphere and the market sphere .
Over time , markets would most efficiently solve most problems , they argued .
Laws and regulations interfering with the operations of the market carried a faint odor of the discredited statist adversary we had just defeated .
This period of market triumphalism coincided with confirmation by scientists that earlier fears about global warming had been grossly understated .
But by then , the political context in which this debate took form was tilted heavily toward the views of market fundamentalists , who fought to weaken existing constraints and scoffed at the possibility that global constraints would be needed to halt the dangerous dumping of global - warming pollution into the atmosphere .
McDonald 's might need to enlist its Big Mouth Billy Bass Singing Fish , made famous in its TV ads , to " bring back " that fish one impatient customer took at its restaurant in South Brunswick , N.J .
Police said the customer crawled out of his car and into the drive thru window to get his fish sandwich , after slapping the McDonald 's employee in the face .
" His Filet - O - Fish was taking too long at 4:30 in the morning , " said South Brunswick Police Detective Sergeant James Ryan to NBCNewYork .
According to Ryan , the customer yelled at the employee and pushed him against the counter .
" After he slaps him , he takes his food , " said Ryan .
Perhaps suggesting how hungry the suspect was , Ryan said he then threatened the employee by telling him " I 'll be waiting for you when you get off work . "
The police report said the suspect " then walked out of the store with his fish filet sandwich , " went to his car , still parked in the drive thru lane and left .
However , he never came back for the employee , leaving McDonald 's and Bill Bass to wonder if the suspect had ever seen or heard the words to its TV ad " Give me back that Filet - O - Fish , Give me that fish . "

Washington ( CNN ) --
A former high - ranking CIA official who was involved in the Iran - Contra scandal has worked on an alleged ad hoc spy program that the Pentagon is investigating , CNN has learned .
Duane " Dewey " Clarridge -- who was pardoned for his alleged role in the Reagan - era scandal by President George H. W. Bush in the waning hours of his presidency in 1992 -- is using contacts in Afghanistan and Pakistan to obtain information for the Pentagon , according to former government officials familiar with the current program .
They declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue .
The Pentagon has launched an assessment of the roles of at least three contractor companies with more than $ 20 million in contracts , according to Pentagon officials
Defense Secretary Robert Gates wants to know if bounds were overstepped .
He needs " a factual baseline from which to determine whether or not systemic problems exist , " and how to fix them if they do , Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday .
The two - week survey will be led by a small team of senior military and Defense Department officials , he said .
The assessment was prompted by an investigation -- currently under way -- into a program led by Michael Furlong , a Defense Department official who oversaw contracts aimed at gathering information about Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The program was meant to be limited to gathering what is known as " open- source information , " in which publicly available facts are gathered from , for example , local media and public events .
Some of the contractors with the program -- retired CIA officers and former military commandos -- may have instead hired local agents to gather information on the specific locations and movements of particular individuals and passed it along to military officials for possible lethal strikes , according to government officials and private - sector businessmen familiar with the investigation .
Federal laws and regulations generally prohibit contractors from directly engaging in intelligence collection because it is considered a crucial government function .
The Pentagon is seeking to find out both whether the law was violated and whether funds were inappropriately diverted to conduct these alleged operations .
Furlong has denied wrongdoing .
" This is something that I need to know more about , but we do have reviews and investigations going on to find out what the story is here , find out what the facts are , and if it 's necessary to make some changes , I 'll do that , " Gates said Monday .
Documents provided to CNN detail sensitive information that contractors gathered , including word of a meeting between Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's brother and Mullah Baradar , a top Taliban leader who was arrested weeks later in Pakistan .
At another meeting with Taliban commanders , an audio message from the reclusive leader Mullah Omar was played , in which he directed who would lead operations after a key member was captured .
Another document details the comings and goings at a safe house in Kabul , Afghanistan , used by suspected members of the Haqqani insurgent network .
Concern within the Central Intelligence Agency about the contract played a role in prompting the investigation , according to officials .
Rear Adm. Gregory Smith , a spokesman for the U.S. - led force in Afghanistan , told CNN last week that elements of Furlong 's project were not clear .
" There was ambiguity about how they were going to collect information , " he said , and about whether Afghans were to be used to do the work , and how the information might be used .
" None of us were comfortable with what this contract meant .
We wanted to know how they were going to glean information , " Smith said .
Smith said he subsequently terminated Furlong 's effort last year because of his concerns .
He estimates $ 6 million to $ 7 million of the funds allocated were spent and does not know what happened to the balance of the contract money .
Clarridge , the former CIA official allegedly involved in the ad hoc spy ring , worked for the agency for 33 years , heading the agency 's Latin American and European divisions and setting up its Counterterrorist Center in 1986 , according to a Publisher 's Weekly review of his book " A Spy For All Seasons . "
He was indicted in 1991 on federal charges of lying to Congress and the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran - Contra affair , the review says .
Investigators said Clarridge was the man who put then - Marine Col .
Oliver North in charge of sending money and weapons to anti-Communist fighters in Nicaragua in the 1980s , in contravention of congressional mandates .
Clarridge always maintained he was innocent , referring to the scandal as " the Iran - Contra nonsense , " Publisher 's Weekly said .

K-STATE EXPERT SAYS RESEARCH SHOWS TREATMENT FOR VIOLENCE AMONG COUPLES SHOULD CONSIDER BOTH MALE AND FEMALE OFFENDERS , SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THE CHOICE TO STAY TOGETHER
MANHATTAN --
Effectively treating violence among couples should encompass more than treating men separately for power and control issues , according to a Kansas State University expert .
Sandra Stith , a professor of family studies and human services , is an expert in intimate partner violence .
She said research supports treating substance abuse as a means to stopping violence in some situations , while also considering that women can be violent themselves and that some couples choose to stay together regardless of violence in the relationship .
Stith expressed concern about some state standards for domestic violence treatment .
" Some standard requirements use particular models that have no evidence of efficacy at all , " Stith said .
" State treatment requirements are not always based on research but often on ideology and beliefs . "
She 's finding that standards often operate on myths , such as that only men are offenders .
Stith said that because men are more likely to be arrested for violence against a partner , most treatment programs target them .
" In most of our research we find that although women are more likely to be injured by intimate partner violence , both men and women are often violent , " Stith said .
" A lot of communities are just putting female offenders in victim services . "
Although research indicates that many women who are victims are also violent themselves , Stith said there 's been less research on understanding the risk factors and treatment for violent women .
" If the victim services do n't address the woman 's use of violence , then the women are not going to be served as well , " she said .
In 2009 , Stith and Catherine McMonigle , a former student of Stith 's from Virginia Tech , published a study in " Preventing Partner Violence : Foundations , Interventions and Issues , " published by the American Psychological Association , on risk factors for intimate partner violence .
" As a clinician , I do this research because traditional treatment for offenders only focuses on power and control and really does n't look at domestic violence as having multiple causes , " she said .
" If you treat everybody who comes in as having a problem with power and control , you 're missing the boat . "
Stith said this is because offenders also struggle with issues like substance abuse , depression , personality disorders and anger issues .
She said some research has shown that by treating substance abuse , violence decreases for some offenders .
" We really need to do better screening and target treatments to the known risk factors , " she said .
In 2008 , she and Virginia Tech 's Eric McCollum published a study in the journal Violence and Victims that showed how treating carefully screened violent couples together can be an effective part of a community 's larger response , which also includes victim services , offender treatment , law enforcement and the judicial system .
" Sometimes our society 's perspective is that all violent couples should separate , " Stith said .
" But sometimes the reality is that people do n't .
They 're living together and making decisions together .
People think they 're doing the couple a favor by saying they wo n't work with them because there 's been violence and they 're choosing to stay together .
But we try to work with them to develop skills to end the violence rather than assuming they 'll separate . "
Stith leads a program at K - State for high - conflict couples .
" We do know there are skills you can learn , and we have evidence of the positive effect of the work we 've done to help couples who want to learn new skills to deal with conflict , " Stith said .
Stith helps couples improve the way they deal with conflict by teaching them how to take a time out and how to calm themselves down .
She also helps them improve their relationships .
" We do a lot of talking about ways you can hear what somebody you care about says and try to understand what 's going on for them instead of taking it personally , " she said .
" The more personally you take it , the more you 're going to want to be violent or hurtful . "
Stith does the work with advanced graduate student therapists at K - State 's Family Center .
They prefer to work with couples in groups of six , although they also work with one couple at a time .
All participants are screened before joining the Couples Conflict program .

Gov. Rick Perry on Monday pardoned a man who died in prison after serving more than 10 years on a wrongful rape conviction .
Mr. Perry granted the posthumous pardon to Tim Cole after receiving a recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles .
Mr. Cole was convicted of a 1985 rape of a Texas Tech University student in Lubbock .
He was cleared by DNA evidence in 2008 , nine years after he died in prison of complications from asthma at age 39 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A new poll had good news and bad news for Republicans on Wednesday -- they lead Democrats in November congressional elections but would lose if a Tea Party candidate is included on the ballot .
The poll by Quinnipiac University said voters by 44 percent to 39 percent said they planned to vote for a Republican over a Democratic candidate in November , the latest sign of a rebirth of the Republican Party .
However , if there is a Tea Party candidate on the ballot , the Democrat would get 36 percent to 25 percent for the Republican and 15 percent to the Tea Party representative .
The poll was further evidence that the Tea Party movement largely draws from the Republican Party .
It said only 13 percent of American voters say they are part of the movement .
Republicans have been working to find ways to absorb unpredictable Tea Party followers into their fold .
The poll found that 74 percent of Tea Party supporters are Republican or independents who lean Republican , while 16 percent are Democrats or independents who lean Democratic .
The Atlanta Thrashes lost 2 - 1 in Columbus last night and effectively eliminated themselves from playoff contention .
In the seven games following the trade of Ilya Kovalchuk the team won 10 of a possible 14 points to push their playoff odds to 60 % .
That hot stretch was followed up by an ice cold 4 consecutive losses in which the offense completely dried up .
When the the Thrashers were winning the other playoff teams were struggling which helped Atlanta climb up into the 8th position in the standing .
But now the tide has reversed and the other playoff contenders are winning as Atlanta has lost -- which has accelerated the team 's decline .
As the graph above illustrates , the real turning point in the season came not in the last four games , but back in late December / early January when the team went 11 games with just one win and three OT / SO losses .
During that 11 game free fall the Thrashers winning percentage was an expansion quality 23 % .
Even good teams have bad streaks during the long season .
But the Thrashers inability to staunch the bleeding during December was catastrophic to for their playoff hopes .
What went wrong during that 11 game stretch ?
The team kept the shots under control ( 342-349 ) , but were outscored 28 - 49 during that period .
That translates into 2.55 GFA and a 4.45 GAA ( If you throw out the 8 - 1 loss to WSH the team GAA is still a lousy 4.10 )
The offensive efficiency was n't great ( 8.2 Shot % ) but the goaltending really fell apart ( .870 SV % ) .
And that 's really where the season was lost .
The moves and non-moves made at the Trade Deadline contributed almost nothing .
Veterans Maxim Afinogenov , Slava Kozlov and Colby Armstrong were all retained .
Afinogenov had two costly turnovers that contributed directly to the Carolina loss and Armstrong took a penalty that proved very costly in the Nashville .
Deadline acquisitions MacArthur and Artuykhin both scored in the win over the Islanders and then promptly became invisible men .
Chris Chelios was signed and has played just one game but he was on the ice for both goals against and redirected the first goal into the net .
With the benefit of more data it appears that the Thrashers were simply hot after the Kovalchuk trade and now they 're cold .
The team is not as bad as their 4 game losing streak would indicate , nor are they as good as their hot streak after the Kovalchuk trade .
Baring a miracle 6 consecutive win streak , the season is toast and it will soon be time to think about draft position ( 7th overall as of this morning ) and free agency and re-signing RFAs ( Bergfors , Pavelec ) .
This is only the 3rd time in 10 years that the Thrashers have had a realistic shot at the playoffs in March ( qualified just once ) .
Their run should have lasted longer in my opinion , but the team work ethic was very inconsistent for most of the season .
Far too often the team only played hard for half a game or just one period .
They threw away points that were there for the taking .
They should have been in this playoff race until the final days of the season in my opinion .
They had the talent to compete , but lacked the will .
I hope that bothers them as much as it bothers me .
O ver the past year , Prime Minister Stephen Harper has appointed 32 senators , just about enough to seize control of the upper house from the Liberals .
To a man and a woman , the Harper senators have vouched to implement the government 's agenda .
As a result , when Parliament reopens next month , the minority government can expect few extra hurdles to stand in the way of its bills once they have cleared the opposition - dominated House of Commons .
In the future , Harper will also have the leisure to use the Senate as a safe launching pad for legislative initiatives that might be dead on arrival with the opposition majority in the Commons .
Both houses would still have to concur for those to become law but it could be good politics to use the more hospitable Senate to showcase them , especially in the lead - up to an election .
But what if Harper had had his professed wish of an elected Senate – a wish according to a just - released Harris - Decima poll that the Prime Minister shares with a substantial majority of Canadians ?
A look at the fractured federal political landscape suggests that , far from acquiring more control over the legislative destiny of its agenda , the Conservative government would almost certainly have had to give some up .
Sheer logic dictates that achieving a government majority in an elected Senate would be no easier than securing one in the Commons , and certainly harder than crafting one through patronage appointments .
Over the past year , it is hard , for instance , to think of a scenario that would have seen the Conservatives win 32 senatorial seats spread out across Canada .
The pair of vacancies in Newfoundland and Labrador would more likely have gone to the Liberals or the NDP .
Among the eight new senators from Quebec , there might well have been four or five sovereignist members .
Somewhere along the way , the legitimacy card , which has always been the ace up the government sleeve in a showdown with the non-elected Senate , would have been diminished or lost .
For who could say that an elected senator was less representative of voters ' views than an elected minister ?
With a Senate opposition majority bolstered by electoral victories , the risks of legislative gridlock between the two houses of Parliament would be increased rather than the opposite .
Some could argue that the risk of more gridlock attendant to an elected Senate would be a small price to pay to put a check on future prime ministers and future majority governments .
But there are other hidden political costs to the plan .
Take Western Canada , the region where support for an elected Senate runs the highest .
For a rare time in modern Canadian history , the West enjoys a defining influence on the current federal government .
But in the Senate , there are 10 New Brunswick senators for the six allotted to British Columbia , and Alberta and Newfoundland have the same number of senators .
Empowering a Senate that grossly over - represents Atlantic and Central Canada sounds like a sure recipe to blunt whatever clout Western Canada might have on Parliament Hill .
In logic , changing the makeup of the Senate to achieve a more balanced regional mix should be job one for anyone who wants to move to an elected upper house .
But that cannot be accomplished without substantial provincial support and a constitutional amendment – a route that Harper says he is not contemplating .

Until he does , the Conservative promise of an elected Senate is a poison pill both for parliamentary democracy and for Western Canada .

A tipster tells us Ben Maisani was Anderson Cooper 's guest at last night 's Vanity Fair Oscar party .
We turned up this picture that certainly looks like Cooper brought his very private boyfriend to a very public event .
This would mark a big turning point for the glass closeted Cooper , who refuses to acknowledge the relationship or his sexual orientation publicly , but is n't afraid to bring him to one of Hollywood 's most high - profile parties .
Too bad the photographers are in on the conspiracy .
From what we can tell , this is the back of Maisani 's head and it seems the Coop is introducing him to Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld .
The caption by WireImage — the agency that pays the magazine a massive sum each year for exclusive photos of party guests — only has three names and one ends in Cooper and the other two in Seinfeld .
( According to our tipster , Maisani and Cooper were seated at a table with Mary Richardson Kennedy , Aaron Sorkin , Katherine Ross , Ron Howard , Tabitha Soren and Michael Lewis . )
Is this a step out of the closet for Cooper ?
First he purchased a home ( and former firehouse ) with his main squeeze , and now he 's taking him out in public for the first time .

You 're in love .
Now you just need to share the news with the rest of the world !
Experts pin hopes on public to decipher 500 - year - old English inscription discovered in church
What is believed to be the first ever example of English written in a British church has been discovered .
Problem is , no - one can read it .
The 500 - year - old inscription was found on a wall in Salisbury Cathedral , Wiltshire , hidden behind a monument dedicated to an aristocrat .
The faded black lettering was discovered in January but experts have now asked for help from the public in a bid to make sense of the inscription .
The digitally - enhanced image of the inscription on a wall in Salisbury Cathedral Conservator Tom Beattie examines the lettering which was revealed after a 350 - year - old monument was removed
Probe : Dr John Crook has produced a digitally - enhanced image of the text
Conservators came across the writing when they were preparing to clean a 350 - year - old monument to Henry Hyde , a local aristocrat who was ' martyred ' in the English Civil War for his support of King Charles I .
The text on the cathedral 's south aisle wall had been whitewashed over with lime , which is why it is hard to read .
Tim Tatton - Brown , the cathedral ’s archaeologist , said : ' The cathedral ’s conservators quite unexpectedly found some beautifully written English text behind the Henry Hyde Monument on the cathedral ’s south aisle wall .
' It was discovered when the monument was temporarily removed as part of the ongoing schedule of work .
' I originally surmised that the text dated from the 16th century , bearing in mind that the monument was erected soon after 1660 .
' However , our researches now suggest it was written a century earlier and therefore pre-dates the Reformation .
' Study by specialist academics is leaning towards the text being written in the 15th century .
' This was period when English was , for the very first time , being used just occasionally in preference to Latin , which was then " the norm " . '
Sir Henry had been buried there in 1650 after his execution .
The monument was put up in 1660 and refers to him as ending life ' kissing the axe ... to suffer the envied martyrdom of Charles I ' .
The writing was found behind this monument .
It was put up in 1660 and refers to Henry Hyde as ending life ' kissing the axe ... to suffer the envied martyrdom of Charles I '
The inscription was found behind a monument in Salisbury Cathedral
So , what would English have been like in the 15th century ?
The era saw the development – and finally dominance – of an English language that we would recognise today .
Not only were peasants using it , but the ruling class , who were still largely descended from the 1066 Norman invaders , increasingly spoke it too .
Revolutionary : Caxton 's printing press
Middle English , which more closely reflected its Saxon roots than today ’s language , was already used in Parliament ( from the 1360s ) and the royal court ( from King Henry V , who acceded in 1413 ) .
Latin , however , remained the official language of the clergy , making the use of the inscription at Salisbury Cathedral all the more fascinating .
It perhaps reflects a growing confidence in users of the tongue during a time of great upheaval as men from lower levels in society came into positions of power .
The advent of William Caxton 's printing press in the 1470s also led greater standardisation , with more recognisable forms of grammar and syntax .
So , as a wider public became familiar with a standard language , the era of Modern English was truly underway .
Mr Tatton - Brown added : ' My guess is that it is a biblical text , put there in the Elizabethan period when the nave was fitted out with high pews for people to sit in to listen to the " new " sermons preached there .
' Inscriptions of the Bible , the Word of God , would have been written on the inside walls of the building following the Reformation , having been translated into English in Cranmer ’s bible . '
Although in the 15th century the clergy stuck to Latin , English was increasingly spoken by wider society , including the ruling class .
The royal court used the language from 1413 onwards .
Experts in deciphering similar messages have attempt to find the meaning of the inscription but have so far failed .
Dr John Crook , who produced a digitally - enhanced image of the text , said he had found one line which read ' and we are c...' but the rest was illegible .
He added :
There seems to be a phrase but so far we have not been able to work out more .
' If anyone thinks they can identify any further letters from the enhanced photographs , please contact us via the Salisbury Cathedral website .
' The basic questions of what exactly the words are and why the text was written on the cathedral wall remain unanswered .
' It would be wonderful for us to solve the mystery . '
Dr Crook also believes there are likely to be other inscriptions in the cathedral , which have since been lost or painted over .
He said : ' It would be too much of a coincidence that the only one happened to be behind this monument . '
The inscription has now been re-covered by the Henry Hyde monument , as scholars said it would be better protected .
From pole - dancing lessons to baking cupcakes , modern woman thinks she can do it all .
Germaine Greer 's free - thinking female eunuch has been replaced by the desperately self - inventing ' Madonna ' , argues Charlotte Raven , who looks back in shame at the moment in the 1990s when her generation turned its back on feminism
Thanks to a string of celebrity sex stories , the world according to the tabloids has recently been – even more than usual – a sorry place for feminism .
But among the countless snaps – of bikini - clad betrayed wives , distressed mistresses and pneumatic " hostesses " – perhaps the most disturbing was that of Katie Price 's two - year - old daughter , Princess , in heavy makeup , complete with false eyelashes .
Millions have seen it .
The " debate " about it has been staged on all media platforms : on one TV talk show , a woman said she could n't see what all the fuss was about .
Her daughter was a " girly girl " , like Princess .
She " adored " dressing up and posing in front of cameras .
It would be wrong to stop her , would n't it ?
Katie Price 's currency is as high today as when she published her million - selling autobiography in 2004 .
She has generated much outrage in the last few years , but it is nothing compared with her influence .
Her narcissism no longer seems so aberrant .
Women 's belief in specialness and a concomitant sense of entitlement has inflated in line with Price 's most famous assets .
How has it come to this ?
Feminists blame the sexists , Martin Amis et al , which is easy but unfair .
In reality , we can't blame anyone but ourselves .
While Price has been working tirelessly at getting her message across , the thinking women – the writers and journalists – who should have been putting the counter case have been indulging in a variety of " guilty pleasures " – from ogling young men ( Germaine Greer in The Boy ) to drooling over frocks ( Linda Grant in The Thoughtful Dresser ) .
Feminists have become increasingly frivolous , and as such are no match for Price , who is serious about her mission to win over all women to " Team Narcissist " .
Two new exposés of the dehumanising effect of the Price worldview feel like too little too late .
The fantasy world described in Natasha Walter 's Living Dolls : The Return of Sexism , where appearances are everything , has already come to pass .
Today 's young women are right to think they will be judged on how they seem , rather than who they are .
In this context , Kat Banyard 's promise to tell " the truth about women and men " in her new book The Equality Illusion is the promise of a horse - drawn plough in the machine age .
The truth is no longer enough ; she needs a promotional gimmick .
In a recent study of 1,000 British girls ( admittedly by a mobile entertainment company ) , quoted in Walter 's book , 60 % said glamour modelling was their preferred career .
A quarter said they would consider becoming lap dancers .
By all measures , the value map has shifted in Price 's favour .
I 'm sorry to say that we are culpable .
Thinking women have turned their backs on feminism .
This might not have been a disaster if we had remained neutral .
But we , too , have found the governing philosophy of Priceworld compelling .
The fact that our daughters join in should n't come as any surprise .
Their insouciance about the business of striking poses for money has been learned from us .
For too long we 've been channelling rather than challenging Price .
There was a moment in the 90s – I wince to recall it – when women themselves fell in with the view that feminism was unglamorous and inhibiting .
It was cramping our style and even worse , stopping us from shopping !
Middle - class commentators encouraged their readers to embrace their " inner bimbos " .
Their paeans to hair products and sexy knickers read like new lad - mag paeans to tarty women .
Comic exaggeration made it clear that the writers were self - aware – women who " should know better " .
" Looking back , I do n't have many regrets .
I was privileged to live through the era of John Frieda restructuring serum , which revolutionised life for women with curly hair " : the journalist Ruth Picardie , who chronicled her battle with cancer , suggested a pleasurable frisson as she delivered the lines of the " knowing " fashion bimbo .
Irony protected her from criticism – she was simply playing with an alternative value system and could n't be held accountable for its moral shortcomings .
" Cycled to Bayswater to interview dull Australian feminist then cycled to Guy 's for treatment , then to Dickens and Jones for a ' personal beauty consultation ' at the fabulous , fabulous beauty studio . "
Somewhere along Oxford Street , she mislaid the inverted commas .
If any feminists had taken against all this , it might not have got so out of hand .
Unfortunately , the people you might have expected to question these assumptions were dancing around in bra tops .
In my Dolce & Gabbana number , I believed I was free to be what I really really wanted .
Like Tony Blair , I felt I was a person of destiny .
Or , as Geri Spice would have it : " I do n't know what I 'm doing but I 'm going to damn well do it . "
The girlpower we were all getting " into " was in fact a bit of marketing aimed at getting tweens to buy records .
Walter , however , thought it was a real phenomenon .
Her first book The New Feminism , which came out in 1998 , suggested that the sex war had been won .
" As women break down every corridor of power in Britain , we can see that we are in the final stretch of a long feminist revolution that is taking women from the outside of society to the inside , from silence to speech , from impotence to strength . "
Could we ?
Or might this belief have been more to do with fashion than politics .
Victimhood looked very 80s and outré .
There was also an element of laziness .
We simply could n't be bothered to be political .
If we could prove there was no need for it , that would leave more time for deciding between fabulous face creams .
If Walter was right , now was the moment to sit back complacently , filing our nails .
The last bit of the feminist revolution was simply a matter of signing on the dotted line .
" This generation of women is much less likely to experience the feminist 's erstwhile ambivalence about taking on power . "
In this model , power could be taken on , like a mortgage , after due consideration .
Everyone could sign up for it .
Those who chose not to may have had some perverse attachment to their " downtrodden " , " sorry victim " status .
The rest would opt for life as a " laughing , independent , ambitious optimist " , in the manner of Cherie Lunghi ( worryingly , one of Walter 's positive role models ) from the Kenco coffee ads .
In her 1994 book Fire With Fire , Naomi Wolf argued that the impediments to my becoming the Kenco CEO were psychological rather than political .
An old - fashioned feminine reticence about boasting and bullshitting was holding me back .
To combat this , Wolf suggested convening a " power group " in a gorgeous setting with gourmet coffee on tap .
Between sips , my Prada - clad sisters and I would affirm our achievements and discuss ways of making feminism " fun , easy and lucrative " instead of angry and bitter .
As a young journalist in the 1990s – when journalism was having its own moment of hubris – following Wolf 's advice , I tapped into my own reservoir of " unclaimed power " .
No longer whinging about constraints , I seized opportunities and relished the feeling of being mistress of my own destiny .
Earning proper money for the first time , I gave myself permission to spend it on designer outfits and crates of bottled Coke " Classic " .
I never had a bottle opener , so developed the knack of pulling off the cap with my teeth .
As I did so , an Oprahesque voice in my head intoned " You go girl ! "
Wolf said we needed new role models to replace uninspiring " downtrodden " feminists .
Walter plumped for Thatcher on the grounds that she " allowed British women to celebrate their ability not just to be nurturing or caring and life affirming , but also to be deeply unpleasant , to be cruel , to be death dealing , to be egoistic .
It was cathartic for us to acknowledge these possibilities .
Thatcher normalised success . "
I opted for Julie Burchill , a narcissist before narcissism was fashionable .
Our brief relationship was a six - month - long powergroup ( without the gourmet coffee ) , and I emerged from it unchivalrously convinced that I would be the next Graham Greene , rather than the next Julie Burchill .
" You 're the proper writer .
Not a performing seal like moi ! "
It was strange to see other women modelling themselves on Susan Street , the heroine of Burchill 's 1989 novel Ambition .
The book begins at a crime scene .
Street has dispatched her rival " to the big boardroom in the sky with a sexual performance of such singular virtuosity that his heart could n't stand it " .
Street does n't do reticence .
The only thing standing between her and her ambition to become the first woman editor of the Sunday Best is its owner , Tobias Pope .
She agrees to become his sex slave , knowing that she will remain in control and unmoved , even as she 's hanging upside down from the ceiling in a lesbian club in New York .
In these moments of degradation , she 's still experiencing the " ecstasy of success " .
In spite of appearances , she is leading him on .
Her motto is : " When you win , nothing hurts . "
We all started to evince " attitude " .
Like Katie Price doing sexy , we adopted the pose selfconsciously , knowing that it made commercial sense .
Women with balls were de rig .
The launch of the late - night magazine - format Girlie Show on Channel 4 in 1994 convinced us that being " Amazonian " and " in yer face " would pay social and professional dividends .
" Attitude " was sold as a more authentic way of being .
The idea was that women had repressed their sex- loving , gobshite side in the name of feminine propriety .
According to the producer : " Women have always behaved like this – they 've just never done it on the TV before . "
The editor of 90s women 's magazine Frank cast " attitude " positively as the freedom to be pleasure seeking .
The Amazonians were free to do what they wanted .
Those of us who did n't fancy hanging upside down in a lesbian club in New York would get the same head rush at the Boots makeup counter .
After years of aesthetic constraint , we were finally free to sport the nail colour of our choosing .
" Are we perpetuating the beauty myth ? " asked Frank 's editor , Tina Gaudoin .
" Only if you believe Naomi Wolf 's half - baked thesis that we are powerless to make our own decisions about the way we look . "
I wore Chanel 's Night Sky at meetings with editors , aware that much was at stake .
Large contracts were being handed to women displaying attitudinal oomph .
I hoped my nail colour would convey my capacity for reckless candour and a readiness to say the unsayable .
If it did n't I could always pretend it had .
The bars and clubs were full of women lying like men about the size of their promotions .
Everyone was " glinting " , Peter York 's phrase for believing one 's own publicity .
Sad to report , feminism had reneged on its responsibility to present uncomfortable truths .
It had become a mirror of the moment .
Ten years of ego inflation has had a predicable impact .
We are hyperconfident , hypersexual and hypercandid about our readiness to do whatever it takes to secure top billing .
We 're still longing to experience the ecstasy of success .
This feels elusive , even to those at the top of the professional ladder .
Wolf would be disappointed to see female CEOs fantasising about the moment when they will be elevated to the next level .
" What women want " is no longer a mystery .
In our age , it is n't a fulfilling job or happy home life , but promotion in the broadest sense .
The heroine of India Knight 's novel My Life on a Plate , published in 2000 , models herself on Madonna .
In times of personal crisis , she asks : " What would Madonna do ? " , confident that this will give her the right answer .
The novel 's popularity suggests women identified with the heroine 's belief that " all we need is to feel like Queens on Thrones all the time " .
The queenly aspect of modern woman – the sense that she is meant for better things – could be described as Madonnaesque .
The pop star 's lifelong commitment to getting to the next level reinforces her fans ' belief that it 's possible and desirable to " reinvent " your world , as well as yourself , to match your inflated self - image .
Her failure to smile once during the whole 40 - year process suggests that this form of self - advancement is as enjoyable as suffragism was for Emily Wilding Davison .
Instrumentalism has taken over from romanticism as the governing female philosophy .
Madonna - ised woman sees everything , and everyone , as a means to her end .
She views her body instrumentally : the " hypersexualisation " of women noted by Walter in Living Dolls has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with self - marketing .
Everyone is constantly orgasming , yet they 've never seemed less convincing .
They are n't fake , but phoney , a form of spin .
They are meant to be overheard , conveying empowerment .
A recent interview with sex blogger Zoe Margolis portrayed her as an icon of liberation .
But Walter does n't fall for this : in the 90s she was happy to take women at their own account , believing their assessment of themselves as empowered - women - of - the - 90s , but not today .
Living Dolls is more sceptical than The New Feminism .
Interviewees ' claims to be happily promiscuous , porn- loving , sex - texting women - of the - noughties are properly scrutinised this time , and her accounts of the emotional and psychological costs of this way of life are plausible and compelling .
But she 's less convincing about the causes of the phenomena of " hypersexualisation " and " exaggerated femininity " , so named , I imagine , because she could n't use " hyper " twice .
Walter puts " hypersexualisation " down to a rise in sexism– not the old - fashioned sort but something more sinister that never quite comes into view .
The second half of her book explains the return of traditional femininity as a result of a greater belief in determinism .
She is right to point out that we no longer believe in conditioning , but surely wrong to say this belief has been supplanted by essentialism – a belief in innate differences between the sexes .
The Madonna - ised woman views femininity as a tool for getting what she wants , whatever that may be .
In this moment , it is more or less compulsory for intelligent women to reveal a passion for baking cupcakes .
The domestic goddess is a pose , not a reversion to old - style femininity .
Now that " attitude " is out and old - fashioned feminine virtues are " in " , so Madonna - ised woman is ready to reveal that cake - making is her number one " guilty pleasure " .
The young girl 's penchant for pinky " girliness " reflects not a belief in essential femininity but an early brand awareness .
Her belief that the pickers on the next level favour " girliness " is reinforced by everything she sees .
Today 's girly is n't passive , but sassy and self - defining .
Completely sold on the myth of " self - invention " , today 's woman believes herself in control of her life , from birth to the present day .
There 's no governing philosophy , just an urge to assert her will .
She does n't know what she 's doing , but she 's damn well doing it .
Anyone who challenges or questions her will get short shrift , even our own children .
A slew of motherhood memoirs portray the baby as a " rival consciousness " .
This memorable phrase was coined in Rachel Cusk 's A Life 's Work .
Cusk 's nuanced portrayal of maternal ambivalence was read one way by those seeking support for their perception of motherhood as an endless bad hair day .
Mothers are now more able to portray themselves as victims of their children .
Brett Paesel says she was prompted to write her memoir Mommies Who Drink by the silence around motherhood and women 's unwillingness to bear witness to their subjugation , " which feels like complaining " .
No one dares convey the rage evoked by the maternal requirement to put someone else 's needs above their own ?
None except Stephanie Calman , author of Confessions of a Bad Mother ; Kate Long , author of The Bad Mother 's Handbook ; Mel Giedroyc , author of Going Ga Ga – Is There Life After Birth ?
and so on and on .
These controlling mothers seem to feel wronged by the autonomy of the people in their orbit .
The fact that their children are separate beings with their own beliefs and habits seems like a dreadful affront .
Female confessional writers seldom pay much mind to how it feels to be them .
Far from being a golden age of female self - expression , this is the opposite .
Real self - expression requires dialogue .
With the other point of view excluded , candid authors are communicating nothing .
Madonna - ised woman believes she should have everything , like the women from Sex and the City , with everything defined as every possible dress and sexual permutation .
The teenagers interviewed in Living Dolls say things like : " We were saying that one week we should go out and try to notch up as many lovers as we can , with the most variety possible – age , gender , jobs . "
They might be mortified to find these very omnipotent fantasies enacted , page by lurid page , in Madonna 's book Sex , 18 years ago .
Many of them maintain a Price - like carapace of invulnerability .
They are winning , they believe , so nothing hurts .
Unable to evaluate risk , they see no reason not to go out to a drinking barn in their underwear , or appear in a college - run porn mag or have sex with everyone they can .
Sex diarist Belle de Jour has claimed that nothing in her background had any bearing on her decision to become a prostitute .
On her website her father 's recent public admission that he'd slept with dozens of prostitutes during her adolescence was denied any importance .
The facts were not disputed .
She just does n't want anyone thinking they impaired her ability to freely choose sexual slavery , à la Susan Street , while still calling the shots .
This belief has made women reckless .
Belle 's assertion in one of her memoirs that she became a prostitute because she " could n't remember the reasons not to " suggest that she has forgotten , or more likely repressed , the physical and psychological risks .
Paradoxically , this generation of women is more vulnerable than any of its forbears .
Women 's refusal to acknowledge any weakness has made them easy prey .
Happily , Kat Banyard is on hand to remind them of the bad things that do happen .
The Equality Illusion is a dose of feminist commonsense .
Banyard does n't think we need new words for things , or a " new feminism " .
She reminds me of the feminists I knew at university : angry in just the right measure .
I 've a hunch she did n't serve cupcakes at her book launch .
Refreshingly , she does n't flinch from portraying as victims the people bad things happen to .
The Equality Illusion provides a useful corrective to the Belle - sponsored myth of free will .
" Between 50 and 75 % of women in prostitution in the UK begin selling sex acts before they are 18 years old . "
Many prostitutes were abused as children or " fucked up " by other means .
" I was basically too fucked up for work , " one woman tells Banyard .
" And I knew it , so when I saw an ad in the paper for escorts , there seemed little choice .
I figured I was really fucked up about men and had been truly fucked over by them , and did n't trust them an inch so might as well make some money from it .
This was not a free ' choice ' .
It was the opposite .
I needed money , but was a mess .
Where else do they greet you with such open arms in such a state as the sex industry ? "
During the 90s , according to a Home Office report , the number of men paying for sex in the UK doubled ; there are now an estimated 80,000 women involved in prostitution and 921 brothels in London .
The industry 's efforts to make it seem like a normal leisure pursuit , rather than a form of abuse , appear to be paying off .
It is n't .
Banyard 's interviewee had recently been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder – a common psychological " side effect " of prostitution .
One symptom of this was disassociation , protective in the first instance , then destructive if you can't stop doing it .
The teenage interviewees in Living Dolls are already adepts at this and rather pleased with themselves to have found a way of avoiding the emotional costs of promiscuity .
The Equality Illusion is full of grim statistics illustrating pay differentials and the point that poverty often has a " female face " .
As Banyard demonstrates , it is n't difficult proving that women are more oppressed than ever ; the difficulty now is getting them to admit it .
Natasha Walter can't quite .
Living Dolls does an excellent job of exposing the brutal reality behind the sex industry 's increasingly sophisticated façade .
It reads much more convincingly than The New Feminism ; she 's describing something real .
Yet , when it comes to it , she still can't say that any of these things are wrong : " There is , of course , nothing intrinsically degrading or miserable about women pole dancing , stripping , having sex with large numbers of partners or consuming pornography .
All these behaviours are potentially enjoyable , sexy and fun . "
Yet even in her own portrayal , there clearly is something intrinsically degrading and miserable about pole dancing .
It 's not about sex , says one of her interviewees , but the illusion of power .
Each man wants to believe the no-touching rule has been breached for his exclusive benefit .
If women were liberated , pole dancing would n't exist .
Why not condemn it outright ?
Walter seems frightened of sounding square – as if she 's bought into the idea that a taste for porn is a badge of sophistication .
She may also be scared of causing offence , possibly justifiably .
Women have never been as touchy and as unwilling to accept criticism .
Her reluctance to condemn may spring from an anxiety about being judgmental or from a fantasy about having everything .
Like her interviewees , she does n't want to rule anything out .
In the end , she does n't want to be the person who 's limiting women 's choices .
In the last decade , choice has become an ideology .
Walter 's solution to the conundrum of how to respond to the sex industry 's successful rebranding as a chic lifestyle choice is to make more wholesome " choices " seem equally alluring .
To rebrand them , in other words .
As things stand , " we can see that certain choices are celebrated while others are marginalised " .
All that needs to happen is for these " marginal choices " to be " celebrated " .
Will her strategy work ?
We 've seen it in operation in repeated attempts to challenge the dominant ideal of beauty .
Gok Wan 's celebrations of cellulite always precede suggestions about how to conceal it effectively .
Beth Ditto's body may look like a good example of a " marginal " choice made mainstream by a process of reclamation , but like every other cover girl she is styled in accordance with the current aesthetic orthodoxy .
Her image on the cover of Pop magazine was manipulated , apparently , to make her bigger .
Today the pickers on the next level like extreme looks , and Ditto is fortunate to conform to their hyperbolic tastes .
The Pop cover is fashion .
Like all fashion images , it makes normality seem risible .
It 's a good moment to reread Betty Friedan 's The Feminine Mystique .
Its reissue feels timely .
In the 50s , as now , the early gains of feminism had been squandered by a generation who thought it unglamorous and inhibiting .
Friedan was recording a postwar period of reaction when women sought refuge in a form of conventional femininity .
With nostalgia she recalls the period during the early part of the century when women such as Amelia Earhart offered a glorious go - faster modernism in place of feminine passivity and female icons were complex - looking rather than merely beautiful .
I feel the same when looking back to the 1970s .
The free - thinking , life - loving , desiring person described in Greer 's The Female Eunuch now seems a historical figure .
In her place , we have Madonna - ised woman grinding out routines in front of a mirror , with her eyes asking " am I hot ? "
Her whole being is directed at self - advancement , yet she is as incapable of real fulfilment .
Her ambitions have been curtailed , just like Friedan 's housewife .
How very far this creature is from the feminist ideal .
In spite of what is now claimed , feminism has never been about empowerment through choice .
You can't simply opt for power – power is n't a fridge or an elliptical training machine .
Any strategy in this consumerist register is doomed to fail .
Friedan did n't worry about offending her audience .
She described the destruction wrecked by the " happy housewife " on her miserable husband and progeny .
With no life of her own , she lives vicariously through them , stunting their emotional growth and preventing them from taking on the responsibilities of adulthood .
It 's hard to imagine Madonna - ised woman having an " ah ha " moment reading something that anatomised her flaws .
Any representation of the damage she is doing to her loved ones and herself will be angrily rebuffed , along with any accompanying advice about " getting other interests " or " putting baby first " .
Putting baby 's needs ahead of our own , with no quid pro quo , seems as silly to us as Friedan 's suggestion that the 50s housewife would benefit from putting herself first .
I remember that T - shirt we used to wear in the 70s which featured Thatcher and the slogan " We are all prostitutes " , meaning exploitation was a universal fact .
At that time it was thought clever to display some awareness of the social and psychological forces underpinning your actions .
Now we think the opposite .
Even prostitutes are insulted by the suggestion that they are not free agents , defining the terms of engagement .
If awareness returned – if modern woman were no longer disassociating from her pain and victimhood – all her decisions would be different .
The things that hurt us would never seem " potentially enjoyable " .
We would n't wear silly shoes , blog about our sex life , worry that our babies are upstaging us .
Most importantly , we 'd resist the temptation to caricature ourselves .
We 'd lose the Nigella - esque pinny , the Price - esque lash extensions ; the Belle - esque pose of erotic empowerment would seem inhibiting .
We 'd recover our desire for the missionary position with the person lying next to us .
In every sphere of existence we'd be free to choose normality .

How will people remember 2013 ?
As the year of the government shutdown ?
The year the N.S.A. revealed that the enemy is us ?
The year Miley Cyrus absolutely , positively stopped playing an adorable child actress ?
In consumer tech , we may remember this as the year Bluetooth speakers finally outnumbered insects on the earth .
Every company and its brother has been cranking out compact , colorful , battery - powered wireless speakers .
And no wonder : these things really are awesome .
Every time some company offers a new tablet , laptop or phone , you can bet that it has a better , sharper , brighter screen — but what about the sound ?
It ’s stuck in 2004 : tinny and weak .
A Bluetooth speaker neatly remedies that enormous quality difference between audio and visual .
The Jawbone Jambox was one of the earliest hits .
It ’s a sharp - edged rectangular box , $ 150 , that comes in a choice of colors .
It pumps out surprisingly loud , clear sound — for its size , which is 6 by 1.6 by 2.8 inches .
Then came the Big Jambox , a shoebox - size $ 300 version with big enough sound for a backyard .
And now comes the Jambox Mini , at $ 180 .
I love this thing .
It ’s actually not all that mini ; in fact , it ’s about as long and tall as the original ( 6.1 by 2.3 inches ) — but it looks like someone sliced the original in half with a saber .
