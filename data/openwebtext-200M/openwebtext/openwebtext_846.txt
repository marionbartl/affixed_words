President Barack Obama 's administration is considering sending a letter to Iran aimed at unfreezing US - Iranian relations and opening the way for face - to - face talks , the Guardian has learned .
The US state department has been working on drafts of the letter since Obama was elected on November 4 .
The letter would be in reply to a lengthy one of congratulations sent by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on November 6 .
Diplomats say Obama 's letter would be a symbolic gesture to mark a change in tone from the hostile one adopted by the Bush administration , which portrayed Iran as part of an " axis of evil " .
It would be intended to allay the suspicions of Iran 's leaders and pave the way for President Obama to engage them directly , a break with past policy .
State department officials have written at least three drafts of a letter that gives assurances that Washington does not want to overthrow the Islamic regime , but merely seek a change in its behaviour .
The letter would be addressed to the Iranian people and sent directly to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , or released as an open letter .
One draft proposal suggests Iran should compare its relatively low standard of living with that of some of its more prosperous neighbours and contemplate the benefits of losing its pariah status in the West .
Although the tone is conciliatory , it also calls on Iran to end what the US calls state sponsorship of terrorism .
The letter is being considered by the new secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , as part of a sweeping review of US policy on Iran .
A decision on sending it is not expected until the review is complete .
In an interview on Monday with the al - Arabiya television network , Obama hinted at a more friendly approach towards Iran .
The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said today he was waiting patiently to see what the Obama administration comes up with .
" We will listen to the statements closely , we will carefully study their actions and if there are real changes , we will welcome it , " he said .
Ahmadinejad , who confirmed he will stand for election again in June , said it was unclear whether the Obama administration was intent on just a shift in tactics or was seeking fundamental change .
He called on the US to apologise for its actions against Iran over the last 60 years , including US support for a 1953 coup that ousted the democratically - elected government and the US shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 .
US concern over Iran is mainly over its uranium enrichment programme , which Washington claims is intended to provide the country with a nuclear weapons capability .
Diplomatic moves are given increased urgency by fears that Israel might take unilateral action to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities .
The state department refused to comment today on options under review .
But diplomatic sources said lots of options were under review about how to signal to the Iranians that there is a change in attitude in Washington and that Obama is looking for direct talks .
One of the chief Iranian concerns revolves around suspicion that the US is engaged in covert actions aimed at regime change , including support for separatist groups in areas like Kurdestan , Sistan - Baluchestan and Khuzestan .
The state department has repeatedly denied there is any US support for such groups .
The Bush administration , in its dying days , was planning to open a US interests section in Tehran , one step down from an embassy .
The former secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said it never happened because attention was diverted by the Russian invasion of Georgia .
Others say that right - wingers in the Bush administration mounted a rearguard action to block it .
The idea has resurfaced but if there are direct talks with Iran , it may be decided that a diplomatic presence would obviate the need for a diplomatic mission in Tehran , at least in the short term .
While Obama is taking the lead on Iran policy , the administration will shortly announce that Dennis Ross will become a special envoy to Iran , following the appointments last week of George Mitchell , the veteran US mediator , as special envoy to the Middle East and Richard Holbrooke , who helped broker the Bosnia peace agreement , as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Ross , who served in the Clinton administration in a leading role in the Middle East peace talks , will be responsible on a day to day basis in implementing Iran policy .
In a graphic sign of Iranian mistrust , the hardline newspaper Kayhan , which is considered close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has denounced Ross as a " Zionist lobbyist " .
Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst , said a US letter would have to be accompanied by security guarantees and an agreement to drop economic sanctions .
" If they send such a letter it will be a very significant step towards better ties but they should be careful in not thinking Tehran will respond immediately , " he said .
" There will be disputes inside the system about such a letter .
There are lot of radicals who do n't want to see ordinary relations between Tehran and Washington .
To convince Iran , they should send a very clear message that they are not going to try and destroy the regime . "
Soldiers were sent to the barracks seized by mutinous border guards A mutiny by border guards in Dhaka has spread to towns outside the Bangladeshi capital , reports say .
Heavy gunfire has also resumed at the border guards barracks in Dhaka , where the troops had begun laying down their arms after a day of violence .
Nearly 50 people are thought to have died on Wednesday as the Bangladesh Rifles ( BDR ) staged an armed mutiny , said to be over pay and conditions .
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is due to address the nation later .
What she says will have a critical impact on how this crisis is resolved , say the BBC's Mark Dummett in Dhaka .
The government had offered the paramilitary troops a general amnesty , and the prime minister has promised to look into their grievances .
Blocked road
There are reports of rank and file soldiers seizing control of their barracks and camps in at least 12 different towns and cities since early on Thursday .
The BDR has 40,000 men stationed at 42 camps across the country .
In some cases , the border guards have taken their officers hostage , and in others they have forced them to leave , reports say .
Some mutineers told the BBC that they had taken up arms over fears that regular army units had been ordered to disarm them .
There are unconfirmed reports of gunfire in the main port city of Chittagong , at Feni , on the eastern border with India , in Rajshahi in the north west , and Sylhet in the north .
A man claiming to be a BDR soldier in Chittagong said they had opened fire to prevent regular army units from entering their camp , unconfirmed reports say .
Another report said similar incidents had occurred at Cox 's Bazaar and Feni .
In Khulna in the south , border guards have reportedly blocked a road , but no shooting has taken place .
The police chief in the north - eastern Moulivibazar district told the AFP news agency that the border guards were " firing indiscriminately " .
Bangladesh becomes battle zone " Their commanding officer told me that he has fled the camp . "
There are no reports so far of any casualties in these reported incidents .
The mutineers seized the military barracks in the Pilkhana area of Dhaka on Wednesday morning , reportedly taking more than 100 people hostage .
Officials said there were unconfirmed reports that nearly 50 people died .
Speaking on Wednesday , one of the mutineers in Dhaka told the BBC that the guards had had to take up arms to resolve problems with their officers .
" Our families might suffer because of what we have done , but they have been exploiting us for more than 200 years , " the man said .

# Bundle all the files needed to build a LaTeX document # # By Scott Pakin , scott+bdoc@pakin.org # #########################################################
Description ----------- bundledoc is a post - processor for the snapshot package that bundles together all the classes , packages , and files needed to build a given LaTeX document .
It reads the .dep file that snapshot produces , finds each of the files mentioned therein , and archives them into a single .tar.gz ( or .zip , or whatever ) file , suitable for moving across systems , transmitting to a colleague , etc .
As an added bonus , this distribution includes a small script called arlatex .
arlatex is a LaTeX - specific archiving program that combines a bunch of files into a single . tex file .
When the .tex file is run through latex , all of the original files are recreated and the LaTeX document is built .
bundledoc can be easily configured to use arlatex as its archiver in place of tar , zip , etc. Files ----- -rwxrwxr-x 1 pakin users 9978 May 22 2018 arlatex -rw-r--r-- 1 pakin users 10262 Sep 6 22:21 arlatex.1 -rw-r--r-- 1 pakin users 33296 Sep 6 22:26 arlatex.pdf - rwxrwxr-x 1 pakin users 31263 Sep 7 23:17 bundledoc -rw-r--r-- 1 pakin users 23351 Sep 7 23:18 bundledoc.1 -rw-r--r-- 1 pakin users 49713 Sep 7 23:18 bundledoc.pdf -rw-rw-r-- 1 pakin users 342 Jan 22 2014 miktex.cfg -rw-r--r-- 1 pakin users 4435 Sep 7 23:18 README -rw-r--r-- 1 pakin users 248 Aug 24 2014 texlive-unix-arlatex.cfg -rw-rw-r-- 1 pakin users 230 Apr 9 2010 texlive-unix.cfg Requirements
------------ bundledoc and arlatex are both Perl scripts , so you naturally need Perl installed on your system .
bundledoc relies on the snapshot package , which is available from CTAN ( http://www.ctan.org).
Before running bundledoc , you must have used snapshot to produce a dependency list for your document .
Finally , bundledoc requires that you have some program for archiving a bunch of files into a single file ( e.g. tar , shar , zip , or arlatex ) and some program that can search your TeX tree(s ) for a given file ( e.g. , kpsewhich or initexmf ) .
Installation ------------
Installation is fairly flexible .
The bundledoc and arlatex scripts should be put somewhere in your executable search path ( e.g. , /usr / local / bin on a typical Unix - like system ) .
The Unix man pages , bundledoc . 1 and arlatex .1 , should be put in the corresponding man directory ( e.g. , /usr/local/man/man1 ) -- or discarded , if you 're not on a Unix - like system and therefore have no interest in having a man page .
The *.cfg files can go anywhere -- just do n't forget where you put them . ;-)
I guess I 'd recommend .../ texmf/tex/latex/bundledoc ( where " ... " is /usr / share or wherever your TeX tree is rooted ) , assuming your TeX distribution follows the TDS directory structure ( meaning , it * has * a .../ texmf /tex/latex directory ) .
bundledoc.pdf and arlatex.pdf are pretty - printed PDF versions of bundledoc . 1 and arlatex . 1 and can also go anywhere .
If you want printed documentation , these PDF files will give the nicest results .
Just note that they 're formatted for U.S. Letter - sized paper , so you may need to scale them slightly to print on A4 paper .
Note that it 's possible to produce documentation in other formats .
The bundledoc and arlatex scripts contain documentation in POD format .
You can therefore extract the documentation into your favorite format -- LaTeX , HTML , plain text , etc. -- using the various pod2*** tools that come with Perl .

Diebold has released a security fix for its Opteva automated teller machines after cyber criminals apparently broke into the systems at one or more businesses in Russia and installed malicious software .
Diebold learned of the incident in January and sent out a global security update to its ATM customers using the Windows operating system .
It is not releasing full details of what happened , including which businesses were affected , but said criminals had gained physical access to the machines to install their malicious program .
" Criminals gained physical access to the inside of the affected ATMs , " Diebold said in its security update .
" This criminal activity resulted in the operation of unauthorized software and devices on the ATMs , which was used to intercept sensitive information . "
The break - in occurred in Russia and affected " a number " of machines , said DeAnn Zackeroff , a company spokeswoman .
" The incident was a low - tech break - in to the ATM , but they had a high - tech knowledge of how to install the virus , " she said .
Diebold did not say exactly how the criminals were able to install the software on the systems , but its security update advises customers that there are several factors that can increase the risk of such a hack .
They include using administrative passwords that have been compromised ; not using the locked - down version of Windows that Diebold provides ; or misconfiguring the Symantec firewall software that comes with the ATMs .
After studying samples submitted to the VirusTotal Web site , security vendor Sophos reported Tuesday that the code has been in circulation since at least November 2008 .
Whoever wrote the malware , called Troj / Skimer - A by Sophos , probably had an insider 's knowledge of the Diebold ATMs , said Vanja Svajcer , a Sophos virus researcher .
" It uses quite a lot of functions that are not documented , " he said .
The software replaces files in the Diebold folder , looks for printer and screen data , and scans for transactions in Ukrainian , Russian and U.S. currencies , he said .
Troj / Skimer - A does not spread from computer to computer like a virus , however .
The criminals have to gain access to an ATM 's internal computer to install the code , Svajcer said .
" You have to have physical access to install the malware on the machine , which is not an easy thing to do . "
Sophos has not seen this type of ATM malware before , but cyber criminals are always hungry for payment card information and have been turning to increasingly sophisticated tricks in order to get it .
In the past few months there have been breaches at at least two major credit - card processing companies , and criminals have been known to install card skimming hardware on bank machines to steal payment card numbers , along with miniature cameras that capture passwords .
Last fall , the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that an organized crime syndicate had tampered with hundreds of payment card scanners , programming them to send payment card numbers over mobile - phone networks .
" This is just another example of the growing level of sophistication and aggression when it comes to ATM - related crime , " Zackeroff said .
Practical and prophetic , particular and poetic , and entirely personal , this is how I would describe Our Life in Gardens .
Composed of nearly 50 essays arranged in alphabetical order , the book is termed by its authors a “ gypsy trunk of this and that . ”
I ’d think of it more as an old - time curiosity cabinet , a curio full of treasures to be pulled out and carefully savored , one by one .
Part memoir , and part garden how - to , it is a completely engaging book to enjoy , perhaps while sitting in a favorite chair in the garden on a sunny afternoon , or by the fire on a cool , wet day , when gardening might be more of an intellectual pursuit .
Our Life in Gardens is co-authored by Joe Eck and Wayne Winterrowd , founders of the Vermont garden design firm North Hill .
They are also the authors of two other collaborative works , including A Year at North Hill : Four Seasons in a Vermont Garden and Living Seasonally : The Kitchen Garden and the Table at North Hill .
( Each has also written books individually ) .
North Hill , which is a primary topic – but not the exclusive subject – of this book , is the creation of nature fostered by Eck and Winterrowd .
It is regarded by many people as one of the finest private gardens in the United States .
This book reads like an iterative conversation occurring during a friendly visit , incorporating a fine meal , and an informative ( and informed ) walk around the garden at North Hill .
Through the course of reading , I often felt as if I were in the garden with Eck and Winterrowd .
While the book is co-authored , it appears to be penned in a single , unified voice , the result perhaps , of the authors ’ lifetime of shared personal and professional experiences , many of which have occurred within the context of the gardens they have cultivated together .
But the book is also a highly practical gardening guide , which provides incredible detail about different kinds of plants and Eck and Winterrowd ’s experiences with cultivating them .
The authors are incredibly observant and provide much valuable information about garden design , as well .
Descriptions are complete , Latin names are given , and the illustration provided at the beginning of each essay is handsomely rendered .

As I read , I was with Eck and Winterrowd as they enjoyed their early gardening efforts in a “ grand ” apartment located at 89 Beacon Street , across from the Public Garden , sharing their joy in the chickens they raised there .
( Chickens in a Beacon Street apartment … see , you must read the book ) .
I learned about their Xanthrorrhoea Quadrangulata , an Australian native they acquired during a visit to the Los Angeles Arboretum , and which has grown into “ a great potted ox of a plant ” at their home in Vermont .
They note and carefully ( lovingly ) describe the growth of individual plants , including a Japanese apricot , the way I note and describe the growth of my daughter .
The garden is a place where much life flourishes , but there is also death .
Eck and Winterrowd write here about the ephemeral nature of gardens ; a topic I , as a writer - gardener , have also been writing about of late .
There is a certain poignancy to Eck and Winterrowd ’s perspectives on the passage of time , an intimacy that is both heart warming and heart rending , the sharing of something as personal as a garden made together …a life made together .
Eck and Winterrowd have produced an extraordinary book that provides valuable and practical information about any number of plants , and about gardens , their design , and their value in our lives .
This book moved and humbled me , because of its incredible combination of all things practical and the personal experiences it shares .
For the authors have written with an authentic voice about the sacred and ordinary act of gardening , about home , their favorite tools and things , domestic life , vocation and avocation , seasons , and journeys they have taken , together .
Eck and Winterrowd understand something key that draws so many of us into gardening : that fact that “ gardens are infinitely imaginable . ”
But Eck and Winterrowd have also provided a window into the other kinds of journeys that we as gardeners take when we carefully , lovingly cultivate gardens , stepping into possibility , the journeys of the heart that all true gardeners – and those who aspire to garden – know .

Goldman Sachs got its bailout .
Now some of its bankers , those aristocrats of Wall Street , apparently need a bit of a bailout too .
Goldman , which accepted billions of taxpayer dollars last fall and , as learned Sunday , was also a big beneficiary of the rescue of the American International Group , is offering to lend money to more than 1,000 employees who have been squeezed by the financial crisis .
The loans , offered via e-mail last week , could range from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands .
Working at Goldman has long been regarded as a sure path to riches .
But Goldman ’s employees are losing money on their personal investments  particularly in Goldman ’s own elite investment funds , which have been considered one of the perks of working at the bank .
Now these funds have stumbled , and some Goldman employees who financed their gilded lifestyles by borrowing in good times are suddenly short on cash needed to meet commitments to their personal investments in the funds .
“ It ’s a problem with the culture of spending , ” said Gustavo Dolfino , the president of Whiterock Group , a Wall Street recruitment firm .
“ No matter how much you have , you spend like you have a lot more . ”
Space shuttle Discovery approaches the ISS to dock ( Live Video )
The space shuttle Discovery is moving closer to the International Space Station ( ISS ) for a 220 - mile - high linkup .
The shuttle and its seven member crew are due to arrive at 5:12:46 P.M. ( Eastern Daylight Time ) .
According to NASA , the shuttle was 1,310 miles ( 2,100 kilometers ) out as of 11:54 A.M. and was gaining on the ISS by about 600 miles ( 965 kilometers ) with every 90 - minute orbit .
After its first launch attempt was postponed due to a hydrogen leak , Discovery and its astronauts lift off at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida Sunday ( March 15 ) .
Its mission is to deliver the final piece of the ISS power system .
The crew includes Koichi Wakata , a Japanese astronaut who will become that nation ’s first resident crew member .
He will replace NASA ’s Sandy Magnus on the station .

SSD ’s , Journaling , and noatime / relatime
On occasion , you will see the advice that the ext3 file system is not suitable for Solid State Disks ( SSD ’s ) due to the extra writes caused by journaling — and so Linux users using SSD ’s should use ext2 instead .
However , is this folk wisdom actually true ?
This weekend , I decided to measure exactly what the write overhead of journaling actually is in actual practice .
For this experiment I used ext4 , since I recently added a feature to track the amount of writes to the file system over its lifetime ( to better gauge the wear and tear on an SSD ) .
Ext4 also has the advantage that ( starting in 2.6.29 ) , it can support operations with and without a journal , allowing me to do a controlled experiment where I could manipulate only that one variable .
The test workload I chose was a simple one :
Clone a git repository containing a linux source tree
Compile the linux source tree using make - j2
Remove the object files by running make clean
For the first test , I ran the test using no special mount options , and the only difference being the presence or absence of the has_journal feature .
( That is , the first file system was created using mke2fs -t ext4 / dev/ closure / testext4 , while the second file system was created using mke2fs -t ext4 - O ^has_journal / dev/ closure / testext4 . )
Amount of data written ( in megabytes ) on an ext4 filesystem Operation < td align= " center " > with journal < /td > < td align= " center " > w/o journal </td > < td align= " center " > percent change </td > </tr > < tr > < td > git clone < /td > < td align = " right " >
367.7 </td > < td align = " right " >
353.0 </td > < td align= " center " >
4.00 % </td > </tr > < tr > < td > make < /td > < td align = " right " >
231.1 </td > < td align = " right " >
203.4 </td > < td align= " center " >
12.0 % </td > </tr > < tr> < td > make clean < /td > < td align = " right " >
14.6 </td > < td align = " right " >
7.7 </td > < td align= " center " >
47.3 % </td > </tr >
What the results show is that metadata - heavy workloads , such as make clean , do result in almost twice the amount data written to disk .
This is to be expected , since all changes to metadata blocks are first written to the journal and the journal transaction committed before the metadata is written to their final location on disk .
However , for more common workloads where we are writing data as well as modifying filesystem metadata blocks , the difference is much smaller : 4 % for the git clone , and 12 % for the actual kernel compile .
The noatime mount option
Can we do better ?
Yes , if we mount the file system using the noatime mount option :
Zombies are suddenly hot again .
Recent films , books and comic series have reignited the worlds love of the flesh - eating undead , and video games are , as always , right in on the action .
Advertisement
So what better time to take a look at zombies , their role in video games , and how games go about implementing the concept of a horde of the living dead !
If you want to get historical , zombies are , as far as we know , first mentioned on the record in the Epic of Gilgamesh .
Which was written around 4000 years ago .
Advertisement
I will knock down the Gates of the Netherworld ,
I will smash the door posts , and leave the doors flat down ,
and will let the dead go up to eat the living !
And the dead will outnumber the living !
You 'll also find historical precedence for zombies in medieval European texts , Haitian Voodoo lore ( where the dead can be revived and bound to a master ) and mythical tales from every other corner of the globe , including the rather unappealing prospect of dead Viking warriors rising from the grave to fight the living .
But really , the zombies we know and love - and the zombies most commonly recycled throughout modern popular culture , including games - come from George A Romero 's films Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) and Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 , pictured below ) .
Both movies revolve around a central , similar story : a group of survivors barricading themselves into a space to protect themselves from a horde of the walking undead , who are feasting on the living and destroying human society in an apocalyptic event .
Both movies were also smash hits .
They 've been remade several times over , and have served as the primary source of reference on all things zombie for countless other films , novels , comic book and , yes , video games about zombies .
Advertisement
There are several reasons for this .
On a cheap , superficial level , people love the gore .
Walking corpses are messy , and they 're out to eat people .
Which is also messy .
But it 's also terrifying .
The concept of a world overrun with creatures whose sole purpose is to eat you is bad enough , but when those people are your former co-workers , friends and family , it adds an extra layer of intimacy to the horror .
There 's also a message .
In Dawn of the Dead , the film is as much a criticism of our consumer - mad lifestyle as it was a tale of flesh - eating corpses , with the zombies portrayed as mindless vessels shambling around the one thing in life that still mattered to them beyond the grave : the mall .
Indeed , the real danger in the film is n't even the zombies : it 's the psychological trauma the survivors are forced to endure , along with the attacks of other violent , selfish humans .
Advertisement
Over all the near - countless zombie tales recorded over the past forty years , most also retain a number of core characteristics when it comes to portraying the zombies themselves , which games ( for the most part ) also stick to .
First , they 're stupid .
These are corpses , after all , all they do is shamble around groaning and looking for somebody to eat .
Advertisement
Speaking of shambling , despite recent ( and less recent , in the case of cult Italian director Lucio Fulci 's works ) filmmakers attempting to tell you otherwise , zombies should be slow .
Simon Pegg , British comedian and Shaun of the Dead ( pictured , above ) actor / writer , puts this best , saying " speed simplifies the zombie , clarifying the threat and reducing any response to an emotional reflex .
It 's the difference between someone shouting " Boo ! " and hearing the sound of the floorboards creaking in an upstairs room : a quick thrill at the expense of a more profound sense of dread . "
Secondly , they " turn " people .
The presence of the horde is already indicative of this , but zombie tales are rife with incidents where loved ones and / or trusted friends are attacked and bitten by a zombie , with the result they then later become a zombie and themselves have to be killed off .
Advertisement
And finally , they explore how , like in many other " apocalyptic " scenarios , humans cope with situations of extreme adversity .
The survivor / survivors of a zombie story have to deal not only with limited food , supplies and communication ( not to mention millions of zombies ) , but also lawlessness and the breakdown of human civilization as we know it .
So how , then , is this modern concept of the zombie – honed to near - perfection for four decades by writers around the world – applied to video games , both in storyline and , more importantly , game design ?
Let 's take a look at a few notable examples – and speak with Resident Evil 5 producer Jun Takeuchi and Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek – to find out .

Resident Evil
We had to start here , did n't we ?
It 's not just the most popular zombie tale in video gaming , it 's one of the most endearing across popular culture as a whole .
Indeed , it 's been credited by many with reviving the entire zombie genre , bringing it back into fashion during the 90's ( the first game was released in 1996 ) in a decade when it had otherwise been relegated to b-movie schlock in other mediums .
Advertisement
But Resident Evil did n't just bring it back .
It made a complicated ( some may say convoluted ) story out of it , with a corrupt and negligent corporation responsible for a series of viral outbreaks , creating a lore which not only adds to the appeal of the series for die - hard , but injects a much - needed sense of " corniness " as well .
Nothing like throwing zombie dogs and Spanish midgets into a story about man-eating corpses to lighten things up .
In recent years , the series has moved away from its roots to challenge the very definition of the term " zombie " .
Where zombies are normally associated with the walking dead , Capcom 's last two Resident Evil games have instead featured villagers infected with an alien virus .
These guys are not only still " alive " , but retain much of their human capabilities , such as communications skills and the ability to use weapons , tools and even vehicles .
Advertisement
Does this mean they 're even zombies anymore ?
Resident Evil 5 producer Jun Takeuchi certainly thinks so .
" Until recently , zombies were seen as beings who could n't run " , he told us ( well , almost recently ... Fulci's City of the Living Dead ( 1980 ) had running zombies ) .
" Tastes have changed a little bit , though .
Now it 's okay to have fast zombies .
So sure , I think that enemies that communicate and use weapons can certainly be seen as zombies , maybe a different type , but zombies nonetheless " .

Left 4 Dead
In many ways , Left 4 Dead takes an approach to the walking dead that can best be summed up as " different " .
There are zombies with " superpowers " .
Zombies are sometimes slow , sometimes fast , sometimes acutely aware of you , other times completely oblivious .
Advertisement
Oh , and you can kill them by shooting them in the leg .
But while the game takes a creative liberty or two with the established idea of a zombie , it takes a meticulous approach to the feel of a zombie apocalypse .
The game captures the bleakness of such a scenario perfectly , with dim lights , ruined cityscapes , and most poignant of all , scrawled letters to loved ones found on walls throughout the game .
All are haunting examples of a society in decay .
Advertisement
" There have been other zombie games " says Valve 's Chet Faliszek , who served as writer for Left 4 Dead , " but they always gum it up for me .
They make it about evil men or evil corporations or evil … you get the idea .
We wanted to have Left 4 Dead be about The Zombie Apocalypse . "
Advertisement
" This is one reason we chose to avoid going in depth over the cause or what exactly is happening when you first start the game " he continues , explaining the game 's emphasis on " realism " .
" We wanted to throw the players into the world of the zombie apocalypse the same way the characters were .
A good test to see how you would last with complete strangers during the zombie apocalypse is to jump in a Left 4 Dead game with three strangers . "
In other words , Left 4 Dead 's aim is n't to portray a zombie apocalypse .
It 's to help you prepare for one .

Dead Rising
Not quite the mainstream name Resident Evil is , but still a fantastic title , one which we think does a better job than any other of really getting zombies " right " .
You play a man trapped in a mall overrun by zombies , and have to survive for three days .
That 's it .
For those three days you 'll have to make use of everything inside the mall you can get your hands on to stay alive , from umbrellas to lawn mowers , often with gory – and hilarious – results .

There 's more than a touch of Dawn of the Dead present in the game 's premise and setting – indeed , it attracted a lawsuit over similarities to Romero 's film – and that 's probably why it succeeds : because it comes closest to delivering a game that apes the feeling of dread you 'd associate with a zombie apocalypse .

Example : 99 % of zombie games are using zombies as a bad guy .
There are a finite number of them , they come at you , you kill them .
And you kill them in a confined , linear space .
Meaning that the zombie has been reduced to a mere " target " .
It could be a zombie , it could be an alien , it could be a monster , does n't really matter .
But Dead Rising placed you in a large shopping mall with tens of thousands of zombies .
And they 're all around you .
Your resources are limited , and while a single zombie rarely presents itself as a threat , 100 zombies in a group does .
And it 's a threat that 's always there .
These are the kind of things a good zombie story plays upon , and sadly , Dead Rising is one of the only games to make full use of them .

At least , until Dead Rising 2 comes out , at any rate .
Above , we 've touched on a few things the " major " zombie games do right , and a few things they do , well , wrong .
But of those core zombie story traits we listed at the start of the piece , there 's one thing zombie games seem to shy away from doing at all , and that 's " turning " .

If you 've read Robert Kirkman 's " Walking Dead " comics , Max Brook 's World War Z or seen Romero 's Dawn of the Dead , ( or even Shaun of the Dead ) , you 'll know that zombie stories are at their best when major characters are bitten , and transition from being one of the few remaining good guys to being one of the countless millions of bad guys .

It 's so powerful because it rolls so many themes and emotions together .
A main character is dead .
The ranks of the enemy have grown larger .
And the good guys are now faced with the hardship of " killing " someone who is , yes , an zombie , but was also once an ally or loved one .
And that 's all rolled into the one event .
But games do n't seem to want to go there .
You 'll see minor examples , sure , but does Leon have to put a bullet in Ashley 's head at the end of Resident Evil 4 , after it 's revealed she 's been bitten ?
Or does Zoey , having been bitten by a Hunter in a round of Left 4 Dead , then rise up to take a chunk out of Bill 's backside ?
Nope .
And for a medium that 's so obsessed with proving its creative chops , in providing experiences that are truly emotional , continually leaving such a powerful story element out of games seems a strange omission .

So why leave it out ?
Faliszek has an easy answer , saying it 's for design purposes .
" Early on we decided we wanted it to be about team - work and the connection you had with your team " , he said .
" While I love the mistrust that " turning " adds to movies , the best implementation in a non-zombie horror film being John Carpenter 's The Thing , it really works against the core mechanics of the game .
We wanted to keep you together as a cohesive unit always working together to escape . "

And Takeuchi's thoughts ?
" You know , that 's a good point , why do n't we see that in games ?
I 'm actually not sure myself .
Is it just a coincidence ...? "
No , sadly , it 's not a coincidence , because it reveals a shortcoming in zombie games that even Capcom , masters of the genre , are prone to dabble in .
For all their gore , and all their brain - eating potential , zombies are not a literal threat .
They 're slow , they 're stupid , they can't open doors , they can't drive after you .
Instead , their threat is a metaphorical one , something Romero understood when he filled a mall full of brain - dead shoppers and a handful of desperate humans .

The real danger was n't necessarily in being eaten alive .
It was in how you 'd deal with prospect of a never - ending horde of zombies that , while mindless , were innumerable and existed for no other reason than to find you , and eat you .
How you 'd cope with seeing your friends and loved ones eaten , then come back and try to eat you .
It was in seeing humanity for what it really was once you penetrate the thin veneer of society : a violent , selfish mob that consumes itself with greed once the zombies have eaten away at law & order .
Zombie games of the future , take note .

Today is Ada Lovelace Day .
This is a truly magnificent enterprise , organised by Suw Charman - Anderson , in which more than 1,000 people have signed up to write a blog post about a woman in technology whom they admire .
Suw was inspired to found Ada Lovelace Day after hearing female friends in technology say that they felt disempowered and invisible .
Ada Lovelace herself is widely recognised as the world 's first computer programmer ; born in 1815 , her friendship with Charles Babbage and her understanding of his difference engine and analytical engine have given her a lasting legacy .
But , as Suw rightly points out , one historical role model is n't enough .
It 's important for girls and young women to see that there are a lot of women making careers in technology .
And in fact , inspirational women in technology are everywhere .
From games designers Elonka Dunin and Jane Jensen to Turing award - winners Barbara Liskov and Frances Allen to influential CTOs Mary Lou Jepsen and Padmasree Warrior , women have been making high - level careers in science and technology for a long time now .
My feeling is , though , that upping the profile of these role models is only half the battle .
While real women have been racking up technological accomplishments , the portrayal of women 's scientific prowess in fiction still lags behind .
And fiction can play a crucial role in teaching young women what life choices are acceptable .
I vividly remember a storyline in the Australian soap opera Neighbours from my teenage years .
" Plain Jane Superbrain " ( played by Annie Jones ) had a crush on hunky Mike ( played by Guy Pearce , later to star in Memento and LA Confidential ) .
But he did n't notice her – what was she to do ?
The answer , of course , was a make­over and … to flunk a maths test .
Once Mike came top in maths , with Jane following demurely in second place , the path was clear for them to fall into each other 's arms .
The story 's ridiculous , of course , but as a teenager I remember having earnest discussions with other girls about it : was it really true ?
Did men not like clever girls ?
Ought we to try to appear less clever ?
Now this was 20 years ago , but things have n't changed as much as I 'd like .
I love Doctor Who passionately , but the dynamic of it remains that Billie Piper , Freema Agyeman or Catherine Tate wander around after a man who knows a lot about science , needing to have things explained to them .
Heroes may have Hayden Panetierre 's gutsy cheerleader character , but all the science is done by men : Mohinder and Chandra Suresh .
And the central premise of the heinous US sitcom The Big Bang Theory is that geeky boys know about science whereas pretty girls know about clothing and manicures .
Hilarious .
It 's time for the creators of fictional scientists to catch up to the modern world .
As Ada Lovelace Day shows , there are a lot of women out there doing incredible work in science and technology ; it 's time fiction reflected that .
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2009 March 4
Explanation : Very good telescopic views of Saturn can be expected in the coming days as the ringed planet nears opposition on March 8th , its closest approach to Earth in 2009 .
Of course , opposition means opposite the Sun in planet Earth 's sky - an arrangement that occurs almost yearly for Saturn .
But while Saturn itself grows larger in telescopic images , Saturn 's rings seem to be vanishing as their tilt to our line - of - sight decreases .
In fact , the rings will be nearly invisible , edge - on from our perspective , by September 4 .
Recorded on February 28 , this sharp image was made with the 1 meter telescope at Pic Du Midi , a mountain top observatory in the French Pyrenees .
The rings are seen to be tilted nearly edge - on , but remarkable details are visible in the gas giant 's cloud bands .
The icy moon Tethys appears just beyond the rings at the lower left .
Another allegation has surfaced against the officer who prevented Houston Texans running back Ryan Moats from entering a hospital to see his dying mother - in - law last week .
The Dallas Morning News reports that Maritza Thomas , wife of former Cowboys linebacker Zach Thomas , was handcuffed and spent approximately three hours in jail after Dallas officer Robert Powell pulled her over for an illegal U - turn in July 2008 .
" This in no way compares to what happened to Ryan Moats and his family , " Thomas told The Morning News .
" But we wanted to tell our story , not knowing how many others have been affected by Officer Powell .
We know the vast majority of the Dallas police force are good and professional people , but this guy just seems excessive . "
Four of the five tickets issued against Maritza Thomas were later dropped including failure to show proof of insurance , running a red light , improper address on driver 's license and a registration sticker was not on the windshield .
She accepted deferred adjudication for the illegal U - turn charge , and her record will be cleared next month .
" This situation never should 've happened , " Maritza Thomas ' attorney , Brody Shanklin told The Morning News .
" Unless extraordinary circumstances exist , no person should be arrested for a Class C citation .
In this case , it was an example of Officer Powell being overzealous and exerting his authority in a manner that he never should have . "
Bob Gorsky , Powell 's attorney , defended his client 's actions .
" I do understand that an arrest on multiple traffic charges happens often and is absolutely proper under these circumstances , " Gorsky told The Morning News .
" Often , when there are multiple charges , an arrest made and bond posted , some of the charges from a single event are later dropped . "
Powell pulled over Moats for running a red light on his way to the hospital to see his dying mother - in - law .
Powell detained Moats for 13 minutes , in which time his mother - in - law died .
Powell issued an apology on Friday .
A Dallas police spokesman declined to comment but said the department would investigate any complaint filed against Powell , who is on administrative leave .
An octopus will be released from a New Zealand aquarium after escaping from a tank and surviving five days on the run .
Last month
Sid mysteriously vanished from his tank at a Dunedin aquarium .
Five days later , he was spotted by a staff member making a dash for the door .
Sid had been hiding out in a drain , which pumps fresh sea water into the aquarium .
He was persuaded back into his tank .
He was hungry but otherwise OK .
The aquarium 's senior aquarist , Matthew Crane , says Sid has done his time and will be freed .
" We are realising he is getting a little older in his life and maybe searching for a mate so that 's why we 've gone ahead and set his release for today , " he said .
Another octopus named Harry - after Harry Houdini - escaped from the same tank .
He was found halfway up a staircase .
More babies were born in the United States in 2007 than in any other year in American history , according to preliminary data reported Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics .
The 4,317,000 births in 2007 just edged out the figure for 1957 , at the height of the baby boom .
The increase reflected a slight rise in childbearing by women of all ages , including those in their 30s and 40s , and a record share of births to unmarried women .
But in contrast with the culturally transforming postwar boom , when a smaller population of women bore an average of three or four children , the recent increase mainly reflects a larger population of women of childbearing age , said Stephanie J. Ventura , chief of reproductive statistics at the center and an author of the new report .
Today , the average woman has 2.1 children .
Also in 2007 , for the second straight year and in a trend health officials find worrisome , the rate of births to teenagers rose slightly after declining by one - third from 1991 to 2005 .
A low - level State Department employee pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to charges of accessing hundreds of confidential passport files , including those of celebrities , actors , athletes , politicians and family members -– and he likely faces little to no jail time .
Dwayne Cross , 41 , of Upper Marlboro , Maryland , became the department 's second employee to plead guilty to federal criminal charges of unlawfully accessing a computer .
In September , Lawrence Yontz , 48 , of Arlington , Virginia , a research analyst , pleaded guilty ( .pdf ) to the same charge in a political scandal in the State Department 's Passport Information Electronic Records System .
Yontz was sentenced last month to one year of supervised release and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service .
Cross faces a similar fate at his March 23 scheduled sentencing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
According to a plea agreement ( .pdf ) , the government has instructed the federal judge presiding over the case that the penalty should range from no prison time up to six months .
As part of the department - wide security breach , the passport files of Barack Obama , John McCain and Hillary Clinton were illegally accessed .
The department declined to name the identities of the people Cross unlawfully accessed .
But Cross confessed that he accessed the files out of idle curiosity .
A July government audit ( .pdf ) has found " weaknesses , including a general lack of policies , procedures , guidance and training " within the State Department 's passport bureau .
The State Department 's passport system maintains data on 127 million passports and can be accessed by more than 20,000 employees .
Cross was an administrative assistant in the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department between 2001 and 2008 .
Both Yontz and Cross pleaded guilty to unauthorized access to a State Department computer in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) .

There are a lot of subjects that [ artist id = " 2389485 " ]
Taylor Swift [ / artist ] has no problem talking about in interviews , including ex-boyfriends , mean girls and her idea of fairy - tale love .
But there 's one subject that Swift does n't think is appropriate .
" It 's fine to talk about love publicly , but I think when you talk about virginity and sex publicly , people just automatically picture you naked , " she told Allure magazine when asked if she 's chosen to remain a virgin .
" And as much as I can prevent people picturing me naked , I 'm going to . "
Choosing not to talk about her sex life is one of the few ways
Swift remains private , since she thinks it 's important to keep her fans in the know about almost everything .
One of the keys to Swift 's success is her MySpace blog , on which she 's written about everything from her breakup with Joe Jonas to redecorating her bedroom .
" I never would have sold any records if my fans had n't gone out and bought them .
It 's so incredible to go out and sign autographs for nine hours straight , for me , " she told the magazine .
" That 's just my favorite thing to do , honestly . "
It also helps that Swift is honest about love and broken hearts in her songs .
" For some reason , I could never , ever stop writing songs about heartbreak , " she said .
" Just because as human beings , what we can't have is what we replay in our head over and over again before we go to sleep .
" I have always been fascinated with fairy tales and the idea that Prince Charming is just one castle away , " she added about her idea of true love .
" And you 're gonna run across a field and meet each other in the middle and have an amazing , perfect movie kiss .
And it 's gonna be happily ever after . "
But Swift is also realistic about romance , noting that she 's had her heart broken and has turned that pain into musical gold .
" I 'm the kind of person who needs everything to be justified and needs all of her time to be worth the energy , " she said .
" So let 's say I date a guy who really does nothing but damage me .
And you 've spent time , you 've spent effort , and you 've put everything into trying to make that work .
And it did n't .
So you write a song about it .
It was worth everything if you write a song about it . "

The bonuses are peanuts compared to the real amount of money in question here .
Millions as opposed to billions .
The AIG bailout has been a way to hide an enormous second round of cash to the same group that had received TARP money already .
Who are the parties really benefitting ?
The usual suspects : Goldman , Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , UBS , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank , Barclays , etc. etc .
The same parties who had ALREADY milked us for billions .
They are now getting MORE billions through AIG .
Why did Goldman have to get back 100 cents on the dollar ?
Did n't we already give Goldman a $ 25 billion capital infusion , and are n't they sitting on more than $ 100 billion in cash ?
Have n't we been told recently that they are beginning to come back to fiscal stability ?
If that is so , could n't they have accepted a discount , and could n't they have agreed to certain conditions before the AIG dollars — that is , our dollars — flowed ?
This is where the real outrage should be focused .
Not that giving bonuses to the failed executives , many of whom have simply taken the money and ran away , is something that should be ignored -- obviously it is criminal and infuriating .
Spitzer poses some vital questions that must be answered in this piece , and concludes :
Failure to answer these questions will feed the populist rage that is metastasizing very quickly .
And it will raise basic questions about the competence of those who are supposedly guiding this economic policy .
Obama , are you paying attention ?
Hello ?
My point is do n't trust the MSM .
When they 're pushing our buttons , there 's always a reason , and it 's NOT because they 're on " our side " .
They never are .
Social websites harm children 's brains : Chilling warning to parents from top neuroscientist
Social networking websites are causing alarming changes in the brains of young users , an eminent scientist has warned .
Sites such as Facebook , Twitter and Bebo are said to shorten attention spans , encourage instant gratification and make young people more self - centred .
The claims from neuroscientist Susan Greenfield will make disturbing reading for the millions whose social lives depend on logging on to their favourite websites each day .
Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg .
The popular website has made him a very rich man , but at what cost to human relationships ?
But they will strike a chord with parents and teachers who complain that many youngsters lack the ability to communicate or concentrate away from their screens .
More than 150 million use Facebook to keep in touch with friends , share photographs and videos and post regular updates of their movements and thoughts .
A further six million have signed up to Twitter , the ' micro - blogging ' service that lets users circulate text messages about themselves .
But while the sites are popular - and extremely profitable - a growing number of psychologists and neuroscientists believe they may be doing more harm than good .
Baroness Greenfield , an Oxford University neuroscientist and director of the Royal Institution , believes repeated exposure could effectively ' rewire ' the brain .
Experts are concerned children 's online social interactions can ' rewire ' the brain
Computer games and fast - paced TV shows were also a factor , she said .
' We know how small babies need constant reassurance that they exist , ' she told the Mail yesterday .
' My fear is that these technologies are infantilising the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights , who have a small attention span and who live for the moment . '
Professor Susan Greenfield : Concerned
Her comments echoed those she made during a House of Lords debate earlier this month .
Then she argued that exposure to computer games , instant messaging , chat rooms and social networking sites could leave a generation with poor attention spans .
' I often wonder whether real conversation in real time may eventually give way to these sanitised and easier screen dialogues , in much the same way as killing , skinning and butchering an animal to eat has been replaced by the convenience of packages of meat on the supermarket shelf , ' she said .
Lady Greenfield told the Lords a teacher of 30 years had told her she had noticed a sharp decline in the ability of her pupils to understand others .
' It is hard to see how living this way on a daily basis will not result in brains , or rather minds , different from those of previous generations , ' she said .
She pointed out that autistic people , who usually find it hard to communicate , were particularly comfortable using computers .
' Of course , we do not know whether the current increase in autism is due more to increased awareness and diagnosis of autism , or whether it can - if there is a true increase - be in any way linked to an increased prevalence among people of spending time in screen relationships .
Surely it is a point worth considering , ' she added .
Psychologists have also argued that digital technology is changing the way we think .
They point out that students no longer need to plan essays before starting to write - thanks to word processors they can edit as they go along .
Satellite navigation systems have negated the need to decipher maps .
A study by the Broadcaster Audience Research Board found teenagers now spend seven - and - a- half hours a day in front of a screen .
Educational psychologist Jane Healy believes children should be kept away from computer games until they are seven .
Most games only trigger the ' flight or fight ' region of the brain , rather than the vital areas responsible for reasoning .
Sue Palmer , author of Toxic Childhood , said : ' We are seeing children 's brain development damaged because they do n't engage in the activity they have engaged in for millennia .
' I 'm not against technology and computers .
But before they start social networking , they need to learn to make real relationships with people . '
Nawaz defiant , says lawyers ' march will continue ; army alerted
Pakistan , Sat , 14 Mar 2009 IANS
Islamabad , March 14 ( IANS )
The army was placed on alert here Saturday as a defiant opposition leader Nawaz Sharif turned down the government 's plea to call off the lawyers ' ' long march ' for restoration of the Supreme Court judges sacked in 2007 , saying there was no room left for talks .
In other developments Saturday , Information and Broadcasting Minister Sherry Rehman sent her resignation to Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani , apparently miffed over President Asif Ali Zardari 's orders to blank out Geo TV and other private channels for highlighting the lawyers ' stir .
' At the moment , the police are in place but the army has been asked to stand by in case it is required , ' an official spokesman said .
The government has vowed to prevent the marchers from entering Islamabad and staging a sit - in before parliament .
Speaking to reporters at his home on the outskirts of Lahore , Sharif said he was all for reconciliation but was not prepared to take Zardari at his word .
' He had said earlier that he would not become the president but he did become so , ' Sharif pointed out .
At the same time , he urged Gilani to take the initiative to break the deadlock , assuring him of his full support .
Thousands of lawyers Thursday set out simultaneously from Sindh , Balochistan and Punjab and will converge here March 16 to demand the reinstatement of the Supreme Court and the high court judges whom then president Pervez Musharraf had sacked after imposing an emergency in November 2007 .
A similar agitation a year ago had resulted in Musharraf 's ouster .
Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) has jumped on to the lawyers ' bandwagon to protest a Supreme Court judgement barring the former prime minister and his brother from contesting elections on corruption charges .
The verdict led to the fall of Shahbaz Sharif 's Punjab government and the imposition of Governor 's Rule in the province .
Nawaz Sharif has accused Zardari of engineering the court verdict to settle political scores .
Observers here saw Sharif 's appeal to Gilani as an attempt to drive a wedge between the prime minister and the president , who are not known to be on the best of terms .
Interior Minister Rehman Khan , however , sought to dispel suggestions that all was not well between Zardari and Gilani , even as he appealed to the lawyers to come to the negotiating table , warning that the marchers would not be permitted to enter Islamabad .
' There are no differences between the president and the prime minister , ' he said at a press conference here , adding : ' This is disinformation being spread by our enemies . '
' Let us not head toward another East Pakistan , ' he said , while appealing to the protesting lawyers to abandon their ' long march ' and sit for talks with the government .
The reference was to the agitation in the erstwhile East Pakistan after the 1971 elections that eventually led to the creation of an independent Bangladesh .
The agitation began after then military dictator Gen .
Yahya Khan refused to accept the electoral verdict that saw the Awami League of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman emerge as the largest party in the National Assembly , the lower house of parliament .
' I appeal to you to come for talks .
Please postpone your agitation .
Your march is against the unity of the nation , ' Rehman maintained .
' If at all there has to be a march , let us march to Swat , to FATA .
Let us march for the country , ' he stated .
' I again appeal to you .
Please consider the interests of the country .
Do n't march to Islamabad .
Let 's talk and resolve our issues , ' the interior minister said , adding : ' The long march can not be against the interest of Pakistan . '
Malik refused to be drawn into the circumstances under which Sherry Rehman had resigned , saying : ' Only she can answer that question . '
He also contended that the government had nothing do with the blackout of TV channels .
' There was a dispute regarding the channel .
It was a problem of the cable operators .
We had nothing to do with it .
We believe in the freedom of journalism , ' Malik maintained .
At the same time , he implied that the private TV channels were not ' independent ' .
' I want you to watch five channels .
Are they partial or are they impartial ? ' he asked .
Geo TV insisted Zardari had ordered the ban .
' It has been learned that cable operators across the country blocked the transmission of Geo News on the directive of President Asif Ali Zardari , ' it said in a posting on its website .
' President Zardari has sent messages to Geo TV administration in which he has said that if Geo has recovered from the courts the losses incurred following the ban on the channel in former president Pervez Musharraf 's rule then it should stop forthwith the coverage of lawyers movement for the restoration of November 3 , 2007 judiciary .
' The reason why President Asif Ali Zardari has taken the step is that Geo TV is reminding the President of his past promises and commitments he had made to the nation and what Shaheed Benazir Bhutto had said about the freedom of expression , restoration of judiciary and Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , ' Geo TV said .
Stunted by the nation ’s credit freeze , troubled OptiSolar Inc. of Hayward , Calif. , has agreed to sell its portfolio of unfinished solar farms to one of the hottest firms in the solar industry .
First Solar Inc. said Monday that it would pay OptiSolar $ 400 million in First Solar stock to buy the outstanding projects , which the Tempe , Ariz . , company intends to complete .
The portfolio includes a planned 550 - megawatt facility in San Luis Obispo County known as the Topaz Solar Farm .
The facility ’s electricity has been sold on a long - term contract to Pacific Gas & Electric Co. , with first delivery slated for 2011 .
The sale gives OptiSolar a way to make good on its legally binding power contracts , as well as a much - needed capital infusion .
Launched in 2005 , the privately owned company manufactures its own thin - film photovoltaic panels to supply solar farms that it planned to develop and manage .

But fallout from the economic crisis put a dent in those plans .
OptiSolar last month fired 290 employees -- nearly half its workforce -- after it failed to secure financing to complete a planned expansion of a manufacturing facility in Sacramento .
OptiSolar is seeking government loan guarantees under the recently approved federal stimulus plan to get the company moving again , spokesman Alan Bernheimer said .
Meanwhile , First Solar is hitting its stride .
The photovoltaic manufacturer has scored deal after deal , even in a lousy economy , thanks to a proven track record and rapidly declining prices for its thin - film solar panels .
Sempra Energy , Southern California Edison and Edison Mission Energy have all chosen First Solar as their supplier for large - scale photovoltaic projects .
First Solar stock closed at $ 103.97 , down $ 1.77 , on Monday .
Its transaction with OptiSolar is expected to close in the second quarter .

State law requires California ’s investor - owned utilities to procure 20 % of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010 .
The utilities have signed contracts with a number of start - up firms .
But the deepening recession has many analysts predicting a shakeout of weaker firms , with well - capitalized companies such as First Solar standing to benefit .
PG&E ; said Monday that it expected no hiccups with the Topaz Solar Farm .
“ We ’re looking forward to working with First Solar , ” said PG&E ; spokeswoman Jane Oliveira .
“ We are confident in their commitment to the project . ”

The Philippine Business Mirror newspaper are today reporting that Acer are planning to launch their first Android powered handset in September of this year .
According to an unknown source from the Taiwanese company , the handset will be known as the ‘ A1 ’ and will be one of four Acer handsets that will make their debut in September .
The A1 , equipped with a touch screen , is among four handset models that Acer plans to debut that month , the person said , asking not to be identified because he ’s not authorized to comment on the matter .
Henry Wang , a spokesman at Taipei - based Acer , declined to comment .

I must add that this article just landed in my inbox a few minutes ago , and up until that point i’d never heard of the Philippine Business Mirror newspaper .
Their about us page does make them seem fairly credible , but faced with news from unknown official sources , who knows ?

AROUND THE WEB
I know , sometimes when you look at the source code of MooTools you ask yourself , " How could this possibly be any better ?
Because it 's so awesome . "
I am by and large always stumped by this question , as the code is so meticulously maintained by its authors .
Today , I have an answer .
The only way to give you a better MooTools is to give you more of it .
It 's that awesome .
Today , we 're making MooTools awesomer .
We give you the new and improved MooTools More - the official plugin collection for MooTools .
The plugins we are releasing today take the fifteen files previously in MooTools More and triple them .
That 's three times the awesome !
What 's in it you ask ?
Well , let me tell you .
The new and improved - more currently includes :
Class extensions including a Binds mutator , easier refactoring , chain pausing and more .
New Native extensions including more love for String and Array , plus a fully featured Date Native and a URI extension to make managing links downright fun .
More Element love with help for managing text selection and relative positioning ( put this box 's lower right corner next to the upper right corner of that other box ... )
Form love including a robust and extensible form validator and a class for displaying hint text over an input .
Extended Request functionality including JSONP support and Queuing .
Support for language localization for classes that output text ( days of the month , months of the year , form validation errors , etc )
Oh , and we 've already translated the text content in these new plugins ( Date and FormValidator specifically ) into half a dozen languages thanks to all the helpful folks in the MooTools - Lang user group ( do you know a language other than English ?
Want to help ?
Here ya go ) .
I know , you can barely contain your excitement .
Us too !
Surely , you ask , there must be a catch to all this awesomeness .
Does it cost four easy installments of $ 19.99 ?
Shipping and handling ?
Must you sign an oath ?
Nay !
It 's free for the taking .
But there are a Few Catches
First , today 's release is just the beta - the first release candidate ( RC1 ) .
This means that you will certainly encounter problems , which would imply that it 's not 100 % awesome ( you are wrong !
It is 100 % awesome - when the beta is finished and we officially release it it will be 125 % awesome ) .
But yes , you may encounter bugs .
In this case , you will need to file it in the shiny new MooTools - More dedicated Lighthouse .
Industrious types are encouraged to pull the repository from github and try and fix things themselves - helping hands are always appreciated .
In addition to this , the docs for the beta are in a different location ( links at the bottom ) .
The search in these docs still points to the google search for the current docs , so the new stuff wo n't be returned if you use the search .
Also note that there is not a compatibility layer yet written for this release .
There are only a handful of items from the previous files that were in MooTools More .
For those of you using the Clientcide libraries , you 'll see a lot of familiar scripts on the list , and there are numerous changes between the versions on Clientcide and the versions here .
You can see the list of breaking changes in the readme .
Enough !
Give It To Me !!!
Ok , ok , you want links ?
Here you are :
How You Can Help
There are several things you can do to pitch in .
First , you can run the tests in all the browsers you have access to .
There are two types of tests :
Running through these in your browsers and reporting anything that seems wonky will help us tremendously .
If you know a language that has n't yet had the translation written for Date or FormValidator , you can , as mentioned previously , jump into the MooTools - Lang group and help out with that
More to Come
MooTools
More is now it 's own official project which means its release schedule is no longer tied to MooTools Core .
Once this release candidate is fully released ( hopefully in the next week or so ) expect to see new plugins arrive every week or two .
Our objective is to quickly grow the plugins available here as well as address bugs in MooTools More constantly .
We have a long list of functionality already lined up for future releases .
This is only the beginning !

Seriously , there were a lot of people who chipped in .
You can too , if you like .
They tell us where to eat , how to find friends , when to make a left turn .
Oh , and they can also make a phone call .
An explosive proliferation of software applications — and easy ways to get them , most notably through Apple ’s App Store — is changing our relationship with mobile phones .
The always - connected era is dawning .
The cell phone is becoming more a companion than merely a means of one - on - one conversation .
“ I ca n’t live without it , ” said James London , a 19 - year - old De Anza College freshman , cradling his iPhone .
“ It ’s like water or food . ”
Though Apple was the first company to create an easy and orderly way for developers to sell smart - phone software , the rest of the industry is trying to catch up .
Owners of all the major mobile phone operating systems — Research In Motion , Windows Mobile , Palm , Symbian and Google ’s Android — are gearing up online application stores .
Independent app sites are also popping up , offering unauthorized software for the iPhone .
Soon , nearly every imaginable function of the office and home entertainment center will be delivered to the computers that fit our palms .
“ I ’m a big believer that the mobile phone will become the remote control of our lives , ” said Chetan Sharma , an independent wireless industry analyst .
“ Anything that we touch and see and feel , and whomever we communicate with — we will control that with our mobile phones . ”
Though the recession is slowing sales of so - called smart - phones , futurists view app - packed mobile devices as the next tech tsunami to hit society and fundamentally change how people navigate life .
“ It ’s a new category of activity , ” said veteran valley forecaster Paul Saffo .
“ Voice ( functions ) are an afterthought . ”
Already people are using their smart - phones to locate friends at nearby bars and restaurants or find a service station with cheap gas .
They stream TV to their phones , update Facebook pages on the go and play sophisticated games .
The Shazam program allows people to instantly identify a song and artist by holding the iPhone up to , say , a radio .
The Trapster program for iPhone and BlackBerry uses crowd - sourcing to avoid speeding tickets — the phone signals a warning when entering ticket zones .
The Android Cab4me app helps hail a cab .
‘ My lifeline ’
“ It ’s my lifeline , ” said Grace Redmond , a 20 - year - old San Jose State University student .
“ My iPhone was broken today .
It ruined my day . ”
Redmond , who grew up in Virginia , relies on GPS - enabled programs to help her get around , and avoid getting lost in the Bay Area .
She found the Urbanspoon app indispensable during a recent vacation to Seattle .
“ My phone told me where to eat , ” she said .
Giovanni Valasco , a 24 - year - old Campbell resident , treats his iPhone like a pocket Yellow Pages by using ﻿a business listings program .
“ I use it all the time . ”
Freshman London worries about an affliction common to BlackBerry users : sore neck .
“ I ’m constantly looking down at my iPhone — every 10 minutes . ”
Because their smart - phone is with them everywhere they go , people develop far closer attachments to the devices than to their home PCs or laptops , said B.J. Fogg , a Stanford University researcher author of “ Persuasive Technology : Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do . ”
Sharma said people using smart - phones spend 70 percent of their time doing things other than talking .
“ They have become devices people use for productivity and leisure , ” he said .
“ They save time and they kill time . ”
Tech ‘ sea change ’
Last year , some 34 million smart - phones were sold in the United States , about 20 percent of the nation ’s overall mobile phone market of some 173 million units , according to research firm IDC .
But by 2013 , it predicts nearly half the mobile phones purchased in the United States will be smart - phones .
“ The sea change is starting to happen , ” said IDC analyst Sean Ryan .
But there are barriers to smart - phone ubiquity .
Perhaps the biggest challenge is the cost of data plans .
Apple ’s U.S. iPhone partner , AT&T , for instance , offers a basic data and voice plan for about $ 80 a month with taxes .
That ’s almost $ 1,000 a year , which can be a hard sell to the general population , particularly in tough economic times .
“ The prices of service plans are big impediments for many people , ” said Shaw Wu , analyst with Kaufman Brothers .
“ It ’s not cheap . ”
But service providers have a lot at stake — analyst Sharma said they pulled in $ 34 billion last year in data charges — and are likely to compete fiercely , which could push down costs and expand consumer options .
Hints of the future can be found at Apple ’s App Store , which now offers some 27,000 iPhone applications , according to 148Apps.com , a San Francisco Web site that reviews iPhone apps .
Some of those are given away for free , while many are sold for less than $ 3 .
As of mid-January , Apple said there had been 500 million downloads from the App Store , which opened in July .
“ It ’s like a concierge .
When you have a problem , it can help solve it for you , ” said Stanford ’s Fogg .
“ Nothing is as close to us all the time — not even your spouse or partner . ”

In a car park not so far away ...
It is a big brother experiment like no other , an experiment which will boldly go where few have gone - or probably wanted to go - before .
Six apparently fearless volunteers are to take part in a unique test by being locked up in what amounts to a series of small steel tins off a parking lot in Moscow for 105 days as scientists simulate a space rocket ride to Mars .
On Tuesday the team will step into a chain of cramped metal capsules , connected by cables and corrugated metal pipes , in a hangar at the back of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems ( IMBP ) in the Russian capital , swing close the hatch and " blast off " .
The idea is for the 550 cubic - metre " ground exploration complex " ( GEC ) to recreate as closely as possible the atmosphere of a spacecraft racing through the solar system , bombarded by cosmic radiation .
Any return flight to Mars - at least 34 million miles from our planet - would take between 18 months and three years , including landing and exploration .
The volunteers - four Russians , a French airline pilot and a German army engineer - will be kept under constant camera surveillance to record the physical and psychological impact of their time in the isolation chamber .
They will eat packaged rations , wash with damp tissues and spend several hours each day conducting experiments , just as astronauts would on a real space flight .
They will use the same toilet as crew on the international space station , which has fans to propel waste into a " sanitary receptacle " .
They will eat together , work out in a tiny gym - and may even get in to the odd punch - up .
Mark Belokovksy of the IMBP admitted the psychological pressure of living in close quarters with five other human beings could crack even the toughest guinea pigs .
" Tension is inevitable , " he said candidly .
The fact the 105 - day " flight " will be a single - sex trip on this occasion may be a blessing .
During a similar experiment in 1999 the participants were given vodka to celebrate New Year 's Eve : two members then got in a fist fight after one tried to kiss a female volunteer from Canada .
The capsules have no windows and the explorers ' only contact with the outside world will be via an internal email system and a delayed radio link to the " control centre " positioned alongside the GEC .
Each member of the team has a narrow bed and only three cubic metres of personal space .
They can take one bag with books and DVDs with them , but will have no access to television or the internet .
" Just like cosmonauts we will have eight hours sleep , eight hours work and eight hours for personal matters - intake of food , physical exercise and free time , " said Sergei Ryazansky , 34 , a space research expert , who will lead the crew .
Crew members are expected to deal with all but the severest medical emergencies themselves - one of the Russian volunteers is a doctor - although each maintains the right to quit the project at any moment without giving a reason .
While the virtual journey cannot recreate weightlessness - without going into space that is only possible for brief periods in an aircraft - separate tests may be used to simulate the long - term effects of zero gravity .
Head - down bed - rest tests , where a volunteer stays for weeks or months in a bed that slopes by six to eight degrees towards the head , recreate the redistribution of blood in the body without gravity .
Other experiments will monitor microbiological contamination using an " electronic nose " and examine the effect of long periods of restricted activity on the bones of the crew members .
Since the Apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s there have been no manned flights beyond Earth 's orbit .
While a flight to Mars is thought to be 20 to 30 years away , Belokovsky said conducting such experiments brought the date ever closer .
" The knowledge gleaned from the experiment will be invaluable in planning for such a trip , " he said .
Volunteers on the 105 - day stint will receive a payment of € 15,000 ( £ 14,000 ) , but Belokovksy said money was not the main motivating factor .
" They are driven by the chance to take part in an experiment of international significance , " he said .
' Like being stuck in a lift '
What will happen to the human guinea pigs ?
Dr Claudia Herbert , chartered clinical psychologist and clinical director of the Oxford Stress and Trauma Centre , explains :
" Obviously three months in a capsule is going to be a highly stressful experience and I wonder what preparation and testing the Russian authorities have conducted in choosing and preparing these volunteers for the experiment .
They are going into a small social group from which no one can escape , with different personalities , temperaments , cultures and languages .
It will be like being stuck in a lift , which can be very stressful even in ordinary conditions - we all have a personal space which we do not like to be invaded by others .
What happens in groups is that somebody will crystalise as the leader and in these circumstances , depending on how carefully the group has been chosen and bearing in mind the sort of people who volunteer for these sorts of exercises , there may be two or three displaying leadership characteristics .
They are likely to be risk takers and strong personalities , which in itself can make cooperation difficult .
It would be good if they have had some mindfulness training : clearing their minds , meditating , taking deep breaths : being aware what is going on in your own mind and learning not to be affected by others .
I hope the volunteers do not have vulnerability factors such as traumas from their past that they may not have thought about but which may now surface in such stressful conditions . "
A standoff between the communities secretary , Hazel Blears , and the Muslim Council of Britain was said last night to " cut to the heart " of the government 's revised counter - terror strategy to challenge those who defend terrorism and violent extremism .
Blears has suspended official links with the MCB over allegations that its deputy general secretary endorsed a Hamas call for attacks on foreign troops , including possibly British troops , if they try to intercept arms smuggled into Gaza .
Blears last night pressed the MCB for further clarification after it distanced itself from a declaration calling for a new jihad over Gaza made by the Hamas - backed " global anti-aggression campaign " in Istanbul last month .
The cabinet minister is still pressing the MCB 's deputy general secretary , Dr Daud Abdullah , who attended and signed the Istanbul declaration , to clarify his own position .
The dispute , involving a senior government minister and one of the most significant Muslim " umbrella " organisations , coincided with the launch of the Contest 2 counter - terror strategy and illustrated the determination of ministers to challenge radical views that fall short of support for violence but reject and undermine " our shared values " .
Ministers have pulled back from spelling out a checklist of views that might constitute extremism .
Instead , the Home Office strategy document published yesterday opts for a more low - key commitment to challenge those who " reject parliamentary democracy , dismiss the rule of law and promote intolerance and discrimination on the basis of race , faith , ethnicity , gender or sexuality " .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , said yesterday the government had no intention of outlawing these views or criminalising those who held them : " Freedom of thought and speech are rights which are fundamental to our society .
But we will not hear these views in silence .
We should all stand up for our shared values and not concede the floor to those who dismiss then . "
At the Home Office launch of the revised strategy , Smith made it clear this extended to challenging those who voiced homophobic views in public .
The document also spells out that the new policy will be reflected in the groups that are supported and the projects that are sponsored as part of the £ 70 m programme to prevent violent extremism .
But this failed to satisfy the Conservatives , with the shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , claiming that ministers were still funding groups that " propagate extremism " .
The revised counter - terror strategy contains fresh warnings about the likelihood of a " dirty bomb " attack in Britain , saying that changing technology and increased smuggling of chemical , radiological and biological materials make the prospect more realistic .
It also discloses that counter - measures are being taken in Britain in anticipation of the possible importation of the use of roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices from Iraq and Afghanistan .
The continued fragmentation of the al - Qaida organisation may lead to smaller , more autonomous networks but it predicts these new " self - starting " organisations will have access to new technology and may become capable of conducting more lethal operations .
Senior Whitehall officials acknowledged serious concern about the impact in Britain of the deteriorating situation in the Pakistan / Afghanistan borderlands , where al - Qaida groups have been involved in the direction and training of some terror cells in Britain .
But the threat may diminish as " terrorism is subject to greater challenge in and by communities in this country , notably but not only by British Muslims , making it harder for terrorists to operate here and to recruit people to their cause " .
The document also reflects more sophisticated thinking within MI5 about the process of radicalisation , making clear that the security services do not think there is a single cause or pathway to extremism .
It acknowledges that political and economic grievances , including perceptions of British foreign policy in the Islamic world , have played a role , and that Iraq , Afghanistan and perceived inaction over Palestine have also contributed to anger and controversy .
But it notes that such grievances do not always or often lead to radicalisation , and that social and psychological factors are also important to the individual , often rooted in conflicts of identity .
The strategy plays down the influence of radical preachers and instead talks of supportive peer groups and charismatic individuals as being crucial to the process of radicalisation .
The strategy says that while many contemporary terrorist organisations purport to have religious objectives , many terrorists have little or no religious understanding or knowledge .
The implication of this analysis is that in addition to tough law enforcement operations , the counter - terrorism programme also engages with " vulnerable " individuals who are at risk of being recruited or have already been recruited by violent extremists .
Contest 2
• Those who defend terrorism and violent extremism to be challenged but not banned or prosecuted .
• New threat from " dirty bomb " as technology changes due to increased smuggling of chemical and biological materials .
• Al - Qaida fragmenting but " self - starting " successor groups may pose more lethal threat .
• Counter - terror budget to rise to £ 3.5 bn a year by 2011 .
Controversial statement : ' Obligations ' to the people of Gaza
The Istanbul statement claims God has granted victory to Gazans over their " Zionist Jewish occupiers " .
But it also complains of an " international and local conspiracy " against Gaza , implicating Palestine leaders in the West Bank and accusing the Egyptian government of treason ( though without mentioning it by name ) .
The statement then sets out eight " obligations " for the Muslim community - " its religious scholars , its rulers and its peoples " :
• To aid the people of Gaza in rebuilding " what the Zionist aggression destroyed " ; to compensate the injured and support widows and orphans .
• In the delivery of aid and reconstruction , to deal only with Hamas .
• Not to recognise the Palestinian Authority as representative of the Palestinian people .
• To withhold aid from the undeserving or untrustworthy and to punish those who cause " mayhem , negligence and waste " of funds .
• To find a fair formula for reconciliation " between the sons of the Palestinian people " ( ie Fatah and Hamas ) , so as to establish a legitimate authority that will " carry on with jihad and resistance against the occupier until the liberation of all Palestine " .
• To open all crossings in and out of Palestine , giving the Palestinians access to " money , clothing , food , medicine , weapons and other essentials " .
• To regard all those who contribute substantially to the " crimes and brutality " of Israel in the same way as Israel itself .
• To reject and " fight by all means " the sending of foreign warships into Muslim waters on the basis of " claiming to control the borders and prevent the smuggling of arms to Gaza " .
With the endless drone of hate and vitriol spilling out of last weeks CPAC cabal , it 's comforting ( somewhat ) to realize the amped - up hysteria and whining is just what history does , and does over and over .
It 's never civilized , it 's never constructive and it is always based on fear and paranoia .
So it 's mild comfort to know another President faced pretty much the same barrage .
President Roosevelt faced familiar taunts and similar paranoid rants during his re-election campaign in 1936 .
Here is an excerpt from the now - famous Madison Square Garden address of October 31 , 1936 .

Appearing in San Francisco to promote Star Trek , J.J. Abrams told an audience that the team behind Cloverfield is looking at a possible sequel , or follow up movie .
“ We ’re working on one right now , ” Abrams said .
“ The key obviously is with a sequel , certainly with this film , is that it had better not be a business decision .
If you ’re going to do something , it should be because you ’re really inspired to do it .
It does n’t guarantee anything and it does n’t mean that it ’s gonna work , but it means you did what you did and not because you ’re trying to make a buck .
We have an idea for something that ’s pretty cool that we ’re playing with .
It ’s something that would be related to ‘ Cloverfield ’ and hopefully we ’ll do something sooner than later , because the idea ’s pretty sweet . ”
Cloverfield grossed $ 170 million worldwide on a $ 25 million budget .
About the Internet Oracle
The Internet Oracle TM ( aka The Usenet Oracle TM ) is a collective effort at humor by the denizens of the internet .
Questions mailed to the Oracle are forwarded to other Oracle users , who serve as an " incarnation " of the Oracle by providing a witty answer to the question .
The funniest and cleverest answers are selected by the Oracular Priesthood for inclusion in the famous Oracularities , which are posted periodically to the newsgroup rec.humor.oracle .
Discussion of the Oracularities occurs in the newsgroup rec.humor.oracle.d .
Those who do not have access to usenet news can subscribe to the Oracularities mailing list .
Local oracle programs have existed in various places for many years .
Most can trace their origin or influence to Peter Langston 's < psl@acm.org > seminal oracle program which was written for the research V5 Unix system at the Harvard Science Center in 1975 - 76 .
As part of his " psl games " distribution , this original program spread to a number of sites , such as Murray Hill Bell Labs , Interactive Systems and Lucasfilm .
Lars Huttar < huttar@occs.oberlin.edu > used a description of this program to write his oracle program , which was posted to alt . sources in August 1989 .
This program inspired the Usenet Oracle .
Steve Kinzler < steve@kinzler.com > , a systems administrator and graduate student at Indiana University , installed Huttar 's program on silver.ucs.indiana.edu , where it proved to be quite popular .
The best Oracularities were posted to in .bizarre , a group local to Indiana .
Ray Moody < moody@pittpa.cray.com > , a graduate student at Purdue University , after correspondence with Kinzler , wrote the core software for The Internet Oracle TM , a mail - based oracle program to be run on iuvax.cs.indiana.edu for net - wide use , where it proved to be an immediate success .
On 12 March 1996 , it was renamed as The Internet Oracle TM .
Kinzler continued development of the system , adding support for the Oracularities postings and ratings and , eventually , the Oracle Priesthood -- a hardy and loyal band of volunteers who read through the hundreds of questions and answers each week to choose the best for publication .
Jon Monsarrat < jgm@cs.brown.edu > and Randal Schwartz < merlyn@stonehenge.com > also contributed to aspects of the software development .
Michael Nolan < nolan@tssi.com > carried through the newsgroup creation process for the rec.humor.oracle newsgroups .
Scott Panzer < stenor@pcnet.com > and David Sewell < dsewell@virginia.edu > developed and support the Oracle 's presence on the World Wide Web via the Internet Oracle Resource Index .

RALEIGH — North Carolina will build a $ 56 million emergency nerve center in West Raleigh to coordinate the state ’s response to hurricanes , floods , terrorist attacks and other disasters .
[ efoods ]
The new building will serve as headquarters for the N.C. National Guard .
But it will also house the state Division of Emergency Management , the regional communications center for the Highway Patrol and other state agencies .
The center is among the first major public works projects in North Carolina mainly funded by the federal stimulus package , which is designed to jump - start the ailing economy .
About $ 41.5 million of the project ’s cost will be paid with federal stimulus money , and the rest will come from the state .
“ This project is a big win for North Carolina , ” Gov. Beverly Perdue said in a statement .
“ It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs . ”
The 237,000 - square - foot facility will be the state command center where governors and state and federal disaster officials can oversee emergency relief efforts .
Among other things , the new center will have a wall projecting TV - camera views of highway congestion across the state , enabling officials to respond more rapidly to severe traffic tie- ups such as the one that occurred on Interstate 85 near Charlotte during an early March snowstorm .

I 've known
Bob Freeman
since our college days .
And while you can't say he's not a bright , nice guy , one thing has never been at issue :
The guy 's never been hip .
I still remember him at parties talking the ear off anyone who would listen -- a trippy yet wonkish guy named Joe Bene was often on the receiving even at Moravian College , as I recall -- about politics or history or policy .
The rest of us were trashed , but Bob was dealing soberly with big issues .
I assume it was good practice for what he does now , as the wonk 's wonk still does n't miss a moment to dissect a mundane fragment of long - forgotten lawmaking that somehow touched his legislator 's desk in Harrisburg .
But in a highly entertaining , raucous meeting on Tuesday of The Express - Times editorial board -- our boss Joe Owens was fired up before his butt even hit the chair -- Freeman was caught off balance on more than one occasion .
This was n't a civil discussion , which is why it was fun , as voices raised and charges flew with the base premise of the meeting being to discuss the Pennsylvania budget .
Democratic legislators from Northampton County Joe Brennan , Rich Grucela and Freeman made some reasonable points at times but at other times seemed terribly out of touch with the non-Harrisburg world .
When quizzed on the state 's reliance on sin taxes -- video poker is the latest targeted cash cow -- the discussion turned to legalizing marijuana and prostitution , regulating it , taxing it and , for lack of a better word , benefiting from it .
When asked directly if we should legalize pot , Brennan began talking about separating violent from nonviolent offenders in prison and the other legislators seemed to like the direction that would take them -- into talking about prison funding .
That 's not what you were asked , I interrupted .
Would you support the legalization of marijuana in order to pour more tax money into the state budget ?
Freeman 's voice took on a suddenly high pitch and he went off on cocaine addicts running through the streets -- I can only assume he meant if marijuana were legalized .
Refer madness , I guess .
It sounded like something out of sixth - grade health class .
Better to scare than make aware .
As I said , my College Hill neighbor has never been hip .
It was a remarkable if momentary slip of the usual Freeman middle - of - the - road , calm , composed mask .
But let 's deal with the cocaine crazies for a moment .
Marijuana as a gateway drug .
I know a bit about gateway drugs and how they become gateway drugs .
You can consider this a true story .
You 're buying dope from a friend who has been pretty reliable and you 're not shy about dumping some bucks on an ounce or two a month .
You get to know the guy , you hang out some and he says at a party that hey , you want to try some coke ?
It 's a friendly exchange .
No money switching hands .
Sure , you say .
Why not ?
So you do .
And once you try coke , marijuana seems pretty boring .
And it can go from there .
Anyway , the point is the gateway was the dealer , not the initial drug .
You tried it because he made it available .
You probably would n't have gone looking for it .
And for someone with an addictive personality , a drug such as coke can make you pretty crazy .
Consider the alternative .
You go into a state store and you buy your ounce of premium pot .
It costs a bit more , because it 's taxed and regulated , but it 's purity is n't in question .
And while the clerk may suggest a nice Merlot for the bong instead of water , he 's probably not going to suggest cocaine .
It 's not on the menu and the guy likes his state job with all its perks .
And the odd thing about Freeman and his outburst is Bob can tell you a lot about beer or wine .
Which is not a complaint because it 's been legal since 1933 .
But what Bob might not get is you 're far more likely to buy some coke in a bar to offset the depressing effects of alcohol than you are to seek out coke if you smoke a joint at home .
It would be far too much effort if you were stoned already .
It 's the same reason people who seldom smoke cigarettes smoke them while drinking .
The kick from the nicotine balances the downer of booze .
Coke and drinking also go together because both , in controlled amounts , make you appear more social .
Toking up at home or even in a smoke shop would simply make you introspective and eventually hungry .
But should we ban booze to keep people from snorting coke ?
Ain't gonna happen .
And , anyway , we tried that .
The bad guys made all the money and there was no guarantee the hooch did n't come from your neighbor 's car radiator .
So , Pennsylvania -- if it really wants to save a ton of money on prisons , cut down on the gateway drug problem and score a ton of tax cash -- should legalize , tax and regulate marijuana .
Make the smoking age 18 and get ready for a surge in sales of Grateful Dead music on iTunes .
What a long , strange trip it's been .
Missed Soccer Goal !
Worst Ever
Total Pro Sports – Thankfully You Tube has provided us another great soccer video .
So if you thought last weeks , Gremio ’s Jonas Triple Miss was bad then you definitely have seen nothing yet .
This time we bring you one of the most embarrassing soccer misses of all time .
Unfortunately we have no idea who the two teams are and who the player is missing the open opportunity .
The ball is kicked on net from a very bad angle , stopped by the goalie and is deflected to the waiting player .
The waiting unknown player gets a little tied up , misses the ball through his legs , trips over his own feet and ca n’t finish on a glorious opportunity .
Madin Mohammed would have easily scored this goal , embarrassed ?
I recommend a career change , maybe he should try an office job or something on those lines .
Enjoy the video below .

Small city vehicles are something that are just now beginning to catch on .
While there are a few available on the market , many people are waiting for them become more mainstream .
Hyundai hopes to help bring the city vehicle into the spotlight with a new concept that uses technology from MIT that produces oxygen as a byproduct .
The design came from the mind of Nicholas Stone , a recent graduate of the College for Creative Studies .
His design is for a small four seat city car that uses no fossil fuel whatsoever .
Power for the Hyundai City Car comes from the sun , but not it the normal fashion we are used to .
The process begins by placing transparent solar panels on the outside of the vehicle and collecting solar energy .
From there , electricity is generated and fed to an electric motor to power the wheels .
However , the electricity is also used to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The hydrogen is stored to be used later , while the oxygen is allowed to flow out of the vehicle .
Sound familiar ?
It should , because the same process happens all around you every day .
The technology is called " artificial photosynthesis " and was designed by the brilliant minds at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
According the designer , Daniel Nocera , the benefits of the system are twofold .
First , the oxygen will be replenishing the city 's air , which can become very polluted very quickly .
Secondly , if the need arises , some of the oxygen can be pumped back into the cabin to help the driver if they need a little extra boost of energy .
If this concept will ever see production is anyone 's guess , but if it does it will be interesting to see how big of a difference the added oxygen will be able to make .
At least nobody will fall asleep at the wheel .

The " NVIDIA is secretly working on an x86 chip " rumor that Charlie at the Inquirer has been flogging since at least 2006 has just been given a major boost , and by none other than NVIDIA itself .
A bit -tech .net reporter was in the audience at a recent Morgan Stanley Technology Conference , when NVIDIA VP Mike Hara seemed to indicate that the company is considering developing a x86 CPU for the mobile space sometime in the next two years .
I 've always been a major doubter of the NVIDIA - produced x86 rumors , though I know at least one other tech reporter besides Charlie who 's sold on the story .
But Hara 's remarks make it fairly clear that the company is indeed headed in this direction .
Based on what Hara said , it seems that NVIDIA would be looking to do a Tegra - like SoC design , but one that pairs an x86 core with an NVIDIA GPU ( as opposed to Tegra 's ARM + GPU pairing ) .
Why would NVIDIA do this ?
Because , as a recent and widely linked Jon Peddie report correctly points out , the integrated graphics processor ( IGP ) will eventually go away , as integrated GPUs move off of the chipset and onto the processor die .
IGPs are a huge and very successful part of NVIDIA 's volume business , and the company can't afford to see that segment left solely to Intel at a future date when all mobile x86 processors come with an on - board GPU .
Can NVIDIA compete ?
Now that Intel has announced that it will be using TSMC as a fab source for some future Atom designs , the idea of an NVIDIA x86 SoC does n't seem as bad as it previously did .
NVIDIA is a TSMC customer , so their hypothetical SoC would have process parity with an Intel - made Atom SoC .
And given the former company 's embedded GPU prowess , and the latter 's lack thereof , it 's not unreasonable to imagine that the NVIDIA SoC could outperform the Intel SoC for most of the media - centric applications that both parts would likely find use in .
I confess that I do n't at all understand the x86 licensing situation , so I do n't feel that I can weigh in on the legality of the hypothetical NVIDIA part .
But if Intel wants to win customers in the smartphone space eventually , it might be best for them to just leave NVIDIA alone to make whatever it likes .
I suggest this because the fact that SoC x86 processors are sole - source now — meaning that you only get them from Intel , and even when they come from TSMC Intel will still exercise a ton of control — is a strike against them vs. ARM .
If a smartphone maker like Nokia goes with ARM , then it can choose from a variety of suppliers like TI or Qualcomm .
This competition among sources is healthy and gets the handset maker a lower price ; it also guarantees a supply of ARM chips , because if one supplier goes under you can just move on to the next .
Intel can't offer this with x86 , but NVIDIA as a credible second source of x86 mobile parts might be enough to get the world 's most successful ISA into the phone market .
It ’s a murder mystery that has puzzled a Los Feliz neighborhood since 1959 .
The criminal - case part was solved quickly enough .
Homicide investigators found that Dr. Harold Perelson bludgeoned his wife to death with a ball - peen hammer , savagely beat their 18 - year - old daughter and then fatally poisoned himself by gulping a glass of acid .
Authorities removed two other children from the sprawling hillside estate that overlooks downtown Los Angeles , locked the front door to the 5,050 - square - foot mansion , and left .
Fifty years later , the Glendower Place home remains empty .

The estate ’s terraced grounds are pockmarked by gopher holes and overgrown with grass that sprouted after recent rains — growth that neighbors know will turn brown when summer returns .
A pond is partly filled with rainwater .
Weeds poke through cracks in a curving asphalt driveway .
On the outside , the mansion itself appears to be slowly decaying .
Through grimy , cracked windows , one can see dust - covered furniture , including a 1950s - style television set , seemingly frozen in time .
What appear to be gaily wrapped Christmas gifts sit on a table .
And in the hills near the Greek Theatre , the questions linger :
Advertisement
Why has the current owner kept the home as it was on Dec. 6 , 1959 ?
Will another family ever again bring life to the estate once described in a sales ad as “ beautiful ” and “ delightful ” ?
Built in 1925 , the three - story Spanish revival - style home has a basement that boasts a maid ’s quarters .
The first floor features an entrance hall flanked by a glassed - in conservatory and large living room .
Toward the back is a den , a dining room and the kitchen .
Four master - bedroom - size sleeping chambers are on the second floor .
A bar - equipped ballroom measuring 20 feet by 36 feet is on the third level .
Real estate experts have suggested that the mansion , with its spectacular view of the Los Angeles Basin and the Palos Verdes Peninsula , could fetch as much as $ 2.9 million if sold .

“ No one has lived there since the murders , ” said Dr. Cheri Lewis , who grew up across the street from the mansion and still lives in the neighborhood .
Lewis vividly remembers the predawn morning when Perelson , 50 , killed his 42 - year - old wife , Lillian , and severely beat his teenage daughter .
When two younger children were awakened by the victims ’ screams , Perelson told them they were simply having a bad dream , his youngest daughter told police .
“ Go back to bed .
This is a nightmare , ” he told 11 - year - old Debbie .
She and her 13 - year - old brother , Joel , escaped injury .
Eighteen - year - old Judye Perelson ran from the mansion and staggered to a neighbor ’s house .
She was treated at Central Receiving Hospital and then taken to General Hospital with a possible skull fracture , The Times would report the next day .

“ Judye came to our door .
I remember having my hand in her blood , ” recalls Lewis , now a Beverly Hills dentist .
“ I used to baby - sit the children there .
I was supposed to spend the next night there , in fact . ”
Police found Perelson lying dead on the floor next to his wife ’s blood - soaked bed .
He was still clutching the hammer .
On a nightstand next to his bed , investigators found an open copy of Dante ’s “ Divine Comedy , ” which was opened to Canto 1 .
“ Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark , for the straightforward pathway had been lost . . . , ” read the passage .

Detectives speculated that Perelson , a physician affiliated with an Inglewood medical clinic , was distressed by financial difficulties .
In Judye Perelson ’s sports car , police found a note written to an aunt that told of the family being “ on the merry - go - round again , same problems , same worries , only tenfold .
My parents , so to speak , are in a bind financially . ”
The teenager spoke of getting a job to help the family out .
After the rampage , relatives took the younger Perelson children to the East Coast , Lewis said .
The current whereabouts of the three are unknown .
The story of the murder - suicide and the locked - up mansion has been told and retold ever since , each time a newcomer moves into the neighborhood or when visitors come upon it .

House painter Steve Kalupski was puzzled one summer day eight years ago when he glanced over at the mansion from a neighboring dwelling where he was working .
Through a grimy window , he said he could see gifts piled next to what in the dimness appeared to be a Christmas tree .
“ I asked the owner of the home where we were working why it was there , and she told me the story , ” said Kalupski , a Hollywood resident who now is an ad agency producer .
His friends did n’t believe him when he told them what he ’d seen .
So he began a ritual of driving them to the Los Feliz hillside to show them the abandoned mansion .
He took Hollywood Internet entrepreneur Babette Papaj there two months ago .
“ It was dark and scary .
I was afraid to get out of the car , ” she said .
Neighboring Glendower Place resident Sheree Waterson said a friend of hers tried one night to check out the mansion in what she describes as “ a Nancy Drew moment . ”

The woman pushed open a rear door and walked in , but she did n’t get far before a burglar alarm went off .
She turned around and left , joking later about “ ghosts ” when she returned to Waterson ’s home .
Soon , her hand was throbbing painfully .
“ She ’d been bitten by a black widow .
There was a red vein going up her arm .
She had to go to the doctor , ” said Waterson , a clothing company executive .
“ Two nights later the alarm kept going off at my house on my back door .
But there was no one there .
It was like the ghost was following us . ”
A year after the murders , in 1960 , the mansion was sold in a probate action to a Lincoln Heights couple , Emily and Julian Enriquez .
Neighbors remember that the pair visited the house and brought property there to store but did n’t move in .

In time , the place gradually fell into disrepair .
Antique light fixtures dating from the 1920s disappeared from the outside .
Over the years , neighbors say they have helped maintain the property by painting a street - side garage and tidying up the frontyard .
They placed a chain across a driveway that leads to the rear of the mansion , giving each nearby resident a key to its lock .
Several years ago the city required current owner Rudy Enriquez to replace stucco that had peeled from the sides of the house and front walkway walls and to repaint the place , neighbors say .
“ We had major problems . , ” explained Jude Margolis , a former neighborhood resident who now lives in Hancock Park .

“ Hookers were coming in .
Everybody was bringing guests up there .
One night I was sitting outside and I noticed that people were over there having a picnic in the backyard , ” said Margolis , an artist .
( The burglar alarm was installed after that . )
Enriquez inherited the mansion when his mother died in 1994 .
Since then , he has been approached many times by potential buyers but has steadfastly refused to sell .
He tells everyone he has n’t decided what he wants to do with the property .
“ I asked him why not lease it , at least .
You ca n’t have a house sit empty for 50 years and not expect it to fall apart .
It ’s a tear - down now .
It ’s a shame , ” Margolis said .
Enriquez never invited her into the mansion when he visited it .
Another neighbor , Steven Hurley , has never been inside , either .

“ There are all kinds of stories about the house .
Rudy ’s a very nice man .
He ’s just not interested in doing anything with that house .
He ’s never going to sell it , ” said Hurley , a lighting company sales manager .
Enriquez , a 77 - year - old retired music store manager who lives in the Mount Washington area , said he remains uncertain about his plans .
“ I do n’t know that I want to live there or even stay here , ” he said .
He might relocate to Hawaii or Arizona , he added .
But it has nothing to do with the mansion ’s violent past .
“ I ’ve never looked at it as being haunted , ” he said .
“ For a time I had two cats inside there and I had to go often to feed them .
I still go there often — I was there last night , in fact .
I think now I ’ll be going more often .

“ The only spooky thing there is me .
Tell people to say their prayers every morning and evening and they ’ll be OK . ”

The year was 1982 .
Argentina and the United Kingdom went to war over some South Atlantic islands with a combined population of some 3000 Britons and half a million sheep .
The Commodore 64 was the big news in personal computers .
New Order was in the studio recording what would become the biggest selling 12 ” of all time .
And the Idaho state legislature was revising its traffic code .
At that time , minor traffic offenses in Idaho were criminal offenses ; the legislative revision was a streamlining program aimed at reducing most of these minor offenses from misdemeanors to “ civil public offenses . ”
Carl Bianchi was a cyclist ; he was also the Administrative Director of the Courts in Idaho , and would later serve as the first Director of Legislative Services for the Idaho State legislature .
In his professional capacity , Bianchi had been approached by magistrates with complaints that law enforcement was ticketing cyclists for failure to come to a complete , foot - down stop .
Magistrates considered these technical violations to be functional and common cycling behavior , but under the law , they had no option but to fine cyclists for these violations .
Bianchi and the magistrates who were bringing these concerns to him felt that these “ technical violations ” were unnecessarily cluttering the courts .
In each of the two previous years , bills to modernize the state ’s bicycle laws had been introduced and failed .
When the legislature initiated its revision of the state ’s traffic code , Bianchi saw an opportunity to attach a modernized bicycle law onto the larger revision of the traffic code ; with the assistance of cyclists and judicial officials , Bianchi agreed to draft a new bicycle code .
Bianchi ’s draft brought the bicycle code into close conformity with the Uniform Vehicle Code , with new provisions allowing cyclists to take the lane , or to merge left , when appropriate .
Addressing the concerns of the state ’s magistrates , the draft also contained a provision that allowed cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign — the so - called “ rolling stop law . ”
Although the draft law was an improvement over the existing law , Carl Bianchi wrote then that the provision allowing rolling stops was quietly opposed by the League of American Bicyclists ( known then as the League of American Wheelmen ) , but did not want to raise the issue in the legislature .
According to Bianchi , Pat Riceci , the League ’s Legislative Representative for the state , explained :
I was looking at ten things that I liked and one that I did n’t .
We all have hidden agendas .
I wanted that position on the roadway wording real bad , and I was willing to bend elsewhere to get it .
The danger the League faced was that opposing the rolling stop provision in the legislature would invite closer scrutiny and debate of the bicycle law ’s other provisions .
“ Besides , ” Riceci explained at the time ,
I ’m not adamantly opposed to the rolling stop law .
I ’m willing to compromise and see if it works .
[ NOTE : I recently discussed the passage of the Idaho legislation with Riceci via email .
He does not recall having been the League ’s state legislative representative at that time , nor does he recall being opposed , either actively or passively , to the legislation — in fact , as he recalls , it was “ just the opposite . ”
Regardess of whether or not the reports at that time were correct , it is clear that there was at least some difference of opinion within the League , with John Allen and League vice president John Forester in support of the legislation , and National Legislative Director Ralph Hirsch , and possibly Pat Riceci , expressing their misgivings . ]
The revised bicycle law was included in the larger bill revising the traffic code , and this time , was passed by the legislature .
Although Riceci was willing to give the new law a try , he nevertheless felt that cycling advocates should not “ be asking for more than autos are given . ”
Former rolling stop supporter Jack Gillette , then - President of the Boise Bicycle Commuters Association , agreed with that position , arguing that “ Bicyclists want the same rights as drivers , and maybe they should have the same duties . ”
The League ’s state representative was not alone in expressing doubts about the rolling stop law ; law enforcement officers were concerned about the wisdom of allowing children to roll through intersections .
Idaho State Police Sgt. Doug Kramer asked
If we do n’t let people drive cars until they are 16 , and then still do n’t let them use their judgment at an intersection , how can we let a small child exercise that judgment at an intersection ?
The problem , Boise Police Sgt. Doug Kraemer noted , is that “ You ca n’t design laws for the skilled minority . ”
Addressing that same concern , former rolling stop supporter Jack Gillette observed
We have to make laws for the lowest common denominator , and the lowest common denominator is still a kid .
Taking the opposite point of view , Eric Guise , the former Ada County Bicycle Coordinator , argued that
The basic philosophy should be to design the laws for the most competent rider or commuter .
Bicycle codes should be designed to allow bicycles to travel within the city more swiftly and easily , so that bikes can play a significant role in the transportation system .
Conservation of energy is paramount to moving about on a bike .
Overcoming inertia is the key .
Bikers try to keep moving , and increasing the number of stops makes it harder for a rider to progress .
Most riders do not now stop .
Countering that perspective , John Williams , editor - in - chief of Bicycling Forum magazine argued that
The “ momentum ” argument is garbage .
If the stop signs are located for good reasons ( not always the case ) , then conservation of momentum should take a back seat to other considerations .
If the stop signs were not located for good reasons , then cyclists and motorists should unite to get them removed .
A different problem with the new law was raised by Ralph Hirsch , then National Legislative Director for the League :
The new law lacked a “ presumption of fault ” clause .
This clause , present in the Uniform Vehicle Code ’s treatment of yield signs , specified that if a motorist drives past a yield sign , and is involved in a collision in the intersection , “ such collision shall be prima facie evidence of his failure to yield the right of way . ”
This means that it is presumed that the motorist failed to yield the right of way , but the motorist can rebut that presumption with the introduction of contradictory evidence .
Because the new “ stop as yield ” law in Idaho did not contain a “ presumption of fault ” clause , Hirsch argued that determinations of fault would be more difficult to establish .
By then , the law had been passed , and as debate still raged as to whether or not it was a good idea , both sides wondered if it would survive the year .
It did , and then some …
Postscript
By 2005 , Idaho ’s “ stop as yield ” law had been on the books for twenty - two years .
It had only undergone one revision , in 1988 , when a provision authorizing bicycle safety education programs was eliminated from the codified statute .
In 2005 , a new issue came to the fore .
As originally written , the law allowed cyclists to roll through red lights if they were making a right turn , or a left turn onto a one - way highway ; Idaho law enforcement officials felt that the law needed to be clarified in regards to a cyclist ’s duties when proceeding straight or turning left through an intersection controlled by a red light .
The Idaho legislature agreed with law enforcement , amending the statute to specify that cyclists must stop on red and yield before proceeding straight through the intersection , and before turning left at an intersection .
The revision took effect in 2006 .
Aside from those two minor revisions , the law has remained in effect for a quarter of a century now .
Today , following on the heels of Idaho ’s quarter century of experience with allowing cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs , other states are considering adopting an Idaho - style “ stop as yield ” law .
In the next article in this series , we ’ll begin to examine this growing momentum .
For previous articles in this series , see :
Braking Story - The Idaho “ Stop As Yield ” Law ( January 25 , 2009 )
Legally Speaking - Stop As Yield ( January 22 , 2009 )

I was alerted to this Media Matters post , revealing that people still do n’t get why the current slump is different from the early 1980s , and why fiscal policy is necessary this time .
Yes , I know , it ’s Joe Scarborough ; but still …
Anyway , it ’s the zero lower bound , stupid .
And here ’s the picture to make the point :
The second new poll of the day is ICM ’s monthly tracker for the Guardian .
This is has topline figures , with changes from their last poll , of CON 42%( nc ) , LAB 30 %( nc ) , LDEM 20 % ( +2 ) .
Clearly , as with the YouGov poll at the weekend , there is very little change indeed here .
If one assumes this mornings MORI poll is something of a return to normalcy after some outlying figures , we really do have a very static and very uniform picture across the pollsters , with the Tories in the low 40s and Labour at or just above 30 .
The variation , as usual , is in the level of Lib Dem support , which differs for various reasons ( not least , 13 % of ICM ’s sample was made up of people who claim they voted Lib Dem in 2005 , while only 9.3 % of MORI ’s was – there are 40 % more Lib Dems in the sample to begin with ) .
Putting the voting intention question aside though , there is a possibly more important finding – ICM ’s semi-regular “ time for change ” question .
As I ’ve said here before , that ’s a powerful message , the sort of narrative that sweeps governments from office ( ICM ’s Nick Sparrow once wrote that there were only really four really powerful messages in politics and all election campaigns boiled down to them – “ Let us finish the job ” , “ Their policies wo n’t work ” , “ Do n’t let them ruin it ” and “ Time for a change ” ) .
Back in September 2006 70 % of people thought it was time for a change .
After the handover to Gordon Brown ICM asked the same question in August 2007 and found 55 % thought it was time for a change , still high , but a significant drop : clearly some people ’s desire for change had been met .
In November 2008 the question was asked again during the “ second Brown bounce ” and 58 % thought it was time for a change .
Today the figure stands at 69 % – pretty much back where it was before Tony Blair ’s resignation .
Before we begin , a pre-emptive disclaimer .
Please accept that I pose the ensuing quartet of questions with no intention to insult you .
As Independent readers , you are le crème de la crème of the intelligentsia .
I know you know the answers , and ask them solely because of the light they cast on the quality of those who rule us .
Right , here we go .
1 ) What was the married name of the scientists Marie and Pierre who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903 for their research into radiation ?
2 ) Which fortress was built in the 1370s to defend one of the gates of Paris , and was later used as a state prison by Cardinal Richelieu ?
3 ) Who succeeded to the English throne aged nine on the death of his father Henry VIII in 1547 ?
And 4 ) Which country 's Rose Revolution of 2003 led to the resignation of President Edward Shevardnadze ?
John Humphrys put these and others to higher education minister David Lammy , star of Tuesday 's Today programme , on Celebrity Mastermind last December .
How I resisted the ague of stupefaction the answers induced long enough to press the record button is a mystery .
Raw courage , I guess .
But thank God I did , because this general knowledge round is a godsend .
Whether the performance of Mr Lammy , who cites " curiosity " among his likes , is sensible cause for jollity is for you to judge , but in a perverse way it cheers me up whenever the melancholy strikes .

All right , enough suspense .
Here are Mr Lammy 's answers .
1 ) Antoinette .
The Nobel physics Laureates of 1903 were , according to our advanced learning supremo , Pierre and Marie Antoinette .
If that seems a Curie - ous reply , stand by for 2 ) .
Versailles .
Quite a swanky jail in which to await the guillotine , even by French revolutionary standards , but there it is .
Bastille our beating hearts , though , for here comes 3 ) .
Henry VII .
Henry VIII was succeeded on the throne , by way of a tear in the fabric of space - time , not by his son Edward VI but his late sire .
Mr Lammy shook his head despairingly at that one , but showed no remorse for 4 ) .
The country of which Mr Shevardnadze ceased to be president in 2003 was , he told us , having taken advantage of the extra thinking time gifted by the end - of - round beeps , Yugoslavia .
Now making every allowance for nerves caused by the black chair , we 'll write off Antoinette as a slip of the tongue , and try to forget Versailles and the time - travelling Henry VII .
Any residual stores of charity are drained , however , by 4 ) .
How could a minister of state , for higher education or paperclips , be unaware that Yugoslavia dissolved in the early 1990s ?
By what savage irony did he imagine that Europe 's most vicious warfare since 1945 could be styled the " Rose Revolution " ?
How did that major global figure Shevardnadze , whose name could only come from Georgia ( the former Soviet state , Mr L ; not the one on Ray Charles 's mind ) , pass him by ?
If it seems incredible , it is all the more so because Mr Lammy has a Masters in law from Harvard , alma mater of President Obama with whom he claims friendship .
Can any of us have such a stellar qualification and tend , to put it generously , towards the dim ?
Yes we can , judging by Tuesday 's Today interview .
Although a presumably sated Mr Humphrys did n't conduct it , he was a Lammy to the slaughter all the same as an heroically patient Sarah Montague teased from him a performance to provoke the heavily tranquilised Zen master known to brother monks as " Old Softie " into pummelling the wall until the knuckles gushed blood .
Did the minister accept the argument of our universities , who have floated the idea of raising annual tuition fees to £ 5,000 , that they need more money ?
" Well , I think the universities have done a piece of work which is about scenarios ... within that piece of work ... actually one of the scenarios is that it remains the same , " he said .
" The universities are rightly preparing for an independent review ... "
But do you agree , asked Sarah , with the basic premise that they need more cash ?
" Look , I do n't want to get into what will rightly be the scenarios when we begin the independent review .
But I would say ... "
Yes but forget the review , she interrupted as exasperation finally began to flirt with her larynx , do you agree they need more money ?
" Look , " said Mr Lammy , understandably irritated himself now at being expected , as minister for higher education , to have an opinion about higher education , " it 's a bit like asking a farmer whether he needs more land . "
Answers on the traditional postcard , please , you cryptographers out there .
In the absence of the Enigma machine , Mr Lammy 's Agrarian Code remains uncrackable to me .
He then accused Ms Monatague of pursuing him on the point not on behalf of school pupils who might want a steer as to whether they 'll be able to afford the higher of education for which , lest I forgot to mention this , he is minister ; but rather in a cynical BBC hunt for " banner headlines " .
Even by the standards of Mrs Bottomley in the dog days of Major , even compared to the " I 've already been very clear ... " obfuscatory gibberish spewed by Hazel Blears herself , this was a display of psychosis - inducing obtuseness and complacency .
I 'd call it a calculated insult to the public 's intelligence , of the sort disclaimed above , but it's hard to accuse someone who answered " Henry VII " to 3 ) of being able to calculate anything at all .
How did it come to this ?
How did this country come to be governed by people whose knowledge of everything from fourth - form history to popular culture , sport and even cheese ( the blue variety served with port , he posited , is Red Leicester ) verges on the non-existent ?
So many questions , so few answers .
If whether higher education needs more funding or not is yet another to stump David Lammy , so be it .
It 's in excellent company .
But if our universities should shortly join every other once - revered British institution on the one - way journey past the U - bend , we should be able to make a fair old stab at answering why .

git clone git://github.com/lethain/django-springsteen.git django-springsteen
Now we 're going to salvage some relevant pieces of django - springsteen 's repository , adapt them to our new purposes , and throw away the rest .
mv django - springsteen/example_project / ./djangosearch mv django-springsteen/springsteen / djangosearch / rm -rf django- springsteen
Next we want to grab a recent Django tarball from djangoproject.com /download /. tar - xvf Django -1.0.2-final.tar mv Django - 1.0.2-final /django/ ./ rm - rf Django - 1.0.2-* rm - rf django/bin django/contrib/admin django/contrib/auth rm -rf django/contrib/databrowse django/test rm -rf django/contrib/admindocs django/contrib/gis
( We need to remove these files to get under the 1000 file limit for Google App Engine .
You can also do some file zipping magic to get around it , but this approach is a bit simpler . )
Actually , django - springsteen pretty much works with Django 0.96 except for using the safe template filter in some of the templates .
If you 're willing to strip it out , then you could skip installing a more recent version of Django .
And next we need to scavenge several pieces from the django_example for Google App Engine .
First create the djangosearch / main .py file with these contents .
import logging , os , sys # Google App Engine imports .
from google.appengine.ext.webapp import util # Remove the standard version of Django .
for k in [ k for k in sys .
modules if k .
startswith ( ' django ' ) ] : del sys .
modules [ k ] #
Force sys.path to have our own directory first , in case we want to import # from it .
sys .
path .
insert ( 0 , os .
path .
abspath ( os . path .
dirname ( __file__ ) ) ) #
Must set this env var * before * importing any part of Django os .
environ [ ' DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE ' ] = ' settings ' import django.core.handlers.wsgi def main ( ) : # Create a Django application for WSGI .
application = django .
core .
handlers .
wsgi .
WSGIHandler () # Run the WSGI CGI handler with that application .
util .
run_wsgi_app ( application ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : main ()
Next we need to create the djangosearch / app.yaml file .
( Be sure to replace djangosearch with the name of the application you registered . ) application : djangosearch version : 1 runtime : python api_version : 1 handlers : - url : /static static_dir : static - url : /.* script : main.py
And finally djangosearch / index .yaml .
indexes : # AUTOGENERATED #
This index .yaml is automatically updated whenever the dev_appserver # detects that a new type of query is run .
If you want to manage the # index .
yaml file manually , remove the above marker line ( the line # saying " # AUTOGENERATED " ) .
If you want to manage some indexes # manually , move them above the marker line .
The index . yaml file is # automatically uploaded to the admin console when you next deploy # your application using appcfg.py .
Next open up djangosearch / local_settings.py and add these at the bottom .
ROOT_URLCONF = 'urls '
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
= ( ' django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware ' , ' django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware ' , ) INSTALLED_APPS = ( ' springsteen ' ,) DATABASE_ENGINE = None DATABASE_NAME
= None CACHE_BACKEND
= " dummy : /// "
Create the djangosearch / boss_settings.py file , which contains only the BOSS_APP_ID parameter , and AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY if you have one .
( You 'll need to sign up here and here to get a AWS Affiliate ID if you want Amazon search results , which is the uninspired man 's choice for monetizing a Springsteen service out of the box . )
BOSS_APP_ID = " abcdefghijlknop "
Tweak the djangosearch / urls.py file to remove all references to example_project , as well as removing the extra url patterns .
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r'^$ ' , ' views.search ' ) , )
Time out .
Let 's pick a topic for our new search engine .
Hmm ... hmm ....
Okay , let 's make it a search engine that is specialized on Apple products .
What could go wrong ?
Next let 's configure our search results .
Go ahead and open up djangosearch / views.py , and start by removing everything .
Start rebuilding by adding these imports : from springsteen.views import search as default_search from springsteen .
services import Web , TwitterLinkSearchService , AmazonProductService from django.conf import settings
Next let 's create our Amazon product service ( if you have an Amazon Affiliates AWS key ) .
class ComputerAmazonSearch ( AmazonProductService ) : _access_key = settings .
AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY
_topic = ' apple '
Followed by creating an Apple flavored Twitter service .
class AppleTwitterService ( TwitterLinkSearchService ) : _qty = 3 _topic = ' apple '
Finally we just need to mix in web results from Yahoo !
BOSS and then expose our new search engine .
def search ( request , timeout = 2500 , max_count = 10 ) : services = ( ComputerAmazonSearch , AppleTwitterService , Web ) return default_search ( request , timeout , max_count , services )
A Short Warning Please note that Yahoo !
BOSS search results wo n't be retrieved successfully when you are testing your springsteen application locally .
However , they will be correctly retrieved once you push your app to production .
I 'll look into some kind of patch for this , but no need to panic .
At this point we have everything working correctly , but results are just stacked on top of each other .
Sure , you might love having those Amazon affiliate links clustered at the top , but your users might not .
Now 's a nice time to dip our toes into relevency .
You want the most relevant results to bubble to the top ( feel free to make a bubble sort pun ) , but naively stacking results from different services does n't permit that unless all results from source A are more relevant than those from source B , all results from B are more relevant than those from source C and so on .
Let 's take a stab at a very simple relevency algorithm to address these problems .
You can think of two kinds of relevency approachs : Scoring results on their individual merits .
We might call this intrinsic relevance .
Scoring results in regard to each other .
We might call this contextual relevance .
We 're going to do a little bit of both here .
First we 're going to boost results which contain the query term in their title , and second we 're going to punish the 2nd - Nth results from an already encountered domain .
Place this code in views .py above the search function .
def ranking ( query , results ) : query = query .
lower ( ) def rank ( result ) : score = 0.0 title = result [ ' title ' ] . lower ( ) if title in query : score += 1.0 return score scored = [ ( rank ( x ) , x ) for x in results ] scored2 = [ ] domains = {} for score , result in scored : domain = result [ 'url ' ] . replace ( ' http://' , '' ) . split ( '/' ) [ 0 ] times_viewed = domains .
get ( domain , 0 ) new_score = score + times_viewed * - 0.1 scored2 . append ( ( new_score , result ) ) domains [ domain ] = times_viewed + 1 scored2 . sort ( ) return [ x [ 1 ] for x in scored2 ]
And then update the search function to use this ranking function .
def search ( request , timeout = 2500 , max_count = 10 ) : services = ( AppleAmazonSearch , AppleTwitterService , Web ) return default_search ( request , timeout , max_count , services , {} , ranking )
Now our results are ranked using the above ranking function .
This is a pretty basic approach to relevancy , but hopefully shows the basic concepts .
Now we have our search engine up and running , and is a good time to customize your site 's templates .
First make a templates directory within djangosearch , as well as a templates / springsteen directory and a few empty files .
cd djangosearch mkdir templates templates / springsteen touch templates / base.html touch templates / springsteen/base.html
Then let 's edit the templates / base . html file .
<!
DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < html > < head > < title > { % block title %} FruitySearch { % endblock %} </ title > < link rel= " stylesheet " type= " text/css " href= " / static/css/reset.css " >
< link rel= " stylesheet " type= " text/css " href= " / static/css/search.css " > </ head > < body > < div id= " body " > < div id= " hd " >< h1 > < a href= " / " > FruitySearch
</a></h1></div> { % block body % }{ % endblock %} < div id= " ft " >< p> A < a href= " " > Your - Name - Here </a > production , 2009 .
</p></div> </div> </body > </html >
Next edit templates / springsteen / base .html ( this one if pretty brief ) .
{ % extends " base.html " %} { % block body %}{ % endblock %}
As you continue customizing the appearance of your results , you 'll probably want to override ` templates / springsteen / results .
html , but for the time being it should be a reasonable default .
Create some CSS to style the site .
cd djangosaerch mkdir static static / css
The current base . html assumes you 'll have reset.css and search.css files .
Recently I tend to use YUI 's reset.css , and just mashed together some custom stylings for search.css .
Warmer temperatures are making access to the Arctic easier
Russia has announced plans to set up a military force to protect its interests in the Arctic .
In a document published on its national security council 's website , Moscow says it expects the Arctic to become its main resource base by 2020 .
While the strategy is thought to have been approved in September , it has only now been made public .
Moscow 's ambitions are likely to cause concern among other countries with claims to the Arctic .
' Military security '
The document foresees the Arctic becoming Russia 's main source of oil and gas within the next decade .
In order to protect its assets , Moscow says one of its main goals will be the establishment of troops " capable of ensuring military security " in the region .
With climate change opening up the possibility of making drilling viable in previously inaccessible areas , the Arctic has gained in strategic importance for Russia , says the BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow .
Russia 's moment of Arctic triumph in 2007 was captured on film
However , Russia 's arctic ambitions have already put those with competing claims on the defensive .
In 2007 , a Russian expedition planted a Russian flag on the seabed beneath the North Pole .
Russia , Canada , Denmark , Norway and the United States , all of whom have an Arctic coastline , dispute the sovereignty over parts of the region .
With an estimated 90 billion untapped barrels of oil , Russia 's strategy is likely to be scrutinised carefully by its neighbours in the far north .

Strangely Enough
The story about the whistling that Ethel tells was an embellishment on my vague recollection of what i remembered as an urban legend that i read when i was a kid .
Since then i eventually tracked down the story , " The Whistle , ” by C.B. Colby , which was first printed in the collection , ( Scholastic , 1963 ) a book which was itself compiled of allegedly true stories originally published in C. B. Colby 's newspaper column “ Adventure Today , ” which itself may have been sourced from a radio program in which people called in with ghost stories .
I have no idea if it's an urban legend or not , basically , but Colby 's ( re ) telling of the story is where i got the idea from .

KDE is about the community , rather than the product .
It is not all about the code : there are many other ways in which people can be part of KDE , and a very simple way is to connect with other people .
In an effort to bridge the gap between users and developers , the KDE Community Forums have launched a new initiative to coordinate feature requests .
A new " Brainstorm " section has been created in the KDE Community Forums : users are encouraged to post requests there .
Once a wish has been filed , it is reviewed by the forum staff to filter out duplicates , spam , and the like .
Upon approval , other forum users can approve or disapprove the idea .
Every few months , the highest - voted features will then be submitted to the developers as feature enhancement requests .
Of course , there will be no guarantee a feature will get implemented , but proposals made this way will be more focused , reducing the noise for both developers and users and leading to a better relationship between the two worlds .
This is a first public test run .
In order to provide the best experience possible , we encourage everyone to come to the forums , make use of the system , and leave feedback .
Do not forget that KDE Brainstorm is meant to accept suggestions on new features only : crashes or unexpected program behaviors are bugs and should be reported to KDE 's Bugzilla instead .
If you feel creative , this is the time to show your skill to the world .
The Brainstorm forum is waiting for you !
In an article in the Guardian last month , I criticised an effort by a group of scientists and activists to cast aside the consensus view of thousands of scientists from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The group is organising an emergency summit on global warming in Copenhagen this month .
The organiser calls the IPCC 's work " wishy - washy " and says her conference is " not a regular scientific conference .
This is a deliberate attempt to influence policy . "
Vital decisions on climate change should not be based on the political activism of a few , but on the careful work by the IPCC .
The IPCC works within a well - established , hugely respected framework that ensures all the scientific arguments are considered .
I pointed out that one conference participant , Stefan Rahmstorf , argues that sea level rises will be much higher than those anticipated by most researchers .
Rahmstorf is a well - established , serious researcher on climate change who holds a minority view on the rise in the sea - level — the IPCC 's estimate is an 18 cm to 59 cm rise by the end of the century .
I mentioned him to make the point that meeting with like - minded colleagues does not somehow create a new global scientific consensus .
In his response , Rahmstorf labels me a " spin-doctor " who is " fooling the public " .
Often , such strong language can belie poor arguments .
In this case , I believe that is the case .
In arguing that sea levels are rising much more than the consensus view of thousands of scientists , he makes a lot of the fact that the 1993 - 2003 sea level estimates were 50 % higher than the IPCC 's models expected , indicating that future sea level rises would also be higher .
He fails to mention that the particular decade centred on 1998 has one of the highest sea level rises , which in the past has varied dramatically over decades .
The decade before , the sea level was almost not rising or possibly even dropping ( as one can see on p413 of IPCC 's first report ) .
One can not pick the timeframes to fit the argument .
Rahmstorf denounces an article I wrote half a year ago where I pointed out that we only hear bad news on global warming .
As an example , I wrote that we hear that sea levels are rising faster than expected , yet sea levels have actually risen less quickly than expected over past years .
Rahmstorf is correct to note that the levels are no longer dropping — which they were from 2006 to early 2008 , the data available at the time of my article — but curiously seems disinclined to explore why the rise over the past four years ( 2005 - 2008 ) has been half the previous rise at 1.6 mm / year .
The inescapable point is that sea levels are not escalating out of hand – if anything , they are doing the exact opposite right now .
And , as if underscoring the point of my previous article , Rahmstorf warns that Greenland may rapidly increase sea levels because ice tongues will melt , releasing glaciers behind them .
In fact , as Science magazine wrote in January with the headline Galloping Glaciers of Greenland Have Reined Themselves
In , the glaciers have slowed down again .
To many this may seem like a technical , obscure discussion .
It is vitally important .
Rahmstorf and his like - minded colleagues are setting out to convince decision - makers that their own minority views are more important than the mainstream perspective of the IPCC .
They are , in my view , trying to replace science with politics – at a time when we need a lot more science and a lot less politics on climate change .
• Bjørn Lomborg , author of The Skeptical Environmentalist , is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and adjunct professor at the Copenhagen Business School .
Lomborg must be kidding
Stefan Rahmstorf
As a lead author of the last IPCC report , I find it gratifying that Bjørn Lomborg sings the praise of the " careful work " of the " hugely respected " IPCC .
Lomborg argues that 18 years could be too short for a robust trend comparison because of decadal variations in trend – but the 42 - year period analysed by IPCC yields the same result .
And it is telling that he then goes on to draw an " inescapable " conclusion about a slow - down of sea level rise from just four years of data .
This is another well - worn debating trick : confuse the public about the underlying trend by focusing on short - term fluctuations .
It 's like claiming spring wo n't come if there is a brief cold snap in April .

Enlarge By Paul Sakuma , AP Gasoline prices in Hayward , Calif. , have been above $ 2 for a while , but now the national average has traveled past $ 2 a gallon .
FAR OFF HIGHS FAR OFF HIGHS
Crude oil futures price per barrel , 12 months .
GASOLINE PRICES GASOLINE PRICES
State - by - state gasoline averages from AAA Gasoline topped $ 2 a gallon at the nation 's gas pumps Thursday , according to the daily survey by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service .
AAA says the average price for a gallon of regular gas was $ 2.009 Thursday , up from $ 1.933 just a week ago and the highest price since Nov. 20 , when the average in the AAA survey hit $ 2.02 .
FUEL FORUM : Will we see $ 4 gas prices soon ?
A year ago , the average price was $ 3.261 a gallon .
Prices peaked in July last year at $ 4.114 a gallon .
Gasoline prices are rising because of higher crude oil costs , which account for about the half the cost of making motor fuel Oil prices rose above $ 53 a barrel as investors wagered that there would be a new run on crude stocks .
Benchmark crude for May delivery rose 86 cents to $ 53.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
In London , Brent prices rose $ 1.39 to $ 53.14 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange .
Analysts have struggled to explain the recent surge in energy prices , especially as reports continue to pour out from the federal government showing that the U.S. economy is shrinking and its oil inventories are bloated with surplus crude .
Investors seem to have shrugged off the government data and have been bidding up prices on the expectation of a future shortage of crude oil , analysts said .
Stephen Schork , an analyst and trader , said a lot of investors are getting swept into a new run on oil stocks even though there is little to support rising prices .
" With global demand in the doldrums and the world swimming in oil , the current price run in oil is an aberration , " Schork said in his daily oil report .
" We do not think it will last ... in a logical world . "
Tom Kloza , publisher and chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service , said the traders are jumping to oil now , but it wo n't be like last year .
" This is not the beginning of the next great oil price shock , " Kloza said .
The price of gasoline , however , is traveling along more traditional lines .
Gas prices usually increase in the spring as refiners slow down production to get ready for a summer gas blends , and gas is actually cheaper now than it was at the same point in the previous four years .
Kloza said the recession will keep prices low as manufacturers retrench and millions of laid off people no longer commute to work .
" We 're on the trajectory where prices will top out between $ 2 and $ 2.25 a gallon in most markets , " he said .

Children and mothers are vulnerable to malnutrition in North Korea
The US says North Korea has refused to accept any further food aid supplies .
Five aid groups have been told to leave the North by the end of March , the US state department and aid groups said .
The UN World Food Programme estimates that almost nine million people - more than a third of the North Korean population - are in need of food aid .
The aid block comes as the North is planning to launch a satellite , which some fear is a cover for testing long - range missile technology .
To add to the tension , North Korea recently closed its border with the South , leaving 400 South Korean workers in the shared Kaesong industrial zone stranded .
Aid blocked Joy Portella , a spokeswoman for Mercy Corps , one of the groups affected by the decision to stop accepting food aid , said they had been ordered to leave without any reason being given .
" North Korea has informed the United States that it does not wish to receive additional US food assistance at this time , " state department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters in Washington .
Is North Korea facing famine ?
" We are obviously disappointed , " Mr Wood said .
" Clearly this is food assistance that the North Korean people need .
That 's why we are concerned . "
A few days ago , a report by the official North Korean news agency KCNA declared that the US was the worst human rights violator in the world - and said that US workers were deprived of the elementary right to food and clothing .
Analysts say that such reports about foreign countries are fairly common in North Korea .
During the famine of the 1990s , in which hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have died , North Korea told its citizens that things were worse in South Korea - one of Asia 's richest societies .
The North has relied on outside food aid ever since .
' Rampant malnutrition '
Five US non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) distributing food said their 16 - member team , which had a mandate to be in North Korea until June , would be leaving by the end of the March .
Under a deal reached in June last year , the US agreed to distribute 500,000 metric tonnes of food to North Korea - 400,000 through the UN World Food Programme and the rest through NGOs .
Ms Portella said North Korea was still suffering from " rampant malnutrition " .
The other four US - based NGOs involved in food distribution are World Vision , Global Resource Services , Samaritan 's Purse and Christian Friends of Korea .
The UN said on Monday that 6.9 million North Koreans had not received food aid they desperately need .
The majority of the US government aid was being distributed by the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
Robin Lodge , a spokesman for the programme , said he had yet to hear anything about whether WFP staff would also be affected , but he added that he was very concerned .
North Korea is now entering the most critical period of the year for food aid , he said - where stocks from the previous harvest are starting to run out and it is too early for the next harvest .
" We 're very worried that people could be seriously hungry there , " he told the BBC .
" We estimate that nearly nine million people are in serious need of food aid . "
Border woes Meanwhile , South Korea has expressed its concerns for the future of the Kaesong Industrial Complex , after a four - day border closure by North Korea that left 400 South Korean workers stranded .
North Korea 's missile programme " We are at this point not considering shutting down the Kaesong industrial zone , " Unification Minister Hyun In - taek told a forum of journalists .
" But if the North repeats the border traffic suspension after the end of the [ joint US - South Korean military ] drills , the government will consider it a very grave situation and will take appropriate measures . "
Mr Hyun said much more was at stake in the Kaesong project than the money invested by the 101 companies operating there .
" I believe the Kaesong situation has dashed the hopes that the North and the South would embrace each other despite the grave military and security conditions between the two , " he said .
North Korea 's announcement that it will launch a communications satellite between 4 and 8 April has added to the tension on the Korean peninsula .
Analysts believe the satellite launch is actually a planned long - range missile test , and the US and its allies have called for it to be cancelled .
Pyongyang recently put its military on full combat alert and shut its border with the South , in what it said was retaliation for the recent annual military exercise by US and South Korean forces .
In January , the North scrapped a series of peace agreements with the South over Seoul 's decision to link bilateral aid to progress on denuclearisation .

Atlantis revealed at last ... or just a load of old Googles ?
For centuries the story of Atlantis has captured the imagination - a fabled city of great beauty , culture and wealth that was suddenly swallowed up by the ocean .
Its location - or at least the source of the legend - remained a tantalising mystery .
Was it really in the Mediterranean and not in the Atlantic at all ?
Some claim its ruins lie beneath the waves off the coast of Cornwall .
Others say they 've been found in the Black Sea .
False hopes :
Google said the grid - like markings , thought to reveal the location of mythical underwater city Atlantis , are an artifact of its map making process
But for a few hours this week , experts hoped the riddle may finally have been solved .
More than six hundred miles off West Africa and more than three miles down lay a mysterious grid of lines that resembled the streets of a city .
Was this where the ocean 's might overwhelmed Altantis , drowning its people and sweeping away a civilisation ?
Or would it prove to be yet another reminder that , actually , there may not have been an Atlantis anywhere at all .
The grid system was found in an area known as the Madeira Abyssal Plane off the coast of Morocco , not far from the Canary Islands
The image - discovered on internet mapping tool Google Earth - lay in an area of the Atlantic long thought of as a possible location for the city .
Experts were agog , marine geologists baffled and internet bloggers were buzzing .
There were just two problems , however .
First , the grid of streets , walls and buildings turned out to be the size of Wales .
That meant Altantis was 20 time as big as Greater London .
More problematic still , the grid of lines does n't exist on the sea floor .
According to Google , the pattern is an ' artifact ' of its map - making process .
Details for the ocean maps on Google Earth come from sonar measurements of the sea floor recorded by boats - and the area around the Canaries was mapped by boats travelling in a series of straight lines .
The grid can be found by anyone using the latest version of Google Earth on their computer .
It lies in the Canary Basin , 620 miles west of the Canary Islands , and east of the undersea Konstantinov Ridge .
' It 's true that many amazing discoveries have been made in Google Earth - a pristine forest in Mozambique that is home to previously unknown species , a fringing coral reef off the coast of Australia , and the remains of an ancient Roman villa , to name just a few , ' said a spokesman for Google .
' In this case , however , what users are seeing is an artifact of the data collection process .
Actor Patrick Duffy - with webbed fingers - in a still from the 1970s TV series ' The Man From Atlantis '
' Bathymetric ( sea - floor ) data is often collected from boats using sonar to take measurements of the sea -floor .
' The lines reflect the path of the boat as it gathers the data . '
The grid was spotted by a British aeronautical engineer who claimed it looked like a ' man - made aerial map ' of a city .
Bernie Bamford , 38 , of Chester compared it to the plan of Milton Keynes , the Buckinghamshire town built to a grid design .
Dr Charles Orser , curator of historical archaeology at New York State University said the site was ' one of the most prominent places for the proposed location of Atlantis ' .

Introduction to the xmonad Tiling Window Manager March 17 , 2009
What good is having a large display if you ’re constantly rearranging windows to fit them on the screen ?
I got tired of try to fit a web browser with other smaller windows and decided to try xmonad , a tiling window manager that could do this for me .
A tiling window manager arranges your windows in a grid .
This maximizes window sizes and prevents any window from obscuring another .
Installing xmonad
xmonad is available from the Ubuntu repositories .
Install xmonad from the package xmonad ( click the link to install ) , or by running the command below in your terminal :
sudo apt - get install xmonad
A number of dependencies will be installed with xmonad .
They are needed because reconfiguring xmonad requires recompiling it .
( Do n’t worry , this is handled automatically . )
I ’d also highly recommend installing dmenu , a simple application launcher that integrates with xmonad .
Install dmenu from the package dwm - tools ( click the link to install ) , or by running the command below in your terminal :
sudo apt - get install dwm - tools
From the login screen , you should now be able to select an xmonad session and log in to start xmonad .
The basics of using xmonad
Note :
All the keyboard commands you ’ll use with xmonad begin with what ’s called the mod key .
The default mod key is the left alt key .
If no windows are open xmonad will just display a blank screen .
Open a new terminal window with mod+shift + return .
With only one window open , xmonad will let it use the entire screen .
Instead of running more applications using the terminal , let ’s use the dmenu launcher .
If you have dmenu installed , pressing mod+p with open it on the top of the screen .
Start typing to find an application , use the right and left arrows to select a result , and press return to run the selected application .
Press escape to close dmenu if you decide not to run anything .
Open some applications so you have more windows to experiment with .
Notice how xmonad splits the screen down the center .
On the left side is the master pane by itself .
On the right side all the other windows are displayed stacked on top of each other .
Press mod+space to cycle though different tiling algorithms .
By default there are three : tall ( vertical split with master pane on left ) , mirror tall ( horizontal split with master pane on top ) , and full ( one window displayed full screen ) .
The currently focused window is displayed with red borders .
You may have already noticed that you can focus a window by moving the mouse over it .
On the keyboard , switch focus using mod+j ( focus next window ) and mod+k ( focus previous window ) .
Perform the equivalent of clicking a conventional window manager ’s close box for a window by pressing mod+shift+c .
What if you want to move a window into the master pane ?
The simplest way to do this is mod+return , which swaps the currently focused window into the master pane .
For finer control of where windows are displayed use mod+shift+j ( move the focused window up ) and mod + shift+k ( move the focused window down ) .
If the master pane is not the right width ( tall mode ) or height ( mirror tall mode ) , you can resize it using mod+h ( smaller ) and mod+l ( larger ) .
Like most window managers , xmonad offers multiple workspaces .
By default you get nine workspaces , each corresponding to a number key .
Pressing mod +[ num ] , where [ num ] is from 1 to 9 , will switch you to that workspace .
Use mod+shift +[ num ] to move the focused window to the specified workspace .
You may have noticed that some applications and dialog windows are not tiled normally .
These are floating windows , which you can move and resize like windows in a conventional window manager .
To float any window yourself , hold down the mod key and drag the window with the left mouse button .
Once a window is floated you can move it around the screen in the same manner .
Use the mod key and right mouse button to resize a floated window .
Tile a window normally again by focusing it and pressing mod+t .
With these basics , you should be able to start using xmonad .
Reconfiguring xmonad
xmonad is configured using a Haskell source file ( ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs ) ; you will need to create this file for your user :
mkdir ~/.xmonad touch ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
The easiest way to get started customizing xmonad is using a template configuration file containing all the default settings and comments explaining what they do .
Such a template is available on the xmonad wiki .
Paste it into your ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs file .
You ’ll probably want to change the myTerminal setting back to gnome - terminal ( or your own preferred terminal ) instead of xterm .
The mod+q key combo will reconfigure xmonad with your settings , and restart it .
This process happens very fast and nearly seamlessly , you might miss it !
If there ’s an error in the configuration file , xmonad will fall back to the previous settings and display an error dialog .
Read though the template configuration file and have fun customizing it to your tastes !
These are only the basics , you can do much more with xmonad than what I ’ve covered .
The xmonad documentation is a good resource if you want to learn more .

The US envoy to Afghanistan has held " a cordial exchange " with Iran 's deputy foreign minister , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said .
The meeting between Richard Holbrooke and Mohammad Mehdi Akhoondzadeh took place on the sidelines of a meeting in The Hague to discuss Afghanistan .
The US has welcomed Iran 's presence at the meeting .
Analysts say the easing of tensions between the US and Tehran is due to a new tone set by the Obama White House .
Earlier , Iran gave a guarded welcome to US plans to increase regional co-operation over Afghanistan .
" In the course of the conference today , our special representative for Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , had a brief and cordial exchange with the head of the Iranian delegation , " Mrs Clinton told a news conference .
She said the meeting had been unplanned , but Mr Holbrooke and Mr Akhoondzadeh had agreed to " stay in touch " .
She added that Iran 's presence at Tuesday 's meeting was " a promising sign that there will be future co-operation " .
Afghan reconstruction Mrs Clinton was speaking at the end of the one - day meeting of delegates from 70 countries and other organisations interested in rebuilding Afghanistan .
The meeting was called by the UN amid widespread concern that not enough progress has been made since the US - led invasion in 2001 .
Mohammad Mehdi Akhoondzadeh criticised US plans for a troops ' surge '
During the conference , Afghan President Hamid Karzai said much of the aid given to his country had been wasted .
He said the failure to deliver aid effectively was a cause of widespread grievance among Afghans .
In response , Mrs Clinton said aid should be more effectively spent , but added that the Afghan state needed to be more accountable and had to tackle corruption .
She said the cost of remaining in Afghanistan in the long term might be high , but it would be worth it .
" Let us be guided by an ancient afghan proverb - patience can be bitter , but its fruit is sweet , " she said .
BBC international development correspondent David Loyn says US President Barack Obama 's new Afghan strategy was given a broad welcome at the conference .
Anti-drugs campaign Mr Akhoondzadeh said Iran was fully prepared to participate in " projects aimed at combating drug trafficking and the plans in line with developing and reconstructing Afghanistan " .
However , he was critical of US plans to send more troops to the region , saying the money would be better spent on building Afghanistan 's own forces .
" The presence of foreign forces has not improved things in the country , and it seems than an increase in the number of foreign forces will prove ineffective , too , " he said .

As for this serialized book : you may become frustrated by the analysis sections , as in " get to the practical checklists already ! "
But the challenges we face cannot be tackled without an understanding of their sources , and whatever conclusions I reach will make no sense if you do n't plough through the first sections .
Lastly , this book will be posted for free in its entirety when complete .
I will be making Survival + available for free because this topic is of critical importance and I do n't want cost to be factor in whether people read the book or not .
I consider it a contribution to the great national discussion .
Print and Kindle editions will be available for $ 8.88 each should you wish to read the book in either of those formats ; those familiar with Chinese culture will recognize the significance of the price : 8 represents prosperity ( actually , it rhymes with prosperity in Mandarin ) .
Thank you for giving the book a try .
SURVIVAL +
Structuring Prosperity and Security for Yourself and the Nation
Chapter One
This is intended as a practical guide to structuring prosperity and security for yourself , your community and our nation .
Any guide claiming to be practical must first present the contexts and causes of the present challenges we face .
Without such an understanding , all planning is like a house built on shifting sand : flawed from the start .
If we are indeed entering a 15 to 25 - year Great Transformation , then as prudent as it is to stockpile a few months of food and supplies , that will obviously not get us through the Transformation , either as individuals or as communities .
We need a thorough understanding of the challenges before we can fashion a response that will make the Transformation a positive one .
Our goal is a sustainable , productive economy and a full appreciation of the fundamental rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
To get there , we must first understand the contexts of our situation .
I know it is tempting to skip ahead to the list of proposed responses , but they wo n't make sense unless we ground ourselves in the contexts of our planet , era , society and economy .
There are four distinct issues to sort out :
The nature of the energy , financial and environmental trends / crises which are heralding the Great Transformation
The nature of the negative and positive feedback loops which determine the system 's stability and direction
The responses which have a high probability of making the Transformation positive
The nature of future work and the skillsets best suited to prospering during the Great Transformation
If we mischaracterize the nature of the crises and fail to grasp the forces powering these trends , then we will select inappropriate responses which will not prepare us to prosper .
You may well disagree with much or perhaps most of this book ; that 's fine , because the primary goal of the book is to spark a reappraisal of our situation and generate practical responses .
I do n't claim to have " the answer , " or even answers ; what I hope to present is a way of thinking about the challenges which is more productive than the status quo .
You may also find some of the ideas presented here difficult to swallow .
None of us like to think of ourselves as debt - serfs ( yes , I have a mortgage , too ) , yet how can we move forward if we cannot be honest about our responsibilities and dilemmas ?
We are all vulnerable to groupthink , propaganda and marketing at various times ; there is no shame in simply being human .
Some of you may find parts of the analysis smacking of warmed - over Marxism , while an equal number may find certain sections " right - wing . "
This urge to categorize any idea or analysis ideologically is part of the simulacrum of thinking we accept as " obvious " the largely unconscious " politics of experience . "
That much of what we accept as " obvious " might be wrong is deeply unsettling .
Context One : Human Nature
The first context we must understand is human nature .
Regardless of the era or challenge , humans remain " wired " to respond to crisis in the same basic ways .
Unfortunately for us , our responses in " default mode " ( our first emotional responses ) and the solutions we find highly compelling in default mode ( inertia / complacency , fear / panic , casting our lot with a " Big Man " / leader or fatalism / giving up ) are often not constructive , and may well be highly destructive .
Even more pernicious , our default mode is extremely short - term .
As small groups of hunter - gatherers , we simply walked away when we 'd depleted the environment of resources ; there were always other lands ( or islands ) available .
In this fashion , ancient humans wandered the entire planet long before the first tilled crop was ever planted .
Our default ability to foresee the consequences of our actions is poor ; thus time and again human societies have added population and " overhead costs " during prosperous times of ample rainfall and grain yields , only to collapse in catastrophic decline when a string of lean years inevitably came along .
In abundance , we freely spend what 's " cheap " and in shortage we mourn what is now " dear " or no longer available .
It 's not difficult to see the same pattern repeating today .
Context Two : Cycles and Patterns of History
While every era of crisis is unique , authors such as David Fischer ( The Great Wave : Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History ) , Jared Diamond ( Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed ) and Joseph Tainter ( The Collapse of Complex Societies ) have carefully researched how cycles of price , conflict and resource depletion / exhaustion tend to repeat as human populations rise beyond the carrying capacity of their environment .
I address these cycles in Food Shortages , Rising Prices , Stagnant Wages :
Welcome to the 13th Century ( reprinted below in Chapter Three ) .
As we seek to understand long - wave cycles , we must also recognize that the crises of our era are unique even as they are manifesting within historical cycles .
A number of recent books have described the unique set of challenges we face : for instance The Long Emergency : Surviving the End of Oil , Climate Change , and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty - First Century ( James Howard Kunstler ) and Financial Armageddon : Protecting Your Future from Four Impending Catastrophes ( Michael Panzner ) .
Other books have addressed critical environmental , energy and demographic issues : The Future of Life , Beyond Oil : The View from Hubbert 's Peak , Fewer : How the New Demography of Depopulation Will Shape Our Future , The Coming Generational Storm : What You Need to Know about America 's Economic Future , The Rhythm of War and The Fourth Turning .
Given this wealth of material , I hesitate to even attempt a short summary of all the interwoven structural challenges of our era .
But the key context is this : financial and resource crises are not new ; they are recurring features of human civilization .
But many aspects of our era's crises are unique in all of human history : never before have we faced depletion of fossil fuels and the population pressures of over 6.5 billion humans to feed , house , clothe , transport , heal , care for in their old age .
Never before have we as a species been so dependent on fragile supply chains and fast - depleting global resources .
Consider the overfishing of the world 's oceans ; what once seemed inexhaustible the supply of fish is now heading to near - zero .
Ironically , this cyclical nature of crisis lends itself to the emotional power of complacency : if we managed to get through those crises , then we can do it again , the power of human innovation will save us , etc .
Unfortunately , there have been many times when the human populace did not " get through " the crisis ; populations collapsed to mere shadows of their levels reached in the years of rising abundance .
Current structural challenges include :
1. demographics ( promised retirement benefits are unaffordable )
2. global financial deleveraging ( renunciation / write - off of debt )
3. high - cost advanced economies , " Planet of Slums " developing economies
4. rising interest rates ( shortage of surplus capital )
5. de-scaling of large enterprises / structural job losses in advanced economies
6. scalability traps / structural job losses in all economies
7. crippling regulation and overhead burdens on small entrepreneurs
8. fossil fuel depletion ( Peak Oil )
9. " head - fake " drop in energy removes incentives for alternative energy
10 . political disunity ( see addendum below ) ; elites ' interests diverge from those of the society as a whole
11 . rising income disparity
12 . depletion of fresh water , ocean and soil resources
13 . climate change ( weather extremes , rising sea levels , etc. )
14 . increasingly drug- resistant bacteria and viruses
15 . rising chemical and industrial pollution levels ( air , water , soil , etc . )
16 . increasing availability of bioweapons and nuclear weapons
I summarize the four primary cycles in my book Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis :
1. Peak oil , or the depletion cycle / end - game of the global economy 's complete dependence on inexpensive , readily available petroleum / fossil fuels .
2 . The cycle of credit expansion and contraction ( approximately 60 - 70 years ) , which is now beginning the transition from unsustainable credit expansion ( bubble ) to renunciation of debt ( credit collapse ) and global depression .
3 . The generational cycle ( 4 generations or approximately 80 years ) of American history which leads to nation - changing social , political and economic upheaval .
( The American Revolution : 1781 +80 years = Civil War , 1861 +80 years = 1941 , World War II + 80 years = 2021 )
4 . The 100 + year cycle of price inflation and stagnation of wages ' purchasing power which began around 1901 is now reaching the final stage of widespread turmoil , shortages , famine , war , conflict and crisis .
Without a firm understanding of the cyclical nature of human history and the unique challenges of our era , we are hard - pressed to escape the comforting illusions of complacency and fatalism .
Context Three : The Forces Which Power Trends , Reversals and History
Within each context , various forces are at work to resist and accelerate trends .
These forces include feedback loops ( both positive and negative ) , marginal returns and the illusion of incremental change .
Context Four : The Environment
It is tempting to hope that all the structural environmental challenges will " sort themselves out " or be solved by some new technology that magically scales from the lab table to global ubiquity .
But the realities do not lend themselves to either benign neglect ( that is , just leave everything alone and it will rebalance itself naturally ) or technological " fixes . "
The human population has exploded in a geological eyeblink from several hundred million to 6.5 billion .
In terms of energy and resource consumption , each resident of the First World ( Europe , North America , Japan ) has an environmental impact up to 100 times larger than that of a Third World person .
As 2 billion people in China , India and elsewhere aspire to an energy - intensive consumerist First World lifestyle , the reality that the planet does not have the resources to support 3 billion middle - class consumers is readily visible .
The list of global environmental ills is well - known .
Overfishing driven by insatiable demand and politically popular subsidies of national fishing industries has driven the world 's fisheries to the point of collapse .
The technological " fix " is aquaculture / aqua - farming , but artificial fisheries spawn another entire host of their own problems .
The depletion of cheap , easy to reach oil is also well - known ; less well - known is that all the alternative energy sources in the entire world geothermal , hydro , solar , wind , tidal , etc. -- make up less than 5 % of global energy supply .
While natural gas and coal can fill some of the gaps as oil supply falls , neither of those fuels is endless , either and " clean coal " is yet another technology that is promising in the lab but not scalable globally without horrendous cost .
Fresh water aquifers are being drained everywhere from the American southwest to China , and there are no sustainable ways to compensate for this drawdown of irreplaceable fresh - water resources .
Schemes to desalinate vast quantities of seawater requires stupendous amounts of energy ; a recent plan by Saudi Arabia would burn fully 1 million barrels of oil a day 1 million barrels that could no longer be exported to the U.S .
Regardless of what we believe the causes might be , glaciers are melting at increasing rates .
Once the Himalayan and Andean glaciers vanish or recede to mere patches of ice , the rivers 2 billion people rely on for irrigation water will become seasonal .
Add in massive soil erosion in China and elsewhere , extended droughts in Australia , etc. , and you get a picture of global resources stretched to the breaking point .
The more you know about the technical details of supposedly miraculous technological " fixes " like desalination , tidal energy , algae - based fuels , etc. etc. , the more you understand that very few if any of these emerging technologies may " scale up " to global applications .
In other words , algae - based fuels can work just fine on the rooftop of a university lab , but the hard part is scaling it up to produce 1.7 billion gallons of gasoline - equivalent liquid fuel a day which is only half of the world 's current consumption of oil .
( Total global consumption of oil , 80 million barrels a day , so 40 million barrels a day X 42 gallons / barrel . )
Add these realities up and the context is a potential crash of global food and fresh water supplies , exacerbated by energy shortages .
As authors such as Diamond have explained , eras of resource depletion / drought often trigger unending war / conflict between competing groups and nations .
In essence there are four interlocking crises : environmental , energy , financial and geopolitical .
Excellent sources abound on these topics : The Future of Life , Beyond Oil : The View from Hubbert 's Peak and The Long Emergency : Surviving the End of Oil , Climate Change , and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty - First Century come to mind , though there are many other reputable texts .
Context Five : The End of Debt - Based " Prosperity "
The " prosperity " of the past two decades was based not on savings , investment and productivity , as the mainstream financial media and think - tank punditry maintain , but by extremes of speculative credit , leverage , debt and risk - taking , all enabled by a financial system based on obfuscation , deception , embezzlement , fraud , abuse of credit and grossly inflated asset valuations , a.k.a. bubbles .
This debt binge was fed by a marketing - based consumerist culture in which shopping and acquisition became recreation , therapy , self - fulfillment and status all in one profit - driven focus .
Compounding the collapse of this debt - based bogus " prosperity " are two long - term trends : the end of cheap , abundant fossil fuels which enabled inexpensive global supply chains and tourism , and the " end of work , " a global contraction of paid labor .
Context Six : Squeezing the Middle Class
The intersection of various long - term political and financial trends is effectively squeezing the middle class , which the state ( government ) depends on to pay most of the taxes .
Caught between the over - reach of both the state and its elites ( known here as the Plutocracy ) and the end of debt - based , cheap - oil " prosperity " which enabled it to maintain an illusion of wealth , the middle class is being squeezed to the breaking point .
Context Seven : The Nature of Prosperity and Happiness
The U.S. Declaration of Independence recognizes the inalienable rights to " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . "
Oddly enough , happiness turns out to be a slippery concept , and much of what Americans spend their lives pursuing does not actually increase their happiness .
Indeed , it is self - evident that the stress levels , medication usage and miseries of the " American lifestyle " even in times of prosperity are far higher than one would expect were happiness as abundant as cheap consumer goods .
And even prosperity itself turns out to be rather more slippery than rising GDP or other metrics would suggest .
It seems that much of what passes for " essential accoutrements of prosperity " such as large suburban homes , multiple vehicles and closets of clothing do not bring happiness to their owners .
Rather , they are largely the mirage - like results of marketing propaganda conjured up to generate profits , not life satisfaction or happiness .
Indeed , were we to travel back in time to 1870s San Francisco , for example , we would find people feeling quite prosperous even though they lived in what we would now consider relatively primitive poverty : no electricity , no vehicles except public streetcars , ( On August 2 , 1873 , the inventor of the San Francisco cable car , Andrew Hallidie , was the system 's first passenger ) , trains and horse - drawn wagons , primitive healthcare , costly consumer goods , etc .
Thus the entire notions of prosperity and happiness must be examined objectively before we can even say with any reliability what the words actually mean .
Context Eight :
The framework of our response
Our responses to these interwoven , reinforcing challenges of our era can be broken down into three inter-related levels :
-- family
-- community / networks
-- nation
Each level requires different skills , resources , inputs and solutions .

AT LEAST 2,390 people were executed in 25 countries last year , according to a report published on Tuesday March 24th by Amnesty International , a human - rights group .
China carried out at least 1,718 executions , 72 % of the global total — the actual number ( as in many other countries ) is believed to be much higher .
But if the populations of the 15 countries that carry out the most executions are taken into account , Iran and Saudi Arabia emerge as more zealous employers of capital punishment than China .

The only time he seemed irritated came when he was asked why the attorney general of New York , Andrew M. Cuomo , seemed to have more success getting A.I.G. executives to return some bonuses than his own administration .
Pressed on why he did not express outrage immediately upon learning of the bonuses , Mr. Obama said sharply , “ Well , it took us a couple of days because I like to know what I ’m talking about before I speak . ”
Even on one of the most polarizing subjects in American life , race relations , Mr. Obama deviated little from the median .
Asked about his impact as the first African - American president , he said the nation experienced “ justifiable pride ” at his inauguration .
“ But that lasted about a day , ” he said , in perhaps his only joke of the night .
“ Right now the American people are judging me exactly the way I should be judged and that is , are we taking the steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets , create jobs , get businesses to reopen , keep America safe ? ”
He showed his usual comfort with a wide array of subjects , even as he excluded the nation ’s big newspapers from the questioning in favor of a more eclectic mix .
He signaled that the new conservative government in Israel could make achieving a peace deal more difficult .
He expressed patience about dealing with Iran .
And he defended his proposal to increase the tax burden on the wealthy .
This was Mr. Obama as more enervating than energizing , a reminder of the way he could be in his early days as a presidential candidate , before he became defined by rapturous crowds .
“ He does n’t seem to emote any real urgency or anger , ” said Matthew Dowd , a former Republican strategist who has often been complimentary of the new president .
“ So at times it comes across as a bit distant and intellectual . ”
Joe Trippi , a Democratic consultant , said : “ He said all the right things .
But sometimes his confidence makes him seem flat . ”

Rachel talks to WBAL reporter Jayne Miller about " drill baby drill " Michael Steele 's 2006 campaign spending .
Miller 's report can be found here : I - Team Questions 2006 Campaign Expenditures .
From the article :
The FBI is currently investigating possible fraud because a former Steele campaign official claimed no work was performed for the payments made by the campaign to a company controlled by Steele 's sister .
Steele has denied the charge .
......
The firm 's
Web site said it was in the business of trading commodities , such as minerals , metals , coffee and sugar .
But the campaign payments it received , according to the candidates ' accounting , were for a wide range of other activities , according to campaign filings .

The spokesman said the money might have been used to pay for six busloads of poll workers on Election Day in 2006 .
The buses carried several hundred black men from Philadelphia -- many of whom were homeless -- as part of a strategy to attract black support that was denounced at the time by Democrats as deceptive .

Distractions are looming around every corner of the internet .
Rather than succumb to the tempting quick Google search or blog refresh , writer Dan Koeppel suggests sticking the diversion in a Tangents Log and getting on with work .
I 'm a writer who has constantly struggled with procrastination and distraction .
I tend to go off on tangents , and lose many hours on those journeys .
My routine is to keep a hand - written " Tangents Log . "
Whenever I feel the urge to diverge from my current work , I write the tangent down instead of following it immediately .
At the end of the day , or the week , I review the list .
Some of the items are really silly , and I 'm glad I never spent the time .
But the big bonus is that a lot of those tangents turn out to be very useful — they 're ideas I can work into my current project , or even better , future ideas that I can use ( and sell ! ) later .
The result ?
My tangents have been triaged — the useless ones are gone , the productive ones are identified , and my daily productivity is saved .

It 's a simple idea , but it's also a perfect solution to handling the ubiquitous distractions in the modern workplace .
Like the idea ?

Lebanon enjoys a relative degree of sexual tolerance and freedom compared to the rest of the Middle East , but when two gay men were beaten up by police in broad daylight and nobody said or did anything to stop it , Beirut ’s gays and lesbians decided to stand up .
Last week , more than 200 gay and lesbian Lebanese gathered in peaceful protest of the police beating , as well as protesting Article 534 of the Penal Code , which condemns “ unnatural sexual intercourse ” , marking the first ever gay protest in the Arab world , according to organizers .
Now Lebanon reports ( via Lebanese gay rights organizers Helem ) :
“ Hundreds of people armed with rainbow flags and signs denouncing violence and discrimination against homosexuals and other minority groups in Lebanon gathered at Beirut ’s Sodeco square amid pouring rain on Sunday afternoon for a demonstration .
The event , the first of its kind in the Arab world according to the organizers , was staged by the Beirut - based Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender , Intersex , Queer ( LGBTIQ ) support organization Helem , and also featured representatives from Lebanese rights groups Kafa , KAFA , TYMAT and SIDC .
Twenty - six year old Maya , holding a sign reading , “ Feminists Against Violence ” told NOW Lebanon she had come to the demonstration to give a “ statement . ”
“ I want to say that I denounce violence on all levels , against homosexuals and disadvantaged groups in my country , ” she said .
Next to Maya stood a protestor waving a sign in front of curious photographers saying , “ I do n’t believe in a country where it ’s more acceptable for two men to hold guns than two men to hold hands . ”
The demonstration was a direct response to a recent incident of anti-gay violence in Achrafieh , in which two men allegedly engaging in sexual conduct in the entrance of a building were dragged out onto nearby Sassine Square and severely beaten . ”
The data presented at the iDate 2009 conference reveal that virtual dating has a strong women appeal
Chick to chick :
Orbit the orphaned owl beats loneliness by cuddling up to toy bird
Starting out in the world with no parents is a sad and lonely prospect .
But fortunately life has just been made a bit easier for Orbit the baby barn owl .
The five - week - old bird was orphaned when he was just one day old but now he has a little owl pal he can cuddle up to - albeit a stuffed one .
Feathered friends : Orphaned barn owl Orbit , right , cuddles up to a toy owl given to him to stop him feeling lonely
The owl toy was bought by Lynsey Wood who is hand rearing Orbit at Folly Farm near Narberth in west Wales .
Ms Wood bought the stuffed toy so that Orbit would feel more at home .
She said : ' A friend suggested that I find something like a toy owl to stop Orbit feeling lonely , so I bought one from a local shop and it's made the world of difference .
' I thought that he might try and eat it , but he just cuddles up to it and goes to sleep .
' It 's the first owl chick that I 've hand reared .
It 's been an amazing experience to see it grow so quickly . '
In good hands : Lynsey Wood with her charge Orbit at Folly Farm in west Wales
Orbit is a common barn owl .
When he grows up he will be grey or tawny - coloured with small eyes and a white heart - shaped face .
The breed hunts at night and they live and lay their eggs in barns , churches and other buildings as well as hollow trees .

Bush Administration Used Immigration Laws To Censor Academic And Political Debate Inside U.S. , Groups Say
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK –
One week before a federal appeals court is to hear argument in a related case , dozens of the nation 's leading academic , free speech and civil rights organizations sent a letter to high - level U.S. officials today urging them to end the practice of refusing visas to foreign scholars , writers , artists and activists on the basis of their political views and associations .
In the letter , groups including the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Education Association and the Rutherford Institute call on Attorney General Eric Holder , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to put an end to the Cold War-era practice of " ideological exclusion . "
" While the government plainly has an interest in excluding foreign nationals who present a threat to national security , no legitimate interest is served by the exclusion of foreign nationals on ideological grounds , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" To the contrary , ideological exclusion impoverishes academic and political debate inside the United States , and it sends the message to the world that the United States is more interested in silencing its critics than engaging them .
Ideological exclusion is a petty and misguided practice that the Obama administration should retire immediately . "
During the Cold War , the U.S. used ideological exclusion to bar artists who were vocal critics of U.S. policy , including Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez , Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and British novelist Doris Lessing .
Over the last eight years , the Bush administration revived the practice , barring dozens of prominent intellectuals from assuming teaching posts at U.S. universities , fulfilling speaking engagements with U.S. audiences and attending academic conferences .
" Ideological exclusion is ineffective as a matter of security policy and inconsistent with the ideals that make this country worth defending , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" The U.S. should evaluate applicants for admission to the United States on the basis of their actions rather than their political beliefs and associations . "
The letter calls on the government to revisit several specific cases of ideological exclusion , including those of Haluk Gerger , a Turkish journalist ; Dora Maria Tellez , a Nicaraguan human rights activist ; Adam Habib , a South African political commentator ; and Tariq Ramadan , a Swiss scholar of Islam .
The ACLU and other U.S. organizations have brought lawsuits to challenge the exclusion of Professors Habib and Ramadan .
The challenge to Professor Habib 's exclusion is pending before a federal district court in Boston .
The challenge to Professor Ramadan 's exclusion is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York .
The ACLU will present oral arguments in Professor Ramadan 's case on Tuesday , March 24 .
The full text of the letter to Attorney General Holder and Secretaries Clinton and Napolitano is available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/general/39050leg20090318.html

A smart chip
An international team of scientists in Europe has created a silicon chip designed to function like a human brain .
With 200,000 neurons linked up by 50 million synaptic connections , the chip is able to mimic the brain ’s ability to learn more closely than any other machine .
Although the chip has a fraction of the number of neurons or connections found in a brain , its design allows it to be scaled up , says Karlheinz Meier , a physicist at Heidelberg University , in Germany , who has coordinated the Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States project , or FACETS .
The hope is that recreating the structure of the brain in computer form may help to further our understanding of how to develop massively parallel , powerful new computers , says Meier .
This is not the first time someone has tried to recreate the workings of the brain .
One effort called the Blue Brain project , run by Henry Markram at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , in Switzerland , has been using vast databases of biological data recorded by neurologists to create a hugely complex and realistic simulation of the brain on an IBM supercomputer .
FACETS has been tapping into the same databases .
“ But rather than simulating neurons , ” says Karlheinz , “ we are building them . ”
Using a standard eight - inch silicon wafer , the researchers recreate the neurons and synapses as circuits of transistors and capacitors , designed to produce the same sort of electrical activity as their biological counterparts .
A neuron circuit typically consists of about 100 components , while a synapse requires only about 20 .
However , because there are so much more of them , the synapses take up most of the space on the wafer , says Karlheinz .
The advantage of this hardwired approach , as opposed to a simulation , Karlheinz continues , is that it allows researchers to recreate the brain - like structure in a way that is truly parallel .
Getting simulations to run in real time requires huge amounts of computing power .
Plus , physical models are able to run much faster and are more scalable .
In fact , the current prototype can operate about 100,000 times faster than a real human brain .
“ We can simulate a day in a second , ” says Karlheinz .
While it may sound implausible , neurons are actually very slow , at least compared to computers , says Thomas Serre , a computational neuroscience researcher at MIT .
“ The reason why computers seem much slower is that they are serial machines , while our brains run in parallel , ” he says .
FACETS is not the only group taking this approach .
Researchers at Stanford University have also been creating neuronal circuits and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency recently started funding a similar project .
“ Where FACETS is ahead of anybody else is that they use these complex synapses , ” says Markram .
While the neurons are quite simple , he says , the synapses are designed to use a very powerful distributed algorithm–developed by Markram–called spike - timing dependent plasticity , that allows the device to learn and adapt to new situations .
Building such complex circuits has required close collaboration with neurobiologists , says Markram .
In fact , the project , whose current budget is € 10.5 million ( US $ 14.1 million ) , relies upon the contributions of 15 scientific groups from seven different countries .
Among the challenges they face is recreating the three - dimensional structure of the brain in a 2 - D piece of silicon , he says .
Despite efforts to make the chips as biologically plausible as possible , Markram admits they are still crude compared to what can be achieved in simulation .
“ It ’s not a brain .
It ’s a more of a computer processor that has some of the accelerated parallel computing that the brain has , ” he says .
Because of this , Markram doubts that the hardware approach will offer much insight into how the brain works .
For example , unlike Blue Brain , researchers wo n’t be able to perform “ in silico ” drug testing , simulating the effects of drugs on the brain .
“ It ’s more a platform for artificial intelligence than understanding biology , ” he says .
The FACETS group now plans to further scale up their chips , connecting a number of wafers to create a superchip with a total of a billion neurons and 1013 synapses .

Helen Dickinson , head of retail at KPMG , which produced the sales figures in conjunction with the BRC , said that women 's and men's clothing sectors had their worst month since April 2008 .
" Although activity picked up later on , it dropped off again in the last week of the month following further headlines about the worsening economic outlook , " she said .
Shelving and storage systems can be frustrating to assemble and usually require a fair bit of time to put together ( correctly ) , especially the flat - pack variety from Ikea .
This clever design , simply called Jigsaw Storage , aims to make this process a lot easier thanks to its jigsaw puzzle shaped modules , which piece together in a snap .
Jigsaw Storage was created by designer Tom Seymour and offers up a contemporary storage solution that is easily assembled without the need for screws , nails , glue and dowels or even any tools at all for that matter .
The modules can be rearranged without hassle also ( depending on which shapes you have ) making it a versatile piece of furniture that can transform to meet your changing storage requirements .
It ’s a fun piece that certainly breaks the mold of traditional shelving unit design .
I do n’t know how practical it would be to actually store things in though , with the connectors creating either bumps or gaps on the inside of each module .
Maybe that would spur some creative positioning of books and other objects .
The Jigsaw Storage unit is not available to purchase just yet , but the designer is looking for a manufacturer – so keep an eye out .

Advertisement The English navy at around the time of the Armada was evolving revolutionary new tactics , according to new research .
Tests on cannon recovered from an Elizabethan warship suggest it carried powerful cast iron guns , of uniform size , firing standard ammunition .
" This marked the beginning of a kind of mechanisation of war , " says naval historian Professor Eric Grove of Salford University .
" The ship is now a gun platform in a way that it was n't before . "
FIND OUT MORE Timewatch : Elizabeth 's Lost Guns BBC
Two , 2000 GMT , Sat 21 Feb
It is also available to UK viewers for seven days on the BBC iPlayer Marine archaeologist Mensun Bound from Oxford University adds : " Elizabeth 's navy created the first ever set of uniform cannon , capable of firing the same size shot in a deadly barrage .
" [ Her ] navy made a giant leap forward in the way men fought at sea , years ahead of England 's enemies , and which was still being used to devastating effect by Nelson 200 years later . "
Deadly artillery Until now , it was thought Queen Elizabeth was using the same cannon technology as her father , Henry VIII .
His flagship , the Mary Rose , was ultra -modern for its day .
However , it carried a bewildering variety of cannon - many designed for land warfare .
They were all of different shapes and sizes , fired different shot at different rates with different killing power .
Elizabeth 's navy created the first ever set of uniform cannon , capable of firing the same size shot in a deadly barrage
Mensun Bound , Marine archaeologist
It is known that during Elizabeth 's reign , English sailors and gunners became greatly feared .
For example , at the beginning of Henry VIII 's reign , the English fleet was forced to retreat from heavily armed French galleys .
By the time of Elizabeth , even Phillip of Spain was warning of the deadly English artillery .
But no - one has ever been able to clearly show why this was .
The new research follows the discovery of the first wreck of an Elizabethan fighting ship off Alderney in the Channel Islands , thought to date from around 1592 , just four years after the Spanish Armada .
The ship was a pinnace , a small ship carrying 12 guns , two of which have been recovered .
" There 's a very good chance this ship fought against the Armada with its revolutionary guns , but there 's no proof that all or even some of the others were armed similarly , " says Saul David , historian and presenter of a BBC Timewatch documentary about the guns .
" Bear in mind that our ship is a pinnace and not a full - size warship .
So it is probably going too far to say these guns defeated the Armada four years earlier .
Saul David and Mensun Bound examine a recovered cannon " But they certainly represent a huge leap forward in military technology and may have contributed to the Spanish defeat . "
Spain attempted to invade England in 1588 with 200 ships .
The Spanish were unable to overcome the English navy , but there were also other reasons for the defeat .
The English used fire ships in a night attack , the Spanish lacked a good deep water harbour to load their troops and they were eventually scattered by a storm .
At the time , Spain was Europe 's superpower and Philip II wanted Elizabeth 's throne and to return England to Catholicism .
Replica cannon
The two cannon were recovered from the Alderney wreck last summer .
Replicas were recreated in a modern foundry , and tests carried out for the Timewatch documentary showed that the Elizabethans were throwing shot at almost the speed of sound .
The only way to learn about their power was to recreate a cannon Elizabeth 's " supergun " , although relatively small , could hit a target a mile away .
At a ship - to - ship fighting distance of about 100 yards , the ball would have sufficient punch to penetrate the oak planks of a galleon , travelling across the deck and out the other side .
Elizabeth 's navy worked out that a few big guns were less effective than a lot of small guns , all the same , all firing at once .
The English navy stood up to the Spanish Armada .
But , perhaps more significantly , as England 's reputation for naval prowess was growing , Philip abandoned any further attempts at invasion .
" What we have shown is that the English navy and its gun founders were almost 50 years ahead of their time technologically , " concludes Mensun Bound .
This made Elizabeth I the mother of British naval dominance lasting three centuries .

To work with lists many c /c++ programmer use a simple for - loop .
I will try to explain how this can be made a little bit easier .
For that I use the self - explaining script language python .
Here is a simple example to filter all odd integers from a list in simple python 2.x syntax .
def filter_odd ( myList ) : result = [ ] # initialize the result list for num in myList : # iterate over the list if num % 2 == 1 : # modulo 2 return 1 for odd integers result.append ( num ) # add to the result return result
The function call will return a list containing only odd integers ( you can use the result of the modulo operation directly without comparing with 1 ) .
Try it directly on a interactive python console ( as an applet on secapps.com ) .
>> print filter_odd ( [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]
try it functional
The function filter_odd could be a more generic method , if the condition could be a variable or used as a parameter :
def condition_odd ( num ) : # the condition as separate function return num % 2 == 1 # condition_odd def generic_filter ( condition , myList ) : result = [ ] for num in myList : if condition ( num ) : # the same condition like the first example , only as parameter result.append ( num ) return result # generic_filter
We can define a condition as a function and use it as a parameter in the generic_filter implementation to filter the values of list myList .
Ok , you do n’t have to define a generic filter function , python offers the filter function in the standard language .
>> print filter_generic(condition_odd , [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) [ 1 , 3 , 5 ] >> print filter ( condition_odd , [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]
The new implementation does not say what to do , it say how to use the condition on a list and has much less code compared to first example .
Passing a function as a parameter is a key aspect of functional programming .
But the condition_odd function will only be used for the line with the filter call .
The next step will show you , how to use this function parameter without defining it separately .
>> print filter ( lambda x : x % 2 == 1 , [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]
The first parameter is the lambda construct : Create a temporary , anonymous function with x as parameter and return the result of the term “ x % 2 == 1 “ .
I do n’t have to define a function and I can use the filter in one line .
Save namespace with one - time functions and code lines .
list comprehension
One - line solutions are fine to write short code , but it also has to be readable .
If the reader does n’t know what filter and lambda means , it can be confusing .
An other alternative for the one - line filter solution , and more confusing in python , is
list comprehension < / cite >.
You can write the above example : < pre class= " prettyprint " >>> print [ x for x in [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] if x % 2 == 1 ] [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]
The result contains items from the constant list , filtered with the term in the if - condition .
[ Updated ]
You have to use the exact syntax , not the simple variant like filter .
more functional helper : map and reduce
There are some other list functions .
First the map function with calls for every item in the list a function .
In a example we will double every integer from the list .
This could also be written as a list comprehension .
>> print map( lambda x : x*2 , [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ] >> print [ x ** 2 for x in [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ] [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ]
Second function is reduce .
It get a function and a list as parameter and will call the function with the first two items from the list .
Then the result and the next item will be computed and so on .
A simple exapmle will calculate the sum of a number list :
>> print reduce ( lambda a , b : a + b , [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) 15
This simple example can also resolved with the build - in sum function .
two examples
Now we will try some real world examples - project eulers first problem :
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 .
Simply to resolve with a for - loop :
the condition term is x%3==0 or x%5==0 filter the values beetween 0 and 1000 calculate the sum
def eulerOne( myList ) : mySum = 0 for num in range ( 1000 ) : if num %3==0 or num%5==0 : mySum += num return mySum
But we want to do it with an one - liner , with functional programming or a list comprehension :
>> print reduce ( lambda a , b:a + b , [ x for x in range ( 1000 ) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0 ] ) 233168 >> print sum ( [ x for x in range ( 1000 ) if not ( x%3 and x% 5 ) ] ) 233168
The second line show a shorter version with sum and a little bit boolean algebra but it will not so clear readable .
As a second example filter all persons who older than 18 :
>> persons = [ { 'age ' : 5 , ' name ' : ' peter'} , {'age ' : 20 , ' name ' : ' paul '} ] >> print [ x [ ' name ' ] for x in persons if x [ ' age ' ] > 18 ] [ ' paul ' ] >> print map( lambda x : x [ ' name ' ] , filter ( lambda x : x [ 'age ' ] > 19 , persons ) ) [ ' paul ' ]
summary
Here the summary with the python doc-strings to the new learned functions :
filter ( function or None , sequence ) -> list , tuple , or string Return those items of sequence for which function ( item ) is true .
If
function is None , return the items that are true .
If sequence is a tuple
or string , return the same type , else return a list .
map( function , sequence [ , sequence , ... ] ) -> list Return a list of the results of applying the function to the items of
the argument sequence (s ) .
If more than one sequence is given , the
function is called with an argument list consisting of the corresponding
item of each sequence , substituting None for missing values when not all
sequences have the same length .
If the function is None , return a list of
the items of the sequence ( or a list of tuples if more than one sequence ) .
reduce ( function , sequence [ , initial ] ) -> value
Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence ,
from left to right , so as to reduce the sequence to a single value .
For example , reduce ( lambda x , y : x+y , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) calculates
( ( ( ( 1+2 ) + 3 ) + 4) +5 ) .
If initial is present , it is placed before the items
of the sequence in the calculation , and serves as a default when the
sequence is empty .
lambda - syntax normal function definition : def name ( arguments ) : return expression anonymous lambda function definition : lambda arguments : expression
[ Updated ] : filter and map are still in python 3000 in the iterator variant , the reduce - function is moved in the functools module .

Google is now accepting applications : Indeed .
Since I am ( perhaps by default ) the GSoC org admin for haskell.org once again this year , and will shortly need to list our mentors on our application form , I am now soliciting volunteers to be mentors .
Please email me directly .
The mentoring group has two main jobs : * To look after students and their projects if / when they are accepted .
If you have suggested , or feel strongly about , or have experience relevant to a particular project ( currently on the trac [ 1 ] , or reddit [ 2 ] - if not , then add it ! ) , please consider volunteering to mentor it .
This requires a commitment of maybe up to five hours a week ( but often less ) during the student coding phase ( 23rd May - 17th Aug ) .
Having multiple mentors for a single project area is no problem - it just means more backup for students .
*
To review and rank student proposals .
This requires a commitment of several hours across the review period ( roughly 23rd March - 15th April ) , and also some enthusiasm for generally promoting projects that will benefit the Haskell community as a whole .
The reviewers include all those who are willing to look after students for the summer .
Of course there is no guarantee that your project will actually get student participation , but if you do n't play at this stage , you definitely wo n't get one !

What if California got out of the marriage business altogether ?
What if the state merely licensed or just recognized private , contractual civil unions with all the benefits of marriage , and couples went to the religious or private institution of their choice to sanctify their vows ?
Would that resolve the legal differences between Proposition 8 and the state Supreme Court ’s 2008 ruling that gay and lesbian couples were entitled to the same marital rights as heterosexuals ?
These were the questions Justice Ming W. Chin posited during oral arguments on the proposition Thursday before the high court .
To which both sides responded :
Why , yes , it would .
The subject has come up repeatedly in blogs and conversations , but this was the first official , public forum to give it voice , and it should n’t be the last .
The argument frequently raised against same - sex marriage is that marriage represents a special bond , traditionally and biblicallyreserved for a man and woman .
But under this approach , religions and other belief groups could continue to sanction marriage in accordance with their definitions , and the state could concern itself with the civil rights and responsibilities of two people who decide to share life , home , family and the remote .
Not that this would be easy to accomplish .
Couples married under state law have reason to expect their status will last until they decide to change it .
What ’s more , marital status is entangled with community property and many private legal agreements .
Federal law would not recognize these civil unions for purposes of , say , joint tax filings .
Advertisement
Nor do we suggest that the court could , or should , take it upon itself to impose this solution .
The court ’s role is to interpret laws , not make new ones , which is the job of the Legislature or , through the initiative process , the voters .
The most adamant opponents almost certainly would be the supporters of Proposition 8 , the same people who argue that same - sex couples already have all the benefits of marriage through the state ’s civil union laws and are just quibbling about a label .
Chances are that they wo n’t see things the same way when it comes to changing the name of their own legal relationships .
But just as marriage and family traditions have altered dramatically -- with shorter and more frequent marriages in a lifetime , couples living outside the married state and prenuptial agreements that trump customary family agreements -- it is time to consider an altered state role in domestic legalities .
Justice Chin opened the discussion , and it is worth continuing .
It wo n’t be quick , though , and it wo n’t be simple .
In fact , by the time Californians are ready to embrace such a seemingly novel idea , they will probably also be ready to vote for same - sex marriage .
The Toilet Scale was designed by Haikun Deng so you can weigh yourself while using the john .
Personally , I like to sit down while I pee .
I 'm not sure why I just shared that .
Anway , the only problem is you have to make sure your feet are n't touching the ground while it 's weighing , or it wo n't work .
So you have to kick your legs out in front of you .
Which , let 's be honest , we all do anyways .
One time I kicked the towel - bar off the wall !
This scale is perfect for determining the weight of turds so you can brag to your friends about them later .
Wow , a six pounder -- somebody call Guinness !
Seriously , I think this warrants a free beer .

Avoiding controversial chemicals at the supermarket could be a daunting task , the report says .
None of the baby bath products tested in the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics ' new report list formldehyde and 1,4 - dioxane on their labels , since they 're formed as manufacturuing byproducts and are n't added intentionally .
The group says consumers can look out for ingredients that are likely to contain either of the chemicals , though , including : peg-100 stearate , sodium laureth sulfate , polyethylene and ceteareth - 20 , quaternium - 15 , DMDM hydantoin , imidazolidinyl urea , diazolidinyl urea and sodium hydroxymethoylglycinate .

Many children 's bath products contain chemicals that may cause cancer and skin allergies , according to a report released Thursday by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics .
Twenty - three of 28 products tested contained formaldehyde , the report says .
Formaldehyde — considered a probable carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency , — is released as preservatives break down over time in a container .
PRODUCTS TESTED : Full list
Thirty - two of 48 products contained 1,4 - dioxane , also considered a probable human carcinogen by the EPA , is a byproduct of a chemical processing techniques used to make petroleum - based ingredients gentler to the skin .
Nearly two - thirds of products tested , including Johnson 's Baby Shampoo , contained both chemicals , according to the campaign , a coalition of environmental and health groups that includes the Breast Cancer Fund and the Environmental Working Group .
Formaldehyde can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive people , the report says , and Japan and Sweden have banned formaldehyde from personal care products .
Analytical Sciences , an independent laboratory in Petaluma , Calif. , performed the tests .
A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson , Iris Grossman , says the company 's products are safe , meeting or exceeding all regulations .
And a spokesman for the Personal Care Products Council says the study 's results are old news .
Manufacturers have known for years that bubble bath , shampoo and other products contain small amounts of formaldehyde and 1,4 - dioxane , and have already reduced theses levels significantly , says John Bailey , the council 's chief scientist .
Bailey says that preservatives make products safer by preventing the growth of bacteria , fungus and other potentially harmful microbes .
There 's no reason to take " extraordinary measures " to further reduce levels of these chemicals , he says , because there 's no evidence to prove that low levels pose a risk .
" Cosmetic and personal care product companies take their commitment to safety and their responsibilities under the law very seriously and work hard to earn and keep the trust of consumers and their families , " Bailey said in a statement .
" Parents should be given complete and accurate information about their products based on sound science rather than on incomplete and alarmist reports . "
Other scientists say the report raises important safety concerns .
Sheela Sathyanarayana , an environmental health pediatrician at Seattle Children 's Hospital and an assistant professor at the University of Washington , says she 's seen kids become " extremely sensitized " from formaldehyde exposures .
These children develop bigger and bigger reactions with each new exposure .
That can make skin sensitive to a variety of substances , beyond just formaldehyde , she says .
Although Sathyanarayana was not involved in the new report , her research has shown that many other baby products contain chemicals called phthalates , which can interfere with the hormone system .
She notes that formaldehyde also irritates the nasal and respiratory passages .
A report released last week by the Organic Consumers Association found that makers of many personal products and household cleaners have significantly reduced levels of 1,4 - dioxane in the past year .
The study found that products bearing the U.S. Department of Agriculture Organic seal , such as items by Dr. Bronner 's , Intelligent Nutrients and Terressentials , were free of 1,4 - dioxane .
Whole Foods is reformulating its 365 Everyday Value products to be free of 1,4 - dioxane by this summer , spokeswoman Libba Letton says .
Brands that have sharply reduced levels of 1,4 - dioxane since March 2008 , when the association released its last report , include : Earth Friendly Products , Ecco Bella , Giovanni , Jason , Johnson & Johnson , Kiss My Face , Life Tree , Method , Nature 's Gate , Planet Ultra and Seventh Generation , which contributed $ 10,000 to fund the Organic Consumers Association study .
Products tested A new study from the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found that many baby bath products contain formaldehyde and 1,4 - dioxane , which are both linked to cancer and skin allergies .
The campaign notes that products with formaldehyde levels over 500 parts per million require warning labels in Europe , although not in the USA .
While all of the following products were tested for 1,4 - dioxane , only 28 were tested for formaldehyde .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has indications that elements of Pakistan ’s ISI military intelligence agency provide support to Taliban or al Qaeda militants , senior U.S. military officers said on Friday .
Navy Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Army General David Petraeus , head of U.S. Central Command , said the agency must end such activities .
The officers made their remarks as the United States unveiled a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , which promises more aid for Pakistan but seeks increased cooperation in the fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in return .
Mullen noted Pakistan ’s Inter - Services
Intelligence service had links to militants on both its western border with Afghanistan and its eastern border with India .
“ Fundamentally , the strategic approach with the ISI must change and their support ... for militants , actually on both borders , has to fundamentally shift , ” he told CNN television ’s “ Situation Room ” program .
Asked if there were still elements within the ISI who sympathized with or supported al Qaeda and the Taliban , Mullen said : “ There are certainly indications that that ’s the case . ”
Although links between the ISI and Islamist militants are widely suspected , it is rare for senior U.S. officials to talk publicly about them , for fear of damaging possible cooperation with Pakistani authorities .
The New York Times , citing anonymous U.S. officials , reported on Wednesday that the Taliban ’s widening campaign in southern Afghanistan was made possible in part by direct support from ISI operatives .
A senior U.S. intelligence official , asked on Friday to describe the problem of ISI information - sharing with militants , said , “ too big , too often . ”
He said Pakistan had in the past failed to act on “ actionable intelligence ” that could lead to a strike against militants .
U.S. FUNDING IN 1980S
Petraeus , speaking on PBS television ’s Newshour program , noted some militant groups had been established by the ISI , with U.S. funding , with the aim of helping drive Soviet forces out of Afghanistan in the 1980s .
“ Those links were very strong and some of them , I think , unquestionably ... do remain , to this day .
It is much more difficult to tell at what level those links are still established , ” he said .
Petraeus said there were some cases “ in the fairly recent past ” in which the ISI appeared to have warned militants that their location had been discovered .
“ It ’s a topic that is of enormous importance , because if there are links and if those continue and if it undermines the ( anti- militant ) operations , obviously that would be very damaging to the kind of trust that we need to build , ” he said .
Petraeus ’ headquarters is responsible for U.S. military operations in a volatile swath of the world which stretches from the Middle East into Central and South Asia .
The intelligence official said the United States and Pakistan viewed militant groups differently , and that Pakistan focused on those it saw as the biggest threats to itself , which meant it overlooked some groups with a higher U.S. priority .
“ Our intelligence shows that these groups also threaten them , so we are asking them to be a little bit more enlightened , to rethink their security calculus in a way that we think is consistent with ours , ” he said .
NEWSPAPERS AND THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE
Back in 1993 , the Knight - Ridder newspaper chain began investigating piracy of Dave Barry 's popular column , which was published by the Miami Herald and syndicated widely .
In the course of tracking down the sources of unlicensed distribution , they found many things , including the copying of his column to alt .
fan.dave_barry on usenet ; a 2000 - person strong mailing list also reading pirated versions ; and a teenager in the Midwest who was doing some of the copying himself , because he loved Barry 's work so much he wanted everybody to be able to read it .
One of the people I was hanging around with online back then was Gordy Thompson , who managed internet services at the New York Times .
I remember Thompson saying something to the effect of " When a 14 year old kid can blow up your business in his spare time , not because he hates you but because he loves you , then you got a problem . "
I think about that conversation a lot these days .
The problem newspapers face is n't that they did n't see the internet coming .
They not only saw it miles off , they figured out early on that they needed a plan to deal with it , and during the early 90s they came up with not just one plan but several .
One was to partner with companies like America Online , a fast - growing subscription service that was less chaotic than the open internet .
Another plan was to educate the public about the behaviors required of them by copyright law .
New payment models such as micropayments were proposed .
Alternatively , they could pursue the profit margins enjoyed by radio and TV , if they became purely ad - supported .
Still another plan was to convince tech firms to make their hardware and software less capable of sharing , or to partner with the businesses running data networks to achieve the same goal .
Then there was the nuclear option : sue copyright infringers directly , making an example of them .
As these ideas were articulated , there was intense debate about the merits of various scenarios .
Would DRM or walled gardens work better ?
Should n't we try a carrot - and - stick approach , with education and prosecution ?
And so on .
In all this conversation , there was one scenario that was widely regarded as unthinkable , a scenario that did n't get much discussion in the nation 's newsrooms , for the obvious reason .
The unthinkable scenario unfolded something like this :
The ability to share content would n't shrink , it would grow .
Walled gardens would prove unpopular .
Digital advertising would reduce inefficiencies , and therefore profits .
Dislike of micropayments would prevent widespread use .
People would resist being educated to act against their own desires .
Old habits of advertisers and readers would not transfer online .
Even ferocious litigation would be inadequate to constrain massive , sustained law - breaking .
( Prohibition redux . )
Hardware and software vendors would not regard copyright holders as allies , nor would they regard customers as enemies .
DRM 's requirement that the attacker be allowed to decode the content would be an insuperable flaw .
And , per Thompson , suing people who love something so much they want to share it would piss them off .
Revolutions create a curious inversion of perception .
In ordinary times , people who do no more than describe the world around them are seen as pragmatists , while those who imagine fabulous alternative futures are viewed as radicals .
The last couple of decades have n't been ordinary , however .
Inside the papers , the pragmatists were the ones simply looking out the window and noticing that the real world was increasingly resembling the unthinkable scenario .
These people were treated as if they were barking mad .
Meanwhile the people spinning visions of popular walled gardens and enthusiastic micropayment adoption , visions unsupported by reality , were regarded not as charlatans but saviors .
When reality is labeled unthinkable , it creates a kind of sickness in an industry .
Leadership becomes faith - based , while employees who have the temerity to suggest that what seems to be happening is in fact happening are herded into Innovation Departments , where they can be ignored en masse .
This shunting aside of the realists in favor of the fabulists has different effects on different industries at different times .
One of the effects on the newspapers is that many of their most passionate defenders are unable , even now , to plan for a world in which the industry they knew is visibly going away .
~~~
The curious thing about the various plans hatched in the '90s is that they were , at base , all the same plan : " Here 's how we 're going to preserve the old forms of organization in a world of cheap perfect copies ! "
The details differed , but the core assumption behind all imagined outcomes ( save the unthinkable one ) was that the organizational form of the newspaper , as a general - purpose vehicle for publishing a variety of news and opinion , was basically sound , and only needed a digital facelift .
As a result , the conversation has degenerated into the enthusiastic grasping at straws , pursued by skeptical responses .
" The Wall Street Journal has a paywall , so we can too ! "
( Financial information is one of the few kinds of information whose recipients do n't want to share . )
" Micropayments work for iTunes , so they will work for us ! "
( Micropayments only work where the provider can avoid competitive business models . )
" The New York Times should charge for content ! "
( They 've tried , with QPass and later TimesSelect . )
" Cook 's Illustrated and Consumer Reports are doing fine on subscriptions ! "
( Those publications forgo ad revenues ; users are paying not just for content but for unimpeachability . )
" We 'll form a cartel ! " ( … and hand a competitive advantage to every ad - supported media firm in the world . )
Round and round this goes , with the people committed to saving newspapers demanding to know " If the old model is broken , what will work in its place ? "
To which the answer is : Nothing .
Nothing will work .
There is no general model for newspapers to replace the one the internet just broke .
With the old economics destroyed , organizational forms perfected for industrial production have to be replaced with structures optimized for digital data .
It makes increasingly less sense even to talk about a publishing industry , because the core problem publishing solves — the incredible difficulty , complexity , and expense of making something available to the public — has stopped being a problem .
~~~ Elizabeth Eisenstein 's magisterial treatment of Gutenberg 's invention , The Printing Press as an Agent of Change , opens with a recounting of her research into the early history of the printing press .
She was able to find many descriptions of life in the early 1400s , the era before movable type .
Literacy was limited , the Catholic Church was the pan-European political force , Mass was in Latin , and the average book was the Bible .
She was also able to find endless descriptions of life in the late 1500s , after Gutenberg 's invention had started to spread .
Literacy was on the rise , as were books written in contemporary languages , Copernicus had published his epochal work on astronomy , and Martin Luther 's use of the press to reform the Church was upending both religious and political stability .
What Eisenstein focused on , though , was how many historians ignored the transition from one era to the other .
To describe the world before or after the spread of print was child 's play ; those dates were safely distanced from upheaval .
But what was happening in 1500 ?
The hard question Eisenstein 's book asks is " How did we get from the world before the printing press to the world after it ?
What was the revolution itself like ? "
Chaotic , as it turns out .
The Bible was translated into local languages ; was this an educational boon or the work of the devil ?
Erotic novels appeared , prompting the same set of questions .
Copies of Aristotle and Galen circulated widely , but direct encounter with the relevant texts revealed that the two sources clashed , tarnishing faith in the Ancients .
As novelty spread , old institutions seemed exhausted while new ones seemed untrustworthy ; as a result , people almost literally did n't know what to think .
If you can't trust Aristotle , who can you trust ?
During the wrenching transition to print , experiments were only revealed in retrospect to be turning points .
Aldus Manutius , the Venetian printer and publisher , invented the smaller octavo volume along with italic type .
What seemed like a minor change — take a book and shrink it — was in retrospect a key innovation in the democratization of the printed word .
As books became cheaper , more portable , and therefore more desirable , they expanded the market for all publishers , heightening the value of literacy still further .
That is what real revolutions are like .
The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place .
The importance of any given experiment is n't apparent at the moment it appears ; big changes stall , small changes spread .
Even the revolutionaries can't predict what will happen .
Agreements on all sides that core institutions must be protected are rendered meaningless by the very people doing the agreeing .
( Luther and the Church both insisted , for years , that whatever else happened , no one was talking about a schism . )
Ancient social bargains , once disrupted , can neither be mended nor quickly replaced , since any such bargain takes decades to solidify .
And so it is today .
When someone demands to know how we are going to replace newspapers , they are really demanding to be told that we are not living through a revolution .
They are demanding to be told that old systems wo n't break before new systems are in place .
They are demanding to be told that ancient social bargains are n't in peril , that core institutions will be spared , that new methods of spreading information will improve previous practice rather than upending it .
They are demanding to be lied to .
There are fewer and fewer people who can convincingly tell such a lie .
~~~
If you want to know why newspapers are in such trouble , the most salient fact is this :
Printing presses are terrifically expensive to set up and to run .
This bit of economics , normal since Gutenberg , limits competition while creating positive returns to scale for the press owner , a happy pair of economic effects that feed on each other .
In a notional town with two perfectly balanced newspapers , one paper would eventually generate some small advantage — a breaking story , a key interview — at which point both advertisers and readers would come to prefer it , however slightly .
That paper would in turn find it easier to capture the next dollar of advertising , at lower expense , than the competition .
This would increase its dominance , which would further deepen those preferences , repeat chorus .
The end result is either geographic or demographic segmentation among papers , or one paper holding a monopoly on the local mainstream audience .
For a long time , longer than anyone in the newspaper business has been alive in fact , print journalism has been intertwined with these economics .
The expense of printing created an environment where Wal - Mart was willing to subsidize the Baghdad bureau .
This was n't because of any deep link between advertising and reporting , nor was it about any real desire on the part of Wal - Mart to have their marketing budget go to international correspondents .
It was just an accident .
Advertisers had little choice other than to have their money used that way , since they did n't really have any other vehicle for display ads .
The old difficulties and costs of printing forced everyone doing it into a similar set of organizational models ; it was this similarity that made us regard Daily Racing Form and L'Osservatore Romano as being in the same business .
That the relationship between advertisers , publishers , and journalists has been ratified by a century of cultural practice does n't make it any less accidental .
The competition - deflecting effects of printing cost got destroyed by the internet , where everyone pays for the infrastructure , and then everyone gets to use it .
And when Wal - Mart , and the local Maytag dealer , and the law firm hiring a secretary , and that kid down the block selling his bike , were all able to use that infrastructure to get out of their old relationship with the publisher , they did .
They 'd never really signed up to fund the Baghdad bureau anyway .
~~~
Print media does much of society 's heavy journalistic lifting , from flooding the zone — covering every angle of a huge story — to the daily grind of attending the City Council meeting , just in case .
This coverage creates benefits even for people who are n't newspaper readers , because the work of print journalists is used by everyone from politicians to district attorneys to talk radio hosts to bloggers .
The newspaper people often note that newspapers benefit society as a whole .
This is true , but irrelevant to the problem at hand ; " You 're gonna miss us when we 're gone ! " has never been much of a business model .
So who covers all that news if some significant fraction of the currently employed newspaper people lose their jobs ?
I do n't know .
Nobody knows .
We 're collectively living through 1500 , when it 's easier to see what 's broken than what will replace it .
The internet turns 40 this fall .
Access by the general public is less than half that age .
Web use , as a normal part of life for a majority of the developed world , is less than half that age .
We just got here .
Even the revolutionaries can't predict what will happen .
Imagine , in 1996 , asking some net - savvy soul to expound on the potential of craigslist , then a year old and not yet incorporated .
The answer you 'd almost certainly have gotten would be extrapolation : " Mailing lists can be powerful tools " , " Social effects are intertwining with digital networks " , blah blah blah .
What no one would have told you , could have told you , was what actually happened : craiglist became a critical piece of infrastructure .
Not the idea of craigslist , or the business model , or even the software driving it .
Craigslist itself spread to cover hundreds of cities and has become a part of public consciousness about what is now possible .
Experiments are only revealed in retrospect to be turning points .
In craigslist 's gradual shift from ' interesting if minor ' to ' essential and transformative ' , there is one possible answer to the question " If the old model is broken , what will work in its place ? "
The answer is : Nothing will work , but everything might .
Now is the time for experiments , lots and lots of experiments , each of which will seem as minor at launch as craigslist did , as Wikipedia did , as octavo volumes did .
Journalism has always been subsidized .
Sometimes it 's been Wal - Mart and the kid with the bike .
Sometimes it 's been Richard Mellon Scaife .
Increasingly , it 's you and me , donating our time .
The list of models that are obviously working today , like Consumer Reports and NPR , like ProPublica and WikiLeaks , can't be expanded to cover any general case , but then nothing is going to cover the general case .
Society does n't need newspapers .
What we need is journalism .
For a century , the imperatives to strengthen journalism and to strengthen newspapers have been so tightly wound as to be indistinguishable .
That 's been a fine accident to have , but when that accident stops , as it is stopping before our eyes , we 're going to need lots of other ways to strengthen journalism instead .
When we shift our attention from ' save newspapers ' to ' save society ' , the imperative changes from ' preserve the current institutions ' to ' do whatever works . '
And what works today is n't the same as what used to work .
We do n't know who the Aldus Manutius of the current age is .
It could be Craig Newmark , or Caterina Fake .
It could be Martin Nisenholtz , or Emily Bell .
It could be some 19 year old kid few of us have heard of , working on something we wo n't recognize as vital until a decade hence .
Any experiment , though , designed to provide new models for journalism is going to be an improvement over hiding from the real , especially in a year when , for many papers , the unthinkable future is already in the past .
For the next few decades , journalism will be made up of overlapping special cases .
Many of these models will rely on amateurs as researchers and writers .
Many of these models will rely on sponsorship or grants or endowments instead of revenues .
Many of these models will rely on excitable 14 year olds distributing the results .
Many of these models will fail .
No one experiment is going to replace what we are now losing with the demise of news on paper , but over time , the collection of new experiments that do work might give us the journalism we need .
Viral videos and individual user channels being obliterated by bland corporate promos as censorship and regulation make popular video website unrecognizable from a few years ago
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , April 17 , 2009
A new You Tube video getting a lot of attention highlights concerns that the “ You ” is being phased out of YouTube , as individual users are sidelined by regulation and censorship in favor of corporate domination of the popular video website , an eventuality that we first warned about years ago .
The clip makes the case that You Tube has all but eliminated the prominence of individual video channels and artificially suppressed their chances of topping the popular ranking charts .
In addition , the ranking charts themselves have been buried on the website and replaced with an assortment of “ featured ” videos , a combination of bland corporate promos and inane mindless clips , selected by You Tube bosses themselves , while “ viral ” videos voted on by individual users have been almost completely hidden .
The top ranking and most discussed categories used to appear on the front page of the website , but are now demoted to a sub - tab , the video claims .
However , looking at the You Tube website this morning , small links to these categories have now been added to the main page .
The clip points out that ratings have been removed from the “ most viewed ” page to prevent bland corporate videos from being voted down by users , which does appear to be the case .
Inoffensive political videos are also being flagged for deletion while clips that amount to soft porn are allowed .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The point made in the video about censorship is well received .
We have had numerous accounts deleted by You Tube with little or no explanation and we receive e mails every week from people who have suffered the same fate .
We have also documented how view counts on our videos have been altered to prevent them from going viral .
The video also claims that You Tube is switching over to a new design which will place corporate - sponsored TV shows and movies on the front page while relegating individual users ’ videos to a sub-page .
This corresponds with the announcement that , “ You Tube … .
is partnering with major studios to stream full - length movies and TV shows on its site for free , ” according to an Associated Press report .
Watch the clip below .
The growth of community websites like You Tube , Facebook and MySpace brings with it the very dangers that we first highlighted years ago when the social networking and video blogging phenomenon was first taking off , that such sites represented a cyber “ trojan horse and the media elite ’s last gasp effort to reclaim control of the Internet and sink it with a stranglehold of regulation , control and censorship . ”
The domination of user - driven community websites owned by large corporations over websites run and owned by individuals has created the perfect opportunity for corporations to swallow Internet traffic and put individual blogs and websites in the shadows .
Websites like You Tube became so successful because they allowed free reign for users to upload whatever videos they liked and put in place ranking systems determined by users themselves and not at the discretion of You Tube bosses .
This meant that truly important videos , along with the usual celebrity trash that is par for the course , were allowed to go viral .
However , since You Tube was bought by Google and changes were made to the website , You Tube has been dominated by bland paid - for corporate videos while videos popular with the actual community have been relegated to the sidelines .
This was always the danger of investing so much power and interest in community websites owned by large transnational corporations , as we warned years ago .
However , You Tube ’s evolution from a community - driven first amendment outpost to a tightly regulated , corporate mouthpiece will only drive users away to smaller video blogging websites as well as a move back towards setting up their own private websites that are n’t subject to the controls of the corporate media oligarchy .

Comment on this article
" Barney 's got a really high opinion of himself and he certainly likes to think he 's my favourite out of the pets .
He 's not – but I would never tell him that . "
The book can be summed up with two basic themes :
The top management of the NSA and CIA has not made the fundamental changes needed post 9/11 , as the politicking and inter-agency squabbles are seemingly alive and well .
Bamford 's other premise continues to be his contempt towards Israel .
Often bands produce abysmal releases in order to fulfill contractual requirements .
In some ways , The Shadow Factory is reminiscent of that ; at almost half the size of Body of Secrets , and 2/3 the size of The Puzzle Palace .
When the book sticks to the facts and avoids conspiracy theories , it is a fascinating read .
If nothing else , Bamford knows how to turn often mundane aspects of wiretapping and supercomputers into a gripping read .
Divided into five interwoven sections , the book starts out with a fascinating account of how two of the 9/11 hijackers lived the American dream , all the while planning their devious acts .
Had there been some semblance of interagency cooperation and shared databases , Khalid Al - Midhar and Nawaf al - Hazmi would have been identified in seconds .
Not only that , in the book , Bamford writes that many of the 9/11 terrorists set - up shop within miles of the NSA headquarters in Maryland , communicated with their counterparts in the Middle East , at the same time the NSA was searching the world over for them .
Bamford makes the NSA seem like the keystone cops searching for these terrorists , while they were literally a par 5 away .
A number of the chapters details the Bush administration forays into its illegal wiretapping adventures and how Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andrew Card manipulated a sick and barely lucid Attorney General John Ashcroft into signing on to the program .
It has long been known that Bamford has no love lost for Israel .
His previous books have incorrectly written of the details around Israel 's attack of the Liberty , a US Navy technical research ship , which was sailing in the Mediterranean Sea during the Six - Day War .
The book details how Israeli high - tech data mining and surveillance companies such as Comverse NICE and more have become indispensable to the US intelligence community .
Bamford asserts that the vast majority of surveillance of telephone transmissions are done via technology from Israeli companies .
He then makes the jump that the American intelligence community is placing itself as risk and that the Israeli companies will access this same information .
Such conspiracy theories are tired and old .
For the longest time , there were claims that every Check Point FireWall - 1 had a backdoor which the Mosad could tap into .
Some years ago , the NSA even sent out a memo denying that fact , as it was getting in the way of firewall deployments at the agency .
As to Bamford 's assertion of Israeli control of American intelligence , it makes great fodder for the conspiracy theory community , but lacks any sort of real evidence .
What Bamford does is show that many of the founders of these companies are graduates of programs from the Israeli military , served in the same intelligence corps unit and therefore , guilty by some sort of association .
Irrespective of Bamford 's deep hostility towards Israel , there is not the slightest indication that the American intelligence community was forced to purchase these Israeli products .
They purchased these due to their superior capabilities produced by one of its closest allies .
What Bamford fails to mention , is that Israeli and US intelligence groups have a long history of mutual cooperation .
Much of the US success in its war against terror and monitoring of Iran are only due to help from Israel .
If the Shadow Factory is meant to be a critique of the NSA , then Bamford 's unsubstantiated allegations about Israel and the Mosad show the agency to be a bastion of utter incompetency .
Irrespective of problems with management at the NSA , it is utterly incredulous that the Mosad could single - handedly undermine the entire US intelligence effort , filling it with back doors and secret agents .
Bamford seems to be confused on his approach to the NSA .
On one side , the NSA are the smartest guys in the room , successfully , surreptitiously and often illegally monitoring nearly every telephone call on the planet .
They push supercomputers to the envelope and optimize ever CPU cycle .
Yet simultaneously , these smart guys are simply pawns of a small group of Israeli intelligence agents who have managed to develop and get their software on various NSA projects .
In his review of the book in the New York Times , Christopher Dickey sums it up best when he writes of Bamford 's habit of such conspiracy theories that " it 's a fair bet that Bamford will find a way to work the bloodbath at the Taj Mahal hotel into the long NSA narrative that he began with " The Puzzle Palace " in 1982 , followed up with " Body of Secrets " in 2001 , and may well continue with paperback updates and further sequels after the present book .
These are the kinds of details , or coincidences , that Bamford loves .
In " The Shadow Factory " he piles one on top of another — events , addresses , room numbers — in a slapped - together text that often blends facts with speculation to evoke a pervasive atmosphere of conspiracy " .
When Bamford is able to stick to the facts , which is about 2/3 of the book , he paints a frightening picture of the threats that the US is facing .
Equally frightening was the response of the Bush administrations to the threats and attacks , which in some cases turned mince meat out of the Constitution .
Bamford writes of Dick Cheney 's attempt to give the President significant more control , while ignoring the need for separation of powers .
There are many other such instances in the book .
Yet when Bamford takes off his hat of reason and attempts to connect invisible dots , Christopher Dickey 's observation should be kept in mind .
Seemingly on the brink of failure , the events of 9/11 recycled the NSA .
For the astute reader who is able to discern between fact and fiction , The Shadow Factory is a fascinating read into an agency that still exists in the shadows .
With a budget larger than the GDP of some countries , and a workforce that spans the globe , the NSA has long existed and thrived in the shadows that Bamford often describes so well .

Exclusive Heads up : A few months ago , I asked Skype CEO Josh Silverman when was he going to launch the iPhone version of the P2P voice and IM service that has now been downloaded more than 405 million times .
He smiled and said , “ Stay tuned . ”
And so we did .
[ digg=http://digg.com/apple/Skype_for_iPhone_to_Be_Released_as_Early_as_Next]
A tipster — a very reliable one — tells me that Skype is almost ready to launch that iPhone ( s aapl ) version , perhaps as soon as next week .
CTIA Wireless , a large mobile industry trade event , kicks off in Las Vegas next Wednesday , so perhaps the announcement will be made there .
I am working on getting more details , as well as screenshots of the service .
The biggest clue about Skype ’s pending iPhone launch came when iSkoot decided to move on from its Skype - centric strategy .
The company had been offering a client that allowed cell phone users to use Skype services .
Skype already offers a Windows Mobile version of its client .
As I ’ve said before , Skype will have to turn to mobile to keep its growth intact .
In recent months , many services , among them Truphone and Nimbuzz , started supporting Skype in their communication clients .
However , a standalone Skype client would get a lot of traction among the Skype faithful .
In the meantime , I think Skype is slowly flexing its muscles and swatting away little VoIP players with some of its recent moves .
Labour deputy Harriet Harman
A formal complaint of racism was made against Labour General Secretary Ray Collins after he asked for a translation of comments made by a man from Lanarkshire .
Trades union official Mary Fee was so outraged by the comments made at last week ’s Scottish Labour conference that she protested to party officials .
Mrs Fee contacted Mr Collins directly and he has since apologised , insisting that he did not intend to cause offence and was wrong to make the comments .
The row started when Labour ’s deputy leader , Harriet Harman , took a question - and - answer session at the gathering at Dundee .
After some exchanges with delegates , it became clear she was struggling to understand and asked her audience if they were also having problems with the acoustics .
When no one agreed , she took a question from a Labour activist from Motherwell .
Ms Harman appeared confused by his strong Scots accent and complained she could not hear what he had said , at which point Mr Collins intervened and said to Scottish Labour Party General Secretary Colin Smyth : “ Can you translate that for me ? ”
Seconds later , Mr Collins then turned to the audience and said : “ I have asked Colin to join us , so he can translate . ”
Mrs Fee , a Glasgow - based shop steward with shop workers union USDAW , said : “ I heard Mr Collins ’s remarks clearly .
I was upset by what he said and considered it to be racist .
The man had a normal Scottish accent and most people could understand him perfectly well .
Several delegates were said to have complained that Mr Collins ’s conduct was anti-Scottish . ”
Mrs Fee said she was so incensed by Mr Collins that she emailed him and he immediately apologised , blaming poor acoustics .
She said : “ He said he was very sorry and he had not intended to cause offence .
He said it was as a result of a problem with the sound in the hall . ”
Mrs
Fee said she accepted the apology , though she suggested she was less than convinced by his explanation .
Labour sources insisted that Mr Collins , a life - long trade unionist , had simply been unable to hear the question because microphones had been turned down .
Sharp reductions in investments and low oil prices could curb future supplies by almost eight million barrels a day within the next five years , according to a study scheduled for release Friday , the latest warning that the world could face a new energy shock when the economy picks up .
The report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates , an oil consulting firm , said that the potential drop in production capacity is a “ powerful and long - lasting aftershock following the oil price collapse . ”
The global slowdown has forced oil companies to slash their investments , postpone or cancel expansion plans , or delay drilling in many corners of the world .
While some of the biggest companies , like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell , say they will keep their investments unchanged this year , many other producers are curbing investments because of the crisis .
The report says about 7.6 million barrels a day of future supplies are “ at risk ” of being deferred or canceled , like heavy oil or deepwater projects , and which could bring total supplies to 101.4 million barrels a day by 2014 .
Last year , the group projected that capacity would rise to 109 million barrels a day by then .
Last Jan. 9 , President Obama declared that  there is no disagreement that we need action by our government , [ for example , ] a recovery plan that will help to jump - start the economy . 
He was wrong .
A few days later , polled by the Cato Institute , some 200 economists from the best American universities answered him in a full - page ad published in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal :  With all due respect , Mr. President , that is not true . 
And then they briefly expressed their reasons : an increase in government spending in the 1930s did not liquidate the Great Depression or contribute to solving the crisis in Japan in the 1990s .
To reprise that strategy was a triumph of hope over experience .
What was the correct road to emerge from the crisis ?
No doubt , they opined , the best fiscal policy to revitalize the growth of the economy consisted of reducing taxes and the burden of government and initiating reforms that would eliminate impediments to work , savings , investment and production .
Among the signers there were three Nobel Laureates : James Buchanan ( 1986 ) , the wise old man who started the theory of public election ( Public Choice ) and demonstrated with it how the decisions of bureaucrats and politicians are made for the same selfish reasons that move entrepreneurs , which excludes the fantasy that they act in the search of a common good , incidentally belying the superstition that the State assigns resources with greater efficacy or justice than the market ; Vernon L. Smith ( 2002 ) , an expert in the formulation of experiments that prove the markets failings ; and Edward C. Prescott ( 2004 ) , a man who specializes precisely in economic cycles .
For the purposes of this article , he is the expert who interests us most out of the three .
Prescott is one of the most accurate critics of Keynesianism and its theory that inflation and unemployment function inversely .
The 1970s had demonstrated that it is possible to suffer high rates of inflation and unemployment simultaneously .
Also , the experience of Japan confirmed that a copious increase in the mass of currency and a dramatic lowering of interest rates did not revitalize the economy .
Where did John Maynard Keynes , the twentieth centurys most prestigious economist , err ?
That was explained by another giant , Robert Lucas , also a Nobel Laureate ( 1995 ) , who discovered that the simple management of information changed the rational expectations  of people and the behavior of each person , hampering the objectives the State wanted to achieve .
It was not true that monetary policy could solve crises : it likely accentuated them .
As soon as the citizens got wind of what the government planned to do , they changed their strategies to adapt to the new circumstances .
A magnificent example of the so - called  Lucas critique is whats happening in the real estate market in the United States .
Faced with an avalanche of unpaid mortgages , the federal government decided to inject money into the banks and promised aid to mortgagers behind in their payments so they wouldnt lose their homes and the value of their property would not drop .
The result ?
Aside from the fact that keeping housing cost high is not among the States functions , the consumers became paralyzed waiting to learn the extent of those measures , provoking an even faster drop in the price of property due to a lack of buyers , multiplying the number of people to whom it is more profitable to lose an undervalued property and move to a rented dwelling than to deal with a ruinous mortgage .
It is the State , with its intervention as a philanthropic ogre , that doesnt allow prices to stabilize and keeps supply and demand from coming together in a natural way .
Those who today defend Keynes with an absurd ideological zeal forget that the prescriptions of this English economist ( a man , it should be said , intent on saving capitalism from the horrors of Marxist collectivism ) were not discredited by academicians or politicians who were intellectually hostile , such as possibly Friedrich von Hayek , who went pretty much unheeded , but by the stubborn reality .
For four decades , the world experimented with Keynes theories and the result was oversized States , punished by inflation , in which waste and a lack of efficiency grew apace with excessive public spending and bureaucracy , until the world began to return to civil society the vigor and role stolen by the governments .
When will the crisis end ?
The more pessimistic economists are starting to think of 10 or 15 years .
They talk about long run . 
Except that , as Keynes himself said in a tone halfway between macabre and humorous , in the long run , we are all dead . 
Maybe not so long .
There is no conclusive evidence of Chinese government involvement
An electronic spy network , based mainly in China , has infiltrated computers from government offices around the world , Canadian researchers say .
They said the network had infiltrated 1,295 computers in 103 countries .
They included computers belonging to foreign ministries and embassies and those linked with the Dalai Lama - Tibet 's spiritual leader .
There is no conclusive evidence China 's government was behind it , researchers say .
Beijing also denied involvement .
The report , Tracking GhostNet : Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network , comes after a 10 - month investigation by the Information Warfare Monitor ( IWM ) , which comprises researchers from Ottawa - based think tank SecDev Group and the University of Toronto 's Munk Centre for International Studies .
They were acting on a request from the Tibetan spiritual leader 's office to check whether the computers of his Tibetan exile network had been infiltrated .
Researchers found that ministries of foreign affairs of Iran , Bangladesh , Latvia , Indonesia , Philippines , Brunei , Barbados and Bhutan appear to had been targeted .
Hacked systems were also discovered in the embassies of countries including India , South Korea , Indonesia , Romania , Cyprus , Thailand , Germany and Pakistan .
Analysts say the attacks are in effect industrial espionage , with hackers showing an interest in the activities of lawmakers and major companies .
Compromised
The researchers said hackers were apparently able to take control of computers belonging to several foreign ministries and embassies across the world using malicious software , or malware .
" We uncovered real - time evidence of malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems , extracting sensitive documents from the private office of the Dalai Lama , " investigator Greg Walton was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying .
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to go into exile 50 years ago
They say they believe the system , which they called GhostNet , was focused on governments in Asia .
By installing malware on compromised computers , hackers were able to take control of them to send and receive classified data .
In this case , the software also gave hackers the ability to use audio and video recording devices to monitor the rooms the computers were in .
But investigators said they did not know whether or not this element had been used .
According to the New York Times , the spying operation is the largest to have been uncovered in terms of the number of countries affected .
In an abstract for a second report released on Sunday by two Cambridge University researchers - entitled The Snooping Dragon : Social Malware Surveillance of the Tibetan Movement - investigators said while such attacks were not new , these particularly stood out for their ability to collect " actionable intelligence for use by the police and security services of a repressive state , with potentially fatal consequences for those exposed " .
CORRECTION : The BBC News website mistakenly gave the impression in an earlier version of this story that the IWM produced the " Snooping Dragon " report .
We wish to stress that this report is entirely separate from the " Tracking GhostNet " report .

Video game sales took a sharp downward turn in March , according to NPD , the market research firm .
Overall sales in the United States in March of hardware , software and game accessories were $ 1.43 billion , a 17 percent drop from the same period a year ago .
Hardware sales fell 18 percent , while software sales were down 17 percent .
On its face , the numbers challenge in stark fashion the notion that the video game industry is recession - proof .
However , NPD was quick to point out that the March returns are not quite as dark as they might appear .
The reason ?
Easter .
According to NPD , Easter represents a surprisingly important holiday for video - game gift giving ( “ Hey son , here ’s a fluffy bunny rabbit and a game where you blow stuff up ! ”
But we digress … )
This year , Easter fell in April , whereas last year , it fell in March .
If you add the $ 121 million attributed to Easter last year to this year ’s overall total of $ 1.43 billion , you get overall sales of $ 1.55 billion .
But that ’s still down from last year ’s March total of $ 1.72 billion .
“ While it might be tempting to jump to the conclusion that the sky is starting to fall on the video game industry , given this month ’s results , it ’s important to remember that two very big things are different this year than last year , ” said Anita Frazier , an analyst with NPD .
She went on to describe the two differences : Easter , and the fact that March 2008 included the launch of Super Smash Bros. : Brawl , which was one of last year ’s hottest games .
Nevertheless , Ms. Frazier acknowledged that not all is rosy in the industry .
She said , for instance , that only Xbox 360 sold more in March than a year ago .
That ’s troubling both for the console makers and the software makers , which rely on a steadily growing installed base of consoles to sell games .
By comparison , overall hardware sales in February of this year were up 11 percent over the same period a year earlier , and software sales were up 9 percent .
In February of this year , Nintendo sold 753,000 Wii machines but it sold only 601,000 in March .
Microsoft sold 391,000 Xbox 360s in February and 330,000 in March , while Sony sold 276,000 PlayStation 3 consoles in February and 218,000 in March .
( Ms. Frazier noted that there does tend to be a seasonal dip in hardware sales from February to March in hardware sales . )
Taken together , the numbers suggest this : the video game industry deserves a closer look from those who assumed it was escaping the economic turmoil .
The mitigating factors in March ( namely , Easter ) make it difficult to discern for certain what is taking place .
But the numbers make April a month absolutely worth watching .
Home prices in Southern California held steady in February for the first time in nearly a year , figures released Tuesday show , as low prices brought buyers back into the market .
At the same time , home construction rose nationwide last month , helping spark a rally on Wall Street .
Experts say it ’s not clear whether prices have hit bottom , but they are now low enough that thousands of buyers are emerging as the traditional spring home - buying season begins .
“ This feels like an excellent time to buy , and we ’re in steady jobs , ” said Rick Asavis , 47 , who recently bought a new town house in Sylmar .
Asavis and his wife , Karen , 50 , were checking out their unit in the KB Home development Saturday to make final interior decorating decisions before moving in later this month .

The Asavises ’ home purchase was among the 4,590 in Los Angeles County in February -- a 32 % increase over the same month last year -- as buyers were lured by low prices and a sense that even if the market continues to fall , houses have become cheap enough to make the investment worthwhile .
The increased sales came as developers started construction at an annualized rate of 583,000 homes in February -- 22 % more than in the previous month , the federal government reported Tuesday .
The increase was far more than economists had predicted , and the news was an important driver of a jump of nearly 179 points in the Dow Jones industrial average .
In Southern California , the number of homes sold last month in the six - county region soared 41 % from a year earlier , to a total of 15,231 .
The median price remained at January ’s level -- $ 250,000 .
Yale University economist Robert Shiller said if prices held up for two more months , it could be a sign that the market was stabilizing .
Still , it ’s too soon to predict the end of the housing crisis , he said , because prices nationwide have further to fall .

“ The best forecast is an average of recent prices , not the latest month alone , ” Shiller told Times reporters and editors Tuesday .
The region experienced a similar leveling - off last year , when the median held steady at $ 385,000 from March to April and then started falling again .
Prices fell so far that median - priced houses in Southern California are selling for half of what buyers were paying at the market ’s peak in 2007 , according to MDA DataQuick .
Those low prices , along with low interest rates , have boosted sales .
“ A friend bought here a year ago for $ 415,000 , ” Asavis said of the KB Home development in Sylmar , noting that he and his wife were able to buy their three - bedroom unit for $ 342,000 after another buyer backed out .
Rick Asavis , a union air - conditioning installer , said he was confident that he would n’t be laid off despite the economic downturn .
Karen Asavis , a sales representative for a gift wholesaler , said she believed her job was also safe .

Not surprisingly , home purchases have increased the most where prices have sunk the lowest -- mainly mid- to low - priced inland areas hit hard by foreclosures .
In February , foreclosures constituted 56 % of all home sales .
In San Bernardino County , the number of homes sold was up 87 % over February 2008 .
Stuart Gabriel , director of UCLA ’s Ziman Center for Real Estate , said prices had fallen enough in these areas that “ even with the abundance of risk in purchasing a home now ” with rising unemployment and falling home prices , “ households and investors believe they ’re compensated for taking on that risk by the lower price levels . ”
Home sales are still frozen in high - priced areas .
Beverly Hills , Santa Monica , Brentwood , La Canada Flintridge , Rancho Palos Verdes and Redondo Beach were among the areas posting far - below - average home sales totals in February , according to DataQuick .

Those areas have had fewer foreclosures , and wealthy sellers can typically afford to keep houses on the market longer at high asking prices .
But bigger price declines at the high end could be on the way , as high - income professionals such as lawyers and those in the financial sector now face job losses , Gabriel said .
High - end sellers may also cut their prices when they either tire of holding out or can no longer afford to do so .
“ These market segments do n’t all move in the same way at the same time .
In the Westside and other more expensive areas , there might be a delay or lag ” in price declines , he said .
Stephanie Vitacco , a Woodland Hills real estate agent , said the owner of a house she listed this year in the $ 2 - million range had declined a $ 4 - million offer for his property in 2007 .
This year he was unable to sell it and took it off the market , she said .
But owners of similarly priced homes may have to sell , and when they do , Vitacco said , prices in that segment will see the same steep declines .
“ The higher end has been a little insulated , but they ’re starting to feel it .
Their businesses are suffering , ” Vitacco said .

Simone Williams , 36 , is trying to take advantage of those market differences , albeit on a more modest scale .
The elementary school teacher is selling her Pasadena condominium and plans to buy a Sylmar town house .
She said she thought Sylmar was closer to the bottom than higher - priced Pasadena .
Williams has listed her town house for $ 389,000 and is considering an offer for $ 375,000 , she said .
She paid $ 179,000 for the property in 2001 .
She expects to buy a town house in the same development as the Asavises for less than the sales price of her Pasadena place .
The Sylmar town house would be about twice the size of her 1,000 - square - foot Pasadena condo .
“ Values in Pasadena are still dropping .
I want to sell there before I lose equity .
I do n’t want to be upside - down , ” she said .

Home sales in the Sylmar area in the first two months of this year totaled 143 , according to DataQuick , more than double the 71 sold in the same period last year .
An analysis by the online real estate brokerage Redfin shows that 56 % of the homes bought in Sylmar this year through February sold for more than 40 % off their previous peak sales price .
The sales are being driven by low prices for foreclosures and short sales -- properties sold for less than the amount owed .
To compete , developers including KB Home are slashing prices for new homes .
In Sylmar , KB Home has cut the starting price for its town houses to $ 268,990 , in a development where units sold in the $ 400,000 range last year .
Across Southern California , new - home sales were just under 6 % of total home sales in February , about one - third the average rate , DataQuick reported .

Nationally , even though developers broke ground on more homes than expected in February , the figures were still 47 % lower than the same time last year .
Most of the new construction was in the Northeast .
In the West , starts were down 59 % in February from a year earlier .
Overall , home affordability has been eased by lower mortgage interest rates as well as falling prices .
The typical monthly mortgage payment for a buyer of a median - priced home in Southern California in February was $ 1,090 , according to DataQuick , down from $ 1,940 in February 2007 .
Orange County ’s median home sales price of $ 375,000 was the highest in Southern California , but it was still down 28 % from the previous February .
Los Angeles County ’s median price of $ 299,000 was down 35 % .
San Bernardino County posted the sharpest decline from a year earlier , 47 % , with a median price of $ 153,000 .
Riverside County ’s February median price of $ 190,000 was 42 % less than a year earlier .
Ventura County ’s 27 % decline brought its median to $ 327,000 and San Diego ’s median of $ 285,000 was down 31 % .

Blogger threatened with assault , smeared anonymously as paedophile
Boasts of role in James Ujaama conviction
Links to prominent politician explored
Tim Ireland of Bloggerheads has returned to the subject of Glen Jenvey , who appeared on the anti-Islam Obsession DVD as a supposed “ Free- lance Terror Investigator “ .
As I ’ve blogged a number of times lately , Tim has found strong circumstantial evidence that Jenvey made anonymous postings to a Muslim discussion forum as “ Abuislam ” , urging Muslims to “ target ” prominent British Jews for revenge over Israeli action in Gaza – in particular , he named Sir Alan Sugar , a businessman and star of a TV competition show .
Jenvey then presented these postings to the UK Sun as evidence of Muslim extremism , and he was featured in a front - page story headlined “ Terror Target Sugar ” .
However , once Tim publicised his concerns , the story was withdrawn , and the Sun is now fending off an investigation from the Press Complaints Commission ( PCC ) and legal threats from Alan Sugar .
Tim has now uncovered lots more – and there ’s a small cameo by me in the unfolding saga .
Jenvey ’s responses have been increasingly desperate .
He claimed that he could prove that his computer had not been used to post to the Muslim forum – rather unconvincing given that it ’s possible to own more than one computer , and to have access to more besides .
Jenvey also took the predictable line that because he battles extremists , any criticism of him must be the work of extremists , and he made edits to Wikipedia accusing the PCC of supporting al - Qaeda .
When the Guardian ran a short report on the PCC investigation , Jenvey then concocted a bizarre conspiracy theory about the editor of the paper , which was then promoted by his friend Jeremy Reynalds at the evangelical Christian newssite ASSIST .
When that flopped , Jenvey then made a complaint to the police , accusing Tim of “ hate comments ” .
Tim then produced extracts from audio recording of Jenvey talking to an unknown journalist , and asked Jenvey for clarifications on some points .
After prevaricating for a few days , Jenvey came up with :
Is your email a threat ? to me .
if so i might have to go to the police .
grow up you child .
tim your a waste of space who supports terrorist at ummah.com as i said for the last time i’m going to sue the Guardian newspaper .
and i’m very interested in why you are so interested in certain names ?
maybe you are the people you keep trying to say others are .
i would suggest you stop writting to me as i have past each of your emails to the police already like i have the last one .
Jenvey , it should be noted , is dyslexic , and his writing style is particularly distinctive .
This was followed up with
do you not understand no one is taking any notice of you creep .
but yes watch out in the dark you never know who might be around the corner .
Around the same time , a posting was made to a blog about Thailand , in exactly the same style as the above , pretending to be from the Daily Mail and accusing Tim of being a paedophile .
There is now strong reason to believe that Jenvey is a vindictive sociopath who is lashing out wildly and recklessly as the sense of self - worth he derives from his “ terror investigator ” status crumbles around him , and I doubt even Jeremy Reynalds will be wanting to defend his friend after these developments .
But this is not just an embarrassment for those who made and promoted Obsession or for Reynalds ; as well as attempting to stir up hatred between British Jews and Muslims via the Sun , Jenvey ’s antics may be a serious threat to countering extremism on both sides of the Atlantic .
Tim has released more of the audio , including this :
The Abu Hamza videos led to the actual conviction and .. of … of … James Ujaama , because I uploaded them the day before he went to court .
They had n’t been shared by the FBI and the American Embassy who already had those … um … those tapes .
See , it was the first time the Seattle FBI had actually had seen James Ujaama sat on a platform next to Abu Hamza , and they were struggling with the case and even struggling to keep him in prison .
So if I had n’t ’ve uploaded the original page of ‘ Al - Qaida Exposed ’… videos .. um … basically …
James Ujaama would ’ve got off scot free .
Probably , the snowball effect that then led to Abu Hamza extradition and case being built , which Ujaama in his plea - bargaining helped the FBI build , would never have happened … and the police in this country arrested Abu Hamza on an American extradition [ “ right ? ” iaudible ] and then they tripped over … boxes of [ VHS ] videos similar to the ones that I uploaded .
That I ’d given them several years before . ”
As Tim notes ,
The action he describes above – releasing ‘ evidence ’ already rejected by authorities to the public a day before a trial – may be legal ( just ) , but I ca n’t see it pleasing anyone doing the hard work of making a clean conviction stick .
No , all I can see is a yappy pup who continually spooks the game because he wants so much to be in on the hunt .
Tim also gives us some more details about Jenvey ’s British friends – the audio also features Jenvey boasting about how when the police do n’t take him seriously he goes to a British diplomat named Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , through Cowper - Coles ’ cousin , a lecturer named “ Mike ” .
Tim has now publicly identified “ Mike ” as Michael Starkey , and this was where I was able to help – I found a family tree which shows they have a common ancestor in Captain Cowper Phipps Coles , who drowned when a ship he had designed capsized in 1870 – “ Mike ” and Sir Sherard are ( I think I ’ve got this right ) third cousins once removed .
Someone left a comment on my blog naming Michael Starkey as a possibility for “ Mike ” from this family tree , but I removed it due to lack of evidence .
However , Tim notes that Michael Starkey ’s older brother is Sir John Starkey , who sits on the executive committee for his local MP – none other than Patrick Mercer .
Mercer was formerly “ Shadow Minister for Homeland Security ” , but he resigned from this position under a cloud after a gaffe which suggested he did not fully understand that racist name - calling in the Armed Forces should not be tolerated ( although he seems generally to be moderate sort of person ) .
Sir John is not much of a fan of Mercer , and he accused him of disloyalty when Mercer agreed to take up an advisory role with Gordon Brown .
Facing what the Daily Mail called “ grassroots fury “ , Mercer was in a tricky situation .
Over the past few years Mercer has been in the media many times to highlight specific extremist threats – but how much of his material is now tainted by association with Jenvey ?
Tim has also been in contact with Sir Sherard :
Meanwhile , after weeks of radio silence , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles has finally been in touch .
We ’re still discussing what will or wo n’t be said on the record , but he ’s not standing shoulder to shoulder with Jenvey by any means .
( Psst ! Glen !
You may want to clutch your archived emails that little bit closer … they could well be the only ‘ friends ’ you have left . )

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian missiles can now reach Israeli nuclear sites , a top Iranian military commander said on Wednesday , but another official held out the prospect of progress in talks on Iran ’s disputed nuclear programme .
An Iranian surface - to - surface missile rests on a launch platform in preparation for a test firing at an undisclosed location in the Iranian desert in this image released to Fars News by the military , November 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / FARS NEWS
Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , Iranian ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , said a breakthrough was possible if negotiations were conducted on an “ equal footing ” and insisted on Iran ’s right to nuclear power .
While he spoke of a possible breakthrough on the nuclear dossier , remarks by the commander - in - chief of the Revolutionary Guards on Iran ’s missile capabilities were more strident .
“ Today , ... Iran has missiles with the range of 2,000 km ( 1,250 miles ) , and based on that all Israeli land including that regime ’s nuclear facilities are in the range of our missile capabilities , ” Guards commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said in comments carried by the ISNA news agency .
Israel has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to end the row over Iran ’s nuclear aims , echoing U.S. policy , though U.S. President Barack Obama has also offered to engage Iran in direct talks if it “ unclenches its fist . ”
Iran has often said it had missiles able to reach the Jewish state but has not until now mentioned such specific targets .
Defence analyst Paul Beaver questioned whether the missiles could hit long - range targets accurately .
“ I would be very surprised if Iran has yet reached that level of sophistication , ” he said , speaking from London .
NUCLEAR SECRECY
Israel , believed to be the only nuclear - armed Middle East state , dismissed the comments .
“ It ’s not our practice to respond to every belligerent and extreme statement of the Iranian leadership , ” said government spokesman Mark Regev .
Iran , the world ’s fourth largest oil producer , says its nuclear work is aimed at generating electricity not making bombs but its failure to convince world powers about the peaceful nature of its work has led to three rounds of U.N. sanctions .
The IAEA said on Wednesday that Iran had strayed from non-proliferation obligations by ceasing to provide advance data on nuclear plans and allow inspector visits to a planned heavy water reactor .
Johan Rautenbach , head of the IAEA legal affairs office , told an IAEA governors ’ meeting Iran ’s refusal to let inspectors visit the reactor “ adversely affects the agency ’s ability to ensure that no diversion pathways are built into the facility . ”
But he said this did not mean Iran was in “ non-compliance ” with rules , a finding that could warrant further U.N. Security Council action .
Since taking office in January , Obama has talked of engaging Iran on its nuclear work and other issues , breaking with the policy of his predecessor George W. Bush .
But he has warned of more sanctions if Iran does not stop enriching uranium , which has both military and civilian uses .
Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , who has the final say on policy , criticised the U.S. president for “ talking about unconditional commitment to Israel ’s security , ” saying he was on the same “ wrong path ” as Bush .
One Iranian analyst said Khamenei may be restating Iran ’s tough line to make clear Tehran would not easily give up regional policies that could be bargaining chips in any talks .
“ He is saying you also have to change if you want us to change , ” said the analyst , who asked not be named .
Random Number Generators
Computer generated " Random Numbers " are used in many applications .
Indeed , there is a whole set of numerical " Monte Carlo " techniques based on them .
This page describes how ( most ) random number generators work and most importantly it lets you design and test your own random number generator .
To do so just click on the applet nearby .
What is a random number generator ?
Most random number generators generate a sequence of integers by the following recurrence :
x 0 = given , x n+1 = P 1 x n + P 2 ( mod N ) n = 0,1,2 , ... (*)
The notation mod N means that the expression on the right of the equation is divided by N , and then replaced with the remainder .
To understand the mechanics consider the following simple Example .
( Choose Example on the applet to study this example further . )
x 0 =79 , N = 100 , P 1 = 263 , and P 2 = 71
x 1 = 79*263 + 71 ( mod 100 ) = 20848 ( mod 100 ) = 48 ,
x 1 = 48*263 + 71 ( mod 100 ) = 12695 ( mod 100 ) = 95 ,
x 1 = 95*263 + 71 ( mod 100 ) = 25056 ( mod 100 ) = 56 ,
x 1 = 56*263 + 71 ( mod 100 ) = 14799 ( mod 100 ) = 99 ,
Subsequent numbers are : 8 , 75 , 96 , 68 , 36 , 39 , 28 , 35 , 76 , 59 , 88 , 15 , 16 , 79 , 48 .
The sequence then repeats .
( This indicates a weakness of our example generator :
If the random numbers are between 0 and 99 then one would like every number between 0 and 99 to be a possible member of the sequence .
The parameters P 1 , P 2 , and N determine the characteristics of the random number generator , and the choice of x 0 ( the seed ) determines the particular sequence of random numbers that is generated .
If the generator is run with the same values of the parameters , and the same seed , it will generate a sequence that 's identical to the previous one .
In that sense the numbers generated certainly are not random .
They are therefore sometimes referred to as pseudo random numbers .
Transformation of the original sequence .
Of course one may want random numbers not as integers in a given range , but for example as uniformly distributed real numbers in a certain interval , or perhaps as real numbers of ( almost ) arbitrary size , but clustered around the origin .
Distributions of that sort can be obtained by suitably transforming the original random numbers .
For example , to transform a sequence defined as above into an evenly distributed set of real numbers in the interval from 0 to 1 simply divide each of the original numbers by N .
In the remainder of this page , though , we just consider the sequence defined by ( *) itself .
What makes a good random number generator ?
That 's a good question !
Several answers are possible , for example :
The sequence generated by ( * ) is n't random at all , so there is no good random number generator of that form .
A sequence ( * ) is good if it passes several well established statistical tests .
Or , it 's good if it gives good results in particular applications ( where of course the meaning of " good results " is heavily dependent upon the context ) .
( x i , x i+k )
The second figure nearby shows a distribution of 1,000 points obtained with a widely used and well tested and analyzed random number generator using
P 1 = 16807 , P 2 = 0 , and N= 2 31 - 1 = 2147483647 .
This generator is described in the reference by Park and Miller given below .
One reason for the seemingly peculiar choice of N is that that particular number is the largest integer than can be represented on a Unix machine or in Java .
To illustrate the abilities of this applet consider the following Figure which shows three sequences of 100,000 points each , using the same generator , for k=1 ( red ) , k2 ( green ) , and k=3 ( blue ) .
Reassuringly , no systematic patterns are readily apparent .
Operating the Random Applet
Clicking on the box at the beginning of this page will cause a control window to pop up that looks much as illustrated in the image nearby .
A drawing window that will contain the plots also appears .
There are mostly text input windows and buttons marked " > " , " < < " etc . .
To change an entry of a text window highlight the text and write a new number .
You can also change parts of the number .
It is important to terminate every change by pressing the Return or Enter key .
The green buttons increment or decrement the text windows they surround .
" < " and " > " decrement or increment by 1 , the other buttons by larger amounts , e.g. , by going to the closest prime number or the closest power of 2 .
Points of the form
( x i , x i+ k )
Following is a description of some less obvious features :
DONT / DRAW : Normally the picture in the drawing window gets redrawn every time a change is made in the control window .
You can suppress the drawing ( e.g. , if you want to make many changes ) by pressing the yellow button in the top row .
Its label " DONT " indicates whether drawing currently takes place .
Click on " DONT " to suppress it or on " DRAW " to activate it .

As you might expect , you can dispose of the control wind and the drawing window by clicking on the Quit button .
You can obtain the same effect by clicking on the applet at the top of this page , or by typing " q " , " Q " , " x " , or " X " in either the control window or the drawing window

People are saying science does n't concern itself with these types of question , I disagree .
1 ) Does the soul exist ?
Maybe , neuroscientists are currently working on the parts of the brain that are active when people are being religious and it may be that they will discover a part of the brain that relates to what people may consider their soul .
It may be that this part of the brain is what is active when people are being spiritual even if they are not religious .
So we can not say definitively if the soul as you mean it exists , but we may be able to explain why people think it does .
2 ) The big bang theory .
As has been said , who is the wrong question .
even if you believe god did it , he would still have used some method that must be understandable to us .
After all everything else in the universe has so far been understandable in scientific terms so it would be strange if he left that one obscured .
And if he left his fingerprints on it then what price faith ?
Faith becomes unnecessary once there is sufficient evidence to know that god exists and apparently god want us to believe without evidence .
So scientists may one day work out what caused the big bang and it may simply lead to more questions , or for us to know that we are part of a cycle of creation and destruction that goes on in nature ad infinitum .
3 ) Chicken and the egg ?
All chickens come from eggs .
Not all chicken eggs were laid by chickens .
The very first chicken egg came from a very close ancestor ( genetically as well as its mother ) of the chicken .
It was close enough that they could interbreed as they were not distinct species .
Over time , for whatever reason the chicken was better adapted and out - competed the ancestor until the ancestors no longer existed and only chickens remained .

Every religion on campus has its student society , from the Christian Union to the Jedi Knights .
Now the non-religionists will have theirs too .
The National Federation of Atheist , Humanist and Secular Student Societies launches today to mobilise non-believers .
The " anti- God squad " , as it is happy to be called , says it will fight for the voices of what it believes to be the majority of students to be heard on campus and further afield .
It is planning campaigns and events across the country to protest against religious privilege and promote the understanding of science .
It has the support of some of the country 's leading critics of religion : the scientist Richard Dawkins , the philosopher AC Grayling , and the Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee .
The launch comes four months after a campaign for 30 London buses to parade the slogan : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
The campaign , first mooted on the Guardian 's Comment is Free site by comedy writer Ariane Sherine , began in response to evangelical Christian adverts on buses .
Chloe Clifford - Frith , 22 , who has just graduated from Oxford University and will be dealing with the federation 's public affairs , said : " We live in a world where religious governments execute adulterers and homosexuals , deny women and minority groups basic freedoms , and circulate fraudulent claims about contraception and scientific research .
" We are privileged , in such a world , to live in a country where we can even have this debate and , as such , we have a duty to bring it into our universities and beyond . "
Polly Toynbee said the students ' federation would " keep the rational and ethical humanist tradition alive both on and off campus " .
She said : " We need to oppose zealotry and fanaticism of all sorts by promoting the positive and liberating case for believing that life on earth is precious , because the here and now is all there is , and our destiny is in our hands .
" The humanist view of life is progressive and optimistic , in awe of human potential , living without fear of judgment and death , finding enough purpose and meaning in life , love and leaving a good legacy .
It is great to see these values being taken up by today 's students . "
Professor Richard Dawkins said public statements of non-belief were treated as " threatening " and an " affront to the religious " .
Religious belief did not have to earn respect like other views did , he said .
" Beliefs that are unsupported , bigoted or demand special privileges should always be challenged .
No opinion should be protected from criticism simply by virtue of being religiously held , " he said .
AC Grayling said : " All people are entitled to their beliefs , but we secularists are right in arguing that the state must be entirely neutral in these matters .
Yet some religious groups defend and even aim to expand their considerable privileges …
Increasing numbers of young people are unwilling to put up with it . "
He cited public money for faith schools and seats in the House of Lords for faith leaders as examples of religious privilege .
The new federation is affiliated to the British Humanist Association .
Pod Bhogal , head of communications at the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship ( UCCF ) , said : " Universities are a marketplace of ideas where concepts can be exchanged .
Anything that encourages intelligent and meaninful discussion we see as positive .
We are thankful for the atheist bus campaign because it raised awareness of spiritual things and put God on the agenda . "
When the employees at Nothing , an Amsterdam ad agency , say they work out of a cardboard box , most people are probably think they ’re making a joke about their cheap - o bosses .
They ’re not , and the bosses are n’t being cheap at all .
Rather , they commissioned Alrik Koudenburg and Joost van Bleiswijk to create all of their office furniture using only cardboard .
The results are pretty impressive , but they ’ll only grow more interesting over time , since visitors are encouraged to mark up the surfaces with anything they please , making the entire office a palimpsest .
It ’s worth noting that cardboard furniture has a long history : Frank Gehry ’s cardboard line is a modern classic that ’s been in production for thirty years ; Design Within Reach used to carry an excellent cardboard desk that I owned for a while .
It ’s a great material : Light , strong , green , and warm - looking .
Peter Baker reporting in The New York Times :
To minimize the risk , the government technology gurus have made it impossible to forward e-mail messages from the president or to send him attachments , people informed about the precautions say .
I can see how to set up a system to prevent the sending of attachments .
But how do you make an email impossible to forward ?
Would n’t that require protocols existing within all email clients allowing this ?
I ’m not an expert on this – so please educate me if this is n’t the technical issue I think it is .

I am a mountaineer and a photographer , and have managed to be shortlisted for a position as Field Assistant with BAS ( UK ) .
If you have a minute to spare , I would be very grateful .
I have a good idea of what they are looking for when it comes to technical skills ( glacier travel , crevasse rescue , etc. ) , but not so much for the " softer " personality questions ...
If you have any advice that would help me come better prepared , it would be extremely welcome !

Well done for getting an interview .
As a marine biologist , I never had reason to work with GA 's ( General Assistant - the nomenclature has now changed to Field Guide ) so I can't claim to have the answers you 're looking for specifically but I 'll try .
I presume you have all the skills and qualifications on paper that you need so , yes it 's about seeing if you fit .
In no particular order this is what comes to mind :
You need to demonstrate self reliance and a high degree of capability , though not be too proud to ask if you get out of your depth ( and be able to recognise when you are out of your depth ) or encounter a situation you do n't know about .
They may give you a scenario to talk them through with this .

You need to be able to be flexible and make things happen when they can happen rather than stick to the schedule .
and make things happen when they can happen rather than stick to the schedule .
You will be in the field with someone for weeks , possibly months , so you need to be easy going and easy to get on with .
There 's not a lot you can do about this , be yourself , if this is not you , then the job is perhaps not for you .

Above all be yourself , if you do n't get the position this time then do n't let it put you off applying again - I know many people who got through the second time ( including myself ) .
The interview starts when you enter the building , not when you sit down in the room .
Damian :
I want to go not this austral summer , but next , and when I go ( theoretically )
I 'll have a master 's degree in mechanical engineering and a bunch of sundry skills .
But I 've sent my resume to anonymous hiring sites before ( i.e. the Raytheon outfit ) and I 've NEVER known that to work .
Neither I nor anyone I know has even once been hired by submitting to an online server .
So I 'm worried that when the time comes , and I submit my papers - qualified or not - they 'll be parsed by a computer , glanced over by a suit who already knows who he 's sending , and tossed into the Antarctic trash bin of history .
I thus ask those who know , realistically : I 'm a multi-talented fellow , and a hard worker ... but what are my chances ?
What are they REALLY ?
Is there an inside track to the Antarctic Circle ?
And how do I get on it ?
Reply - Sharon
Really good questions !
I think your chances of being hired are greatly enhanced by attending Raytheon 's Job Fair in April ( as from 2013 , job fairs have now ended as Raytheon no longer have this contract ) .
I did and was hired .
I 'm returning for my third season in October !
I have been told they receive over 30,000 applications for about 500 positions .
So being at the Fair , getting to know the persons for whom you hope to work , getting their extension numbers , names , email addresses really is a foot in the door .
When I worked the Midrat shift in the galley , six of the ten of us had masters degrees !
No , not in culinary arts !
We had school counselors , teachers , school psychologist and me , a nurse practitioner .
So be willing to take ANY job .
There are attorneys , judges , pharmacists , and PhD 's working as mechanics , janitors , galley slaves , housing department and shuttle drivers .
Some folks have said to me , oh , I do n't have the money to go to Denver for the Fair , or I 'm not sure I can go .
Well , do you want to go to the Ice !!!???
You do what you gotta do !!
Good luck !
Mark
I have a great job record and have thought for a long time that working in Antarctica would be an interesting thing to do !
It would seem to me that there would be more of a need for help due to the cold and harsh weather one must endure down there !
Your site makes it seem like a real narrow chance to go there !
I think that 's a shame if that 's the case !
I have been in Hi-Tech for 19 years and done lots of heavy work too !
If there is any need for a strong smart guy such as myself I would sure like to give it a go !
If the American or British stations can't use me , perhaps I could work at the Russian station as I have a Russian wife and can speak it some !
Thanks for your time in reading this !

It 's a case of supply and demand , for every job available , there are dozens if not hundreds of people who would be prepared to do it .
So the recruitment is biased towards those who REALLY want to go to Antarctica as well as being capable of doing the job , the recruiters really can pick and choose .
You need to apply through Lockheed Martin , the US company that currently deals with logistics .
If you do n't get in straight away , keep plugging at it , they like persistence too , shows it 's not just a short - term idea you 've had .
I got the second job I 'd applied for and know of many others who were turned down at least once before they were offered a position .
Hamish
I Have a question that does n't seem to have been answered here .
I 'm interested in getting a job in Antarctica , but realise that everyone else is too , and so I figured that my best bet would be as a scientific guy .
How do I go about getting information on research jobs in Antarctica ?
All the information seems to be about cooks and carpenters and mechanics .
Reply - Paul , webmaster
Scientific jobs are advertised in the scientific press usually .
You could also try the website of your national programme as there are often current vacancies advertised there , but not all of the scientific ones .
Also scientific jobs are not always offered by the Antarctic programme directly , but by a University with secondment to the Antarctic programme to go south and carry out the research .
When I went to Antarctica as a marine biologist I was actually employed by St. Andrews University and seconded to the British Antarctic Survey .
The overall impression is that scientists are supposed to be more interested in their line of research than in just going to Antarctica which is " coincidental " .
Your scientific discipline and career so far are obviously extremely important , and while there may be dozens of applicants for a particular generalist support job , there may only be a handful for a scientific post - BUT that 's because of the specialist nature of the job .
There can be ( and are ) many well qualified and experienced scientists who would love to go to Antarctica , but there 's just no jobs in their particular discipline .
So as a scientist , there 's less chance of a job coming up that fits your experience , but if it does - the odds are narrowed in your favour .
You should research the science programmes currently happening in Antarctica and investigate the qualifications needed to be a part of them .
Sharon Heilman
A retired Registered Nurse living in Princeville , Illinois .
Sharon always wanted to go to Antarctica and in September 2000 , she did just that .
After attending a job fair in Englewood , Colorado . for Raytheon Polar Services she was one of the few lucky people to be hired .
She has been six times to Antarctica to work , most recently in October 2006 .
Sharon also has a Masters degree from the University of Illinois , having become a nurse after her three children entered school - " so I was a late bloomer ! "
She now has grandchildren and turned 65 in October 2003 on the Ice !
" Again , blooming late ! "
Sharon 's job was to drive shuttle buses around the US McMurdo base in the Ross Sea area of Antarctica .
In the Antarctic summer from October to February when she was there , there are about 1,000 people on base .
A very similar size in fact to the small rural community in central Illinois where Sharon lives .
Hi Folks ,
Not much to report from McMurdo Station , Antarctica .
Cold and windy , planes can't come down from Christchurch , NZ , so many workers are stranded there .
Temperatures have been about - 10 F to - 20 F with wind chills to - 60 F or so .
We actually had a Condition 1 in town the other day .
Unusual !
Must stay where you are , not go even from one building to the next .
Condition 1 usually only occurs away from Mactown , at the airfields of up in the hills .
My job is going very well .
I love driving shuttles !!
I took some carpenters out about 10 miles onto the Ross Ice Shelf the other day in a Delta , the big orange vehicle with 5 ' tires .
The passenger section and engine section are articulated from the driver section .
The driver , me , sits forward of the front tires !
The are building a shelter for the LDB , Long Duration Balloon , project .
The scientists send up a balloon probably in December or January to 120,000 feet , the edge of outer space .
It circles counter - clockwise Antarctica collecting data to be analyzed later at Washington U. in St. Louis .
I learn so much and hear so much that there is never a dull moment .
I know we have a cushy life here compared to the early explorers , but last Thursday , a woman decided to walk / climb up Observation Hill , a 900 foot lava hill .
Well , she went alone and did not take a radio !
A big no -no .
She lost her footing and slid on the lava about 20 feet , then rolled over and slid another 40 feet , loosing a shoe and gloves in the process .
Luckily , a group of hikers came along after about 1/2 - 1 hour and found her .
She has frostbite on all 20 digits !!
And her one heel is purple / black .
She is confined to her room , visiting medical for dressing changes and morphine and debridement daily .
She is not out of the woods yet !
She could see shuttles going to Scott Base that night and waved and yelled , but with howling winds almost always , nobody saw or heard her .
She 's lucky to be alive - and only right on the edge of our buildings !
Since when did the sun actually work as a coolant ?
“ The hotter it got , the better it worked ! , ” according to the CEO of the solar - powered air conditioning manufacturer .
Coolerado Corporation showcased their revolutionary design for a solar - powered air conditioning system at the last week ’s RETECH 2009 renewable energy trade show in Las Vegas .
The Coolerado air conditioner is capable of cooling off a 3,000 square foot building and uses only 600 watts of power – less than what is needed to light six , 100 watt light bulbs .
The system will provide 72,000 BTU ’s of cooling .
Only a few solar photovoltaic ( PV ) panels are needed to power Coolerado air conditioners , so most systems have plenty of excess power available for other electric devices .
The solar - powered air conditioning system also has “ a cool waste air stream that normally exhausts to the atmosphere , but can be ducted behind PV panels to improve their performance by more than 15 percent , ” says Tony McDonald , VP of sales at Coolerado .
“ Industry experts who have seen the system are also amazed at the tiny amount of power being drawn by the air conditioner , ” said Rick Gillan , executive vice president of Coolerado .
The air conditioner uses only 15 percent of the energy that traditional cooling systems use .
Colorado Governor Bill Ritter recently presented the company with the Governor ’s Excellence in Renewable Energy Award for 2008 .
The system has been showcased at trade shows , street fairs , music concerts and even the Democratic National Convention .
“ What surprised people the most was not only the solar powered cool air they enjoyed right on the street , but that the hotter it got , the better it worked ! , ” said the company ’s CEO , Mike Luby .
Coolerado is n’t the only one involved in the solar air conditioning business .
A company in Wisconsin , PDM Solar , said that it is trying to capitalize on the Obama stimulus plan to assist the company in mass - producing solar powered air conditioning systems .
“ We ’re taking a technology that was , you know , 100 years , 120 years old , and packaging it differently and using it in an application that has never been used before , ” said David Baker of PDM Solar .
PDM has been granted $ 200,000 by the Wisconsin ’s Energy Independence Fund , which distributes money to companies working on renewable energy projects .
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction : Correction : December 15 , 2008
A chart last Tuesday with an article about the proliferation of the atomic bomb , showing the exchange of nuclear information and technology between countries , misidentified the type of reactor that India acquired from Canada , which allowed India to make fuel for its first nuclear test .
It was a CIRUS reactor , not a Candu reactor .
Can a good type system prevent concurrency errors ?
Or is this a quest for the Holy Grail ?
There are two parts to this question , corresponding to two major types of concurrency errors :
Preventing data races
Preventing deadlocks
I ’ll start with the first one .
Data races occur only when memory is shared between threads .
Disallow sharing and data races are gone !
In fact there is a name for threads that do n’t share memory : processes .
It ’s perfectly feasible to have a concurrent language that disallows sharing –Erlang is one ( see my post about Erlang ) .
The trick is to always pass data between threads by value .
This is especially easy in functional languages .
Non-functional languages like C++ , Java , or D ( I was told by Walter Bright , the creator of D , to always use the full name , “ the D programming language , ” so that search engines can index it properly ) tend to share data almost by default ( see , however , this post ) .
In Java , all non-primitive types have reference semantics .
When you pass a Java object between threads , you ’re only passing a handle ; the object behind it becomes accessible from both threads .
C++ at least has means to express passing by value and move semantics for user - defined types .
Still , it ’s up to the programmer to use them .
Who ordered Guava ?
For every type - system idea there is one or more dialects of Java that implement it .
I ’ll start with an older attempt at data - race free Java called Guava , as it illustrates some of the basic premises .
- Explicit sharing
The most important step–if we do n’t want to completely ban the sharing of data–is to regulate it .
Let the programmer explicitly mark the data destined for sharing as such .
The corollary is that the data that is not marked for sharing cannot be shared .
This can be accomplished , for instance , by making all objects thread - local by default , or by using type modifiers that prevent references to such objects from escaping .
In Guava , the data type designed for sharing is called a Monitor .
As the name suggests , all access to a Monitor is automatically synchronized by the Monitor ’s lock .
This , incidentally , eliminates the need for the synchronized keyword , which is absent from Guava .
The non-shared data types are either Objects or Values .
Objects are just like regular Java Objects , except that they do n’t have a built - in lock , since they can never be shared between threads .
Values are either primitive values , like integers , or user - defined types with value semantics .
Monitors , Objects , and Values are collectively called instances .
- Value semantics
When you pass a Value , the compiler will make a deep copy of it ( well , sort of –the monitors embedded in a Value are not deep copied ) .
Since deep copying might be expensive , Guava defines operator “ move ” , which nulls the source .
The syntax is :
v2 = v1--;
The value v1 becomes null after the move to v2 .
This is similar to C++ unique_ptr and std::move .
- Ownership
The biggest problem in lock based concurrency is to make sure that the correct lock (s ) are taken when accessing shared data .
In Guava , all Monitor ’s data are protected by that Monitor ’s lock .
As long as they stay inside that Monitor , nothing bad can happen to them from the point of concurrency .
Values stored inside a Monitor are never accessible outside of the Monitor–only their copies may be passed out .
The same is not true about Objects .
Since Objects have reference semantics , there is a real danger that Objects ’ references might escape the Monitor that protects them .
Imagine a situation where two Monitors have references to the same Object .
It is possible then that two threads may operate on that Object at the same time–one entering through one Monitor , the other through the other Monitor .
We have a data race !
Therefore it is important that every Object have an owner at all times .
The Object ’s owner is either a Value or a Monitor .
( The exception is a fresh Object that ’s been just allocated –it has no owner until it is assigned to a variable . )
Since an Object may only be owned by at most one Monitor , it is that Monitor that protects it from simultaneous ( racy ) access .
- Regions
All Objects that are owned by a particular Monitor or Value form a region .
Equivalently , assigning a monitored region to an object specifies what lock must be held when accessing it .
All instances may contain ( references to ) monitors , but monitors are not “ owned ” by anybody .
References to the same monitor may appear in multiple regions and may be freely passed around .
It is thus up to programmers to define an ordering scheme for their monitors in order to avoid deadlocks .
How can we protect Objects from moving between regions and acquiring multiple owners ?
We need a way to control aliasing .
Here are some Guava rules for passing Objects .
A method may declare its Object parameter as either kept or lent .
( By default , parameters to Object methods are kept and to Monitor methods are lent .)
If the parameter is kept it must belong to the same region as this , and there are no limitations on its use .
If , however , the parameter is lent , the method may not store a reference to it in this , nor may it store this inside a lent Object .
No cross-aliasing is allowed .
A method may also be marked new if it returns a freshly created object , which has no owner yet .
Constructors are considered new unless they accept kept parameters .
Notice that you may have multiple references to the same Object , but they will all be within the same region .
The only instances that may be passed between threads are Monitors and Values .
- Constructors
Guava final fields may either be initialized inside a constructor or in a private method that is only called from inside a constructor .
( BTW , in D a private method is not private within a module , so the compiler would have to analyze the whole module to establish the latter condition . )
[ Note to self :
The same scheme might be useful in the construction of immutable objects in D. ]
Partially constructed Objects must not be visible outside constructors .
The compiler must verify that constructors do n’t pass this to other methods , and do n’t store this inside other instances ( no alias cross-contamination ) .
- Optimizations
Copying Values around may be expensive .
I already mentioned one optimization , the use of the “ move ” operator .
The other optimization is related to immutability .
If a Value is immutable , it may be safely passed by reference .
Guava defines immutable classes as ones that have no update methods .
Any method that may modify this must be marked update .
The update notation is also extended to method parameters–by default parameters are immutable .
There is a bonus advantage to separating update methods from the rest .
In a Monitor , a non- update method may safely use a readers ’ lock , which allows multiple readers to access data simultaneously , to increase concurrency .
- Global and local methods
A method is considered local if its effects cannot be observed or influenced by other threads .
All Object and Value methods are by default local .
A local method is immune to races thus allowing single - thread optimizations .
Conversely , all Monitor methods are considered global , since operations on Monitors may be visible or influenced by other threads .
These defaults may be overridden .
For instance , an Object may contain a reference to a Monitor .
The methods that call this Monitor ’s methods must be marked global .
Moreover , Object or Value methods that access Monitors that are passed to them as arguments must also be marked global .
So touching a Monitor ( which is equivalent to using its lock ) taints the whole callers ’ tree with the global annotation .
This is similar to the way update taints the callers tree , except the update annotation of a method only pertains to this , not to its arguments .
However , when global and update are combined , they have the same tainting power as global .
In particular , a method that invokes a global update method on its argument becomes tainted with global update .
Methods that are global update cannot be invoked from non- update methods , even if they only global - update their arguments .
Note :
This part of the paper is not very clear to me .
The authors never explain the importance of global update methods ( other than optimization opportunities ) .
- Limitations
Guava implements a relatively simple and somewhat limited system to eliminate races .
It punts the problem of ownership - passing and lock - free programming .
Even with those limitations the Guava type system is not simple .
The idea that safe multithreading may be achieved with a few simple modification to the type system seems to be untenable .
However , as long as special type annotations are limited to the code that does actual multithreading , I think they ’re worth the added complexity .
LAS VEGAS -- Police detective Mark Menzie drove 55 miles into the desert Sunday to inspect the charred remains of a formerly silver Ford Expedition .

Banking leaders face the hot seat in Congress Associated Press
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Banking leaders who benefited from a federal bailout are bringing a message of accommodation and gratitude to Congress , hoping for a better reception than the one given Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
The eight chief executives nevertheless will likely hear plenty of skepticism Wednesday morning when they take seats at a witness table in the Rayburn House Office Building .
It will be the first such examination by lawmakers since they passed the bailout bill last year .
The CEOS will be quizzed aggressively on how they have used more than $ 160 billion in taxpayers ' money .
In prepared testimony , the banking industry leaders applauded the program for making more loans available and promised to pay their share of the money back to the Treasury over time .
Anticipating confrontations over their own compensation , several asserted that none of the government 's money went to bonuses or dividends .

The " running machine " was well - named .
You had to put foot to the ground to make it move . *
Photo : Corbis * __1818 : __ A minor German nobleman patents a two - wheeled , foot - powered vehicle .
It looks almost like a modern bicycle , but it 's missing some key components .
Baron Karl Christian Ludwig von Drais de Sauerbrun ( or Drais von Sauerbrohn , or Sauerbron ) was born in Karlsruhe in 1785 .
He studied at Heidelberg and broke with his guardian 's pre-selected career choice of forestry to take up inventing .
Bad weather in 1812 caused oat crops to fail , and horses starved as a result .
That got von Drais thinking about how you could get around quickly without a horse .
His first attempt was a four - wheeled vehicle with a treadmill crankshaft between the rear wheels .
He demonstrated it to the Congress of Vienna ( the peace confab that ended the Napoleonic wars ) .
That invention went nowhere , but the eruption of Indonesia 's Tambora volcano in 1815 gave Europe a snowy summer in 1816 .
Oats were scarce and expensive again , horses died , and von Drais got back to work .
This time , he invented a two - wheeler on a frame that looks much like a modern bicycle frame with a seat and front - wheel steering .
It did n't have a chain drive , and it did n't even have pedals .
You drove the thing with your feet , much like a scooter .
You stopped it with your feet , too : no brakes .
Von Drais ' Laufmaschine , or running machine , bested 9 mph on its first trip , June 12 , 1817 , near Mannheim .
He patented the invention the next year , but better weather and falling oat prices dimmed its future as a practical replacement for the horse .
( Sounds sort of like gasoline prices and public attention to electric vehicles and alt - fuels , does n't it ? )
In some localities , riders faced fines for riding on public roadways .
The two - wheelers really needed paved or at least smooth surfaces , of which there were n't many .
It was also way too easy to fall off the contraption , and people 's leather shoes were nowhere near as durable as a horse 's iron shoes .
What 's more , the Laufmaschine also faced competition from another new invention : the railroads .
So , the utilitarian - inspired mechanical horse instead became a fancy toy for aristocrats and the rising bourgeoisie .
The French called it a draisine , the English a hobby horse .
The devices were often graced with equine figureheads , or even carved dragons and elephants .
In the first - known draisine race in 1819 , a German cyclist named Semmler covered the 10 - kilometer ( 6.2 mile ) course in 31 ½ minutes — an average speed under 12 mph .
( The word draisine is still used to describe a variety of hand - or foot - propelled rail cars , used for track inspection and repair . )
When revolution broke out in Germany in 1848 , Baron von Drais renounced his title , proclaimed himself a democrat and styled himself simply as citizen Karl Drais .
When the revolution failed , the triumphant aristocrats ridiculed Drais , and banned him from the fashionable spas .
The government also revoked his inventor 's pension .
Drais died in 1851 , but his concept of the rider straddling a two - wheeled vehicle with the rear wheel following a steerable front wheel lives on in both the bicycle and motorcycle .
In the decades after his death , many hands improved the two - wheeler :
French draisine maker Ernest Michaux put pedals on the front wheel in 1861 , then added brakes a few years later .
In 1869 , Englishmen James Starley and William Hillman started making penny - farthing bicycles with a small back wheel and huge front wheel .
The design maximized pedal power , but keeping balance was pretty tricky .
Harry John Lawson , another Englishman , returned to smaller wheels and notably added the chain transmission in 1879 .
Gottlieb Daimler added an engine to the design to create the first internal - combustion motorcycle in 1885 .
Starting in the late 1880s , John Dunlop , Édouard Michelin and Giovanni Battista Pirelli made successive improvements on Robert W. Thompson 's pneumatic tire , which rolled out a little ahead of its time in 1845 .
But the baron who did n't want to be a forester — or even a baron — was the father of it all .

Congratulations on having read this far .
Reading anything whatsoever is apparently a dying art .
According to a survey released last week to help promote World Book Day , 65 % of respondents admitted lying about which novels they 'd read in a desperate bid to impress people .
The news was accompanied by a top 10 rundown of the least - read and most - lied - about books .
Top of the list : George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty - Four .
Presumably people do n't feel the need to actually read it because they can see the film adaptation taking place all around them every day , yeah ?
Yeah .
In your FACE , Jack Straw .
Nineteen Eighty - Four is the only entry on the list I have actually read .
The others include War and Peace , Ulysses , and the Bible .
Apparently people lie about having read all these books because they think it 'll make them appear sexier .
Which begs the question : who the hell earnestly believes that claiming to have read the Bible from beginning to end is going to get them laid ?
Mention your love of the New Testament on a date and you might as well stick a fork in your face and start screaming about ghosts .
Potential partners who genuinely adore reading the Bible on a daily basis traditionally do n't mention it until later , when they 've invited you back to their place to unexpectedly nailgun your hand to the wall while loudly reciting a selection of their favourite parables from memory .
Still , the most tragic aspect of the survey is the sheer number of people who lie about the same things .
If you assume the respondents are at least vaguely representative of the nation as a whole , almost half of us have pretended to read Nineteen Eighty - Four , which means when you 're lying about it to impress someone , there 's a very good chance they have n't read it either .
Both of you are hiding your true selves in order to avoid recrimination , which , ironically enough , is precisely what the citizens in Nineteen Eighty - Four wind up doing , not that you 'd know .
My favourite sequence in the book , incidentally , is the bit where the monkey drives the car .
Of course , whenever two people meet , literary fibs are just the tip of the iceberg .
As potential partners initially circle one another , a full 98 % of their conversation consists of out - and - out falsehood .
The remaining 26 % is wild exaggeration .
It 's an unnecessary game of bluff in which you both claim to be into the same bands , hold the same political viewpoints , harbour the same dark secrets and so on .
Assuming it works and the pair of you get together , the rest of the relationship consists of either a ) both of you slowly discovering what the other one 's actually like , or b ) one of you grimly maintaining the fiction that , hey , you 're really into Bruce Springsteen , fell - walking or sex parties too , until the facade finally crumbles or you die of sheer despair .
The secret , then , is simply to let go : to not give a toss about what anyone else wants or likes or thinks in the first place .
That way you wo n't paint yourself into a corner trying to impress them .
In fact , the best strategy of all would be to actively put them off : confess to all your worst traits and guiltiest pleasures at the earliest opportunity .
Tell them you do n't know about that James Joop and his Ulyssesso pop-up book thingy , but you reckon James Herbert 's Nazi- zombie thriller ' 48 is one of the most exciting books you 've ever read ( which it is , actually ) .
Not only will this make them feel cleverer than you , and therefore good about themselves - which , let 's face it , is a nice present to give to anyone on this cold and awful planet - you 'll have set the bar so low there 'll be no need to impress them later by packing Midnight 's Children ( number seven on the list ) in your carry - on luggage when you eventually zoom off on honeymoon together .
Instead you can spend the flight playing Super Mario Shoe Factory on your Nintendo DS .
Everyone 's happy .
The other irony is that while people lie about having read highbrow novels in order to impress each other , a massive percentage of highbrow novels are n't worth reading anyway because the authors are too busy trying to impress the reader ( who , we now know , probably has n't bothered turning up ) .
That 's why so many contemporary novels seem to largely consist of a thinly veiled version of the author discussing politics and art and quantum theory over a carefully selected bottle of wine with the devastatingly beautiful mixed - race wife of an impotent international statesman and / or gangster ( delete where applicable ) before whisking her off to a swish hotel room to have expert animal sex with her all weekend until a pigeon symbolising the unions or something crashes into the window and blah blah blah blah BLAH .
I mean , really , who cares ?
Mr Tickle had 20 times the raw entertainment value - and it came with pictures - so if you can't beat that , do n't bother .
In summary : reading is more trouble than it 's worth , and lying about reading is even more pointless .
Far better to glance at the cover and skip to the end every time .
In fact , if you 'd done that with this article , you could 've got on with your day a bit quicker without listening to me burble on .
Sorry about that .
Now go away .

Green transport and sustainable fuel alternatives have come a long way in the past decade – but the auto industry still has a long way to go .
In the meantime , there are plenty of creative individuals coming up with their own way to make their driving a little eco-friendlier .
From fat and feces to liquor and sawdust , there are some weird alternative fuel sources currently powering cars around the world …
Disposable diapers are n’t exactly easy to dispose of – sitting in a landfill , a dirty diaper could hang around for as long as 500 years .
So why not turn those poop - filled pieces of plastic into fuel ?
Every 30,000 pounds of diapers could create 5,000 pounds of biodiesel and this stinky alternative fuel source is much more cost efficient than our traditional diesel .
There are a lot of ways to use old coffee grounds – as a dye , a fertilizer , you can even use coffee grounds as printer ink – but is old coffee a viable green fuel alternative ?
A gasification process allows the Cafe Racer to get around town on nothing but caffeine .
The 1975 pickup truck was modified by Chicken John .
Turkey plants discard all sorts of leftovers every day – bones , fat , feathers , and other little bits and pieces .
Changing World Technologies takes these leftovers and make turkey - based biofuel .
The company also turns waste from cows , chickens , pigs , and fish into clean alternative energy .
The Power of Paint
[ youtube width = ” 500 ″ height = ” 344 ″ ]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upI7QJis3bY[/youtube]
Spray - on solar panels are an intriguing concept that still have n’t reached realization , but if this renewable energy option is perfected and put into use – the solar paint could generate as much electricity as 50 wind farms for a fraction of the price .
The paint could be applied to homes , boats , cars , and even roads .
Human fat is another alternative fuel source to consider .
Trim a few inches off your waist and use your liposuction - leftovers as gas – could this be the key to an oil - independent nation and an answer to obesity ?
Earthrace owner , Pete Bethune used his own body fat to produce 100 ml of fuel for the boat .
I ’ve always thought of chocolate as human power – but mix it with a little e.coli bacteria and chocolate creates hydrogen .
Thankfully , the UK scientists experimenting with this weird fuel alternative are using chocolate waste instead of Hershey kisses !
Within 5 to 10 years , the technology may be ready for industrial - scale use .

Human power has been one of the most reliable sources of renewable energy for centuries , at least until the onset of the Industrial Revolution .
The HumanCar takes us back to those days in Bedrock , but this people - powered vehicle can travel over 30 mph – without a drop of oil .
Wind powered cars may be a sensible alternative fuel solution .
This working concept was designed by university students in Denmark with the supervision of 2 university scientists and competed in a renewable energy race against 5 other creations last August .
A sleek , aerodynamic body and a bit of an incline are all you need to power this Volvo .
This concept car fared well in the Extreme Gravity Competition in 2005 , reaching speeds of 54 mph , but gravity powered cars have still not made it into production .
Another wind - powered concept car , this 3 - wheeled creation uses a kite similar to the sail of a windsurfing board .
The kite car has electric motors in each tire for backup power when the wind speeds are n’t quite high enough .
To operate efficiently , the car requires a lightweight driver and , of course , a steady breeze .
Huge Sales on ... Everything From clothing to cars , prices are being cut like never before .
March 7 , 2009  -- Trey Shores , 36 , recently scored a fantastic deal .
The Tokyo - based consultant scooped up an in - season Helmut Lang leather jacket in the city 's Ginza district for 50 % off the regular price .
What was an out - of - reach $ 2,000 became a more reasonable $ 1,000 " just like that , " says Shores .
" I 'm quite proud of [ it ] . "
He 's certainly not the only consumer benefiting from the financial hardship of retailers .
From clothing to travel to cars , companies are being forced to reduce prices at a never - before - seen clip as the global economy continues to shrink .
Click here to learn more about surprising sales at our partner site , Forbes.com .
In the U.S. , consumer spending in the fourth quarter of 2008 -- which accounts for more than two - thirds of domestic economic activity -- decreased by 4.3 % , according to the Commerce Department .
That 's the worst decline since the second quarter of 1980 .
And while retail store sales were up 1 % in January 2009 to $ 344.6 billion when compared with December 2008 , and overall consumer spending was up 0.6 % during the same period , the government has attributed those increases to massive markdowns on inventory .
For many retailers , bargaining with consumers is the only option .
In other words , it 's a buyer 's market .
More Deals , Fewer Restrictions
Kathryn Finney , editor of the the Budget Fashionista , a Web site that caters to fashion - savvy shoppers on a budget , says that right now shoppers are likely to find more deals with fewer restrictions .
For example , coupons from department stores typically excluded products from the beauty counter , such as perfume or makeup .
Not anymore .
Finney recently used a Saks friends and family coupon to buy her favorite Giorgio Armani Hydro Glow foundation at 15 % off $ 57 , which knocked the price down to $ 48.45 ( before tax ) .
" I buy most of my makeup at Target , but I splurge on this foundation because of the quality , " says Finney .
" This is the first time I 've ever purchased it at a discount . "
And while shoppers are the true winners in this discount war , some retailers are benefiting as well .
Take discounted designer goods Web site Bluefly.com .
The site is currently featuring several coveted Hermès handbags at up to 40 % .
You wo n't find the brand 's popular Kelly or Birkin bags , but you will find a gray herringbone twill " Jumping " tote , discounted by 20 % to $ 1,480 .
Recently , a black pebble leather Bolide was been marked down by 49 % from $ 8,400 to $ 4,300 ( the piece sold out soon thereafter ) .
Melissa Payner , CEO of Bluefly , says that exclusive deals like this have kept customers spending .
Although Bluefly wo n't release 2008 full - year and fourth - quarter results until March 11 , the company did see significant growth in last year 's third quarter .
Sales increased by 10 % to $ 19.8 million , and gross profit increased 28 % to $ 7.3 million when comparing both with the third quarter of 2007 .
" As we 've become more well known , more and more designers have become interested in working with us , " says Payner .
An elevated brand list combined with an overall consumer desire to get more value for their money has aided Bluefly 's success .
" We 've seen growth in our customer file , e-mail subscribers and the word ' Bluefly ' as a Google search term . "
Beyond Beauty and Fashion
It 's not just fashion and beauty companies that are offering deals on their most coveted products .
Luxury car companies , for instance , are offering unheard - of incentives .
In January 2009 , Mercedes - Benz offered customers a $ 6,000 discount on the 2009 CLK , while Cadillac knocked $ 8,000 off of its extravagant SUV , the 2009 Escalade .
This month , Italian automaker Lamborghini is offering to subsidize the financing on its $ 1.5 million Reventon so potential buyers can avoid tight - credit banks .
" We 're definitely seeing automotive luxury players being a lot more generous with their incentives , " says Jessica Caldwell , an industry analyst at Santa Monica , Calif . - based auto data research firm Edmunds.com .
The incentives are also evident at the lower end of the luxury tier .
Through the end of March , Volvo is offering $ 1,553 cash back on any 2009 model .
This is in addition to the Swedish carmaker 's current loyalty incentive , in which customers can trade in an old Volvo , no matter how ancient , in exchange for guaranteed cash back on certain models .
These deals also include free factory - scheduled maintenance and Volvo roadside assistance .
High - End Dining
The leftover cash from Volvo might have once afforded you dinner for four at a swanky Manhattan eatery like Del Posto , where guests enjoy meals epic in quality and length .
Today , six or eight could dine for the same price ; some high - end restaurants are shaving the financial fat off of their decadent tasting menus .
Del Posto in particular has reduced its nine - course tasting - menu price to $ 125 from $ 175 and decreased its 20 - course menu from $ 250 to $ 175 .
And for the family who would choose Mickey Mouse over Mario Batali , Walt Disney World is offering some unprecedented offers .
While an all - access pass to the theme park in Orlando , Fla. , typically costs $ 75 , this year both adults and children get free admission if they visit on their birthday ( proof of age is required ) .
And cruise lovers will be happy to know that kids can travel on most three - night Disney Wonder cruises for free though May 28 , 2009 .
Good as these deals are for lucky consumers with a bit of discretionary income , these short - term survival tactics could spell trouble for retailers ' long - term outlook .
" People are questioning previous prices , " says Finney .
" They 're questioning [ traditional ] retailers altogether . "
In other words , shoppers like Trey Shores might never want to pay full - price for a high - ticket item again .
On the last afternoon of his life , Bernard Monroe was hosting a cookout for family and friends in front of his dilapidated home in this small northern Louisiana town .
Throat cancer had left the 73 - year - old retired electric utility worker unable to talk , but family members said he clearly was enjoying the commotion of a dozen of his grandchildren and great - grandchildren cavorting in the grassless yard .
Then the Homer police showed up , two white officers whose arrival caused the participants at the black family ’s gathering to fall silent .
Within moments , Monroe was dead , shot by one of the officers as his family looked on .

Now the Louisiana State Police , the FBI and the Justice Department are swarming over this impoverished lumber town of 3,800 , drawn by allegations from numerous witnesses that police killed Monroe without justification -- and then moved a gun to make it look like he had been holding it .
“ We are closely monitoring the events in Homer , ” said Donald Washington , the U.S. attorney for the western district of Louisiana .
“ I understand that a number of allegations are being made that , if true , would be serious enough for us to follow up on very quickly . ”
Monroe ’s friends and relatives say they still do n’t understand why the neighborhood patriarch ended up dead .
Four witnesses said he was sitting outside his home in the late afternoon on Feb. 20 -- clutching a large sports - drink bottle -- when two police officers pulled up and summoned over his son , Shawn .

Shawn Monroe , who has a long record of arrests and convictions on charges of assault and battery but was not wanted on any warrants , reportedly ran into the house .
One of the officers , who had been on Homer ’s police force only a few weeks , chased after him and reappeared moments later in the doorway , the witnesses said .
Meanwhile , the elder Monroe had started walking toward the front door .
When he got to the first step on the porch , the witnesses said , the rookie officer opened fire , striking Monroe several times .
“ He just shot him through the screen door , ” said Denise Nicholson , a family friend who said she was standing a few feet away .
“ After [ Monroe ] was on the ground , we kept asking the officer to call an ambulance , but all he did was get on his radio and say , ‘ Officer in distress . ’ ”

The witnesses said the second officer picked up a handgun that Monroe , an avid hunter , always kept in plain sight on the porch for protection .
Using a latex glove , the officer grasped the gun by its handle , the witnesses said , and ordered everyone to back away .
The next thing they said they saw was the gun next to Monroe ’s body .
“ I saw him pick up the gun off the porch , ” Marcus Frazier said .
“ I said , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
The cop told me , ‘ Shut the hell up , you do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ’ ”
Homer police maintain Monroe was holding a loaded gun when he was shot , but would not comment further .
The shooting took place amid long - standing tensions between police and the residents of Monroe ’s crime - plagued neighborhood .

“ People here are afraid of the police , ” said Terry Willis , vice president of the Homer branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People .
“ They harass black people , they stop people for no reason and rough them up without charging them with anything . ”
That is how it should be , responded Homer Police Chief Russell Mills , who noted the high rates of gun and drug arrests in the neighborhood .
“ If I see three or four young black men walking down the street , I have to stop them and check their names , ” said Mills , who is white .
“ I want them to be afraid every time they see the police that they might get arrested .
“ We ’re not out there trying to abuse and harass people -- we ’re trying to protect the law - abiding citizens locked behind their doors in fear . ”

Trees :
More than just carbon sinks
By Mark Kinver
Science and environment reporter , BBC News
" In the absence of trees , our communities would simply collapse , " states Andrew Dokurugu , a project officer for Tree Aid .
Speaking from the charity 's West Africa offices in Burkina Faso , he explains how trees are vital for poor rural villages to survive in the long - term .
" We are looking at ways to promote sustainable agriculture and agroforestry , " he tells BBC News .
Fruits , leaves , wood and bark provide the vital resources for rural life " This will help ensure that the remaining trees are well looked after and that communities have access to the trees they require . "
Using the Family Trees and Land Use scheme in northern Ghana , one of Tree Aid-led projects that have helped 600,000 villagers , Mr Dokurgu outlines why so many communities in West Africa are facing tough times .
" Rural settlements located close to big cities have particularly difficult challenges , " he says .
" Urban developments damage the environment and remove trees for use in the cities .
" This quickly deprives rural areas of their sources of food , fuel and other tree products . "
Rising urban populations and expanding cities makes life tougher both inside and outside the city boundaries .
Seeds of growth Tree Aid was set up in 1987 by a small group of foresters who were keen to use their expertise to help people in Africa , explained programme director Tony Hill .
Growing demands means natural regeneration is no longer enough " They saw that trees , potentially , were a way for poor rural families to help themselves in the long - term , " he told BBC News .
And in 1997 , the charity established a permanent office in Ouagadougou , the capital of Burkina Faso .
Mr Hill described this development as a " step change " for Tree Aid , which has now planted more than 6.5 million trees .
" We were then able to work directly with local partners , " he said .
" Projects always have a beginning and an end , but the needs of the villagers do not end when the scheme finishes - particularly when you are dealing with trees .
" You need to have the continuity of attention , care and protection if you are going to deliver the benefits long - term . "
Planting trees offers a better outlook for future generations
The need to plant and manage the region 's tree stocks is becoming increasingly important , Mr Hill says .
" If you go back several decades , the wild tree resources were rich enough for villagers to get more or less all of the products they needed without having to plant trees .
Without trees in the landscape , you cannot have a sustainable farming system
Tony Hill
Tree Aid " Now , growing populations and an erratic climate means that villages have to invest in trees , rather than letting nature do its own thing . "
However , it is not simply the case of telling people to plant saplings and sitting back and waiting for them to grow .
Some cultures , Mr Hill reveals , have traditionally considered planting fruit trees as taboo : " People believed that if you planted a tree , you were bound to die before it bore fruit . "
But he says one of the biggest challenges is the issue of land tenure .
" For farmers , it is like a declaration of ownership .
Planting trees says ' this is my land and it is going to be mine for a long time ' .
Tree produce is the sole source of income for many people " For many people , it is difficult to negotiate adequate secure tenure and get permission from all of the relevant authorities . "
This is one area where Tree Aid has been focusing its efforts , especially for women , who generally are not allowed to own land .
" In the drylands of Africa , where Tree Aid operates , the real value of trees is the products that they can take : fruits , leaves , bark and roots , firewood , building materials , " Mr Hill says .
He adds that healthy trees also help maintain the area 's ecosystems .
" People rely on trees to recycle nutrients , prevent erosion and maintain moderate water flows .
" Without trees in the landscape , you cannot have a sustainable farming system .
" Without farming , you do not have any life in these communities . "

I 'm watching the President 's address to Congress .
Or I was anyway .
I 've had enough .
But after listening to him butcher economics for the last half hour , I have an idea for a little mass action that will both protest the ignorance of his plan and educate those who need it most in the process :
Readers of this blog should email the office of their elected officials , and enclose the following link :
http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss1.html
That link is to " The Seen and the Unseen " by Bastiat .
It is quite clear after listening to Obama 's talk tonight that he , and those who applauded him wildly , have no clue as to this fundamental point in political economy .
Not once in all of his talk of what government would do did he ever even come close to acknowledging that what government spends on the one hand must be taken from the private spending stream on the other .
In fact , at one point he touted his " transparency " plan by saying that it would enable " taxpayers to see how government money is being spent helping other taxpayers . "
Maybe so , but he glosses over the fact that the money being spent came from those same taxpayers and would have been spent on other things , without the waste of the transfer , were it not for government 's intervention .
Robbing Peter to " help " Paul only damages both in the process , and certainly stimulates no economic activity .
So let 's start our own little form of mass action and protest .
Take a few minutes and email your elected officials ( and members of the media ! ) a copy of Bastiat 's essay .
And then you should spread the word to your friends and family and ask them to do the same .
Feel free to enclose a note to the politicians and talking heads explaining why they should read it .
It can't hurt and it can only help .
And would n't it be great if this spread and members of Congress and the media ( and the White House ! ) got deluged with dozens or hundreds or thousands of emailed copies of Bastiat ?
At the very least , no one can say we did nothing .
Programming Clojure Beta 5 is now available .
What 's new :
A new chapter , Clojure in the Wild , with information on
unit testing with test -is
data access with clojure.contrib.sql
web development with Compojure
desktop GUI development with Clojure and Swing
I have rewritten Section 1.1 " Clojure Coding Quick Start . "
All dependent libraries ( Clojure , clojure - contrib , etc. ) are now prebuilt and included with the sample code for the book .
This should make it much easier for people to get started .
I have rewritten Section 2.6 " Metadata " to clearly explain the difference between user metadata and compiler metadata .
Clojure and clojure - contrib continue to evolve .
To make sure you have the latest , greatest version of the sample code from the book , go and grab the github repo .

JAKARTA , Indonesia ( CNN ) --
The death toll from a flash flood in Indonesia 's capital grew to 98 people on Sunday as rescuers widened their search for more than 130 other people in the aftermath .
Members of a search and rescue team look for bodies near Jakarta .
The nation 's health ministry said 62 women , 31 men and three students had been killed .
Of those , 12 bodies remained unidentified , ministry spokesman Rustam Pakaya said .
Another 13 people were missing .
The search for the missing will be called off Sunday night , he said .
The flood started Friday morning after heavy rains caused waters to smash through a dam and rush into Jakarta .
The breach unleashed a torrent of water that plowed into hundreds of homes in what some survivors described as a suburban " tsunami . "
About 1,500 volunteers -- mostly students from two flooded universities in Jakarta -- are assisting in the search and rescue effort , said Mardjito , a social affairs ministry official who , like many Indonesians , goes by one name .
He said rescuers started using heavy machinery to lift debris .
Still , the death toll is expected to rise .
At least 50 people were injured and nearly 1,500 have been displaced .
Mardjito said a camp for survivors so far has adequate supplies as members of political parties continue to send food , blankets , flashlights and other items amid a major election year .
Sleeping residents were taken by surprise by the powerful flash flood as it crashed through the crowded Cirendeu district near Jakarta early Friday .

Drenched and shivering survivors were taking refuge on the rooftops of their homes as rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to reach them , said social affairs ministry official Mardjito .

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , currently on the campaign trail ahead of the elections later this year , has said he had ordered senior ministers to visit the scene of the disaster .
" On behalf of the government , I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty , " he said , according to the official Antara news agency .
The rain obliterated a 255 - meter - long section of the dam , releasing a wall of water from a 20 - hectare lake that some survivors said reminded them of the tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004 .
" They said they had heard loud rumbling sounds like during a powerful earthquake .
They later found out that the sounds came from the water rushing out from the dam's lake , " according to Antara .
Floods from heavy rains are an annual occurrence in and around Jakarta , a low - lying city on the northern coast of Java island , where poor infrastructure often results in polluted canals and rivers overflowing their banks and spilling into thousands of homes .
In 2007 , 38 people were killed and 430,000 forced from their homes when storm water 3 meters deep in some places swamped 75 percent of the capital , which is home to about 9 million people .
With poor sanitation and a hot and humid climate , the risk of water - borne diseases is usually a major concern following floods in the city , where mosquito - transmitted malaria is also a threat .

Bellman , Dynamic Programming , and Edit Distance
Approaches to the exact edit distance problem
Richard Bellman created the method of dynamic programming in 1953 .
He was honored with many awards for this and other seminal work , during his lifetime .
We probably all know dynamic programming , use it often to design algorithms , and perhaps take it for granted .
But , it is one of the great discoveries that changed the theory and practice of computation .
One of the surprises–at least to me–is given its wide range of application , it often yields the fastest known algorithm .
See our friends at Wikipedia for a nice list of examples of dynamic programming in action .
I never had the honor of meeting Bellman , but he wrote a terrific short autobiographical piece that contained many interesting stories .
( I cannot locate it anymore : if you can please let me know . )
One story that I recall was how , when he was at The Rand Corporation , he often made extra money playing poker with his doctor friends in the evenings .
He usually won , which convinced them that he was using “ deep mathematics ” against them–perhaps probability theory .
Bellman said the truth was much simpler : during the day the doctors were stressed making life and death decisions , at night when they played poker they “ let go ” .
During the day Bellman could just look out at the Pacific Ocean from his office and think about problems .
At night he played tight simple poker , and he cleaned up .
One other story from this piece made a long - lasting impression on me .
When he was famous he would often be invited to places to give talks , like many scientists .
However , he always insisted that he must be picked up at the airport by a driver of a white limo .
I understand the driver part , I understand the limo part , but insisting on the color was a very nice touch .
The Edit Distance Problem
The edit distance problem ( EDP ) is given two strings
determine their edit distance .
That is what are the fewest operations that are needed to transform string into .
The operations allowed are : insert a character , delete a character , and substitute one character for another .
In general their costs can be arbitrary , but for us we will consider only the basic case where insert / delete have unit cost and substitute has cost two .
This makes sense , since substitute is the same as one delete and one insert .
This distance is sometimes called the Levenshtein distance , named after Vladimir Levenshtein , who defined it in 1965 .
The notation of edit distance arises in a multlude of places and contexts , I believe that the notion has been repeatedly discovered .
It also has many generalizations where more complex operations are allowed .
People really care about EDP .
There are very good heuristic algorithms that are used , for example , in the biological community to solve EDP .
One is called BLAST .
It is implemented in many languages and runs on everything , there are even special purpose hardware devices that run BLAST .
Clearly , there is need for solutions to EDP .
Unlike theory algorithms , BLAST has no provable error bounds ; unlike theory algorithms , BLAST seems , in practice , to be good enough for the scientists who use it .
However , I have no doubt that they would prefer to get the optimal answer–however , the cost of getting the optimal answer cannot be too great .
Upper and Lower Bounds
The dynamic programming algorithm for EDP has been discovered and rediscovered many times .
I believe that Robert Wagner and Mike Fischer did it first , but I will not try to be the perfect historian .
Their algorithm runs in time and uses the same space : it is convenient to assume that for the rest of this post .
With a little bit of work , it is easy to improve the space bound to
There are papers that prove a lower bound of for EDP .
These papers assume a restricted model of computation : only input symbols can be compared for equality .
Like any restricted lower bound they give you an idea of what not to do : if you wish to beat the the lower bound , then you must do more that compare symbols for equality .
Use the value of the symbols , use bit operations , use randomness , do something other than just compare symbols .
Actually , as I recall , there was a bit of an inversion here : there was a better upper bound paper that gave an algorithm for EDP that took time , before the lower bound papers were published .
The method used to prove the sub-quadratic algorithm for EDP is based on a general idea called The Four Russian Method .
I never liked the name , I do like the method .
As Dan Gusfield points out , the four were not even all Russian : perhaps a consequence of the cold war was that information did not always flow easily between east and west .
The Four Russian Method was first , I believe , used to compute boolean matrix products faster than cubic time .
The method has been used since then to solve many other problems .
If you do not know the method , take a look at the following link .
Still here .
Okay , here is an overview of the method : it is based on trading space for time .
A typical Four Russian Method algorithm operates in two phases .
In the first phase , it examines the input and cleverly pre-computes values to a large number of subproblems , and stores these values in a look - up table .
In the second phase , it uses the pre-computed values from the table to make macro steps during the rest of the computation .
The result is usually a reduction in time by a logarithmic factor , while the space becomes as large as the time .
The method is not generally practical ; however , it is a useful method to know .
Bit Complexity
Actually there is a logarithmic factor that is hidden in the quadratic dynamic programming algorithm for EDP , since the algorithm must use size numbers .
Thus , the bit complexity is , .
There is a clever way to remove the factor of that is due to Dan Lopresti :
Theorem 1
There is an algorithm for EDP that uses bit operations and space .
Proof :
The key idea is to use only a constant number of bits rather than bits and still run the standard dynamic program .
I will explain this in more detail in a future post .
Truth in blogging : Lopresti was once a graduate student of mine , and I worked with him on this result .
Approximation and EDP
Legend has it that when faced with unravelling the famous Gordian Knot , Alexander the Great simply cut the knot with his sword .
We do this all the time in theory : when faced by a “ knotty ” problem we often change the problem .
The edit distance problem is any not different : years ago the problem of exact distance was changed to approximate edit distance .
The goal is to get a fast algorithm that finds the distance to within a small relative error .
For example , in the STOC 2009 conference there will be a paper “ Approximating Edit Distance in Near - Linear Time ” by Alexandr Andoni and Krzysztof Onak .
They show that there is an algorithm ( AO ) that in time gets a relative error of
This is a huge improvement over the previous work .
I will not go into any details today , see their paper for the full proofs .
This is very pretty work .
I have started to look at their paper and believe that it has many interesting ideas , they may even help solve other problems .
My issue is that we still are no closer to solving the edit distance problem .
The AO algorithm still makes too large relative error to be practical –what exactly is the factor for reasonable size ?
See my other posts on the use of “ O - notation . ”
On the other hand , I am intrigued with their breakthrough .
I think that it may be possible to use their new algorithm as a basis of an exact algorithm .
The key idea I have in mine is to try to use their algorithm combined with some kind of “ amplification trick . ”
Amplification
Papers on approximations to the EDP use “ relative ” error , so let ’s take a look at additive error .
Suppose that is an algorithm for the EDP that works for any fixed size alphabet .
Say that has additive error provided , for all strings of length over the alphabet ,
There is a simple amplification trick :
Theorem 1
Suppose there is an algorithm for the EDP that runs in time and has additive error .
Then , there is an algorithm for the EDP that runs in time and has an additive error of .
I assume that this is well known , but in case not , here is a sketch of the proof .
Suppose that and are strings of length over the alphabet .
Consider the following two strings :
The claim is that provided ,
It should be clear that
since one way to change to is to edit the strings and and leave the ‘s alone .
The cost of this is twice the cost of editing to .
The opposite inequality follows since any matching of the first with the second ( or the other way around : second with first ) must delete all the ‘s and this will cost more than This claim follows since are over an alphabet that does not include .
Thus ,
and therefore ,
Divide by and we see that is within additive error of the edit distance of and .
I conjecture that there is a general construction that can replace by an arbitrary .
This would yield an algorithm that runs in time and has additive error of for some absolute constant .
Note , we can repeat the above construction ; however , the obvious application would require a size alphabet .
If such an amplification were possible , then we could do the following , for example : if there is an algorithm that runs in near linear time , i.e. time , for EDP and has additive error of , then there is a near linear time exact algorithm for EDP .
This follows by just setting and doing the calculation .
I have started thinking about the AO algorithm and how to combine it with different amplification methods .
Perhaps this could lead , finally , to a fast exact algorithm for EDP .
Perhaps .
In any event such amplification methods seem potentially useful .
Open Problems
Thus , the main open problem is clear : find an EDP algorithm that runs in time .
Or one that runs in time , or near linear time .
Or one that runs in I see no reason , even after decades of failure , to believe that there could not be an exact algorithm that runs fast and solves the EDP .
This is–in my opinion–an important and exciting open problem .
Let ’s finally solve the problem .
There are other , perhaps , more approachable open problems .
In real applications the inputs are not worst case , nor are they random .
For instance , the BLAST program assumes implicitly a kind of randomness to the inputs .
Are there reasonable models of the kinds of inputs that are actually encountered ?
And for such a model can we get provable fast algorithms for EDP ?
Ali Velshi & the CNN Money Team take on the dismal February jobs report .
How will the job market recover ?
Watch a special AC360 � Friday at 11 p.m. ET
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The U.S. economy continued to hemorrhage jobs in February , bringing total job losses over the last six months to more than 3.3 million , and taking the unemployment rate to its highest level in 25 years .
The government reported Friday that employers slashed 651,000 jobs in February , down from a revised loss of 655,000 jobs in January .
December 's loss was also revised higher to a loss of 681,000 jobs , a 59 - year high for losses in one month .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a loss of 650,000 jobs in February .
" The economy is headed south with a vengeance , " said Kurt Karl , head of economic research for the U.S. unit of insurer Swiss Re .
The unemployment rate rose to 8.1 % from 7.6 % in January .
It was the highest reading since December 1983 and higher than economists ' projections of 7.9 % .
Most workers who have jobs today are not old enough to have worked in a labor market this bad , while 13 % of workers were n't even alive the last time unemployment was at this level .
The survey of households found 12.5 million people are now unemployed , the most since records started being kept in 1940 .
The U.S. economy has now lost 4.4 million jobs since the start of 2008 .
To put that in perspective , that 's about equal to the total number of jobs in each of the following states -- Georgia , Michigan and North Carolina -- at the end of 2007 .
" It 's a dismal report .
We thought we'd have another month like this , and I think we have a couple of more coming , " said Tig Gilliam , chief executive of Adecco Group North America , a unit of the world 's largest employment firm .
" We 've got a lot of layoffs being announced that have n't been implemented . "
Gilliam said he expects the unemployment rate to rise to 9 % within the next few months .
Other economists echoed Gilliam 's view that the battered labor market has yet to hit bottom .
John Silvia , chief economist at Wachovia , pointed to the weekly initial jobless claims , which are still above 600,000 a week , and the large increase in the number of people working part time when they 'd prefer full - time work as signs of more job losses to come .
" I 'd love to believe this is the worst , but I suspect we 'll continue to lose jobs for months to come , " he said .
" All we can hope is that the pace would slow down . "
The Obama administration issued a statement saying that the jobs report and overall economic problems are the reasons why it moved quickly to get an economic stimulus package passed by Congress last month .
" There 's no doubt that we have a long way to go to get this economy moving again , and the jobs numbers are one more reminder of that , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters aboard Air Force One .
But some economists questioned whether the stimulus package will be able to do much to address job losses in the near term .
" The stimulus wo n't have immediate effect on job creation even though some planned layoffs could be cancelled , " said Sung Won Sohn , economics professor at Cal State University Channel Islands .
He said most of the job growth that the $ 787 billion in government spending will create wo n't be seen until 2010 .
Underemployment rate keeps rising as well
The number of workers with part - time jobs who either can't find full - time positions or have had their hours cut jumped by 787,000 in February to 8.6 million .
Counting those part - time workers , along with discouraged job seekers no longer counted as unemployed by the government , the so - called underemployment rate hit 14.8 % in February , up from 13.9 % in January .
This was the fifth straight record high for that reading , which has been calculated since 1994 .
Silvia said the cut in total hours worked and the jump in those now working only part - time are both signs that the overall economy will continue to slow .
He said many people with part - time jobs are not earning enough to pay their bills .
That will probably lead to more cuts in consumer spending , which in turn will lead to more drops in revenue for businesses and more layoffs .
The job losses were widespread , with manufacturing and construction companies , as well as business and professional services firms all losing more than 100,000 workers .
The report also showed that businesses in more three - quarters of the sectors in the economy reduced the number of jobs in the last month .
Over the last three months , 83.2 % percent of industries have lost workers , a record high for that reading .
" What started in construction and manufacturing and financial services has spread to every industry , " said Gilliam .

Via : Telegraph :
The study , funded by the copper industry , found copper fittings rapidly killed bugs such as MRSA and C difficile – bugs which claim thousands of lives a year .
Trials at Selly Oak hospital , in Birmingham , found copper taps and toilet seats helped significantly reduce the presence of the bug .
Copper is a common constituent in medicines including antiseptic and antifungal creams .
Although it is widely believed copper provides relief to many , including those with arthritis who wear copper bangles , there is no scientific evidence that they work .
It is thought the presence of copper in the hospital wards prevents the germs from breathing and stops them from feeding .
The ten - week trial involved a set of taps , a toilet seat and a push plate on an entrance door on a medical ward being replaced by copper versions .
They were swabbed twice a day for bugs , comparing the results with traditional versions elsewhere in the ward .
It found the copper items had up to 95 per cent fewer bugs on their surface whenever tested .
Professor Tom Elliott , lead researcher and a consultant microbiologist at the hospital , said : “ The findings of 90 to 95 per cent killing of those organisms , even after a busy day on a medical ward with items being touched by numerous people , is remarkable .
“ I have been a consultant microbiologist for several decades .
This is the first time I have seen anything like copper in terms of the effect it will have in the environment .
“ It may well offer us another mechanism for trying to defeat the spread of infection . ’
Should further trials prove as successful , the researchers hope to install copper fittings in hospitals throughout the country .

Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has been sworn in as prime minister in a unity government with President Robert Mugabe .
The justices ’ questions to lawyers often reveal how the court is leaning .
Legal analysts will be carefully watching Chief Justice Ronald M. George , whose vote often determines whether the conservative or more liberal wing of the court prevails .
The court will need to decide the fate of existing same - sex marriages only if it is prepared to uphold Proposition 8 , which many legal analysts believe is likely .
During a three - hour televised hearing this morning , the San Francisco - based high court will examine whether the November ballot measure was an impermissible constitutional revision or a more limited constitutional amendment .
The California Supreme Court will hear arguments today on whether Proposition 8 , the anti-gay - marriage initiative , should be upheld and , if so , whether the marriages of an estimated 18,000 same - sex couples should remain valid .
The state high court ruled 4 to 3 on May 15 that same - sex couples should be entitled to marry .
George wrote the ruling , which was signed by Justices Joyce L. Kennard , Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos R. Moreno .
Justices Marvin R. Baxter , Ming W. Chin and Carol A. Corrigan voted against overturning the state ’s previous ban on same - sex marriage , arguing that the matter should be left to voters .
After Proposition 8 passed , only Moreno voted to put the measure on hold pending a decision on the legal challenges .
Kennard , who usually votes in favor of gay rights , voted against accepting the revision challenge to the proposition but said she would hear arguments over the validity of existing same - sex marriages .
Some legal analysts believe the vote signaled that Kennard did not believe the revision argument would prevail .
Without her vote , the court would be unlikely to muster a majority for overturning the measure .
In addition to arguing that Proposition 8 was an illegal constitutional revision , gay rights lawyers contend that it usurped the authority of the courts .
The hearing , scheduled to start at 9 a.m. and end at noon , will be broadcast live on the California Channel and streamed on its website .
The California Constitution can be revised only during a constitutional convention or if two - thirds of the Legislature puts the proposal before voters and they approve it .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown ’s office will ask the court to overturn the measure on other grounds .
Brown has said Proposition 8 must be struck down because it eliminates an inalienable right without compelling reasons .
Both challenges are based on novel legal theories .
Gay rights lawyers contend that the measure undermined the Constitution by permitting a simple majority to take away a fundamental right from a constitutionally protected minority that has suffered discrimination .
Legal analysts have said the court is more likely to uphold the existing same - sex marriages than to overturn Proposition 8 .
The court received a record number of briefs in the case , with most outside groups calling on the court to overturn the measure .
Opponents of gay marriage have threatened a campaign to remove justices who vote to overturn the measure .
If the court upholds the proposition , gay rights activists will consider asking voters to revisit the marriage question in an initiative on the 2010 ballot .
In previous cases , the court has defined a constitutional revision as a change in the fundamental structure or foundational power of state government or one that makes " far - reaching changes in the nature of our basic governmental plan . "
Courts in Oregon and Alaska have rejected revision arguments in upholding anti-gay - marriage amendments , but those challenges did not involve marriage rights that the voters repealed .
The California Supreme Court has rejected at least six revision challenges of initiatives , including measures that reinstated the death penalty , changed tax law ( Proposition 13 ) and imposed term limits .
In 1948 , the court overturned an initiative as an illegal revision because it made a wide array of changes in the state Constitution .
And in 1990 , the court struck down an initiative that would have required the courts to apply federal law when determining the rights of criminal defendants .
The relatively few state high court decisions on revision challenges have never directly addressed whether the kind of change made by Proposition 8 could be considered a revision .
Six of the court ’s justices were appointed by Republican governors .
Moreno is the only Democratic appointee .

Dear Cecil :
As a kid , I seem to remember reading on the back of a cereal box about a man who got struck by lightning seven or eight times during his life , totally at random , with no scientific explanation as to why this poor soul ( the final strike killed him ) was subject to these heavenly barrages .
I also recall that the guy 's headstone , by an infinitesimally small chance , was hit by lightning and obliterated some years after his death , which is very spooky .
He had clearly annoyed somebody by his mere existence .
Could you confirm or deny this electrifying ( sorry ) tale ?
Greg , London , UK
Cecil replies :
I can confirm about 80 percent of it , putting it 79.9 percent ahead of most of the yarns that cross my desk .
No doubt we can thank the cereal box , where at least you had somebody from Kellogg ’s ( Weetabix , whoever ) keeping things straight , in contrast to , say , Wikipedia , which is more the million - monkeys - with - a- million - keyboards approach .
First the accurate 80 percent : the human lightning rod you ’re thinking of is Roy Cleveland Sullivan , for most of his life a forest ranger at Shenandoah National Park , Virginia .
He was struck seven times :
While in a lookout tower in 1942 .
While driving in 1969 .
While walking across his front yard in 1970 .
While standing in a ranger station in 1972 .
While on patrol in the park in 1973 .
While checking a campground in 1974 .
While fishing in 1977 .
Fine , the guy ’s job kept him outside a lot .
Still , seven ?
Roy suffered assorted losses during these encounters : toenails , eyebrows , hair , and eventually his nerve .
After the fourth incident he started to believe some higher power was trying to kill him , according to a 1989 St. Petersburg Times article ; the fifth time came after he tried unsuccessfully to outrun a cloud he thought was following him .
Given that , ignoring Bayesian considerations , the chances of being struck seven times in your life are about 1 in 1.6 times 10 to the 25th power , I do n’t blame him for a little paranoia .
Lightning did n’t end up killing Roy , though – he took his own life at age 71 .
Ca n’t help thinking he wanted to beat the universe to the punch .
Now for the balance of the BS 20 percent – the headstone angle .
I suspect you or the cereal company has conflated Sullivan ’s well - attested story with a possibly apocryphal tale about one Major Summerford .
According to numerous accounts , Summerford was a British officer who , while on horseback in Flanders in February 1918 , was struck by lightning .
After moving to Vancouver , he was again hit in 1924 and once more in 1930 .
Dying in 1932 , he rested in peace until 1936 , when lightning allegedly struck either his tombstone or close to it .
Great story , huh ?
Well , I ca n’t verify any of it – and brother , I tried , searching vainly in print and online for anyone with a similar name and description , including British and Canadian military records and Vancouver history .
I did notice the interval in years between lightning strikes was 6 - 6 - 6 .
You may call that a sign ; I call it fishy .
I turned up something else interesting , or rather my intrepid assistant Una did : one of the Teeming Millions who has survived multiple lightning strikes , namely August Hellman of Arkansas .
He says he ’s been struck twice , once while baling hay in an Oklahoma field in 1959 and again while sailing on Savannah Bay in 1977 .
In both cases , he said , the storm advanced quickly and left him nowhere to hide .
Just before the first strike his hair stood on end , the baling wire made a “ crinkling ” sound , and he noticed a strong smell of ozone ; the sailboat ’s mast made a similar sound just before the second strike .
Mr. Hellman reports having had a sense of impending doom in each case , perhaps as a result of static charge buildup , followed by an earsplitting noise and a few seconds of lost time .
Although both times he suffered severe burns and sore muscles , he was n’t permanently injured .
Still , he ’s not looking forward to strike three .
When you consider that more than 31 million bolts hit the ground annually in the U.S. alone , what ’s surprising is n’t that some folks are struck repeatedly but rather that most are n’t struck at all .
A federal study of lightning incidents from 1959 to 1994 shows that over that time roughly three people were killed and nine injured by lightning per million flashes , though mortality is dropping – by 1994 injuries outnumbered deaths eight to one .
Other facts of note :
Men really take it in the shorts , accounting for 83 percent of lightning victims .
Golfers make up just under 5 percent of victims .
July is the most common month to get struck , noon to 6 PM the most common time , and Saturday and Sunday the most common days , with Wednesday a strong third .
Why Wednesday ?
Wild guess : doctors ’ day off .

Heroes was perking up last week , but this week there was a slow slide into the melodrama blahs - punctuated by completely random religious moments .
Spoilers ahead .
OK look , if you liked Monday 's episode then riddle me this :
Why would Nathan swoop in and rescue Claire , then take her to Mexico , only to earn money for their hotel room by challenging some frat boys to a shot - drinking contest ?
Obviously the writers realize that we 're dying for an excuse to drink during Heroes , but creating an actual drinking game in the show is not the way .
Seriously , THIS is Nathan 's way of showing he can be as cool as Claire 's ( good ) adoptive dad HRG ?
Telling her that he earned money in the army by drinking lots of shots , and then passing out ?
Advertisement
Luckily it turns out that one of Claire 's many " tissue regenerating " powers allows her to stay completely sober while drinking over 22 shots because - as she explains later - her liver is regenerating .
What ?
Honestly I would rather watch her liver regenerate like 1000 times over if it meant I could skip her whole pep talk with Nathan where she whines that he's " supposed to be Superman " and therefore he should go to Washington and make everything better .
And then he drunkenly admits that he sucks and has been a lame father .
Actually , why can't he sober up and go to Washington and make everything better ?
He 's been running the whole mutant roundup thing , and all he has to do is work more on shutting it down .
Nobody will believe the psycho Hunter about Nathan flying anyway .
Have I missed some subtle political point here that explains why Nathan is no longer a powerful politician and instead is some dude in a hot suit and even hotter sunglasses drinking shots with frat boys in Mexico ?

Try not to think about that , Newitz - just focus on the Sylar .
Oops , I 'm talking to myself .
Heroes does that to me after a while , especially when I 'm watching Sylar eat his own brain !
Yes , that was a truly awesome development and certainly worth slogging through the confusing Jesus stuff ( more on that in a minute ) .
Here 's what happened .
After some lollygagging , the Hunter finally decides to hook up with Sylar and go mutant hunting together .
HRG has given Hunter a pep talk about how you can " use " the mutants and Sylar keeps leaving the Hunter all kinds of dead people as presents and finally Hunter caves and makes out with Spock .
I mean , Sylar !
I mean , crap !
They do n't really even make out !
But what they do is team up to hunt a shapeshifter at a club where the shifter is using his powers to mack on chicks while wearing the Hunter 's pasty face .
Then the shifter takes Sylar 's face so he 's a lot hotter .
Then the real Sylar and the real Hunter trick the shifter into leaving the club and the Hunter shoots him - but leaves him alive for Sylar to eat .
So there 's literally a Sylar - on - Sylar brain eating scene !
You should see the sexy looks that Sylar shoots over to the Hunter when he finds out what a pal his mutant - killing buddy is .
Now they are truly a team , and Sylar can morph into anything as long as he sort of groans and makes faces .
As the new boyfriends drive away , Hunter says , " If we succeed , you 'll be the only one . "
And Sylar does his Spock eyebrow and is like , " Yeah and we can have tons of sex . "
I mean , he says something like " Yeah totally that 's the plan . "
Anyway , now it seems like Sylar 's raison d'etre might be to eat every mutant in the world , with Hunter 's help .
But it 's hard to say because Sylar is pretty sneaky and never really has sex with anybody except Electric Elle and that was last season .
Now for Jesus .
If you thought Nathan 's whining about how he never was a good father to Claire was bad , wait ' til you get a load of Mama Petrelli's " you must hate me " guilt trip .
Yup , she even lays it on Peter in a church where she goes to calm down and get some sleep so she can start using her prophesy powers .
Remember , Peter rescued her from Hunter 's guys and they 're on the run .
So after she yammers at Peter for minutes on end about how she was a bad mom and even God can't forgive her , Peter is like , " I do n't totally hate you , please just drink some tea and go to sleep . "
Poor Peter - he may have superpowers , but nobody can withstand the Total Guilt Momslaught .
Advertisement
That 's probably why Peter goes and lights a bunch of candles and stares up at a painted Jesus thingie and talks for way too long about how Jesus should be helping him out and where is Jesus .
Hello , you are in a scientific universe full of mutants , Peter !
This is not a Jesus - based story .
Jesus is busy on other shows that have angels and devils and crap like that .
Anyway Peter does n't know this , and so he prays for a really long time and then he and Mama hide in a confessional while HRG and the shock troops search the church for them .
Mama confesses that she had to become an evil manipulator to save the world and she 's guilting so hard that HRG finds them - but pretends he has n't .
You can tell from Peter 's face that he thinks Jesus has intervened .
And maybe he has !
At the end of the episode , Mama Petrelli finally falls asleep and has a vision of an angel or maybe just a stained glass window .
Either way , she says they have to get the Petrelli family together again and go to visit her mysterious sister .
I hope it 's a Twisted Sister .
Because I really want somebody to have the superpower of yelling WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT every time the plot veers away from Sylar or Rebel .
CAIRO – Washington and Baghdad signed a security agreement earlier this month allowing the U.S. to maintain a military presence in Iraq for another three years .
But while Baghdad officials hailed the pact as the “ beginning of the end ” of the U.S. - led occupation , Egyptian commentators  like much of the Iraqi opposition  say the agreement simply reflects U.S. strategic interests .
“ The pact reflects the balance of power and is therefore entirely in the interest of the U.S. , ” Ahmed Thabet , political science professor at Cairo University , told IPS .
“ It provides formal cover for the continuation of the U.S. occupation of Iraq and leaves all decision - making  and the very fate of the country  in American hands . ”
After months of wrangling between the U.S. - backed government in Baghdad and Iraqi opposition groups , the agreement was ceremonially signed Dec. 14 by outgoing U.S. President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
The pact lays down a timetable for the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraqi cities by June of next year and the complete departure of the U.S. military from Iraq as of Jan. 1 , 2012 .
In addition to a timetable for troop withdrawals , the treaty also puts limited restrictions on U.S. military operations in Iraq and grants Baghdad a degree of legal jurisdiction  under certain conditions  over U.S. troops .
While Iraqi government spokesmen defended the pact as a step towards the eventual departure of all foreign troops from the country , Iraqi opposition groups blasted the deal .
Iraqi Shia leader Moqtada al - Sadr , whose followers staged angry demonstrations against the agreement , called it “ a pact of shame and degradation . ”
In Egypt , a major Arab ally of the U.S. , the signing of the agreement was met by official silence .
Independent Egyptian commentators , however , were quick to criticize the document , which they say amounts to little more than political cover for the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq .
“ The agreement is simply a formal continuation of the long - standing U.S. occupation and will ultimately allow American troops to stay in Iraq indefinitely , ” Gamal Mazloum , retired army general and expert in military affairs , told IPS .
Most importantly , said Mazloum , the pact does not clearly and definitively call for the full withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the Jan. 1 , 2012 , deadline .
“ The terms of the agreement are ambiguous and contain a number of possible legal loopholes , ” he said .
“ Although it states that the U.S. military presence is temporary , there are a number of stipulations that could allow it to extend its mandate further . ”
“ Iraqi government officials say the pact represents the ‘ beginning of the end ’ of the U.S. military in Iraq , ” Mazloum added .
“ But at the same time , they ’re publicly saying that U.S. forces might be needed for another ten years . ”
On Dec. 11 , a spokesman for Maliki reportedly told a Pentagon press briefing that U.S. troops might be required to provide security in Iraq for up to another decade .
“ The Iraqi military is not going to be built in the three years .
We do need many more years , ” he was quoted as saying .
“ It might be ten years . ”
In a statement issued days later , the Iraqi PM insisted that his spokesman ’s comments “ did not represent the Iraqi government . ”
Thabet , too , expressed serious reservations over the likelihood of a full U.S. withdrawal within the next three years , pointing to recent calls by the U.S. Defense Department for the establishment of permanent military bases throughout Iraq .
“ In this case , the U.S. will be able to say it has withdrawn while simultaneously maintaining strategic command centers from which it can force its policies on the Iraqi government and people , ” he said .
On Dec. 13 , fears that the agreement ’s terms would not be respected by U.S. military planners were partially borne out when the commander of coalition forces in Iraq , Gen. Raymond Odierno , announced that U.S. “ training teams ” would remain in Iraqi cities beyond the June 30 deadline .
The agreement was officially approved  by a slim majority  by the Iraqi parliament late last month .
Nevertheless , critics say the pact lacks the support of the Iraqi public , the vast majority of which would like to see the immediate departure of all foreign troops .
“ Washington forged the security pact with the government in Baghdad , not with the Iraqi people , ” said Thabet .
“ And the only Iraqis that will benefit from it are those individuals and political parties  be they Sunni , Shia , or Kurdish  working in the interest of the U.S. ”
Thabet added that , almost six years after the U.S. - led invasion , there is still “ tremendous popular opposition ” to the presence of foreign troops in the country .
“ The occupation has n’t benefited anyone except the so - called Iraqi ‘ expatriates ’ that cooperated with U.S. war planners in Washington and London in advance of the invasion , ” he said .
Nor , say critics , will the signing of the agreement have a positive impact on Iraq ’s dangerous security environment .
“ I seriously doubt that the pact will improve the security situation , since the U.S. military itself  which broke up the country ’s existing police apparatuses and encouraged sectarian conflict  is the reason behind most of the instability , ” said Mazloum .
He went on to point out that , according to the document ’s small print , U.S. soldiers operating in Iraq will for the most part remain subject to U.S.  not Iraqi  law .
“ This means that war crimes perpetrated by U.S. troops can be expected to continue , ” he said .
“ Iraq will never be stable until all foreign military forces completely withdraw from the country , ” Mazloum said .
“ But given the vague terms of the new pact , I ca n’t see this happening for a very , very long time . ”
The bishop said his sons were wearing harnesses A bishop who claims he was assaulted by police after photographing his two sons sitting on top of their south London home has threatened legal action .
Bishop Jonathan Blake , 52 , pictured the boys , who he said were wearing harnesses , reading books on the roof in Welling as part of a school challenge .
He said he was punched and kicked after his arrest last month , before he was released by the Metropolitan Police .
The force said the allegations would be dealt with appropriately .
' Brutal policing '
The police spokesman also confirmed that the bishop was released after his arrest and that no further action would be taken .
" I was arrested without questioning and without any details being taken and without any ability to stop this waste of police resources , " Bishop Blake said .
" This was a gratuitous example of unintelligent and brutal policing . "
We are very conscious about safety .
At no point were they in danger
Bishop Jonathan Blake The Open Episcopal Church bishop claims one officer punched him in the back , injuring his shoulder , and kicked him as he was taken downstairs in handcuffs .
The clergyman has written to Metropolitan Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and the IPCC .
He is also considering taking legal action against the police , alleging false imprisonment and personal injury .
His arrest was triggered on 29 January after a member of the public reported a child left unattended on a roof .
The school challenge involved being pictured in the most unusual place reading a book .
The children were challenged to read a book in an unusual place After spending about 20 minutes photographing Nathan , seven , and Dominic , eight , Bishop Blake said seven police officers arrived at his home and arrested him .
But he insisted his children were completely safe .
" We are very conscious about safety .
At no point were they in danger .
" There were lots of people who walked by and they did n't have any concerns because they could see the harnesses . "
He added : " We are very hands - on parents .
I walk the boys to school three times a week and we leave early so we 've got an hour and a half walking and climbing in the park .
" We encourage them to do all the things that the nanny state does not want them to do . "
The boys and their younger brother Gabriel , two , were " traumatised " by his arrest , Bishop Blake said .

President Obama thanks President Obama in teleprompter screw - up
“ The president embarrassed America and showed the world just how stupid he really is last night . ”
That ’s how the media would have reported last night ’s White House screw - up if President Bush were still in office .
But we doubt that President Obama will receive the same harsh treatment .
Here ’s what happened :
Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen was giving a speech when he realized he was repeating the same words President Obama had just read from the same teleprompter .
Cowen stopped , turned to the president and said , “ That ’s your speech . ”
Obama laughed .
Oh , how he laughed .
It was the laugh of a man who was thinking , “ Damn , I ’m glad that was n’t me . ”
Then he compounded the problem by walking up to the podium , staring into his trusty teleprompter and giving Cowen ’s remarks instead of his own .
In the words of Fox News , “ President Obama thanked President Obama for inviting everyone over . ”
Joe Biden was once busted for stealing a British politician ’s speech .
But at least he was smart enough not do it right in front of the guy .

Barack Obama 's decision to order 17,000 more combat troops to Afghanistan signals the start of an intense debate in Nato about how to respond to the country 's crisis , western diplomats and military officials say .
When he announced his decision on Tuesday night , Obama said the increase was " necessary to stabilise a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan " .
His military advisers urged him to deploy as many as 30,000 extra troops .
The president said military means alone would not solve the problem .
The US government is conducting a review of policy towards Afghanistan , as is General David Petraeus , overall commander of US forces in the Middle East and Central Asia .
Both reviews are likely to conclude that more emphasis should be placed on the economic , social , and political , development of the country - including corruption and the heroin trade .
That , and training the Afghan security forces , costs money .
But some donor countries are wary of spending more and are reneging on their promises , leaving a shortfall of billions of dollars , according to a report by the Afghan finance ministry .
Of $ 21bn ( £ 14.7bn ) in aid pledged at an international donors ' conference in Paris last year , only $ 14bn was new money , leaving a shortfall of $ 7bn , the report says .
A senior British defence official yesterday described the operation against the Taliban as " strategically a stalemate " .
Though Britain shares the US view that there is no long - term military solution - and both agree that talks with Taliban leaders will have to be pursued - there are concerns about a shortage of combat troops .
Britain and the US are increasing pressure on their Nato partners to deploy more troops and equipment , notably helicopters .
Italy and Germany have indicated they are prepared to deploy more forces .
But a number of governments do not share the view expressed by Obama and British ministers that Afghanistan could collapse into a failed state , allowing the Taliban and al - Qaida to become the kind of threat that they were before 9/11 .
With Nato casualties reaching record levels , a UN report this week said war - related civilian Afghan deaths increased by nearly 40 % to 2,118 last year .
While it said " anti-government elements " were responsible for 55 % , a quarter of all civilian casualties - 552 people - died as a result of US and Nato air strikes .
Polls suggest foreign troops are becoming increasingly resented in Afghanistan , and that the main cause of this is the number of civilians killed .

WASHINGTON — Americans ' net worth plunged a record 17.9 % in 2008 as the value of their homes , stocks and other assets dropped swiftly , the Federal Reserve said Thursday in a report that did not bode well for consumer spending and the overall economy this year .
With net worth dropping so much , consumers are likely to focus on saving , not spending , as they realize they can't rely on their homes and stock portfolios as ever - rising sources of income , says RDQ Economics senior economist Conrad DeQuadros .
Such saving , while good in the long run , will likely prolong the economic slump .
Consumer spending drives more than two - thirds of U.S. economic activity .
" This does point to further weakness in consumer spending going forward , " DeQuadros says .
" I was confident before that I was doing fairly well , " says Sullivan of Venice , Fla .
But , " I have no chance at all of recouping the money by the time I need it . "
U.S. net worth , a measure of households ' assets minus their liabilities , such as debt , was $ 51.5 trillion in 2008 , the lowest since 2003 .
The record annual drop in net worth , the first since 2002 , accelerated as the year progressed .
In the fourth quarter , household net worth dropped 9 % , the biggest decline since quarterly records began in 1951 , the Fed said .
Other details from the report :
• The value of household real estate fell for a second - consecutive year in 2008 , declining 10.5 % , the biggest drop on record .
At $ 18.3 trillion , the total value of U.S. homes was the lowest in five years .
• Stock market wealth plunged a record 39.9 % in 2008 to $ 5.5 trillion , the lowest since 1996 .
• Corporate profits fell 10.8 % in the September - December quarter and were down 8.8 % for the year as a whole .

Lieutenant - Colonel Yvonne Bradley , an American military lawyer , will step through the grand entrance of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London tomorrow and demand the release of her client - a British resident who claims he was repeatedly tortured at the behest of US intelligence officials - from Guantánamo Bay .
Bradley will also request the disclosure of 42 secret documents that allegedly chronicle not only how Binyam Mohamed was tortured , but may also corroborate claims that Britain was complicit in his treatment .
But first , Bradley , a US military attorney for 20 years , will reveal that Mohamed , 31 , is dying in his Guantánamo cell and that conditions inside the Cuban prison camp have deteriorated badly since Barack Obama took office .
Fifty of its 260 detainees are on hunger strike and , say witnesses , are being strapped to chairs and force - fed , with those who resist being beaten .
At least 20 are described as being so unhealthy they are on a " critical list " , according to Bradley .
Mohamed , who is suffering dramatic weight loss after a month - long hunger strike , has told Bradley , 45 , that he is " very scared " of being attacked by guards , after witnessing a savage beating for a detainee who refused to be strapped down and have a feeding tube forced into his mouth .
It is the first account Bradley has personally received of a detainee being physically assaulted in Guantánamo .
Bradley recently met Mohamed in Camp Delta 's sparse visiting room and was shaken by his account of the state of affairs inside the notorious prison .
She said : " At least 50 people are on hunger strike , with 20 on the critical list , according to Binyam .
The JTF [ the Joint Task Force running Guantánamo ] are not commenting because they do not want the public to know what is going on .
" Binyam has witnessed people being forcibly extracted from their cell .
Swat teams in police gear come in and take the person out ; if they resist , they are force - fed and then beaten .
Binyam has seen this and has not witnessed this before .
Guantánamo
Bay is in the grip of a mass hunger strike and the numbers are growing ; things are worsening .
" It is so bad that there are not enough chairs to strap them down and force - feed them for a two - or three - hour period to digest food through a feeding tube .
Because there are not enough chairs the guards are having to force - feed them in shifts .
After Binyam saw a nearby inmate being beaten it scared him and he decided he was not going to resist .
He thought , ' I do n't want to be beat , injured or killed . '
Given his health situation , one good blow could be fatal , " said Bradley .
" Binyam is continuing to lose weight and he is going to get worse .
He has been told he is about to be released , but psychologically and physically he is declining . "
It is conceivable that Mohamed himself may shortly return to London , heralding yet another political embarrassment for Foreign Secretary David Miliband , who already faces a tumultuous week over claims that he was keen to suppress evidence of torture .
On Tuesday , the unprecedented dispute between Miliband and the judiciary is set to reignite when High Court judges Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones decide whether to reopen the case which Mohamed believes substantiates his torture claims .
Meanwhile , in San Francisco , a little - publicised court case into the treatment of Mohamed will open .
American civil liberties lawyers are hoping to shine a light on the defence firm that allegedly carried out the practice of " rendition " on behalf of the CIA .
Jeppesen Dataplan , a Boeing subsidiary , helped to arrange rendition flights for several terror suspects , including Mohamed , to nations where they claim they were tortured .
The case was originally dismissed after the Bush administration asserted " state secrets privilege " , indicating that it would endanger national security - the same argument used by Miliband .
However , Obama has repeatedly stressed his willingness to be less secretive than his predecessor and a similar decision would lead to claims that the current administration is bent on suppressing evidence of torture .
Closer to home , the Observer has found evidence suggesting a broader unwillingness by Britain to confront the US over its war on terror programme .
The Attorney General says it is " actively considering " possible criminal wrongdoings against MI5 and the CIA , but sources claim the government 's senior lawyer has failed , after almost four months of looking into the issue , to request material from the US that may substantiate allegations of MI5 complicity in Mohamed 's torture .
Suspicion is also growing that some sections of the US intelligence community would prefer Binyam did die inside Guantánamo .
Silenced forever , only the sparse language of his diary would be left to recount his torture claims and interviewees with an MI5 officer , known only as Witness B . Such a scenario would also deny Mohamed the chance to personally sue the US , and possibly British authorities , over his treatment .
But if Mohamed survives to come back to London , his experiences of the past six years promise a harrowing journey through the dark underbelly of the war on terror .
For Miliband , the questions concerning Britain 's role may have only just begun .
In a basketball arena filled with uniformed officers from across the continent , four members of the Oakland Police Department were remembered Friday as eager servants of the city where -- six days earlier , in a single afternoon of horrific gun violence -- they paid for their dedication with their lives .
“ When duty called , they did not hesitate to answer , ” said U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , one of a handful of elected officials who spoke at the three - hour service in Oracle Arena .
“ When danger lurked , they did not back away .
And when the time came to make the ultimate sacrifice , their final hour was their finest . ”
It was a ceremony filled not only with soaring oratory , cannon salutes and helicopter flyovers , but also with poignant moments and touching memories .
These were offered by colleagues and family members who spoke about each of the four men -- Sgts. Ervin Romans , Daniel Sakai and Mark Dunakin and Officer John Hege .
Dunakin and Hege were motorcycle patrolmen who shortly after 1 p.m. last Saturday pulled over wanted parolee Lovelle Mixon for what was described as a “ routine traffic stop ” in east Oakland .

Mixon , a 26 - year - old with a long criminal record , shot the two officers with a handgun and then , witnesses reported , stood over them and fired coup de grace rounds into his victims .
He fled to his sister ’s apartment around the corner where , two hours later , a SWAT team led by Romans and Sakai stormed the unit .
Mixon shot them through a closet door with an assault rifle , wounded a third officer and then was killed by police , according to authorities .
The magnitude of the loss moved law enforcement agencies from Canada and across the United States to send contingents to the service : Mounties in their bright red jackets , Boston police in their dress blues , LAPD motorcycle officers who rode in formation all the way up Interstate 5 and attended the ceremony in their high , leather boots .
All 800 - plus members of the Oakland Police Department attended , their duties on the streets taken up for the day by other agencies .
They wore white gloves and somber faces as they marched into rows of seats on the arena floor .

The already seated crowd stood as one and watched the 15 - minute procession in silence .
There were several such long silences at pivotal moments in the ceremony , and they were almost as moving as the eulogies .
A large blue curtain parted and the coffins were rolled out , one by one .
Each was escorted by officers as pallbearers and by immediate family .
A bagpipe and drum corps , composed mainly of San Francisco police officers , played a medley of “ Dawning of the Day ” and “ Going Home . ”
The last coffin to emerge was that of Sakai who , among other duties , served as a K - 9 officer .
When his casket had been placed in a row with the others , each before their respective family members , Sakai ’s partner , a German shepherd named Doc , was brought in on a leash .
The dog stood at the casket and barked several times before being led away .

After Interim Police Chief Howard Jordan , Feinstein , Sen. Barbara Boxer , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , Atty . Gen. ( and former Oakland mayor ) Jerry Brown spoke , it was time for the rank - and - file officers and kin of the fallen to bring intimacy to the service .
There were tears and occasional sad smiles as the speakers worked through their memories of childhood antics , family bonds , station house pranks , love of police work , personal passions and deep friendships galvanized in dangerous moments .
Though the shootings have been characterized in some quarters as evidence of strains between Oakland police and portions of the city , this was not a day for divisiveness .
Lawrence Eade , a retired lieutenant who spoke as a friend of Hege , expressed frustration over continued media reports on the subject .

“ I need to set the record straight , ” he boomed .
“ The citizens are not warring against the police .
There is no war between us and , I might add , you cannot create one . ”
One of the most moving speakers was Capt .
Ed Tracey , who , after making his way to the podium , pulled off his white gloves and sighed , loudly .
There were bags under his eyes .
His voice faltered as he spoke .
Tracey explained that he supervised both the tactical teams and traffic units .
“ These were my men , ” he said simply .
“ Please know , ” he said , “ that these officers died doing absolutely what they loved , being Oakland police officers , riding motors , kicking in doors , serving on SWAT . ”

Tracey ended by giving thanks to a passerby who had attempted to save the stricken motorcycle officers before paramedics arrived .
“ To the brave man who provided CPR to our fallen heroes , we thank you , ” Tracey said .
“ We thank you from the bottom of our heart .
Your actions let us know that day that they did not die in vain , that the people they were there to protect and serve were the ones who helped them . ”
This was met with sustained applause , not only from Oakland police ranks seated on the floor of the arena , but from the sections in the upper reaches that had been reserved for civilians .

POZNAN , Poland , Dec. 13 ( UPI ) -- Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore says the world needs to drop its obsession with celebrities and concentrate on saving future generations from global warming .
Gore , trying to rally delegates to the United Nations Climate Change Conference that concluded Friday in Poznan , Poland , used soaring rhetoric to urge participants to renew their moral commitments to fight to end global warming , The Daily Telegraph reported .

" The political systems of the developed world have become sclerotic , " he said .
" We have to overcome the paralysis that has prevented us from acting and focus clearly and unblinkingly on this crisis rather than spending so much time on O.J. Simpson , Paris Hilton and Anna Nicole Smith . "
The conference ended in harsh criticism of the European Union for failing to move forward on emission standards .
Gore , however , said help was on the way from U.S. President - elect Barack Obama and his " new green deal , " which he predicted would be copied all around the world , the Telegraph reported .
" Once he ( Obama ) is president , the ( United States ) will engage vigorously in theses negotiations and help to lead the world toward a new era on global co-operation on climate change , " Gore said .
Franken campaign demands ' forensic ' search for missing ballots Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Franken camp says lead down to 10 Al Franken 's Senate campaign demanded an intensive search for more than 130 missing ballots Thursday and said the Democratic candidate 's lead over Republican incumbent Norm Coleman is down to 10 votes .
Campaign lawyer Marc Elias told reporters Thursday that 56,000 votes remain to be counted of more than 2.4 million cast in the Minnesota Senate race .
The 10 - vote margin does not include a Minneapolis precinct where 133 ballots were lost .
Elections officials in the precinct are keeping the recount open while they search for those ballots .
Elias demanded an " intensive and thorough " search for the missing ballots .
" That does n't mean [ just ] looking around the office , " he said .
" They should conduct a systematic , forensic search of the polling location , any vehicles that were used to transport those ballots and the warehouse where they were stored . "
Reporters pressed Elias on what the campaign would do if the ballots were not found .
He would say only that the campaign is keeping all its options open and that he was optimistic the ballots would be found .
" I do n't believe that 133 ballots walked off , " he said .
" We 're not walking away from 133 votes . "
Later Thursday , Franken 's campaign said Minneapolis elections director Cindy Reichert revealed that a missing envelope , marked " 1/5 , " contained the 133 missing ballots .
" We 're glad that Minneapolis elections officials now acknowledge that these ballots are missing , and that they are committed to finding them .
To fail to do so would disenfranchise 133 Minnesota voters and call into serious question the integrity of this election , " said Franken spokesman Andy Barr .
" The Secretary of State 's office has rightly recognized the importance of this matter by giving Minneapolis officials the time they need to locate this envelope .
Simply put , these ballots must be found . "
Also on Thursday , Coleman 's campaign decided to withdraw 650 ballot challenges following a similar move by Franken 's campaign the day before .
The Franken campaign 's estimate of its margin is based on observations from poll watchers on - site at recount locations .
The campaign also assumes that a state canvassing board will not overturn the inital judgements of elections officials on any of the nearly 6,000 ballots being challenged .
Tallies from local newspapers continue to give Coleman a lead of several hundred votes .
With relatively few votes remaining to be counted , the Franken campaign believes its margin will remain fairly unchanged .
However , with so many ballot challenges , the outcome of the race could change depending on a state canvassing board 's decisions later this month .
Franken 's campaign has said they may go to court if they are unsatisfied with the canvassing board 's decision or may ask the US Senate to intervene .
AS PART of a strategy designed to broaden the revenue base , leverage content over new platforms and promote The Economist brand to a young and dynamic audience , The Economist Group is delighted to announce the development of a public - entertainment facility that combines the magic of a theme park with the excitement of macroeconomics .
After six months of negotiations with the British government , The Economist Group can confirm that Econoland will be built on a former industrial estate in East London , close to the beating heart of the City and thus to a large potential market of financial - sector employees .
Thanks to issues relating to its previous use , the site has been acquired at an advantageous price .
Most of the toxic wastes have been cleared and levels of carcinogens appear to have returned to normal .
High unemployment in the area will only increase the facility 's attractions , as former City workers seek to recapture some of the excitement they enjoyed in their professional life .
Heavy investment in security and a landscaped moat and electric fence will neutralise any potential threat from the growing anarchist presence .
Among the thrilling experiences Econoland will offer are :
The currency high - roller : Float like a butterfly with the euro and drop like a stone with the pound !
Chamber of horrors : Tremble at the wailing of distressed debt !
Fiscal fantasyland :
Watch the economy shrivel before your very eyes as you struggle to stop growth falling !
Bankrupt Britain :
Pit your wits against the government as you try to sink sterling and bring the country to its knees !
The Severe Contest :
Try your strength against a bear market !
“ Econoland will appeal to the kid in everyone ” , said a spokesman for The Economist Group , “ although children themselves will not be admitted ” .
The park will open on April 1st .

There are some 1.4 million active members of the US military Reports of sexual assault by US military personnel against both fellow troops and civilians rose by 8 % last year to 2,923 , the Pentagon says .
The number of incidents reported in Iraq and Afghanistan rose by about a quarter on the previous year to 163 .
Pentagon officials say the jump in reports suggests the department 's policy of encouraging victims to come forward is bearing results .
But they estimate that no more than 20 % of attacks are actually reported .
" Given the fear and stigma associated with the crime , sexual assault remains one of our nation 's most under - reported crimes in both the military and civilian community , " said Dr Kaye Whitley , the director of the Pentagon 's Sexual Assault and Prevention Office .
She said the rise in reported incidents did not necessarily mean sex crimes were increasing but that victims were less afraid to come forward .
" The department has been aggressively pursuing efforts to increase reporting and convince more victims to seek care and support services , " she said .
Among the report 's findings :
There were 2,923 reported sexual assaults in the 2008 fiscal year , up from 2,688 in 2007
There 251 incidents in combat areas , including 141 in Iraq and 22 in Afghanistan
Investigations took place in 2,763 cases .
In 832 cases , action was taken , including 317 courts - martial , a rise of 38 %
Of the 6.8 % of women and 1.8 % of men who indicated they had experienced unwanted sexual contact , the majority - 79 % of women and 78 % of men - chose not to report it .
The Pentagon acknowledges that despite the increase in reported attacks and action taken , " the question will be asked why every single reported case did not go to courts - martial " .
One possible explanation , the report says , is the complexity of sexual assault investigations and prosecutions .
Unwanted sexual contact is defined as ranging from touching to rape .
Of the reported attacks , 63 % were rape or aggravated assault .
The report covers rape and sexual assaults across the 1.4 million active members of the US military .
Cases are defined as involving at least one member of the military as either alleged attacker or victim .

Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007
Officials from the two biggest Palestinian factions have returned to the Egyptian capital , Cairo , to resume reconciliation talks .
Their dialogue , mediated by the Egyptians , was adjourned two weeks ago after they failed to agree on the shape of a unity government .
Fatah and Hamas , which control the West Bank and Gaza respectively , had hoped to reach agreement by the end of March .
Policy , security and electoral arrangements remain areas of dispute .
Ahmed Qurei , the former Palestinian prime minister , is representing Fatah , while the senior Hamas figure at the talks is Musa Abu - Marzuq , who is based in Damascus .
Egyptian intelligence official Omar Suleyman is acting as mediator .
Recently we ’ve had a couple of articles and discussions on OSNews about browser statistics .
Every now and then someone in the comments will ask what OSNews statitstics are like , and what browsers and operating systems our readers are running .
Well , recently we installed a fancy new web site analytics program , Mint .
I figured I might as well put it to good use by showing some of the browser and platform statistics we ’ve gathered over the past month .
Disclaimer
It is obvious that these figures are representative of nothing other than the OSNews readership , which means that in no way can they be extrapolated to other websites or the rest of the world .
For the most part , our statistics are n’t very surprising .
As a website dedicated to alternative computing , with a readership consisting largely of , well , nerds , you ’d expect to see lots of non-Windows and non-Internet Explorer users , and this turns out to be true .
Still , deeper down in the data there are some interesting figures .
Operating system usage
As was to be expected , we have lots of readers using Linux and Mac OS X. Still , I had not expected that Windows ’ share would be over 50 % ( I had expected more Mac users ) .
There is more to this chart than meets the eye , of course .
When you break down the Windows figure into Windows XP , Vista , and previous versions , you ’ll see that Vista really is n’t popular among OSNews readers .
That 57 % breaks down into 40 % XP , 13 % Vista , and 3 % unknown ( Windows 7 ? ) .
The remaining 1 % is previous versions ( adding up to 57 % ) .
OSNews ’
Mac users are a lot more eager to upgrade , with the 16 % figure consisting of 13 % Leopard users , 1 % Tiger users , 1 % unknown , and less than 1 % iPhone users .
I had expected the iPhone figure to be slightly higher , I must admit .
I also like to believe the “ unknown ” are stubborn Mac OS 9 users .
Sadly , we can’t really break down the Linux figure .
It ’s just 25 % , and we do n’t know anything about which distributions or desktop environments people are using to access OSNews .
The “ other ” figure is also unspecified , but those are of course all Amiga users .
Right ?
Browser usage
Our browser statistics are pretty straightforward , and do n’t contain too many surprises .
Firefox is obviously the big bad evil monopoly here , with more than half of our readers preferring Mozilla ’s golden boy .
What ’s interesting is that there are still quite a number of people using Firefox 2.x , namely about 3.5 % .
We also appear to have quite a few Mozilla - proper users on OSNews .
Where it gets a tad bit worrying are the stats for Internet Explorer .
Apparently , we still have 5 % of our readers visiting OSNews with Internet Explorer 6.0 , which should be a crime .
Internet Explorer 7 is stuck at 8 % , and version 8 , only recently released , is already at 3 % .
And yes ,
Mint even reports a number of users using IE 5.x , which is n’t all that weird seeing we still get Windows 95 and 98 users as well .
We also had a few people coming in with an Internet Explorer 999.1 string , which most likely are people who think they ’re being funny .
Which they ’re not .
For the rest , we already have a lot of Chrome 2.x users ( relative to 1.x , that is ) , and the same goes for Opera – we already have quite a number of Opera 10 users ( again , relatively speaking ) .
Misc
As it turns out , most of our readers have Flash installed , with only 8 % not having Flash ready on their systems .
Unsurprisingly , Flash 9 and 10 are the most popular , with respectively 24 % and 67 % .
The most popular resolution is 1280 × 1024 ( 22 % ) but the others are following close behind with all about 12 - 15 % : 1280×800 , 1680 ×1050 , 1024×768 , and 1440×900 .
Only 2 % of our readers use the typical netbook resolution of 1024×600 .
We got wind that Obama was doing something big at midnight , and he did .
Though at first blush it might not have seemed that way .
He released a video .
To the leaders and people of Iran , on the holiday of Nowruz ( New Years ) .
At first , Joe and I thought , huh ?
A video ?
That ’s the big news ?
But then as you ’re watching , you realize what ’s up .
He ’s reaching out to Iran .
Something the US has n’t done since Reagan sent that stupid cake in the 1980s .
This is actually quite big .
It ’s something Obama said he ’d do .
Reach out to our enemies .
And he did .
He did it in a way that does n’t cede any ground .
But at the same time treats them with respect .
It will be interesting to see how official Washington reacts tomorrow during the day .
As an aside , the fact that Reagan is the other president who reached out to Iran may just inoculate Obama from any real criticism from the right .
They can knock Obama for extending an olive branch to Iran , but then they ’re knocking Reagan too .
Here ’s the video :

Is it just me , or does Obama already look older ?
Bailouts , Double Standards and Hypocrisy
The Senate Republicans have made it clear they have no principled objection to bailouts .
As The Freeman editor Sheldon Richman pointed out , if they ’d been motivated by free market principle , they would have just refused a bailout–period .
But instead , they demanded a rewrite of the House version because it was n’t tough enough on auto workers .
( Free Association blog , Dec. 13 , 2008 ) .
Richman cited a Wall Street Journal editorial of the same day that celebrated the extortion as “ Mitch McConnell ’s Finest Hour . ”
Shocked ?
I did n’t think so .
What ’s really amusing is the WSJ editors ’ obliviousness to their own self - contradiction .
Using the bailout as leverage to extort lower wages , in WSJ parlance , is “ reform ” and “ discipline . ”
See , it was all about making auto workers “ show they were serious about making Detroit competitive again . ”
No bailout will ever restore the car companies to profitability without a restructuring .
Yet an explicit UAW goal is to use the bailout to avoid any such thing .
The union and their Democratic protectors want to avoid the discipline that a bankruptcy could impose under Chapter 11 .
On the other hand , imposing discipline on anybody besides auto workers is blackmail .
A bailout , the WSJ complains , “ would also give environmentalists huge leverage over the cars Detroit builds , a power they and Democrats have wanted for decades . ”
And the senior executives were mentioned in the WSJ editorial only as victims : “ the long line of Detroit executives … caving to the UAW … ”
As Dean Baker pointed out in regard to a similar Washington Post celebration of the wage cuts ,
For some reason , the Post attaches enormous importance to reducing the pay of auto workers who earn $ 28 an hour .
It shows no comparable concern for reducing the pay of auto industry executives to parity with their foreign competitors .
( The top executives at Toyota , Honda , and other successful companies get paid in the neighborhood of $ 1 - 2 million a year .
Unlike their U.S. counterparts , they do n’t get paychecks in the tens of millions of dollars even in the best years . )
The Post has also never felt the need to insist on large pay cuts for Wall Street executives even though their banks are now wards of the state .
( Beat the Press blog , Dec. 20 , 2008 ) .
And with all that talk of “ restructuring ” for “ competitiveness , ” any talk of changing the Detroit dinosaurs ’ business model was notable for its absence .
As Bill Wadell and Norman Bodek described it in The Rebirth of American Industry , the Alfred Sloan management accounting system treats inventory as an asset , and labor as the only signficant direct cost .
So despite all the lean talk and the superficial adoption of lean methods on the shop floor , GM still produces cars to sell to inventory without regard to current orders for them , and treats human capital as a variable cost to be downsized whenever business fluctuates .
But management salaries are treated as a fixed cost , and swept under the rug through the practice of “ overhead absorption ” ( incorporating them into the price of the cars sold to inventory , so they are magically reclassified as an asset ) .
So there you have it .
In what passes for “ free market ” thought among Republican politicians and neoliberal hack journalists , “ restructuring ” is good if it means rolling back union wages and benefits , but bad if it means abandoning the gas guzzling business model that put Detroit in the tank .
Government - imposed discipline is good and pro-market only if it ’s aimed at labor , and not capital or management .
More generally , I think this highlights the problems of equating “ capitalism ” to “ the free market . ”
In neoliberal orthodoxy , supposedly , labor and capital are just coequal “ factors of production . ”
So why name an economic system after one of the factors of production , in particular ?
What we ’re seeing is that , beneath the ideological veneer of “ free contract ” and all the rest of it , some “ factors of production ” are more equal than others .
That ’s why , when Costco pays its workers above - average wages for the retail industry , business analysts squirm with the same undisquised moral disapproval that some people reserve for diamond - studded dog collars .
But when a Bob Nardelli or Carly Fiorina gets a retirement package worth tens or hundreds of millions , after gutting their companies to massage the quarterly numbers and game their own bonuses and stock options , that ’s just the way “ our free enterprise system ” rewards them for “ the value they created . ”
What the politicians and journalists are for , behind all the “ pro-market ” rhetoric , is n’t the market at all .
It ’s the interests of capital .
What we need is the genuine article : a free market without special privileges or artificial scarcity , without subsidies and corporate welfare , and without market entry barriers and other protections against competition .
Of course , if we had that kind of free market , there would n’t even be a General Motors .
He decided to run last month and received the nomination late last week .
He now has to get at least 7,500 signatures to get on the ballot in November .
“ When the Green Party approached him , he was thinking that Bloomberg was essentially purchasing a third term , ” said Michael O’Neil , 29 , the campaign ’s press officer .
“ He wanted to run because it seemed unlikely that any of the front - runners in the election would speak to the issues that have been challenging New York City ’s neighborhoods . ”
Reverend Billy , who according to Mr. O’Neil makes a living with paid appearances at colleges and other venues , said refocusing attention on the city ’s neighborhoods  he used the word “ neighborhood ” dozens of times  would be the centerpiece of his campaign , though he said little about other issues , like subway fares and the economic crisis .
He did make it clear that he did not approve of Mr. Bloomberg ’s pursuit of a third term .
“ We ’re at a critical point in the city ’s history right now , ” he said .
“ The mayor ’s trying to privatize Union Square .
We ’re surrounded by logos everywhere .
We need to oppose that . ”
Reverend Billy , who grew up in the Midwest and arrived in New York from San Francisco in 1994 , has long been known for his colorful street - theater tirades on what he sees as corporate intrusions on American life .
He was arrested during a protest in Union Square in 2007 and that year was the subject of the documentary “ What Would Jesus Buy ? ”

U.S. stocks will fall and the government will nationalize more banks as the economy contracts through the end of 2009 , said Nouriel Roubini , the New York University professor who predicted last year ’s economic crisis .
[ efoods ]
“ The stock market is a bit ahead of the real macroeconomic and financial news , ” Roubini , a professor at NYU ’s Stern School of Business and the chairman of consulting firm Roubini Global Economics , said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in London today .
“ We ’ll have some major banks going belly up that will need to be taken over . ”
The global equity rebound in March that sent the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index to its best monthly advance in 17 years is a “ bear - market rally ” and U.S. Treasury yields will “ remain relatively low ” as investors flock to the safest assets , Roubini said .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s new plan to remove toxic debt from financial companies wo n’t be enough for insolvent banks , he said .
Roubini ’s outlook contrasts with predictions this week from Templeton Asset Management Ltd. ’s Mark Mobius and Traxis Partners LLC ’s Barton Biggs , who said that equities are poised to rally as government efforts to revive the economy and banking system begin to work .
Investors are “ way too optimistic ” about the prospects for a recovery in the economy and earnings , Roubini said .

If there is a lesson to be learned from the precipitous fall in " green " stocks last year , it 's this : Combining greed with good intentions can make for a poor investment strategy .
Once among the hottest names on Wall Street , makers of solar panels , wind turbines , and other environmentally friendly gear are in for a difficult year .
In 2008 , almost every stock in the green space fell harder than the rest of the market during an all - around terrible year for equities .
While the S&P 500 index declined by more than a third , several popular green indexes fared worse , slumping between 60 percent and 70 percent .
Now , as many of those stocks languish near record lows , alternative energy appears to have stalled .
Nervous investors are waiting until money begins to flow from the government 's $ 787 billion stimulus package .
Even when the spigot opens , it 's not clear that a new commitment to renewable energy will be enough to revive the fortunes of an entire industry .
Simply put , problems in the green space go beyond the ongoing recession and the credit crisis .
An even bigger drag is overly sunny expectations for sales of wind turbines and solar panels .
A bit of history : Earlier in the decade , a mix of generous subsidy plans and easy money sparked a miniboom , fueled by a flood of venture capital and a seemingly unquenchable demand for shares of a small number of publicly traded companies .
Between 2004 and 2007 , private - sector investments in solar jumped almost 20 - fold .
As money poured in , output soared — just as demand was about to be hit by a devastating one - two punch .
First , subsidy rollbacks in key markets like Spain hurt .
And then the credit crisis froze financing for new projects .
Suppliers suddenly found themselves with too many solar panels .
Proposed wind farms went begging for start - up funding .
Soon , Wall Street darlings like SunPower and SunTech were announcing job cuts .
OptiSolar , a thin - film solar panel maker , slashed 300 jobs , or half of its staff , in January .
VeraSun , an ethanol maker , filed for bankruptcy and is selling off several plants in the Midwest .
Even wind 's most visible backer , Texan oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens , has scaled back his plans to develop " America 's wind corridor . "
At the same time , with oil prices dipping below $ 40 a barrel ( more than $ 100 cheaper than last year 's peak ) , the economics of all sorts of clean energy are far less attractive .
The industry 's fortunes are likely to get worse before they get better , with 2009 shaping up as a " shakeout year . "
Ted Sullivan , an analyst at Lux Research , sees a stark demarcation , particularly among large , publicly traded solar companies facing a near collapse in demand .
" You could have every solar company fail but the top 15 and still have a little too much supply , " he says .
The market , he says , is already picking winners .
Valuations remain relatively high for just a few companies .
Industry leaders First Solar , SunPower , and Energy Conversion Devices have so far managed to hold some of their value .
But Wall Street is beginning to count some of the other players out .
Many analysts expect less - well - capitalized firms without substantial technological advantages to fall by the wayside over the next few years .
" Ambitious goal . "
The brightest hope for an overall recovery in green energy remains an environmentally friendly president .
The Obama administration 's pledge to double clean - energy production over three years would have been scoffed at as conservative just a year ago , says Ethan Zindler , head of North American Research for New Energy Finance .
" Now that 's a pretty ambitious goal , " he says .
The massive stimulus could help , but the billions of dollars targeted for clean energy cannot offset all the losses .
Analysts at Merrill Lynch say fleeing investment already renders last year 's passage of a key solar - related tax credit " impotent . "
The stimulus bill is designed in part to let project developers apply for grants directly from the federal government .
That could prove a lifeline for replacing a vital source of funding destroyed by the credit crisis .
Before the crunch , investors , often big banks , helped fund large chunks of solar or wind projects by purchasing tax credits from developers to offset their own tax bill .
As profits disappeared , so have most of those so - called tax equity investors .
Already , the industry is feeling the difference .
Mark Morelli , president and CEO of Energy Conversion Devices , says , " Last year , everything was getting financed .
Every project you could put on the market was snapped up immediately .
Clearly , things are much more selective . "
For now , government help may very well allow the green energy industry to survive .
For it to thrive , however , both financing and demand will have to recover .

Every business requires a little bit of luck in order to succeed .
And often times , success depends on timing and being at the right place at the right time .
But do you ever wonder how some people keep getting lucky over and over again ?
Is it just a coincidence that some entrepreneurs always seem to find a way to steer luck in their direction ?
Personally , I do n’t believe in coincidences but I know many of you are skeptical .
For example , below is an excerpt of an email that I recently received from a reader after she listened to my podcast interview with Abby Walker , a student in my Create A Profitable Online Store course .
I just listened to your podcast with Abby .
Great podcast ! ( …..) I do n’t want to discount her success .
But a large part of it was based on a series of fortuitous events .
It ’s not repeatable .
Do you agree with this reader ?
Here ’s a quick recap of Abby ’s story for context .
Last October , Abby made over $ 100 K in a single month selling high heeled insoles online .
But what was amazing about her story was the number of things that magically fell into place during her journey .
One , she “ accidentally ” stumbled across her product while running her blog .
Two , she “ happened to ” reach out to a manufacturer who was willing to let her sell their products under her own brand .
Three , she “ happened ” to meet the CEO of The Home Shopping Network who helped her get on the show .
The list goes on …
So was Abby ’s success based on luck or skill ?
When my wife and I first started our wedding linens store , several fortuitous events helped us on our path to success .
One , we happened to stumble upon selling handkerchiefs because my wife was a crier .
Two , I just happened to be friends with someone who started an ecommerce store who pointed us in the right direction .
Three , my brother in law just happened to work for the Google Adwords team and suggested that I give Adwords a try .
With MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , I ca n’t tell you how many lucky events have taken place over the years .
For example , I ’ve been randomly featured in many large publications like Forbes and Inc magazine .
I ’ve met so many amazing people that I ’m now proud to call my friends .
I ’ve been invited to speak at popular conferences .
Back in the day when something “ lucky ” would happen , I ’d thank the heavens above for helping me out .
But looking back , did my actions play a part in facilitating these lucky events ?
Did my wife and I do anything to improve our luck ?
Was my student Abby just at the right place at the right time ?
Today , I ’m going to break down some of these fortuitous events and teach you how to get lucky in business and life .

Luck Booster # 1 : Take The Initiative
First of all , Abby ’s success was the direct result of her ability to take immediate action .
Sure , there were elements of luck in her story , but to base her sales entirely on circumstance would be insulting .
If you closely analyze her story , you ’ll realize that Abby is a big time hustler .
In the beginning when she was researching and developing her first product , she stumbled upon a forum where two women were talking about this amazing insole called Insolia .
Then immediately , she picked up the phone , found out where the company was based and made a proposal to sell their insoles .
Was it luck that this company was willing to let her be the sole supplier for this product ?
Possibly .
But was it luck that Abby secured this vendor ?
Hell no .
Was it luck that Abby accidentally stumbled upon this product on a forum ?
Yes .
But would she have found it if she was n’t working hard doing research ?
No way .
When Abby met Mindy Grossman , the CEO of the Home Shopping Network , at a random product pitch event , was that luck ?
Absolutely .
But would she have met Mindy by staying at home watching tv ?
No way !
Bottom line , Abby took the initiative , hopped on a plane to pitch her product and drastically increased her luck .
When my wife and I first started sourcing product , we primarily looked online to find our vendors .
But while the web is a great place to do research , it is a lousy place to establish lasting business relationships .
For example , it requires tremendous patience to communicate with someone in a foreign country in a different time zone .
And for our online store , cultural differences caused a lot of miscommunication early on which resulted in products that did n’t match our specifications .
So one day , my wife and I decided get off of our butts and booked an impromptu flight to Asia to meet our vendors directly .
In fact , we literally hopped on an airplane and dropped in to visit our potential manufacturers on a whim .
Fortunately , our timing was right on cue .
Because our vendors just got back from the Canton Fair in China , they all had their inventory available to show us .
Had we visited at a different time , we would not have been able to see the products first hand and probably would have had to wait several weeks for samples to be fabricated .
Even though we arrived too late to attend the actual fair ( which we had no clue about at the time ) , we still managed to nail down 2 solid vendors during that trip who we still use today .
Luck Booster # 2 : Build Up Your Network
A long time ago when we first launched our online store , our website was stuck in the Google sandbox for an extended period of time .
For all of you who do n’t know what the Google sandbox is , it is like a jail where Google places your website before it gets indexed .
During this time , your site wo n’t get any organic traffic at all and you pretty much just have to wait for Google to change its mind .
Editor ’s Note : I ’m not sure if the Google sandbox still exists anymore but back in the day , it was extremely frustrating if you got trapped there .
Anyway , I was tired of being stuck in the sandbox so I contacted a friend of mine who worked at Google asking for advice on how to expedite the process .
And as luck would have it , my friend happened to be in charge of writing the next post for the Google blog .
The topic of the blog entry was how online websites utilize Google Webmasters tools in order to improve traffic to their website .
And basically , my friend told me that if I signed up for Google Webmasters tools and found it useful that she would write the blog entry about our online store !
As soon as the blog entry was published with a link to our website , we immediately escaped the sandbox !
Anyway this just goes to show that you never know when a random person that you ’ve met in the past can help you out .
And that is why I spend so much time trying to expand my network .
Every new person that you meet drastically increases your luck !
In fact , meeting other like - minded people is the main reason why I run my podcast .
After all , the opportunity to speak with and network with other successful entrepreneurs 1 on 1 for an hour is priceless !
Another great way to meet new people is by attending conferences .
Even though I have a wife and 2 young kids , I still try to hit 5 or 6 conferences per year because the connections I make are worth every penny .
Editor ’s Note :
If you want to meet other ecommerce entrepreneurs face to face , then check out my annual conference , The Sellers Summit .
Because I ’ve been doing this for so many years , I can now travel pretty much anywhere in the world and find someone I know to hang out .
For example , the first time we traveled to China and Hong Kong , we had several friends show us around which greatly helped us locate the vendors that we wanted to visit .
We also had other friends in the textile business give us some pointers as well and we would definitely not be where we are today without their help !
Luck Booster # 3 : Put Yourself Out There
While podcasting and attending conferences are great ways to expand your network , the best and most scalable way to improve your luck is by putting yourself out there to be discovered .
Think about it this way .
The more places you can be found , the more likely that someone will randomly discover and learn who you are .
But what does it mean exactly to put yourself out there ?
There are many ways to go about it .
You can … .
It does n’t really matter what medium you choose , just be consistent .
When my wife and I launched our online store , we blogged on a consistent basis .
And after about 6 months , our website started getting some decent organic traffic .
And because we provided good content on our store in the form of arts and crafts pages , we slowly but surely climbed the search engine rankings over time .
Pretty soon , our website rose to the front page of Google for several of our targeted search terms which started a chain reaction of events .
Large companies began to notice us and major magazines like Real Simple , Martha Stewart Weddings and Brides started reaching out to us in order to feature our products in their magazines .
We were even featured on the Today show because they found us through Google .
In fact , the majority of our media mentions have been the result of pure luck .
90 % of the time , editors discover our content via search or Pinterest and then reach out to feature us in their publications .
Is Business Success Based On Luck Or Hard Work ?
Every success story involves a little bit of luck but it always comes down to hard work and initiative .
Here ’s how I think about it .
The harder you work and the more action you take , the more lottery tickets that you earn .
Every piece of content you put out there earns you additional tickets .
Every person that you meet earns you another lottery ticket in life .
And if you wait long enough , your number will eventually get called .
Over the years , my wife and I have felt extremely fortunate .
And we attribute most of our luck to our network of friends who have provided us with a ton of help to get us started .
How did we get so lucky ?
In a nutshell , we continue to play the lotto .
After all , if you simply sit at home on the couch and do nothing , you ’ll never have a chance at all .
So why not give your business idea a chance and see what happens ?

Have you read these ?
Faithful readers , I know the blog has become more polemic in tone over the last few months .
We are in the stage of the cycle , as Warren Buffet put it , the tide has gone out and we are seeing who is n’t wearing a swimming suit .
Worse , as the powers that be are desperately throwing funds at banks and investors in a doomed effort to return to the status quo ante , the money is certain to enrich industry incumbents ( even if they think they are being treated badly by suffering a lifestyle hit ) and much less likely to restore the financial system to a semblance of health .
And the net result is that a lot of taxpayer money is going to folks who helped create the problem , or were less than innocent bystanders .
Unfortunately , there is a proud tradition in finance of bad actors finding profitable employment doing more or less what they did that created a train wreck .
Drexel sold S&Ls a lot of the junk that brought them to ruin ( and “ sold ” does n’t even begin to describe it .
A regulator told me that Lincoln Savings would get a daily fax from Drexel of what it had bought , and then when the regulators came a calling , Lincoln realized it was supposed to have filed demonstrating that it had done due diligence on the investments .
It hired Arthur Andersen to create the phony paper trail ) .
And the principals of LTCM , having nearly brought the financial system to its knees , started another hedge fund .
Now admittedly , the authorities did bring down Michael Milken , who in a plea bargain agreed to be barred from the securities industry permanently .
But many of his lieutenants had profitable post - Drexel careers .
And while the Enron collapse did lead to a much larger number of executives being investigated and prosecuted , it was not a financial intermediary in the traditional sense and almost serves as the exception that proves the rule .
As we have noted repeatedly , we ’ve seen no investigation of Lehman , where the public financial appear to have greatly overstated the true condition of the firm .
That is a long - winded way of saying there is much to be genuinely unhappy about .
And as much as I do not want to seem fixated on how the public is being had , this is too important to let go by .
If we allow ourselves to become inured to this sort of thing , it will further lower the barriers to this sort of behavior .
And while I recognize , unlike the Milken / Enron examples , the Countrywide conduct ( so far ) falls short of being criminal , it is certainly of questionable morality .
We ’ve had enough examples of the costs of buccaneer capitalism that it ’s time we start demanding something better .
From the New York Times :
Fairly or not , Countrywide Financial and its top executives would be on most lists of those who share blame for the nation ’s economic crisis … .
Stanford L. Kurland , Countrywide ’s former president , and his team have been buying up delinquent home mortgages that the government took over from other failed banks , sometimes for pennies on the dollar .
They get a piece of what they can collect … .
As hundreds of billions of dollars flow from Washington to jump - start the nation ’s staggering banks , automakers and other industries , a new economy is emerging of businesses that hope to make money from the various government programs that make up the largest economic rescue in history …
And there is PennyMac , led by Mr. Kurland , 56 , once the soft - spoken No. 2 to Angelo R. Mozilo , the perpetually tanned former chief executive of Countrywide … Mr. Kurland has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from big players like BlackRock , the investment manager , to finance his start - up .
Having sold off close to $ 200 million in stock before leaving Countrywide , he has also put up some of his own cash … .
“ It is sort of like the arsonist who sets fire to the house and then buys up the charred remains and resells it , ” said Margot Saunders , a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center , which for years has sought to place limits on what it calls abusive lending practices by Countrywide and other companies ….
Mr. Kurland acknowledges pushing Countrywide into the type of higher - risk loans that have since , in large numbers , gone into default .
But he said that he always insisted that the loans go only to borrowers who could afford to repay them .
He also said that Countrywide ’s riskiest lending took place after he left the company , in late 2006 , after what he said was an internal conflict with Mr. Mozilo and other executives , whom he blames for loosening loan standards …
But lawsuits against Countrywide raise questions about Mr. Kurland ’s portrayal of his role .
They accuse him of being at the center of a culture shift at Countrywide that started in 2003 , as the company popularized a type of loan that often came with low “ teaser ” interest rates and that , for some , became unaffordable when the low rate expired .
The lawsuits , including one filed by New York State ’s comptroller , say Mr. Kurland was well aware of the risks , and even misled Countrywide ’s investors about the precariousness of the company ’s portfolio , which grew to $ 463 billion in loans , from $ 62 billion , three times faster than the market nationwide , during the final six years of his tenure .
“ Kurland is seeking to capitalize on a situation that was a product of his own creation , ” said Blair A. Nicholas , a lawyer representing retired Arkansas teachers who are also suing Mr. Kurland and other former Countrywide executives .
“ It is tragic and ironic .
But then again , greed is a growth industry . ”
It ’s funny how standards vary .
If a company with a great technology was seeking funding , and there was outstanding litigation against the principals alleging misconduct , most VCs would pass on the deal .
But if you are in the money game , as opposed to the building real businesses game , character might be viewed as an impediment to success .
The P - 51 Mustang is one of the most celebrated fighters of the 20th century .
The WWII - era single - seat plane was introduced in the middle of the conflict and served to tremendous success in both the European and Pacific theaters .
The most widely produced of the P - 51 models was the D variant , which was put into service in 1944 and would become the workhorse ( bad pun ) of the USAAF in Europe .
Outside of its beautiful shape , speed and maneuverability , what made the P - 51D special was the Packard built V - 1650 engine .
The fighter ’s power plant was a North American made supercharged version of the illustrious Rolls - Royce Merlin engine .
This gave the P - 51 an incredible top speed and a ceiling of over 41,000 feet .
Perfect for long range bomber support .
After the war , the iconic fighter even inspired Ford designers to name their new sports car after the P - 51 .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Hundreds of people in the United States are under investigation for financial scams , many involving Ponzi schemes , a U.S. regulator said on Friday , calling the phenomenon “ rampant Ponzimonium . ”

While none are as mammoth as disgraced financier Bernard Madoff ’s $ 65 billion fraud , multimillion - dollar “ mini Madoffs ” are proliferating from New York to Hawaii , the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said .
So far this year , the agency has uncovered 19 Ponzi schemes , which depend on an influx of new capital instead of investment profits to pay existing investors .
That compares with just 13 for all of 2008 .
“ Because of the economy , people are seeking redemptions more than they ever have and that ’s making a lot of these scams go belly up , ” Bart Chilton , commissioner of the Washington - based Commodity Futures Trading Commission , said in a telephone interview .
In the last month alone , his agency has pursued investment fraud in Pennsylvania , New York , North Carolina , Iowa , Idaho , Texas and Hawaii .
Chilton called the problem “ rampant Ponzimonium ” and “ Ponzipalooza ” -- a play on the word “ Lollapalooza , ” an American music festival featuring a long list of acts .
Many of the financial scams are small but grew fast to support lavish lifestyles , like the suspected $ 40 million , five - year Ponzi scheme that came to light last month when a North Carolina man , Bruce Kramer , committed suicide .
Claiming he was an expert mathematician , Kramer is accused of persuading 79 people to invest in what he said was a foreign currency trading operation , Barki LLC .
He promised monthly returns of at least 3 percent to 4 percent , the CFTC said .
Instead , he funneled money into a Maserati sports car , a $ 1 million horse farm and artwork while holding “ extravagant ” parties , according to a CFTC complaint released on Wednesday .
As the economy soured , Kramer struggled to find new clients to keep the scheme going .
In the days before his suicide , his investors demanded their money back and grew suspicious when they could n’t access their own funds , said Chilton .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission shares oversight of financial markets with the Securities and Exchange Commission , which also faces a swelling casebook of Ponzi schemes , including charges against Texas billionaire Allen Stanford , who is accused of bilking investors of $ 8.8 billion .
The SEC has taken emergency action in 24 cases this year “ to halt ongoing fraud , ” said SEC spokesman John Heine .
The FBI is also ramping up probes of financial wrongdoing .
The agency has 43 corporate fraud cases under way directly related to the financial crisis , FBI Deputy Director John Pistole told a Congressional panel on Friday .
The CFTC , which set up a task force last year to pursue foreign currency Ponzi schemes and fraud , discovered about $ 80 million invested in four Ponzi schemes this month .
That followed 10 such schemes in February totaling about $ 1.46 billion , and about $ 450 million in such scams in January .
Those accused of the scams used the money for cars , boats , clothing , jewelry , homes and ranches , said Chilton .
One bought his own island in Belize in Central America , he added .
“ Some are easier to catch now because people are more vigilant than they have been , ” he said .

Ian Angus addresses the World at a Crossroads conference .
Photo by Alex Bainbridge .
By Ian Angus
[ Ian Angus is an associate editor of Socialist Voice ( Canada ) .
He was a featured guest at the World at a Crossroads conference , organised by the Democratic Socialist Perspective and Resistance , and held in Sydney , Australia , April 10 - 12 , 2009 .
Below is Ian Angus ' speech to the final session of the conference : ``World at a Crossroads -- Fighting for our future ''. ]
I want to begin by thanking the Democratic Socialist Perspective , the Socialist Alliance and Green Left Weekly for inviting me to participate in this inspiring event .
I have of course known of your work from afar -– Green Left Weekly is one of the very best English - language socialist publications in the world - – but this is my first visit here , and I have to say that your work and your dedication is even more impressive close up .
I and the other comrades from Canada have been extremely impressed with the conference -– and the many comrades I have met from other countries have said the same thing .
Socialist Voice is a small current in Canada , a network rather than an organisation , that is committed to rebuilding and regrouping the left on a non-sectarian basis .
This conference has been an invaluable contribution to that process .
It was an opportunity for us to meet and exchange ideas and experiences with activists not only from Australia , but from many countries .
With this event , the DSP has set an example of practical , working internationalism that we can all learn from , that all of us , in our home countries , should report , explain and above all emulate .
There are many academic conferences on Marxism these days , but this has been a conference of activists , of people of people who are actually fighting on the front lines , for climate justice , for indigenous rights and sovereignty , against imperialism , and for workers ' power .
If there is one thing that has been crystal clear at this meeting , it is that the revolutionary left now faces new opportunities to grow , to build and lead struggles far beyond what has been possible for some time .
We need to break out of traditional ways of operating , to escape business - as - usual , to find ways to work with individuals , groups and social layers beyond our usual circles of influence .
And , as a comrade said in this room yesterday , there is no justification any more -– if there ever was –- for backbiting , bickering and gossip .
Why ?
Because we have a world to win , a world to change –- and that task is just too important for us to waste time with petty foolishness .
The goals that unite us are vastly more important than any differences we may have .
In Canada , where the neoliberal offensive and the collapse of the socialist bloc severely weakened the Marxist left , we are rebuilding –- not as quickly as we'd hope , but nevertheless we are moving forward .
We owe the DSP a great debt for the example it has set .
We have published Green Left Weekly articles in Socialist Voice , and we 've been pleased and honoured that Green Left Weekly and Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal have seen fit to publish some of ours .
Challenge
In my remarks this afternoon , I want to particularly address a challenge to the comrades who are here from outside Australia .
It 's too easy for us to sit back and let the DSP organise conferences we can attend , to let the DSP write articles we can reprint , to let the DSP organise international brigades to Venezuela , and so on .
What I would like to see as a result of this conference , is for all the comrades who are here from outside Australia , to commit themselves to extending this practical , working internationalism .
Some of us come from very small groupings , some from fast - growing revolutionary parties –- but all of us have a role to play in building a working international movement .
What we need to do above all is to create ever more opportunities to do what we 've done this weekend , to share experiences and ideas on a continuing basis .
For example , I was very pleased to be able to spend a week before this conference speaking on climate change in several Australian cities , and in the process meeting and learning from a wide range of climate crisis activists .
We need to do much more of that , not just on a bilateral basis , but multilaterally .
It would be wonderful if a conference like this could be organised in India , or South Africa , or even , one day , in Canada .
Not all of our organisations have the resources to do that today , but we can all begin moving in that direction .
We also need to expand our exchange of articles , documents and publications .
The internet is a great resource that we do not use nearly enough .
When the comrades in India publish a pamphlet , for example , it could be instantly available for printing in other countries –- that would n’t require huge effort , but it would greatly expand the resources all of us can call on .
Much of the most important revolutionary thought and analysis in the world today is being developed and published in Spanish –- in Cuba , Venezuela and Bolivia .
Through cooperative efforts , we could expand the amount of that material that is well translated and widely disseminated , perhaps in printed form , but definitely in electronic form .
I 'm very sure there are other ways that we can expand the exchange of ideas and experiences .
To some degree , what we need to do is simply to consciously and deliberately take advantage of tools we already have -– websites , discussion forums and so on .
But more than that , we need to make a commitment to allocate real resources , to expand our own material contributions to the practical internationalism we 've seen here .
International collaboration
Please understand , I am not in anyway suggesting that we need or should create a new international organisation .
None of us wishes to be , and none of us should accept , any kind of “ leading party ” or international centre ” .
No toy internationals , no standardised international tactics .
That has n't worked in the past , and we know it wo n’t work now .
But we also know that every current , every group and every individual in this room , has much to offer and share , and that each of us will be stronger if we can share the work with others .
We will build an international movement not by setting up artificial structures , but by finding every possible opportunity to exchange visits , articles , experiences , concrete support and more .
My challenge to the international guests here –- and I definitely include my comrades from Canada –- is that we move beyond accidental and occasional collaboration , towards a deliberate effort to work together on a regular and continuing basis .
Comrades , this conference could not have been better named .
The world is at a crossroads .
The choice between socialism and barbarism has never been so stark , or so immediate , or so pressing .
All of us are conscious of what a huge task we face , of the immense responsibility that rests on our shoulders , on the shoulders of the publications , groups and parties we are part of .
We have an historic obligation to do everything possible to build a global movement to rid the world of capitalism forever .
This meeting is a step towards that sacred objective , and I urge everyone here to build on this success , to make practical internationalism a key part of all of our political work in the coming year .
Together -— and only together -— we can win .
Sex and the City character Carrie Bradshaw loves to shop Women may be able to blame impulse buys and extravagant shopping on their time of the month , research suggests .
In the 10 days before their periods began women were more likely to go on a spending spree , a study found .
Psychologists believe shopping could be a way for premenstrual women to deal with the negative emotions created by their hormonal changes .
Professor Karen Pine will present her work to a British Psychological Society meeting in Brighton later this week .
She asked 443 women aged 18 to 50 about their spending habits .
The spending behaviour tends to be a reaction to intense emotions
Professor Pine Almost two - thirds of the 153 women studied who were in the later stages of their menstrual cycle - known as the luteal phase - admitted they had bought something on an impulse and more than half said they had overspent by more than £ 25 .
A handful of the women said they had overspent by more than £ 250 .
And many felt remorse later .
Professor Pine , of the University of Hertfordshire , said : " Spending was less controlled , more impulsive and more excessive for women in the luteal phase .
" The spending behaviour tends to be a reaction to intense emotions .
They are feeling stressed or depressed and are more likely to go shopping to cheer themselves up and using it to regulate their emotions . "
Hormonal
She said much of this could be explained by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle .
And the findings were exaggerated in the women with severe PMT .
" We are getting surges and fluctuations in hormones which affect the part of the brain linked to emotions and inhibitory control .
So the behaviour we found is not surprising . "
Another explanation might be that women are buying items to make themselves feel more attractive - coinciding with the time of ovulation when they are most fertile , typically around 14 days before the start of a period .
Most of the purchases made by the women were for adornment , including jewellery , make - up and high heels .
Professor Pine said : " Other researchers have found there is an ornamental effect around the time of ovulation . "
Researchers have found women tend to dress to impress during their fertile days .
Professor Pine , author of the book Sheconomics , said if women were worried about their spending behaviour they might avoid going shopping in the week before their period was due .

Not content with destroying the world ’s economies , the banking industry is also bent on ruining us individually , it seems .
Take a look at Verified By Visa .
Allegedly this protects cardholders – by training them to expect a process in which there ’s absolutely no way to know whether you are being phished or not .
Even more astonishing is that this is seen as a benefit !
Frame inline displays the VbV authentication page in
the merchant ’s main window with the merchant ’s
header .
Therefore , VbV is seen as a natural part of the
purchase process .
It is recommended that the top
frame include the merchant ’s standard branding in a
short and concise manner and keep the cardholder
within the same look and feel of the checkout process .
Or , in other words
Please ensure that there is absolutely no way for your customer to know whether we are showing the form or you are .
In fact , please train your customer to give their “ Verified by Visa ” password to anyone who asks for it .
Craziness .
But it gets better – obviously not everyone is pre-enrolled in this stupid scheme , so they also allow for enrolment using the same inline flow .
Now the phishers have the opportunity to also get information that will allow them to identify themselves to the bank as you .
Yes , Visa have provided a very nicely tailored and packaged identity theft scheme .
But , best of all , rather like Chip and PIN , they push all blame for their failures on to the customer
Verified by Visa helps protect you from fraudulent claims from cardholders – that they did n’t take part in , or authorise , a payment .
Once you are up and running with Verified by Visa , you are no longer liable for chargebacks of this nature .
In other words , if the phisher uses your Verified by Visa password , then it ’s going to be your fault – obviously the only way they could know it is if you told them !
If you claim it was not you , then you are guilty of fraud ; it says so , right there .
Urteilsbegründung Verwaltungsgericht : Vorratsspeicherung ungültig
Die umfassende Speicherung aller Telekommunikationsdaten sei ein Verstoß gegen das Grundrecht auf Datenschutz " , so die Wiesbadener Richter .
Nun wird der Fall dem EuGH vorgelegt .
WIESBADEN afp / ap Das Verwaltungsgericht
Wiesbaden hat die umstrittene Vorratsdatenspeicherung als unzulässig bewertet .
Die seit dem vergangenen Jahr geltende Regelung stelle einen " Verstoß gegen das Grundrecht auf Datenschutz " dar , heißt es in einem am Montag bekannt gewordenen Beschluss des Gerichts vom 27 .
Februar .
Eine solche Praxis sei in einer demokratischen Gesellschaft nicht notwendig .
" Der Einzelne gibt keine Veranlassung für den Eingriff , kann aber bei seinem legalen Verhalten wegen der Risiken des Missbrauchs und des Gefühls der Überwachung eingeschüchtert werden " , befanden die Richter .
Hintergrund des Beschlusses ist eine Klage , bei der es um die Veröffentlichung von Empfängern von EU - Agarsubventionen im Internet ging .
Es sei problematisch , wenn derartige Informationen interessierten Bürgern nur elektronisch zugänglich gemacht würden , zugleich aber verstärkt die Telekommunikation überwacht werde , erklärte das Gericht .
Es beschloss , den gesamten Vorgang dem Europäischen Gerichtshof vorzulegen .
Der Beschluss des Verwaltungsgerichts hat keinerlei rechtliche Bindung , wie eine Gerichtssprecherin sagte .

Nftables : a new packet filtering engine
Did you know ...?

Packet filtering and firewalling has a long history in Linux .
The first filtering mechanism , called " ipfwadm , " was released in 1995 for the 1.2.1 kernel .
This code was used until the 2.2.0 stable release ( January , 1999 ) , when the new " ipchains " module took over .
While ipchains was useful , it only lasted until 2.4.0 ( January , 2001 ) , when it , too , was replaced by iptables / netfilter , which remains in the kernel now .
If netfilter maintainer Patrick McHardy has his way , though , iptables , too , will be gone in the future , replaced by yet another mechanism called " nftables . "
This article will give an overview of how nftables works , followed by a discussion of the motivations behind this change .
The first public nftables release came out on March 18 .
This code has been in the works for a while , though , and the ideas were discussed at the 2008 Netfilter Workshop .
So nftables is not quite as new as it might seem .
The current iptables code has a lot of protocol awareness built into it .
There is , for example , a module dedicated to extracting port numbers from UDP packets which is different from the module concerned with TCP packets .
The nftables implementation is entirely different ; there is no protocol knowledge built into it at all .
Instead , nftables is implemented as a simple virtual machine which interprets code loaded from user space .
So nftables has no operation which says anything like " compare the IP destination address to 196.168.0.1 " ; instead , it would execute code which looks like :
payload load 4 offset network header + 16 => reg 1 compare reg 1 192.168.0.1
( Patrick presents the code in mnemonic form , and your editor will do the same ; the actual code loaded into the kernel uses opcodes instead ) .
The first line loads four bytes from the packet , located 16 bytes past the beginning of the network reader , into register 1 .
The second line then compares that register against the given network address .
The language can do a lot more than just comparing addresses , of course .
There is , for example , a set lookup feature .
Consider the following :
payload load 4 offset network header + 16 => reg 1 set lookup reg 1 load result in verdict register { " 192.168.0.1 " : jump chain1 , " 192.168.0.2 " : drop , " 192.168.0.3 " : jump chain2 }
This code will cause packets aimed at 192.168.0.2 to be dropped ; for the other two listed addresses , control will be sent to specific rule chains .
This set feature allows for multi- branch rules in a way which cannot be done with the current iptables implementation ( though the ipset mechanism helps in that regard ) .
The above code also introduces the " verdict register , " which records an action to be performed on a packet .
In nftables , more than one verdict can be rendered on a packet ; it is possible to add a packet to a specific counter , log it , and drop it all in a single chain without the need ( as seen in iptables ) to repeat tests .
There are a number of other capabilities built into the nftables virtual machine .
There 's a set of operations for communicating with the connection - tracking mechanism , allowing connection information to be used in deciding the fate of specific packets .
Other operators deal with various bits of packet metadata known to the networking subsystem ; these include the length , the protocol type , security mark information , and more .
Operators exist for logging packets and incrementing counters .
There 's also a full set of comparison operations , of course .
Network administrators are unlikely to be impressed by the idea of programming a low - level virtual machine for their future firewalling needs .
The good news is that there will be no need for them to do so .
Instead , they 'll write higher - level rules which will then be compiled into virtual machine code before being loaded into the kernel .
The nftables utility does this work , implementing a human - readable language encapsulating most of the needed information about how packets are put together .
So , if we look back to the first test described above :
payload load 4 offset network header + 16 => reg 1 compare reg 1 192.168.0.1
The administrator would simply write " ip daddr 192.168.0.1 " and let nftables turn that into the above code .
A full ( if simple ) rule looks something like this :
rule add ip filter output ip daddr 192.168.0.1 counter
This rule will count packets sent to 192.168.0.1 .
The new nftables API is based on netlink , naturally .
Unlike the current iptables API , it has the ability to modify individual rules without the need to reload the entire configuration .
There is also a decompilation facility built into nftables that allows the recreation of human - readable rules from the current in - kernel configuration .

This could be a disruptive and expensive transition ; the kernel development community will want to see some very good reasons for inflicting this pain on its users .
END QUOTE ]
All told , it looks like a nicely - designed packet filtering mechanism , but the merging of nftables is likely to be controversial .
The iptables mechanism works well , and is widely used ; replacing it with code which breaks the user - space API and breaks all existing iptables configurations is guaranteed to raise some eyebrows .
This could be a disruptive and expensive transition , even if , as seems necessary , the developers commit to maintaining both iptables and nftables in the mainline for an extended period of time .
The kernel development community will want to see some very good reasons for inflicting this pain on its users .
There are some good reasons , but one should start by noting that it should be possible to create a tool which reads current iptables configurations and converts them to the nftables language - or even directly to kernel virtual machine code .
Patrick seems to expect to create such a tool One Of These Days , but it does not exist at this time .
Some of the reasons for replacing iptables have already been hinted at above .
The protocol knowledge built into the iptables code has turned out to be a problem over time ; there is a lot of duplicated code doing the same thing ( extracting port numbers , say ) for different protocols .
Even worse , the capabilities and syntax tend to vary from one protocol to the next .
By moving all of that knowledge out to user space , nftables greatly simplifies the in - kernel code and allows for much more consistent treatment of all protocols .
There are a lot of optimization possibilities built into the new system .
Some expensive operations ( incrementing counters , for example ) can be skipped unless the user really needs them .
Features like set lookups and range mapping can collapse a whole set of iptables rules into a single nftables operation .
Since filtering rules are now compiled , there is also potential for the compiler to optimize the rules further .
Traditional firewall configurations tend to perform the same tests repeatedly ; a smart nftables compiler could eliminate much of that duplicated work .
Unsurprisingly , this optimization remains on the " to do " list for now , but the fact that all of this work is done in user space will make it easy to add such features in the future .
The nftables tool will also be able to perform a higher level of validation on the rules it is given , and it will be able to provide more useful diagnostics than can be had from the iptables code .
But , arguably , the most important motivation is the ability to dump the current ABI .
The iptables ABI has become an increasing impediment to development over time .
It includes protocol - specific fields which has made it hard to extend ; that is part of why there are actually three copies of the iptables code in the kernel .
When developers wanted to implement arptables and ebtables , they essentially had to copy the code and bang it into a new , protocol - specific shape .
Patrick estimates that , even after four years of unification work , the kernel contains some 10,000 lines of duplicated filtering code .
Beyond that , the structures used in the ABI are also used directly in the kernel 's internal representation , making that implementation even harder to change .
Separating the two would be possible through the addition of a translation layer , but the details involved ( including the need to translate in both directions ) increase the risk of adding subtle problems .
In summary , the iptables ABI has become a serious impediment to further progress in packet filtering .
Nftables is a chance to dump all of that code and replace it with a much smaller filtering core which should prove to be quite a bit more flexible .
With any luck , nftables should last a long time ; the virtual machine can be extended in unexpected ways without the need to break the user - space ABI ( again ) .
It 's smaller size should make it well suited to small router deployments , while its lockless design should appeal to administrators of high - end systems .
All told , chances are good that the larger community will eventually see this change as being worthwhile .
But not for a while : there are some unfinished pieces in nftables , and the larger discussion has not yet begun .
( For more information , see this weblog posting from August , 2008 and the slides from Patrick 's presentation [ ODF ] at the Netfilter Workshop ) .
ANTANANARIVO ( Reuters ) - Police in Madagascar tear - gassed supporters of former president Marc Ravalomanana for a third successive day on Saturday to stop them gathering in the main square of the Indian Ocean island ’s capital .
Thousands of pro-Ravalomanana supporters held a rally in an Antananarivo park -- the sixth in six days -- and then tried to reach the May 13 plaza where Madagascar ’s new leader , Andry Rajoelina , had held months of protests prior to assuming power .
The security forces blasted tear gas canisters and fired some shots in the air as protesters repeatedly tried to force their way into the square .
The daily demonstrations against Rajoelina , who took power last week after Ravalomanana handed over to the army , have prolonged a political crisis since the start of 2009 .
The unrest has killed 135 people in protests prior to Ravalomanana ’s fall , scared tourists away , and unnerved foreign investors in the booming mining and oil exploration sectors .
Ravalomanana , 59 , whom Rajoelina ’s camp said was out of touch with the people and running Madagascar like a private business , is out of the country , rallying international support .
The African Union ( AU ) has suspended Madagascar , and foreign powers from the United States to the European Union have condemned the changeover in power as a coup d’etat .
Rajoelina , 34 , a former disc jockey and successful businessman whose only prior political experience was a nearly two - year stint as Antananarivo mayor , is offering reconciliation talks and an election within two years .
Rajoelina told reporters on Friday the talks would consider a timetable for holding free and fair elections .
Foreign nations have been urging him to hold a vote soon .
He said the members of the transition authority he heads would be in place on Monday and the government finalized on Wednesday .
Rajoelina also announced cuts in the price of cooking oil , rice , bread and fuel .
Ravalomanana says he will only take part in dialogue if he is recognized as president still .
GoDaddy goes to great lengths to hide its expired domain warehousing operations .
UPDATE 12/17/08 : GoDaddy is shutting down Standard Tactics .
Scottsdale , Arizona based The Go Daddy Group , which runs the world ’s largest domain name registrar GoDaddy.com , is warehousing its customers ’ expired domain names and profiting from them .
The company has taken a number of steps to hide this practice from public view .
This article covers the results of a Domain Name Wire investigation into GoDaddy ’s domain warehousing activities .
Profiting from Expired Domain Names
When domain names expire , most large domain name registrars try to make money from them .
Network Solutions and eNom auction expired domains at NameJet .
Register.com auctions domains through SnapNames .
GoDaddy.com and other registrars that are part of The Go Daddy Group do n’t use a partner to sell customers ’ expired domain names .
Instead it auctions them on the company ’s own platform originally called The Domain Name Aftermarket ( TDNAM ) .
It ’s a fairly transparent system .
But when a valuable domain does n’t sell , something not - so - transparent goes on in the background , as described in detail below .
It ’s not unique that GoDaddy profits from expired domains .
What ’s unique are the steps GoDaddy takes to cover up its tracks , that it holds on to some domains that are n’t sold at auction , and its apparent hypocrisy between domains it owns and some of its activities such as combating online pharmacy fraud .
Go Daddy ’s Domain Name Warehouse
I first discovered GoDaddy ’s domain warehousing efforts in 2005 .
I noticed a typo domain name that did n’t sell at TDNAM and was n’t released .
It was subsequently monetized by GoDaddy using a domain parking page .
At the same time I purchased several domains on TDNAM that had expired but had n’t sold in the initial auction , much like the typo .
Interestingly , I received notification from an email address at StandardTactics.com offering to transfer all of the domains I purchased into my account .
Standard Tactics , LLC , is a The Go Daddy Group subsidiary that takes ownership of valuable expired domains that do n’t sell at TDNAM .
It then monetizes the domain names using parked domain pages and lists the domains for resale on TDNAM .
The Formation and Structure
When GoDaddy launched TDNAM back in 2005 , it finally started cashing in on its customers ’ expiring domain names .
By auctioning off the domains it was able to generate revenue even when its customers did n’t pay to renew their domains .
But GoDaddy understood it could also make money by keeping some of the domain names that did n’t sell at auction for itself .
On August 16 , 2005 , GoDaddy formed a subsidiary called Standard Tactics , LLC in New Mexico .
Before founding Standard Tactics , all of GoDaddy ’s subsidiaries were incorporated in Arizona where the company is headquartered .
There are a couple reasons GoDaddy may have chosen to form the company as a New Mexico limited liability company rather than an Arizona corporation .
First , by creating the company in New Mexico it could distance itself from it .
Second , by filing as a limited liability company instead of a corporation , it did n’t have to list directors of the corporation .
It only had to list an organizer — Scottsdale , Arizona lawyer Robert J. Rosepink .
Rosepink filed the papers in New Mexico and listed the company ’s principal address outside the state at 7373 North Scottsdale Rd , Suite E-200 in Scottsdale .
That ’s the address for Rosepink ’s law firm .
GoDaddy says Rosepink is outside counsel for the company .
He may have run in the same circles as GoDaddy CEO Bob Parsons in Scottsdale .
Both Rosepink and Parsons donated to Jon Kyl ’s campaign for U.S. senate .
Earlier this year , Rosepink was indicted on 102 counts by the Arizona Attorney General office for his part in a concert promotion investment scheme .
Rosepink allegedly earned nearly $ 1 million in fees for recruiting investors in what The Arizona Republic labeled a Ponzi scheme .
[ UPDATE : 12/17/08 :
In an interview with Parsons on his internet radio show today , Parsons told me that Rosepink was exonerated on all charges .
Additionally , he says that Rosepink was merely outside counsel for the company . ]
[ UPDATE 4/3/09 : Apparently Rosepink was not exonerated on all charges as Parson said .
The Arizona Republic reports today that Rosepink struck a plea bargain with prosecutors and plead guilty to four counts of solicitation or sale of unregistered securities . ]
Although GoDaddy did a good job distancing itself from Standard Tactics as a separate company ( one source said Standard Tactics was commonly called “ a client ” of GoDaddy ’s even inside the company ) , GoDaddy ’s filing to go public in 2006 provides a definitive link between the two companies .
It showed that Standard Tactics , LLC is indeed a subsidiary of GoDaddy .
It ’s distanced even further from the parent company as a subsidiary of a subsidiary .
Special Domain Services , Inc. , is a subsidiary of The Go Daddy Group .
Standard Tactics , LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Special Domain Services , Inc. Special Domain Services , Inc. is also the parent company of GoDaddy ’s Domains By Proxy , a whois privacy service that helps people shield their information from the whois database .
GoDaddy ’s S - 1 filing lists subsidiaries including Standard Tactics , LLC .
Because GoDaddy.com is itself a subsidiary of The Go Daddy Group , the domain registrar could technically say it did not warehouse domain names .
How it Works
GoDaddy is able to determine potential traffic to its customers ’ expired domains .
When a domain expires , GoDaddy places a parking page with paid advertising on the domain to count traffic .
This also gives the company the ability to measure potential revenue .
If a domain gets lots of traffic , GoDaddy places a higher starting bid on the domain when it is subsequently auctioned on TDNAM .
GoDaddy also discloses estimated traffic to potential buyers .
If a high traffic domain does n’t sell at TDNAM , it is often transferred to Standard Tactics .
Standard Tactics makes money from the domains by placing parked pages on them .
It sometimes lists the domains for sale on TDNAM at fixed prices , creating another opportunity to profit .
When Standard Tactics takes over a domain , it typically uses Domains By Proxy ’s whois privacy service to hide its identity .
There are a couple reasons Standard Tactics may do this .
First , it hides the fact that a Go Daddy company owns domains its customers originally registered .
This comes in handy when a customer merely forgets to renew a domain and later wants to re-acquire it .
It also allows GoDaddy to tell customers that it does n’t own the domains .
Second , and perhaps more importantly , it hides that Standard Tactics ’ portfolio includes a number of unsavory domain names including trademarks .
One way to uncover the name of a domain owner that uses whois privacy is to file for arbitration under ICANN ’s Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ( UDRP ) .
Whois privacy services are required to disclose the owner ’s name when an arbitration is filed .
Standard Tactics has been on the losing end of a number of arbitration cases , including for the domains Ambian.org , buy - ambien - now.com , cheapest - ambien.net , JunoDSL.com , and PorschePartSite .
It ’s especially ironic that Standard Tactics owns prescription drug names since GoDaddy touts its lobbying efforts at the U.S. Congress to stomp out online prescription drug fraud .
When I asked Camille Ede , Director of Domain Services at GoDaddy , about the company ’s ownership of pharmacy and trademark domains , she said the accusation that the company owned such domains was false .
Records at the arbitration companies prove otherwise .
In fact , in one UDRP case a Standard Tactics representative asked complainant Sanofi- aventis , a pharmaceutical company in France , to close the arbitration request and that it would transfer the domain automatically :
“ Hello
We are aware of the domain dispute that has been filed on this domain .
This domain was purchased in a bulk backorder .
We do not support trademark infringement .
We would like to transfer this domain to you at no cost you .
You will have to contact WIPO to close the dispute before I will be allowed to transfer the domain to you .
Please feel free to contact me with any questions .
Regards Administrator Standard Tacticsâ€
In a follow up to my questioning , Ede wrote :
We by no means meant to mislead you about trademarks .
We are NOT saying Standard Tactics does n’t own a variety of names in a variety of different contexts , but disagreed with your characterization .
Go Daddy treats all parked pages in the same way .
If the trademark holder contacts DBP , asking us to remove …we remove it .
Standard Tactics Today
It ’s clear that GoDaddy has taken a number of steps , including setting up a subsidiary in a different state , to cover its tracks warehousing domain names .
GoDaddy has over 30 million domains registered , and a quick look at TDNAM shows a number of high traffic domains being auctioned off every day .
One source said the company receives millions of hits a week on its Standard Tactics domains .
Ede calls Standard Tactics a “ research ” subsidiary :
For a number of years , traffic aggregation , monetization and advertising has become an increasingly prevalent aspect of the domain name industry .
As the world ’s largest registrar , we felt it was important for us to understand trends and developments in this industry .
As a result , we created Standard Tactics as a research group .
All names in Standard Tactics are presented to the public for purchase in TDNAM .
We do not withhold these names from TDNAM .
There are relatively few names with Standard Tactics and there is randomness built in to the process in order to provide sample types representing all domain characteristics .
By comparison , domain aggregators have 100’s of 1000 ’s of domain names .
This is an interesting response given the multitude of evidence that Standard Tactics acquires domains that do n’t sell on TDNAM , including the statement in the above mentioned UDRP that Standard Tactics acquires domains in “ bulk backorders ” .
Whether Standard Tactics technically acquires the domains before or after the auction is irrelevant , although expired domains are in a grace period until after the auction and should not be transferred to a new owner .
Furthermore , Standard Tactic ’s web page states that the company buys and sells domain names , that it may own trademarks as a result of bulk purchases , and refers interested buyers to TDNAM .
A phone number for Standard Tactics , found on the whois record for a .us domain name owned by the company ( .us domains can not use whois privacy ) , has a New Mexico phone number .
A Call to the number is answered by a recording that asks you to wait for a representative , and then sends you straight to voicemail .
A fax number on the same record is in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area .
Getting former GoDaddy employees to talk about Standard Tactics is a challenge .
I contacted former employees who were happy to talk about GoDaddy in general .
When I brought up Standard Tactics , a common response was for a brief pause followed by , “ I ca n’t talk about that ” .
Perhaps Standard Tactics answers another question : why Bob Parsons is so adamant that customers need whois privacy .

Endangered languages have been in the news recently with the launch in February of UNESCO ’s electronic edition of its Atlas of the Worlds Languages in Danger .
According to UNESCO , half of the 6500 languages spoken today are in danger of disappearing before the century ends .
Hundreds of languages have already died , some of these long ago and with no fanfare , but sometimes the death of a language is recorded and we know exactly who last spoke it .
It is these people I ’d like to honor .
This list is in no particular order and is not an exhaustive list , but I think it is representative and shows that language death is not restricted to one part of the world .
The people below came from all walks of life and , some seemed indifferent or unaware of their status , while others became campaigners and tried to pass their knowledge onto others .
It is interesting that many of those in the latter category lived long lives , almost defiantly trying to battle the inevitable .
12 Dolly Pentreath died 1777
Last known speaker of : traditional Cornish
According to her gravestone , which can still be visited today , Dolly Pentreath was the last known speaker of Cornish .
Dolly , who only learned English as an adult and whose last words reportedly were “ Me ne vidn cewsel Sawznek ! ” ( “ I do n’t want to speak English ! ” ) , had a fierce reputation and was known for smoking her pipe and using profane language .
Some thought her to be a witch .
There is some controversy as to Dolly ’s status as the last known speaker of Cornish , with some arguing that John Davey who died in 1890 should have that honor , others stating that Cornish has never really died out .
Fun Language Fact – Efforts to revive Cornish have been moderately successful and Cornish gained official recognition under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002 , and in 2008 a Standard Written Form was agreed upon .
11 Ned Maddrell circa 1878 – 1974
Last known speaker of : traditional Manx
As with Dolly Pentreath , there is some controversy as to Ned Madrell ’s status , however he deserves credit for the role he played in linguistic preservation .
Ned , a fisherman from Cregneash , travelled far and wide but spent his last decades on The Isle of Man teaching younger revivalists and recording his conversations to preserve the language .
He is remembered as being a cheerful man who was proud of his minor celebrity status .
Fun Language Fact –
There have been efforts to revive Manx since Ned Madrell ’s death and there is now a primary school , Bunscoill Ghaelgagh , where children are taught solely in Manx .
10 Tevfik Esenç 1904 – 1992
Last known speaker of : the Ubykh language
The Ubykh language is a North Caucasian language originally spoken along the shores of the Black Sea until its speakers were forced out by the Russians .
They eventually settled in Turkey , and it was there that language died .
Tevkik Esenc was an intelligent man who spoke several languages and he worked with linguistics to record the language as he was well aware of his status as the last speaker .
Some of these recordings are available on Youtube .
Fun Language Fact – Ubykh was in the Guinness Book of Records for being the language with the most number of consonants .
9 Alf Palmer circa 1891 – 1981
Last known speaker of : Warrunga
Little is known about Alf Palmer or Jinbilnggay as he was known in his native language .
He was born and died in Townsville , Queensland , Australia and , like many on this list , was keen to play his role in trying to preserve the language .
He worked with linguists from Japan and Australia and proved inspirational in alerting linguists to language loss .
He is pictured on the left above .
Fun Fact –
These very linguists returned to Townsville a few years ago and are working with Alf Palmer ’s descendants in attempts to revive the language .
8 Fidelia Fielding 1827 – 1908
Last known speaker of : the Mohegan Pequot Language
Fidelia Fielding or as she called herself Dji’ts Bud dnaca ( Flying Bird ) is remembered as being something of a loner who kept to herself .
However she should not be dismissed and she is an important and respected figure in the history of the Mohegan people .
She was one of the last people to live the traditional Mohegan lifestyle and she mentored Mohegan anthropologist Gladys Tantaquidgeon .
After her death , four of her diaries were found .
These are now housed in the Museum of the American Indian in New York City and have been studied in efforts to revive the language .
Fun Fact – On May 24 , 1936 , an estimated 1,000 people gathered at the Ancient Burial Grounds of the Mohegans , Fort Shantok State Park in Montville , to pay tribute to “ Flying Bird ” .
7 Tuone Udaina died 1898
Last known speaker of : Dalmatian
Tuane Udaina was not actually a native speaker of Dalmatian .
He picked it up from secretly listening to his parents ’ private conversations .
Despite this , and the fact that he was deaf and had not spoken the language for 20 years , he was approached by linguist Matteo Bartoli in 1897 to try to record the language .
Previous documentation of the language dated from the 13th – 16th century .
Sadly , Bartoli ’s original work ( in Italian ) was lost , existing only in a German translation , until 2001 when it was re-translated into Italian .
Udaina himself also met an unfortunate end , being blown up by a landmine on 10th June 1898 .
Fun Language Fact – Dalmatian , a Romance language with some similarities to Romanian , was spoken in the Dalmatia region of Croatia , with each town having its own different dialect of the language .
6 Big Bill Neidjie circa 1920 – 2002
Last known speaker of : the Gagudju language
Big Bill Neidjie was always something of a local legend .
He was born on the East Alligator River in Northern Territory , Australia .
He had a traditional upbringing and was taught to hunt by his father and grandfather .
He was known throughout for his physical strength and physique as well as for his commitment to conservation issues and the rights of indigenous Australians .
His fame grew when he was featured in National Geographic Magazine in 1988 and he was awarded the Order of Australia in 1989 .
Fun Language Fact – Like a number of indigenous Australian languages , in Gagudju it was taboo to discuss traditional secrets , passed from generation to generation , with outsiders .
When Bill became aware of his fate , he faced the dilemma of breaking taboo or letting his culture die completely .
He chose to break taboo and pass the secrets on to a select number of people .
5 Shanawdithit 1801 - 1829
Last known speaker of : the Beothuk language ( and last member of the Beothuk )
Considered one of the most notable people from Newfoundland , Shanawdithit had quite a sad short life .
Having lost most of her family either to TB or attacks from the British , who regarded her people as thieves , she spent the last few years of life working as a servant before also dying of TB .
Shanawdithit was taught some English by the philanthropist William Epps Cormack , in whose house she spent some time .
She proved talented at drawing , and it is through these that we know about the lifestyle of the Beothuk .
There is a sad postscript to her life , her skull was taken to the Royal College of Physicians in London , where it remained until it was given to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1938 .
Unfortunately , her skull was destroyed and lost during the Blitz .
The rest of her remains are buried in St John ’s , Newfoundland .
Fun Language Fact –
There is debate as to whether Beothuk is a language isolate , unlike any other , or whether it is related to Algonquian languages spoken in Quebec and Labrador .
4 Armand Lunel 1892 - 1977
Last known speaker of : Shuadit ( Judeo - Provençal )
Writer , librettist , philosopher and teacher , Lunel was born in Aix - en - Provence , France , where his family had lived for centuries , but later moved to Monaco .
His writings were in French and he wrote about everyday Jewish life in Provence .
1968 , a recording was made of Lunel singing in his language but he died before another recording could be made .
Fun Language Facts –
The origins of Judeo Provencal are something of a mystery to linguists , documents in the language go back to the 11th century .
Its use declined rapidly after the French Revolution .
3 Ishi 1860 – 1916
Last known speaker of : the Yana language ( and last member of the Yahi )
Of all the things we know about Ishi , his name is n’t one of them .
Ishi is simply a pseudonym meaning “ man ” in Yana , the language of the Yahi .
It was considered taboo in in Yahi society to say ones own name , so Ishi ’s real name died with him .
His story – that he went into hiding after his family was killed , before being found by a group of butchers - has continued to intrigue .
Documentaries , films and stage plays have all been made about him and many aspects of his life are still contested .
Sadly , Ishi did not have the long life that others on this list have enjoyed , dying of tuberculosis in 1916 .
Fun Language Fact –
Thanks to linguist Edward Sapir , who worked with Ishi , Yana is relatively well documented compared to other extinct American languages .
2 Marie Smith Jones 1918 – 2008
Last known speaker of : Eyak
When Marie Smith Jones died early last year she received obituaries from respected sources all round the world , perhaps indicating that language death is not just an interest of a few linguists .
Smith , the last full - blooded Eyak , only really became politically active after the death of her sister in the 1990s made her the last speaker .
She had declined to teach her children the language because of social stigma attached to it .
However in her later years , she helped work on an Eyak dictionary , became active in environmental concerns and twice spoke at United Nations on peace and indigenous languages .
Fun Language Fact – Eyak was originally spoken near the mouth of the copper river in Alaska .
It has now become a symbol in the fight against language death .
It is the first known native Alaskan language to become extinct .
1 Soma Devi Dura circa 1926
Last known speaker of : Dura
Coincidentally , mere days before Marie Smith Jones died , British news sources made us aware of the plight of 82 - year old Soma Devi Dura , the last know speaker of the Dura language of Nepal .
Soma Devi Dura is partially blind , deaf and in failing health but is described as being a rich source of songs and folklore in the Dura tongue .
Kedar Nagila , who is studying for a PhD in Nepalese languages has been working with Dura and trying to get her medical help .
As of April 2008 , Dura was still alive , but news of her since then has dried up .
Fun Language Fact – Dura is one of over 120 languages spoken in Nepal , but due to a “ one-nation , one - language ” policy instituted by the Shah dynasty , up to 96 % of these are threatened with extinction .

China says it liberated Tibet from centuries of serfdom The Chinese authorities have marked the inaugural " Serfs ' Liberation Day " with ceremonies and speeches extolling the virtue of Chinese development in Tibet .
" Any plots to make Tibet independent ... are bound to fail , " said Zhang Qingli , Tibet 's Communist Party chief .
The holiday , which marks the start of Beijing 's direct rule of Tibet in 1959 , was announced last year after Tibetans joined violent protests against China .
The Free Tibet group said all China had to offer was intensifying repression .
Beijing says it liberated Tibet from the dark ages , freeing the population from medieval - style feudal slavery and bringing prosperity to its people .
A crowd of more than 13,000 watched the Serf 's Liberation Day ceremony in front of Tibet 's famed Potala Palace .
National television broadcast the 75 - minute event live .
Nowadays we have roads , televisions and telephones ... all made possible by the Communist Party
69 - year - old Tibetan A man describing himself as a former serf , a student and military officials joined Mr Zhang in praising the economic development brought by China and denouncing the exiled former Buddhist theocracy that ruled Tibet .
" Nowadays we have roads , we have televisions and telephones , children go to schools , and we have savings in the banks , all made possible by the Communist Party , " said one Tibetan man who had been born into what he described as a serf family in 1940 .
But critics of Beijing rule say Tibetans feel excluded from China 's considerable economic investment in the region which has mainly benefited the Han Chinese who have migrated there in massive numbers .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Beijing says 50 years of Chinese control has left Tibetans with little political or religious freedom .
Troops Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was predictably vilified by speakers on Serfs ' Liberation Day and in the run-up to the holiday .
The rival Panchen Lama - the Chinese supported leader of Tibetan Buddhists - told a gathering of monks in Wuxi , eastern China that the event proved the country enjoys social harmony , stability and religious freedom .
The Communist Party has been relentless in promoting its view of an improved contented Tibet .
Anti-Chinese protests in Tibet in 2008 State - controlled newspapers , television and a museum exhibition have lauded Chinese rule .
The Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said that the region is peaceful and stable but that may be thanks to the thousands of paramilitary troops and police who have been stationed there since last year 's trouble .
A year on from protests in Lhasa and surrounding areas over Chinese rule , the Communist government still forbids foreign journalists from reporting freely from the region .

Almost nine out of 10 climate scientists do not believe political efforts to restrict global warming to 2C will succeed , a Guardian poll reveals today .
An average rise of 4 - 5C by the end of this century is more likely , they say , given soaring carbon emissions and political constraints .
Such a change would disrupt food and water supplies , exterminate thousands of species of plants and animals and trigger massive sea level rises that would swamp the homes of hundreds of millions of people .
The poll of those who follow global warming most closely exposes a widening gulf between political rhetoric and scientific opinions on climate change .
While policymakers and campaigners focus on the 2C target , 86 % of the experts told the survey they did not think it would be achieved .
A continued focus on an unrealistic 2C rise , which the EU defines as dangerous , could even undermine essential efforts to adapt to inevitable higher temperature rises in the coming decades , they warned .
The survey follows a scientific conference last month in Copenhagen , where a series of studies were presented that suggested global warming could strike harder and faster than realised .
The Guardian contacted all 1,756 people who registered to attend the conference and asked for their opinions on the likely course of global warming .
Of 261 experts who responded , 200 were researchers in climate science and related fields .
The rest were drawn from industry or worked in areas such as economics and social and political science .
The 261 respondents represented 26 countries and included dozens of senior figures , including laboratory directors , heads of university departments and authors of the 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The poll asked the experts whether the 2C target could still be achieved , and whether they thought that it would be met : 60 % of respondents argued that , in theory , it was still technically and economically possible to meet the target , which represents an average global warming of 2C since the industrial revolution .
The world has already warmed by about 0.8C since then , and another 0.5C or so is inevitable over coming decades given past greenhouse gas emissions .
But 39 % said the 2C target was impossible .
The poll comes as UN negotiations to agree a new global treaty to regulate carbon pollution gather pace in advance of a key meeting in Copenhagen in December .
Officials will try to agree a successor to the Kyoto protocol , the first phase of which expires in 2012 .
The 2C target is unlikely to feature in a new treaty , but most of the carbon cuts proposed for rich countries are based on it .
Bob Watson , chief scientist to Defra , told the Guardian last year that the world needed to focus on the 2C target , but should also prepare for a possible 4C rise .
Asked what temperature rise was most likely , 84 of the 182 specialists ( 46 % ) who answered the question said it would reach 3 - 4C by the end of the century ; 47 ( 26 % ) suggested a rise of 2 - 3C , while a handful said 6C or more .
While 24 experts predicted a catastrophic rise of 4 - 5C , just 18 thought it would stay at 2C or under .
Some of those surveyed who said the 2C target would be met confessed they did so more out of hope rather than belief .
" As a mother of young children I choose to believe this , and work hard toward it , " one said .
" This optimism is not primarily due to scientific facts , but to hope , " said another .
Some said they thought geoengineering measures , such as seeding the ocean with iron to encourage plankton growth , would help meet the target .
Many of the experts stressed that an inability to hit the 2C target did not mean that efforts to tackle global warming should be abandoned , but that the emphasis is now on damage limitation .
ALLENDALE -- Apartment neighbors of Grand Valley State University student Derek Copp say they cannot fathom what prompted police to shoot him late Wednesday in a drug - related raid .
But they said they were aware of marijuana odors in the complex .
If you came down the hallway at the right time , you could smell the smoke , " said Joe Putra , whose apartment door is in the same Campus View Apartments hallway as the shooting victim .
The 20 - year - old student was in serious condition at Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital .
Copp , a Spring Arbor native , has been at GVSU since 2007 , the same year he graduated from Jackson Community College , according to his page on Facebook .
He identifies himself as " a left - wing hippie peace - keeping liberal , " who is seeking a film and video degree .
Copp plays the guitar and often volunteers at music festivals to see favorite bands for free , the social networking page states .
Putra described the wounded student as a " real nice guy " who was easy going .
He said people would " come and go " to the apartment often , particularly last fall .
Still , he wondered why the student was shot .
" It must have been something more than just weed , " he said .
Police said five officers with the West Michigan Enforcement Team , a regional drug unit , executed a search warrant on the apartment about 9 p.m. Wednesday .
An Ottawa County sheriff 's detective assigned to WEMET fired one shot at the student , hitting him in the upper right chest .
The student was unarmed , but police would not say whether they thought he posed a threat or what happened during the raid .
The 12 - year veteran deputy is on paid leave pending an investigation .
Michigan State police Lt. Cameron
Henke also refused to disclose whether police found any drugs in the apartment .
Police discuss GVSU shooting
Brian Gardner , owner of Campus View Apartments , said such an incident has never happened in the complex 's 42 - year history .
He described the complex as a quiet place where many of the university 's more studious students live .
" This was just a once - in - a - blue - moon incident , " he said .
He said students who live there sign a " no party " agreement that prohibits kegs and essentially classifies any gathering of more than eight people as a party .
" That 's why it 's so disappointing this happened , " he said .

It 's Funny Because It Might Be True
Andrew Koenig was born on August 17 , 1968 in Los Angeles , California , USA as Joshua Andrew Koenig .
He was an actor and editor , known for InAlienable ( 2007 ) , Batman : Dead End ( 2003 ) and Unser lautes Heim ( 1985 ) .
He died on February 14 , 2010 in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
The US economy has suffered a sharp nosedive .
Plunging exports and the biggest fall in consumer spending in 28 years has meant that the decline was much worse than analysts had expected .
Kevin Connolly in the US looks at why we are now talking trillions as well as billions .
The US economy shrank by 6.2 % in the last three months of 2008
In the world of American government , the trillion is the new billion .
There was a time when only astro- physicists and accountants practising in Zimbabwe had any use for a word which - in the US at least - means a million millions .
Barack Obama is not the only extraordinary phenomenon to rise to prominence in this country in the last year or so - the trillion is right up with him .
Suddenly it is popping up in newspaper headlines with extraordinary frequency , even though it is surely a number so far beyond our everyday conceptual grasp that it conveys practically nothing .
America 's budget deficit for example - the amount by which what the government spends exceeds what it earns - is now $ 1.75tn , and its national debt - the total of those deficits accumulating from year to year - is nudging $ 11tn .
Incomprehensible
If it helps to view it as a figure then here is America 's annual budget deficit as it stands now : $ 1,750,000,000,000 .
And the national debt : $ 11,000,000,000,000 .
Does that help ?
No , I rather thought it would not .
President Obama has unveiled his $ 3.6tn ( £ 2.5tn ) budget for 2010
You get more of a feel for the scale when you consider that the digital national debt counter near Times Square in New York ran out of space when the number crossed the $ 10tn mark .
They were only able to keep spelling out figures electronically by replacing the dollar sign at the front with an extra number .
And yet the trillion is only one of a number of startling , incomprehensible numbers to make their way into the headlines since the start of this recession .
Take Mr Obama 's stimulus package for example , which ended up at $ 787bn ( or just over three - quarters of a trillion if you prefer ) .
You have probably heard by now the calculation that that is the equivalent of spending $ 1 m a day every day starting from the birth of Christ and going on through the present day .
Verbal inflation Slightly more accessibly , it is also regarded , in real terms , as one of the most expensive projects ever undertaken by the American government .
Only fighting and paying for World War II cost more .
Vietnam came close but putting a man on the moon was a bargain in relative terms at about a third of the price of the stimulus programme .
It is hardly surprising that politicians and pundits on American discussion programmes often jumble up the millions , billions and trillions - we are still in the process of adjusting to a frightening order of magnitude
That is even more startling when you consider that the bailout for troubled banks ( that is troubled in its modern sense of " greedy and incompetent " ) is only going to come in very slightly cheaper , at perhaps $ 750 bn .
The creation of the new reserve fund to pay for health care reform in Mr Obama 's first budget will cost a further $ 634bn .
The US is struggling with rising unemployment
And yet it is not very long ago that the word billion began creeping into the lexicon of everyday politics .
In the past it was mostly regarded as a loose , non-specific way of conveying a sense of scale bordering on the fantastical - as in " a billion stars in the heavens " .
The speed of that verbal inflation is staggering .
Most of us still use the word millionaire to describe someone of enormous wealth , but it has actually been around since the mid-19th century in its current form and once conjured an image of someone with limitless spending power .
Today it is a little less special .
There are thought to be around 10 million millionaires in the world and we use the word billionaire to convey the idea of limitless plenty instead - there are only just over a thousand of them , and maybe even fewer than that after the global collapse of values of the last year or so .
But hardly have we grown used to the idea of the billionaire when the word billion , relatively speaking , has begun to lose some of its power to convey a cosmic sense of financial scale , displaced by the t-word .
It is hardly surprising that politicians and pundits on American discussion programmes often jumble up the millions , billions and trillions - we are still in the process of adjusting to a frightening order of magnitude .
Quadrillion
If you are not sure of the difference by the way , think of it like this .
A million seconds is 11 days .
Since we have only just started on the trillion scale a bit of a breathing space should now follow
A billion seconds is around 32 years .
And a trillion therefore is 32,000 years .
It seems to me this matters because the language of political arithmetic is now completely removed from the language of everyday life - and that has happened with frightening speed .
In the early years of his presidency , for example , Bill Clinton tried to get a $ 16.3 bn stimulus package through on Capitol Hill and failed , partly perhaps because that sounded like a hell of a lot of money back then .
The American budget , and the American budget deficit have come a long way since - not in the right direction .
Still , since we have only just started on the trillion scale a bit of a breathing space should now follow .
It is the quadrillion next by the way .
Now that really IS a lot of money .

I travel pretty frequently .
If you do too , this might sound familiar .
Whenever I fly somewhere , the first thing I 'll do upon landing is turn on my phone 's radio to send / receive SMS and check email .
I 'll usually scan Google Reader and / or Twitter while waiting to deplane .
Then I 'll make my way straight to the taxi line to get a ride into town .
Sometimes , I know the wait will be ridiculous – like in Las Vegas or New York .
Other times , it 's pretty quick , like in Austin .
But there 's one aspect of the experience that bugs me consistently – solo travelers like me , taking taxis to the same general location .
Sure , I could walk up and down the line asking if anyone 's going where I am – but in most places , that just does n't seem culturally acceptable .
Kind of like saying hello to everyone in the elevator of a Midtown highrise .
Why ?
Because there 's no real need to engage with complete strangers that will soon leave your proximity .
Plus , you do n't know what these people are all about .
Enter social technology .
The nature of participation lends itself to people willingly publishing personal profile information .
So you can get a sense of whether someone 's sketchy or not without having the training of a FBI interrogator .
Here 's the concept :
Do you think we could get a taxi sharing movement started using Twitter ?
Two great reasons – better for your travel budget and better for the environment .
When I search for something similar , it appears that point solutions exist for cities like New York .
But to make something like this work , you need networks with critical mass – so it 's easier to activate the native network with its million + accounts and hundreds of thousands of active users .
Witness ideas like # followfriday or # songsaturday
Here 's how it could work .
Your plane lands .
You turn on your phone and take care of essential communications .
You search for #taxishare and see if anyone 's nearby .
Or you tweet your own details , e.g. location , destination , time you 're willing to wait until for responses ( all times local ) , and the hashtag .
Like this :
LGA .
W Times Square . 9 pm. # taxishare
BOS .
Harvard campus .
10:30 pm. # taxishare
Anyone who 's relevant can ping you back with an @ message .
You 'd just have to run the search 2 or 3 times as you make your way to queue .
By using Twitter , users can check profile information before deciding to respond .
E.g. if you 're only willing to share with other solo female travelers , you 've got some ability to filter .
Naturally there are many ways to modify the message string to help .
I could see this being particularly useful next week as SXSW begins .
A lot of people are visiting Austin bound for destinations concentrated in the downtown area ; many people are also on Twitter .
What do you think – could this work ?
What are other benefits / drawbacks ?
Would you be willing to try it out ?
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A Berlin cashier who was sacked from a supermarket after 31 years of service because her employer accused her of stealing 1.30 euros ( $ 1.65 ) has become a flash point of a debate about unchecked capitalism in Germany .
Leaders of Germany ’s major political parties criticized the supermarket ’s decision to fire Barbara Emme , especially because the 50 - year - old who has become a German cause celebre denies the charges that she kept bottle deposit receipts worth 1.30 euros .
Wolfgang
Thierse , vice president of parliament and member of the Social Democrats , on Thursday called a court decision on Tuesday that upheld the cashier ’s sacking “ barbaric ” and warned cases like this “ destroy people ’s confidence in democracy . ”
Horst Seehofer , leader of the Christian Social Union , said the case raised questions about capitalism , which has come under attack in Germany in the wake of the global financial crisis .
“ I do n’t understand how a cashier can be fired because of 1.30 euros while managers who lose billions of euros can keep their jobs , ” Seehofer told a rally in Bavaria on Wednesday .
LIGHTNING ROD
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked about the case at a news conference with a group of foreign journalists on Thursday after the case has drawn extensive television and print media coverage in recent weeks .
The case of “ Barbara E. ” is starting to loom over Germany ’s upcoming election campaign in a way that has similarities to “ Joe the Plumber , ” an ordinary Ohio voter who became a lightning rod in the 2008 U.S. presidential election .
“ My phone has been ringing off the hook , ” Emme told Bild newspaper on Thursday after she appeared on a late night ZDF television talk show on Tuesday evening .
“ But unfortunately no one offered me a job .
That ’s not surprising considering the nasty accusations hanging over my head .
It ’s going to be hard to find a new job because of that . ”
Bernd Ahlers , head of the supermarket chain , defended the company ’s decision to sack the cashier .
He said the company had lost confidence in her trustworthiness because of the incident .
Wow , some nutty investor is actually buying into that harebrained scheme to turn the money - bleeding San Francisco Chronicle into a ( purposely ) nonprofit paper .
Local billionaire Warren Hellman ( pictured ) , a private - equity kingpin , joined with other " prominent San Francisco business leaders " to propose leading such a conversion , according to a report in the San Francisco Business Times .
The Chronicle is something of a bellwether for the rest of the newspaper industry , if only because the transition to online news consumption is so far advanced in the tech - obsessed Bay Area .
In the past five years , the paper 's circulation has declined to 370,345 from more than 480,000 .
It lost more than $ 50 million last year , the latest in a series of deep annual losses over nearly a decade .
Owner Hearst Corp. is slashing expenses and considering closing or selling the paper .
Hellman and team want to prevent that , but only if Hearst keeps playing the role of sugar daddy .
From the Business Times :
The proposal would be for a nonprofit corporation " to take over the Chronicle , " with Hearst Corp. continuing to provide some philanthropic support , [ San Francisco attorney and power broker Bill ] Coblentz said .
Details remain sketchy .
It 's unclear if the proposal is being seriously considered .
So , to recap : The Chronicle will keep losing money .
Hearst will keep losing money .
But Warren Hellman 's nonprofit corporation gets to own and control the paper .
This is the sort of dealmaking that made Hellman a billionaire .
And given Hearst 's track record , the company just might take the offer .
( More likely : Hearst finds a way to sell to notorious cheapskate Dean Singleton , who bought up most of the region 's other failing newspapers .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is already on the case , handling some pesky antitrust provisions . )

I remember the days when someone might get dissed for rolling in a Hyundai .
That was back in ’ 86 or ’ 87 when the company first started selling cars in the US .
They sold like hot cakes due to their super cheap price but were of such low quality that it almost did n’t matter .
However , the car company that once was known to stand for Hope You Understand Nothing ’s Driveable And Inexpensive , has come a long way since then .
This year , the Hyundai Genesis was named the 2009 North America Car of the Year and Canadian Car of the Year 2009 .
In addition it gained the Autobytel Editor ’s Choice Award along with several other accolades .
The point is that Hyundai has found the right mix of product , quality and price and everyone ’s taking notice .
Our eyebrows were raised with the introduction of the 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe which is the cheapest 300 hp car available on the market today .
It compares favorably to the BMW 335i coupe and the Infinity G37 .
Performance - wise it is right up there with these premium brands and can hold its own .
The two engine options available for the Genesis Coupe include a 210 - horsepower , 2.0 - liter turbocharged unit or the 306 hp 3.8 - liter V6 .
The later comes standard with a six - speed manual , leather upholstery , fog lights , premium door sill plates and chrome fascia accents , all for $ 25 k .
An automatic Shiftronic transmission is also available but pushes the price up to $ 26,500 .
Hyundai offers a variety of packages such as the Grand Touring but we only really care about the Track version .
This nice collection of performance upgrades includes 19 ″ gunmetal finished alloy wheels , track - tuned suspension , Brembo brakes with 13.4 inch rotors and 4 piston calipers and a Torsen - type limited slip - differential .
The Track V6 model with manual transmission goes for $ 29,500 while the automatic runs $ 31,000 .
The Hyundai Genesis Coupe has been showing up in all the right places .
Last year , the SEMA show featured 3 different coupes freaked by Rhys Millen Racing ( RMR ) , HKS and Street Concepts .
The RMR version was built on a 2.0 - liter prototype to create what became later known as the “ Art of Speed ” Genesis Coupe .
Their camp performed some serious weight reduction by using carbon fiber to replace the front bumper , doors , fenders and side skirts along with other body panels .
The engine was equipmed with a Turbonetics turbocharger , wastegate and blow - off valve and a custom intake manifold .
Two - way adjustable KW coilovers were used to beef up the suspension along with new sway bars and adjustable lower control arms .
The stock rims were replaced with SSR Type - F wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza slicks with 18×9.5s in front and 18×10.5s in the rear .
The final mods include a roll - cage , custom gauges and a mandatory fire suppression system .
Street Concepts got their hands on the 3.8 - liter V6 model which they molded into a “ Stealth Fighter - inspired ” vehicle that was heavier on external aesthetics and lighter on performance mods .
The camoflauge paint scheme was matched with a custom grill , tinted head lights and tail lights and a large APR wing .
An improved Brembo brake system was installed along with 19 inch Volk wheels fitted with Pirelli tires .
Performance modifications were limited to a K&N cold air intake and a Magnaflow cat - back exhaust system .
HKS was provided a turbo - charged 2.0 - liter Genesis Coupe .
Similar to RMR they really went to work on the performance modifications .
A GT2835 R turbo upgrade was installed along with an HKS stainless tubular manifold , sequential blow - off valve , carbon fiber airbox , intercooler and cat - back exhaust .
The suspension system received HKS Hipermax III coilovers .
And to round out the look , an aerodynamic package from Ken Style was applied .
In addition , look for the Hyundai Genesis Coupe to make its movie debut in the Fast and Furious 4 opening on April 3rd .
Check out the spoiler video of the movie ’s major race .
Who would have thought a few years ago that a Hyundai would be featured in a franchise known for radical tuners and high - performance sport cars !

Scientists in Britain plan to become the first in the world to produce unlimited amounts of synthetic human blood from embryonic stem cells for emergency infection - free transfusions .
A major research project is to be announced this week that will culminate in three years with the first transfusions into human volunteers of " synthetic " blood made from the stem cells of spare IVF embryos .
It could help to save the lives of anyone from victims of traffic accidents to soldiers on a battlefield by revolutionising the vital blood transfusion services , which have to rely on a network of human donors to provide a constant supply of fresh blood .
The multimillion - pound deal involving NHS Blood and Transplant , the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Wellcome Trust , the world 's biggest medical research charity , means Britain will take centre stage in the global race to develop blood made from embryonic stem cells .
The researchers will test human embryos left over from IVF treatment to find those that are genetically programmed to develop into the " O- negative " blood group , which is the universal donor group whose blood can be transfused into anyone without fear of tissue rejection .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This blood group is relatively rare , applicable to about 7 per cent of the population , but it could be produced in unlimited quantities from embryonic stem cells because of their ability to multiply indefinitely in the laboratory .
The aim is to stimulate embryonic stem cells to develop into mature , oxygen - carrying red blood cells for emergency transfusions .
Such blood would have the benefit of not being at risk of being infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis , or the human form of " mad cow " disease .
The military in particular needs a constant supply of fresh , universal donor blood for battlefield situations when normal supplies from donors can quickly run out .
But developing blood made from the cells of spare IVF embryos will raise difficult ethical issues for people not happy with the idea of destroying embryos to create stem cells .
It also raises the intriguing philosophical question of whether the synthetic blood will have come from someone who never existed .
In theory , just one embryo could meet the nation 's needs .
The Wellcome Trust is believed to have promised £ 3 m towards the cost of the project , with further funding coming from the blood transfusion services of Scotland , and England and Wales .
The Irish government is also understood to be involved .
A spokesman for the Wellcome Trust said complicated legal issues were still being ironed out between all the parties involved but that an announcement is likely to be made in the coming week .
The project will be led by Professor Marc Turner , of Edinburgh University , the director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service .
Professor
Turner has been involved in studies investigating how to ensure donated blood is free of the infectious agent behind variant CJD , the human form of " mad cow " disease .
Several vCJD patients are thought to have contracted the disease by blood transfusions .
Professor Turner was unavailable for comment but a spokeswoman for the National Blood Service for England and North Wales confirmed that negotiations on the joint research project were at an advanced stage and that legal , rather than scientific , issues were holding up the announcement .
The multi-centre collaboration is also understood to involve scientists at the Medical Research Council 's Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh , and Roslin Cells , a spin - off company that has emerged out of the Roslin Institute , where Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996 .
Scientists in other countries , notably Sweden , France and Australia , are also known to be working on the development of synthetic blood from embryonic stem cells .
And last year , a team from a US biotechnology company , Advanced Cell Technology , announced that it has been able to produce billions of functioning red blood cells from embryonic stem cells .
But the US work had been held up because of funding problems dating back to the ban on embryonic stem cell work under the Bush administration .
President Barack Obama has since reversed that policy .
In Britain , the project was held up because of the difficulty of finding funding for " translational " research that attempts to take scientific studies in the laboratory into the earliest stages of commercial development .
This problem has now been overcome .
Citigroup ’s 10 - K filing makes it clear why regulators appear committed to ( or perhaps are stuck with ) a strategy of supporting the full capital structure ( including holding company debt ) , rather than subjecting the bank to the Lehman treatment .
Citigroup has a daunting $ 1.9 trillion of assets on the balance sheet alone ( not counting off - balance sheet exposure ) .
The balance sheet is essentially supported by an uneasy alliance between the U.S. government and the company ’s depositors and other creditors , since the market value of the equity is so depressed .
Deposits totaled $ 774 billion at year end , including nearly $ 500 billion outside the U.S.
In a liquidation of a U.S. insured depositary institution , the 10 - K notes that U.S. deposits would have priority over deposits outside the U.S. , as well as over parent company claims .
But we ca n’t imagine the new administration will want to precipitate an international crisis over whose - deposits - get - paid - off - first .
There is $ 360 billion of long - term debt , including about $ 24 billion of TruPS - related junior subordinated debt and $ 34 billion of subordinated debt .
At year - end , parent company liquidity , including unencumbered cash deposits at the broker - dealer , totaled $ 67 billion .
But no cash hoard would be big enough right now , without the support of Uncle Sam .
Investors are worried ( with good reason ) about the risk for more markdowns of loans , securities and the deferred tax asset ( $ 44.5 billion ) .
Moody ’s lowered Citigroup ’s senior and subordinated debt ratings last week , but left the short - term rating at P1 ( under the assumption that “ systemic support ” is “ most predictable ” for short - term debt . )
A downgrade in the C.P. rating would trigger an $ 11 billion funding requirement .
As we discussed last week ( see report dated 2/24/09 ) , we see value in Citigroup ’s senior debt ( although the 5.5 % notes due 2013 have tightened to T+604 from T+752 a week ago .
Here is something for all those who say we are permadoom sayers ...
Fresh from gimme credit , and we tend to agree .
A full blown implosion of Citi would be the Mutual Assured Destruction to everyone with exposure to Citi , which is ... well ... everyone , whether it is by 1 or 6 degrees of separation .
Betting on Citi 's demise is ironically just like buying US Sovereign CDS : you have a high likelihood of being right , but if you are , the money you make ( assuming someone honors the contract you are collecting under ) will be worth just the paper it is written on .
From GimmeCredit :
When my wife , Elizabeth , was pregnant , she had a routine ultrasound exam , and I was astonished by the images .
The baby ’s ears , his tiny lips , the lenses of his eyes and even the feathery , fluttering valves in his heart were as crisp and clear as the muscles and tendons in a Leonardo da Vinci drawing .
Months before he was born , we were already squabbling about whom he looked like .

Is n’t it about time for a wristwatch credit card ?
MasterCard thinks so .
The “ priceless ” payment brand recently approved the LAKS Smart Transaction Watch 2 , a handsome black and stainless steel analog timepiece with an embedded antenna coil that functions as a contactless PayPass device once a tiny SIM - like M / Chip is inserted .
The payment watch , a joint venture between Austria Card and Vienna - based LAKS watches , is the latest move into nontraditional form factors by Austria Card , a leading supplier of smart cards in Austria and Eastern Europe .
“ The delivery of smart card chip modules to local chip embedders allows Austria Card to expand its market presence into new geographical territories , ” says Max Paul , marketing director of the Lykos Group , the major shareholder in Austria Card .
Dubai - based Emirates Bank and the Turkish Vakif Bank were the first financial institutions to order Smart Transaction Watches for their customers .
LAKS introduced its first Smart Transaction Watch in 2006 as a limited edition FIFA World Cup sports watch in collaboration with Taiwan - based Chinatrust Commercial Bank .
The watchmaker then improved upon its original design by adding a slide - in slot below the 9 o’clock position that enables users to quickly and easily insert their M / Chip and turn their timepiece into a tap - and - go credit card .
Watches are only the latest wearable accessory to be augmented as a means to make electronic payments as handy as cash .
The idea of a credit card ring dates back at least to 1964 , when the New York Times ran this ad .
Since then , a variety of contactless RFID key fobs have been deployed , including the miniature , gym bag - ready Discover 2GO Card .
Elsewhere in the world , that most ubiquitous accessory , the cell phone , has become the contactless payment solution of choice .
Multifunction watches gaining
But multifunctional watches are certainly gaining momentum .
The Fossil Wrist Net ( $ 149 - $ 199 ) pulls in customized news , sports and weather via FM radio waves with an MSN Direct subscription .
NHJ ’s Wearable TV Watch ( $ 199 ) keeps your favorite television shows handy on its 1 \xbd - inch screen , thanks to a micro tuner and headphone antenna .
Two LAKS watches ( $ 200 each ) carry 2G of integrated memory ; one for storage , the other as an MP3 player , and both with USB connectivity .
The Garmin Forerunner 201 ( $ 160 ) features an integrated GPS .
And new mothers will want to check out the Boardbug Baby and Child Monitor , which enables you to keep watch on your toddler while remotely monitoring your new baby ’s every cry and temperature change .
Or you can indulge your inner Dick Tracy with a real - life two - way wrist radio , LG ’s new DG910 Watch Phone .
The mighty mite incorporates a 1.43 - inch touch screen that toggles from video to keypad , a built - in camera and 3 gigs of storage — handy for evidence - gathering should you run across Pruneface or Flattop Jones .
Iran 's Bushehr plant may begin operations this year Iran has enough nuclear material to build a bomb , the United States ' most senior military commander has said .
" We think they do , quite frankly , " Adm Mike Mullen , chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , told CNN .
" And Iran having a nuclear weapon , I 've believed for a long time , is a very , very bad outcome for the region and for the world , " he said .
Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful , but the West suspects it is seeking nuclear weapons .
' One bomb ' possible A report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) two weeks ago said Tehran had built up a stockpile of fissile nuclear material .
They 're not close to a stockpile .
They 're not close to a weapon at this point
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates
This raised concerns in the West that Iran might have understated by one - third how much uranium it has enriched .
The IAEA report showed a major increase in Iran 's reported stockpile of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) since November to 1,010 kg .
Some physicists believe this stockpile is enough to be converted into enough highly enriched uranium to build one bomb .
The amount " is sufficient for a nuclear weapons breakout capability " , David Albright , president of the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security , told AFP news agency .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has adopted a more cautious approach .
" I think that there has been a continuing focus on how do you get the Iranians to walk away from a nuclear weapons programme ?
They 're not close to a stockpile .
They 're not close to a weapon at this point , " he told NBC on Sunday .
President Barack Obama has stated he wants to engage in diplomacy with Tehran to ensure it does not build nuclear weapons , and has described the country 's nuclear programme as an " urgent problem " the international community must confront .

“ Faithmouse ” is a painfully sincere cartoonist who specializes in incomprehensible images of fetuses doing cutesy things , in the apparent belief that the morality of abortion is determined by the wisdom of Little Jeffy from The Family Circle .
But occasionally he makes himself clear enough that you can understand what he ’s saying .
Here ’s an example :
If you ca n’t see it clearly in the reduced - size image , a cute pink fetus is lounging in a wingback chair , reading “ Modern Fetus ” magazine , inside a soft , red , squishy - walled apartment with the sign “ Womb Sweet Womb ” hanging on the wall .
The fetus is plugged into the wall through an umbilical cord that terminates in an electrical outlet .
Its baseball cap is hanging from a peg on the wall , a ventilator duct appears on the other wall , and – displaying a worrisome grasp of anatomy – a heart - shaped heart and other organs are visible through a huge gap in the side wall , next to a set of large , coin - operated binoculars like you find at outdoor public attractions . (?)
A gloved hand is bursting through the screen door and slamming down the front door of the apartment , holding an “ Eviction Notice ” .
Yep .
Your uterus is the home of a fetus .
Your cervix is merely the front door of its “ apartment ” , and your bodily organs are merely the walls , floor , wiring , and ventilation ducts of its abode .
Acting on your own body , or having a doctor do so on your behalf , is equivalent to bursting down the door of someone else ’s home .
( I admit , I have no freaking idea what the binoculars are for . )
And , of course , it ’s a violent invasion – tearing through the screen , ripping off the door , and dragging the little wobbly - head - doll fetus out into the cold , like a thug or a home invader , or at best a slumlord .
You do n’t , of course , have the right to treat your own body as your own body if someone else is living in it – that would be cruel .
Amazingly enough , also , the cartoon manages to show the inside of a woman ’s body without ever implying that there ’s actually a woman present .
The fetus is fully characterized – it not only looks like a typical cartoon image of a fully - developed child , but it has intellectual interests , possessions , and a home with little domestic touches hanging on the walls .
The woman is represented only by the grossly distorted image of the walls of her uterus , which actually belongs to the fetus as its dwelling place .
( When you see someone ’s apartment , you do n’t think “ Oh , here ’s the landlord ’s real estate investment ” – you think “ Oh , here is this person ’s apartment “ .
Here , the woman ’s entire body , including the internal organs visible through the “ window ” in her uterus – it ’s a “ womb with a view ” – get it ?
– are the dwelling place of this fetus ; they are its home , not her body . )
So , if you want to know what you are to the right wing , there you have it .
You are the property of your own fetus – its home , its “ castle ” .
Your uterus is as sacrosanct against “ home invasion ” – by you – as a citizen ’s home is against thugs or intruders .
You have no right of “ trespass ” on your own body .
And your fetus is a fully - developed person with its own tastes in home decoration ; you are nothing but some walls and tubing .
Do be sure to keep the yard picked up , though ; it ’s your obligation as landlord .
MOVIE REVIEW
also known as “ Watchmen : The IMAX Experience , ” “ Cel ce vegheaza , ” “ Cuvari , ” “ Strázci — Watchmen , ” “ Watchmen — Die Wächter , ” “ Watchmen — O Filme ”
Reviewed by : Michael Karounos
CONTRIBUTOR
“ Justice is coming to all of us .
No matter what we do . ”
For conservative Christian audiences , the prospect of seeing Zack Snyder ’s “ Watchmen ” is a non-starter .
There is male frontal nudity ( albeit blue and animated ) ; numerous instances of blasphemy ; shots of women ’s breasts ; gory violence ; and a nude love - making scene .
I suspect that ( with the exception of Dr. Manhattan ’s nudity ) such content is put in there for the fanboys , because it does n’t contribute to the story or to the film as an aesthetic pleasure .
However , those caveats aside , let me state at the outset that “ Watchmen ” is a serious work of art .
Calling the synthesis of comics and ideas “ serious art ” seems oxymoronic , but it is not .
Alan Moore ’s “ Watchmen ” is serious in a way that most comics are not , for the simple reason that it contains commentary on the Cold War , the Vietnam War , the prospect of nuclear destruction , quantum physics , the peace movement , social issues such as drugs and crime , and the philosophical significance of power and the use of violence .
This seriousness is compelling , but , in its specifics , it is also the Achilles heel of the film , because all the references are so dated .
This kind of newspaper topicality is what Robert Frost avoided in his poetry , saying , for example : “ Eliot has written in the throes of getting religion and foreswearing a world gone bad with war .
That seems deep . ”
That seems deep .
The killing irony is that there is no news worse than old news .
Who cares about World War I now ?
That is why Frost is read and enjoyed by more undergraduates than Eliot or Pound is .
Frost ’s depth is metaphysical , not political .
This is Watchmen ’s great virtue as well .
Although it is a relentlessly political commentary and anti-conservative , that is the weakest aspect of the work .
The strongest aspect is the character of Dr. Manhattan who provides a profound metaphysical dimension around which the temporal issues orbit like planets around the sun .
Arguably , without that character , “ Watchmen ” would be a very good comic book series , but not the classic that it is .
The other problem with the movie , besides the topicality of faded 1960s issues , is the disjointed narrative style that it faithfully copies from the comic book .
There are intermittent flashbacks that jump from 1940 to 1959 to 1965 to 1985 and points in between .
This makes it difficult to follow , if you have n’t read the graphic novel .
Preferably , twice .
For those not familiar with it , the novel charts the rise of heroes in the United States from the 1940s .
These heroes are roughly analogous to American military power and the strengths of its civil society .
Dr. Manhattan represents the advent of the nuclear age and the advantage the United States holds over the rest of the world .
The retelling of the past ( known as “ alternate history ” in genre terms ) occurs in 1985 , in the journal of Rorschach , one of the heroes .
In addition to him and Dr. Manhattan , there is Nite Owl , the Comedian , the Silk Spectre II , and Ozymandias .
The movie opens with the death of one of the characters and the suspicion that someone is out to kill all of them .
This , as illustrator Dave Gibbons describes in numerous interviews , is the Hitchcockian “ macguffin , ” the pretense of the plot .
But the movie is about character and ideas , not plot .
Rorschach takes us on a picturesque tour of history through his investigations in space and time .
In 1977 , the Keene Act outlawed the heroes , and those who did n’t go insane or were n’t killed were forced to retire .
Nixon is into his third term , the United States won the Vietnam War , and the Soviets are threatening a nuclear war .
That is the social background of the novel .
Equally compelling to the metaphysical and political elements are the emotional issues .
The characters are fully fleshed - out in their relationships to one another , their histories together , their resentments and friendships , and in that sense the novel is epic in scope , traversing all boundaries .
The affairs between the characters are convincing and felt : the pains are real , the pleasures are real , the human issues which separate them are real .
Compared to “ Watchmen , ” the “ X - Men ” movies are adolescent exercises in adult conversation , and do n’t get me started on the infantile level of “ Star Wars . ” “ Watchmen ” is a film for adult tastes and sensibilities .
Violence as an expression of power is central to the understanding of the movie and the characters .
In an interview , Alan Moore stated , “ And yes , Watchmen came to be about power .
About power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society . ”
The idea of a Nitzschean “ superman ” is perfect for the conception of a superhero .
Similarly , power and the “ superman ” is what “ The Dark Knight ” is about as well .
In that film , power is wielded by criminal gangs , by the police , by Batman , and by the Joker .
Each of them has a different ethic in their use of violence .
The police are deontological , placing the law above all other considerations .
The criminal gangs and corrupt police officers are utilitarians : whatever action benefits them the most is the best action .
Batman operates on virtue theory : the action must be “ right ” because it is intrinsically the right thing to do , whether it is legal ( deontological ) in the eyes of the law or beneficial ( utilitarian ) to him does n’t matter .
The Joker is non-ethical .
He is the supreme nihilist and does n’t even recognize a value system with “ good ” or “ bad ” as descriptors .
Seen from this perspective , societal conflict is a conflict of value systems and force .
“ Watchmen ” is similar to “ The Dark Knight ” in that way .
There are power constituencies ( the military , the police , the heroes , the Russians , etc. ) , all of whom use force in accordance with their ethics .
Moore stated in another interview , “ We tried to set up four or five radically opposing ways of seeing the world and let the readers figure it out for themselves ; let them make a moral decision for once in their miserable lives ! ”
It is important to know that Moore is a self - proclaimed anarchist .
Anarchism as a system of thought is a radical left ideology which is anti-authoritarian .
This is why in Moore ’s “ V for Vendetta ” and in “ Watchmen ” there are characters who wish to recreate a new order by first destroying an existing order , as in the prison riot .
Toward that end , Moore gives us moral “ choices ” on the philosophical use of violence .
Those moral choices are represented by the kind of “ hero ” we identify with .
Rorschach is described as a psychopath , but in fact he is the movie ’s legalist , the deontologist who adheres ruthlessly to the strict letter of the law .
The Comedian is perhaps a hedonist , doing only that which gives him pleasure , though it may not be “ good ” for him .
Nite Owl , like his doppelganger , Batman , is an aretaic ; he wants to do the right thing in any given situation , as does Silk Specter , although that sometimes means crossing the law .
Ozymandias is a utilitarian , willing to sacrifice some to save many .
And Dr. Manhattan is the ultimate existential materialist : he exists in Time , not Space , and sees life itself as matter .
At one point , he argues that a dead body has the same amount of matter as the living one , and he speculates what benefit life is to the universe .
Also , like “ The Dark Knight , ” the movie takes its violence seriously .
Force exists as an ethical statement — punitive , pleasurable , beneficial , destructive — and not as a gratuitous exercise of force for the sake of force .
“ Watchmen ” is a long viewing .
It is sometimes ponderous , grisly , and confusing , but for those who have read the book and have reasonable expectations of what can be done in cinematic form , it is an instant classic — a tour de force which asks universal questions through comic book characters .
For Christians , Dr. Manhattan represents the seeker who questions the existence of God and the meaning of life .
His questions are in part answered in the realization that life is a miracle , “ gold from air , ” unexplained by the processes of nature .
When the movie is over , the character that viewers will be most interested in is Dr. Manhattan and his journey to another galaxy , a journey he would n’t make if he were just interested in matter .

White , the director of the network , said he had calculated that “ the average yearly value to every card used in our system was $ 706 . ”
“ You do n’t get that kind of rebate on the Discover Card , ” Mr. White said .

As in Ms. Weiss ’s case , librarians said they were noticing more adults getting library cards for the first time , or sheepishly explaining that they had lost their cards or even paying long - neglected late fees so they could use the library ’s free Internet service .
Jude Schanzer , the director of programming at the East Meadow Public Library , on Long Island , tells the story of a middle - class woman in her 50s who dropped in late last year after work and applied for a library card .
She confided to a librarian that it was the first library card she had possessed since childhood .
“ Now I do n’t have to buy my books , ” she told Ms. Schanzer .
“ This is how I ’m cutting back . ”
In Ridgefield , an affluent Connecticut town where many residents work at nearby companies like Pepsi , General Electric and I.B.M. , people are tapping the public library ’s free services even if they are financially comfortable enough for now , library officials said .
“ I just think people are hunkering down , ” said Christina Nolan , the library ’s director .
“ They may not have to cut out Netflix , but they ’re choosing to do so because they do n’t know what ’s around the corner . ”
Indeed , as Ms. Nolan spoke , Ann Harrington , a mother of two married to a freelance illustrator whose assignments , she said , were slipping , was carrying a half - dozen DVDs , including “ A Few Good Men ” and “ The Upside of Anger , ” as well as the inspirational football film “ Facing the Giants , ” which her whole family could watch .
Ms. Nolan said attendance was up 20 percent at the library ’s abundant  and free  weekend and weeknight programs , with residents opting for those rather than tickets to Broadway or Lincoln Center or a movie at the multiplex .
Ms. Nolan has shown the Batman movie “ The Dark Knight ” and “ Man on Wire , ” the documentary about the Twin Towers tightrope walker , to packed houses of about 100 people , something she said would not have happened a year ago .

Hillary Clinton ran up massive debts in her run for the presidency
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is offering the chance to spend a day with her husband Bill in exchange for help paying off her campaign debt .
The offer was sent to supporters of Mrs Clinton in an e-mail from her former campaign manager , James Carville .
Mrs Clinton owes $ 2.3 m ( £ 1.5 m ) from her run for the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency last year .
For a $ 5 donation , supporters enter a draw for several prizes including a day with the former US president .
The other prizes are tickets to the season finale of the hit US talent show American Idol and lunch in Washington with Mr Carville - a long - time Democratic strategist .
The day with Mr Clinton involves meeting him in New York and attending " several interesting events " .
" Make a $ 5 contribution today , and you could be on your way to one of these once - in - a - lifetime opportunities ! "
Mr Carville 's e-mail said .
" Your contribution today not only gives you the chance at winning one of these fantastic prizes , it 'll also help our dear friend , Hillary Clinton , pay off the very last of her campaign debt . "
As secretary of state , Mrs Clinton is banned from fund - raising but loyalists such as Mr Carville have stepped into the breach .
Previous appeals have whittled down her debt from a peak of $ 25.2 m to $ 2.3 m , all of which is owed to Mark Penn , a pollster and political strategist .
Mrs Clinton lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama , who named her as secretary of state .
WHEN banks say no , owners of cash - starved small - businesses are n't giving up on finding loans .
Many are turning to microlenders for the money they need to meet the payroll , buy supplies , pay the rent and keep the lights and heat on .
These microlenders — community - based nonprofit lenders that draw on a varying mix of financing from the Small Business Administration ; other federal , state and local government agencies ; and some philanthropies — say small businesses and entrepreneurs are increasingly seeking financing as home equity loans , credit lines and other loans have all but evaporated .
Adding to the pinch , credit card companies are slashing spending limits for many cardholders , including some longtime small - business customers who have relied on their credit lines as a source of ready cash .
Even profitable small businesses that once relied on banks for financing are depending more on microlending , a resource that was originally intended to be a lifeline for women , low - income and minority entrepreneurs .
A POINT OF VIEW
Caught out in a fib to get out of a speeding ticket , do you put your hands up - or dig yourself deeper into a hole of your own making , asks Clive James .
It was n't me at the wheel , honest
In a case which has deep resonance for Britain and the entire civilized world , the whole of Australia has been glued to the media in recent weeks , following the story of an eminent judge who has ruined his reputation because he tried to lie his way out of a speeding fine that would have cost him about £ 36 .
At the age of 70 , he is about to go to jail for a minimum of two years because he failed to cough up 36 quid at the right moment .
On the face of it , you can't call his disaster a tragedy .
A tragedy , according to classical principles , is a fall from high degree because of some great flaw .
Marcus Einfeld , the judge in question , was certainly of high enough degree - none higher .
Queens Counsel since 1977 , Australian Living Treasure 1997 , United Nations Peace Award 2002 , the list goes on .
He retired a few years ago but has continually been brought back to judge important cases about refugees because the Australian legal system can't do without his experience and prestige .
Einfeld , here protesting against mandatory detention , faces jail Or anyway it could n't .
In 2006 a speed camera in Sydney caught his silver Lexus doing 6 mph over the limit .
At this point we have to forget about the dizzy speed of the car and try to slow down the thought processes going on in his head .
There he is , at the top of his profession , with a national , indeed international , reputation for wisdom .
This is the man who was the founding president of Australia 's Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission .
In 1987 he headed the Commission 's enquiry into the living conditions of aborigines in the border area of New South Wales and Queensland , and he wept openly at evidence that a young aboriginal boy who had been denied a proper rugby ball had played instead with an old shoe .
Those were famous tears , and there is every reason to think that they were sincerely felt .
As a judge of great matters of justice , Marcus Einfeld had deservedly been revered for many years .
He had a right to think of himself as the very incarnation of the law .
Now here he was , with a speeding ticket in his hand , facing a fine of a paltry £ 36 for having exceeded the speed limit by a lousy 6 mph .
Right to drive
And right there , the fatal error begins to take form .
It was n't so much the £ 36 fine .
He could afford that .
It was that the penalty points would bring him closer to losing his licence .
Somehow the top judge and national treasure did n't see himself in a position where he was not allowed to drive .
If he had said he lent the car to a secret agent whom he could not name without rendering him vulnerable to attack , Marcus Einfeld might still be enjoying his place at the top of the heap
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View Unusual , that .
Many 70 - year - old men of his exalted rank are very content to be driven , rather than having to do the driving .
They have a man with a cap to drive them , so they can say from the back seat : watch out for the speed cameras , Bruce .
Perhaps Marcus
Einfeld is one of those strange men - there are thousands of them in every country and they are nearly always men - who need to have a driving licence just so that they can get points on it , who think that the whole purpose of driving is to drive as far over the limit as they can and still get away with it , and still keep going for as long as the licence lasts even if they do n't get away with it .
But the judge was only 6 mph over the limit , which scarcely made him a boy racer .
He must have thought the prospect of getting yet more points on an already point - scarred licence was an awful lot of inconvenience for practically nothing , and he must also have thought - and here the other half of the fateful mental pattern comes into play - he must also have thought of how easy it would be to get out of it .
All he had to do was say that someone else was driving the silver Lexus that day .
So he said he had lent the car to an American friend , Professor Theresa Brennan .
Satisfied , the magistrate dismissed the case , and the judge walked free .
In just such a way , King Oedipus believed himself to be in the clear when he left Corinth .
If he - I mean the judge , not King Oedipus - had said that he had lent the car to an Australian government secret agent whom he could not name without rendering him vulnerable to attack by terrorists , Marcus Einfeld might still be enjoying his place at the top of the heap , admired by all .
But Professor Theresa Brennan was an actual figure , who could be traced .
When a newspaper did trace her , it turned out that she was no longer in existence .
At the time of the speeding incident she had already been dead for three years .
The judge is a respected defender of the displaced and downtrodden
It was probably already too late for Marcus Einfeld to save his career .
Yet he might conceivably have climbed relatively unbesmirched out of the hole he was occupying , and even drawn some sympathy for the depth to which he had dug himself in by telling one of those little fibs that almost everyone tells over small matters .
But like President Nixon in the Watergate scandal , the judge , although trying to cover up an infinitely smaller crime - dodging a £ 36 fine instead of okaying acts of black - bag espionage against a rival party in clear defiance of the Constitution of the United States - the judge chose to go on digging himself further towards the centre of the earth .
He said he did n't mean that Theresa Brennan .
He meant another Theresa Brennan .
A Greek chorus at this point might have said that the judge was anything but a natural liar , because he lied so very badly , just like most of us .
We were left with the thought picture of a man of true stature with his life in ruins
Further proofs of his amateur status followed in quick succession .
Finally , in a skein of inventions that we need n't bother to unravel , he managed to implicate his own mother , aged 94 , when he claimed to have been using her Toyota Corolla that day , so he could n't have been at the wheel of his silver Lexus .
Alas , there was security camera footage to prove that his mother 's Toyota Corolla had not emerged from the garage of her apartment block between daylight and dusk .
We were left with the thought picture of a team of trained investigators examining a whole day 's worth of CCTV footage to establish that a Toyota Corolla had remained stationary throughout .
With that thought picture , and with the thought picture of a man of true stature with his life in ruins .
Truth and nothing but Did any of this really matter ?
Well , obviously the original offence did n't matter much .
At 6 mph over the limit , the judge was n't going to hurt anyone .
Six mph he wo n't ever forget
And the first lie should n't have mattered much either .
People really do lie all the time .
Often they lie to protect themselves , sometimes they lie to protect their loved ones , and there is even such a thing as a saving lie , a lie that wards off the dreadful consequences of the truth .
Ibsen wrote a play about that , called The Wild Duck .
None of this means that lying is a virtue .
Almost always , it 's a vice to be avoided .
But it 's a universal vice , and its prevalence is the very reason why any properly functioning legal system has a harsh law against perjury , because a court is where the lies have to stop , or there can be no justice .
And what the judge did was knowingly to put himself on the road to perjury .
He was on the road at only 6 mph over the limit and he could have stopped himself by coughing up 36 quid , but there was an inner momentum .
Just why that should have been so is a question he 'll be occupying himself with for the next two years at least .
Everyone else will be thinking about it too , but his will be easily the finest mind concerned with the subject .
He does n't need me or anyone else to tell him that a judge who commits perjury , over no matter how trivial a matter , has sinned against the spirit of his profession .
That 's why his case really is a tragedy , and not just a farce .
It 's a tragedy because he not only fell from high degree , there really was a tragic flaw : a capacity to forget , at the critical moment , the central ethical precept of the calling to which he had given his life .
Suddenly , belatedly , and for almost no reason , he put himself in the position of a doctor who is arraigned for selling body parts , and , because he was selling only fingernails , defends himself by saying it had n't been him that sold the fingernails , it was Professor Theresa Brennan , or another Theresa Brennan , or his mother at the wheel of a Toyota Corolla .
The doctor was n't supposed to be selling anything , so he should have owned up .
The tragic climax came when the distinguished Judge Marcus Einfeld found himself on the telephone to his mother
But the judge does n't need to hear that from me , or from any other of the thousands of Australian experts - editorial writers , television commentators and philosophers of all descriptions - who are now picking this matter over .
The judge is already hearing about it from himself .
He 's hearing about the fatal road that led from the speed camera to the truly tragic climax , which was n't the moment when one of his fellow judges had to send him down for three years , two of them without parole .
The tragic climax came when the distinguished Judge Marcus Einfeld found himself on the telephone to his mother saying : " Mum , remember how you lent me your Toyota that day ? " and she said " Marcus , what have you got yourself into ? "
And suddenly he was a little boy again , as all men are when the truth they must face is about a mess of their own making .
Here is a selection of your comments .
A modern day Aesops fable , a chicken licken tale of epic proportions .
An appalling judgement of error from someone well educated at the top of his profession , does it undermine his life 's work , personally I think it does .
Rob Mck , Manchester UK
' At 6 mph over the limit , the judge was n't going to hurt anyone . '
Not so , a 6 mph difference in speed can easily be the difference between killing a pedestrian and them surviving .

Been there - done that .
Is there an invisible demon that runs around gleefully handing out the shovel ?
The same demon that eggs us on and on even when we know from the very start that all is lost .
Takes us past the point when that small boy deep inside every man begs , we shovel away deeper and deeper we go until the bed - rock of truth brings us to a halt .
Sometimes even then I 've been known to clang away at the rock in futile hope of escape .
It is a tragedy ; but I do draw a nugget of comfort from the fact that in one small way I am the same as those whose minds normally function on a plane many miles above mine .
In the case of shovels are all men truly equal ?
Bob Colwell , Rhos on Sea , Conwy I try to avoid lying , all the more so as I get older .
I 'm useless at it and the lies ( even the white ones ) usually eventually turn around and bite me on the bum .
How many sleepless nights did the judge have as things began to unravel ?
How many times will he say to himself " If only " ?
The greatest irony is that his punishment does n't always fit the crime .
Well at least he can console himself that he is no different from the rest of us .
We 've all been there .
We Are All The Same , Manchester I find it really hard to believe the outcome of what was a relatively minor error on behalf of the judge .
The whole process was a waste of public time and money .
The case should have been dismissed right out at the beginning .
A rap on the knuckles might have done the trick .
A case of disproportion if ever I heard one .
Jennifer South , Rotherham , England I feel very sorry for the man and find the punishment very harsh .
On the other hand , this verdict highlights the honesty of the Australian justice system .
I cannot think of any other country where this may have happened .
Bravo Australia .
Was I a judge , however , I should have been tempted to give a suspended sentence in view of his formidably constructive past and the laughably small speeding excess .
Jean - Francois , Hafnarfjordur Iceland
Such a fine example of one of those who presume to lord over us and tell us all what to do and how to live our lives , yet somehow imagining that they do n't have to comply with the same rules .
One thinks of MPs and their expenses , bankers and the old socialist eastern bloc heads of state and high government officials with their dachas in the forest .
And this is especially significant coming from someone whose moral fibre was supposed to be unquestionable .
Lets face it though - he was hung by the surveillance society - speed cameras and fixed community cameras pointing somewhere near his mothers house .
The ability to hide anything from the authorities ( including normal everyday activities ) is much diminished these days .
And even if you 're not hiding anything - they still have you in their sights .

Viz to publish new manga from Shonen Sunday 's 50th anniversary in 2009
This year 's 16th issue of Shogakukan 's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine has confirmed on Wednesday that celebrated manga creator Rumiko Takahashi will launch her newest series in the magazine on April 22 .
Viz Media already announced that it will publish this manga in North America this year .
The magazine had first revealed Takahashi's new series last month ; she had ended her last work , Inuyasha , in the same magazine last June .
Takahashi's earlier works include Urusei Yatsura , Maison Ikkoku , Ranma 1/2 , One - Pound Gospel , and Rumic Theater .
Viz Media has been releasing most of Takahashi's manga in North America , and it has also released many of their anime adaptations .
The same 16th issue of Shonen Sunday celebrates the magazine 's 50th anniversary , which happens to fall on Tuesday .
For this special occasion , Takahashi collaborated with another famous Shonen Sunday creator , Mitsuru Adachi ( Touch , H2 , Cross Game , Miyuki ) , on a 30 - page one - shot manga called " My Sweet Sunday . "
The issue also offers a DVD with trailers for the Urusei Yatsura , Ranma 1/2 , and Inuyasha special anime shorts that were created for last year 's " It 's a Rumic World " exhibition .
A bundled " Sunday 50th anniversary memorial big poster " features sketches and other tributes from 51 manga creators .
( The poster reproduces the sketches from the " 50th Anniversary Flag " that Shogakukan displayed at last month 's Jisedai World Hobby Fair . )

[ From Planning for Freedom .
Originally published in Farmand , February 17 , 1951 , Oslo , Norway .
An MP3 audio file of this article , read by Floy Lilley , is available for download . ]
The outlook of many eminent champions of genuine liberalism is rather pessimistic today .
As they see it , the vitriolic slogans of the socialists and interventionists call forth a better response from the masses than the cool reasoning of judicious men .
The majority of the voters are just dull and mentally inert people who dislike thinking and are easily deceived by the enticing promises of irresponsible pied pipers .
Subconscious inferiority complexes and envy push people toward the parties of the Left .
They rejoice in the policies of confiscating the greater part of the income and wealth of successful businessmen without grasping the fact that these policies harm their own material interests .
Disregarding all the objections raised by economists , they firmly believe that they can get many good things for nothing .
Even in the United States , people — although enjoying the highest standard of living ever attained in history — are prepared to condemn capitalism as a vile economy of scarcity and to indulge in daydreams about an economy of abundance in which everybody will get everything " according to his needs . "
The case for freedom and material prosperity is hopeless .
The future belongs to the demagogues who know nothing else than to dissipate the capital accumulated by previous generations .
Mankind is plunging into a return to the Dark Ages .
Western civilization is doomed .
The main error of this widespread pessimism is the belief that the destructionist ideas and policies of our age sprang from the proletarians and are a " revolt of the masses . "
In fact , the masses — precisely because they are not creative and do not develop philosophies of their own — follow the leaders .
The ideologies which produced all the mischief and catastrophes of our century are not an achievement of the mob .
They are the feat of pseudoscholars and pseudointellectuals .
They were propagated from the chairs of universities and from the pulpit , they were disseminated by the press , by novels and plays and by the movies and the radio .
The intellectuals converted the masses to socialism and interventionism .
These ideologies owe the power they have today to the fact that all means of communication have been turned over to their supporters and almost all dissenters have been virtually silenced .
What is needed to turn the flood is to change the mentality of the intellectuals .
Then the masses will follow suit .
Furthermore , it is not true that the ideas of genuine liberalism are too complicated to appeal to the untutored mind of the average voter .
It is not a hopeless task to explain to the wage earners that the only means to raise wage rates for all those eager to find jobs and to earn wages is to increase the per -head quota of capital invested .
The pessimists underrate the mental abilities of the " common man " when they assert that he cannot grasp the disastrous consequences of policies resulting in capital decumulation .
Why do all " underdeveloped countries " ask for American aid and American capital ?
Why do they not rather expect aid from socialist Russia ?
The acme of the policies of all self - styled progressive parties and governments is to raise artificially the prices of vital commodities above the height they would have attained on the markets of unhampered laissez - faire capitalism .
Only an infinitesimal fraction of the American people is interested in the preservation of a high price for sugar .
The immense majority of the American voters are buyers and consumers , not producers and sellers , of sugar .
Nonetheless the American government is firmly committed to a policy of high sugar prices by rigorously restricting both the importation of sugar from abroad and domestic production .
Similar policies are adopted with regard to the prices of bread , meat , butter , eggs , potatoes , cotton , and many other agricultural products .
It is a serious blunder to call this procedure indiscriminately a profarmers policy .
Less than one fifth of the United States ' total population is dependent upon agriculture for a living .
Yet the interests of these people with regard to the prices of various agricultural products are not identical .
The dairyman is not interested in a high , but in a low price for wheat , fodder , sugar and cotton .
The owners of chicken farms are hurt by high prices of any agricultural product but chickens and eggs .
It is obvious that the growers of cotton , grapes , oranges , apples , grapefruit , and cranberries are prejudiced by a system which raises the prices of staple foods .
Most of the items of the so - called profarm policy favor only a minority of the total farming population at the expense of the majority , not only of the nonfarming but also of the farming population .
Things are hardly different in other fields .
When the railroadmen or the workers of the building trades , supported by laws and administrative practises which are admittedly loaded against their employers , indulge in feather - bedding and other devices allegedly destined to " create more jobs , " they are unfairly fleecing the immense majority of their fellow citizens .
The unions of the printers enhance the prices of books and periodicals and thus affect all people eager to read and to learn .
The so - called prolabor policies bring about a state of affairs under which each group of wage earners is intent upon improving their own conditions at the expense of the consumers , viz. , the enormous majority .
Nobody knows today whether he wins more from those policies which are favoring the group to which he himself belongs than he loses on account of the policies which favor all the other groups .
But it is certain that all are adversely affected by the general drop in the productivity of industrial effort and output which these allegedly beneficial policies inevitably bring about .
Until a few years ago , the advocates of these unsuitable policies tried to defend them by pointing out that their incidence reduces only the wealth and income of the rich and benefits the masses at the sole expense of useless parasites .
There is no need to explode the fallacies of this reasoning .
Even if we admit its conclusiveness for the sake of argument , we must realize that , with the exception of a few countries , this " surplus " fund of the rich has already been exhausted .
Even Mr. Hugh Gaitskell , Sir Stafford Cripps 's successor as the Fuhrer of Great Britain 's economy , could not help declaring that " there is not enough money to take away from England 's rich to raise standards of living any further . "
In the United States the policy of " soaking the rich " has not yet gone so far as that .
But if the trend of American politics is not entirely reversed very soon , this richest of all countries will have to face the same situation in a few years .
Conditions being such , the prospects for a genuinely liberal revival may appear propitious .
At least fifty percent of the voters are women , most of them housewives or prospective housewives .
To the common sense of these women a program of low prices will make a strong appeal .
They will certainly cast their ballot for candidates who proclaim , " Do away peremptorily with all policies and measures destined to enhance prices above the height of the unhampered market !
Do away with all this dismal stuff of price supports , parity prices , tariffs and quotas , intergovernmental commodity - control agreements , and so on !
Abstain from increasing the quantity of money in circulation and from credit expansion , from all illusory attempts to lower the rate of interest and from deficit spending !
What we want is low prices . "
In the end these judicious householders will even succeed in convincing their husbands .
In the Communist Manifesto , Karl Marx and Frederick Engels asserted , " The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which capitalism batters down all Chinese walls . "
We may hope that these cheap prices will also batter down the highest of all Chinese walls , viz. , those erected by the folly of bad economic policies .
To express such hopes is not merely wishful thinking .
D uring the Great Depression of the 1930s , two of the world 's most " successful " economies were those of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany .
In hindsight , this sounds perverse – even obscene .
But at the time , political leaders from around the world watched the Italian and German economic experiments and , in many cases , lauded them .
During a 1937 visit to Germany , Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King noted in his diary how impressed he was by Adolf Hitler 's labour policies .
In the U.S. , as German cultural historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch recounts in his book Three New Deals , then president Franklin Roosevelt pronounced himself " deeply impressed by what ( Italian dictator Benito Mussolini ) has accomplished ... "
King and Roosevelt made these comments not because they favoured Hitler 's murderous anti-Semitism or Mussolini 's brutal blackshirt tactics .
Rather they were intrigued by the combination of authoritarianism and capitalism that the two dictators used to reduce unemployment and revive their respective economies .
Both Hitler and Mussolini spent massive amounts of government funds on public works and rearmament .
At the same time , their bans on independent trade unions ensured that workers would n't interfere with any recovery by demanding higher wages – an example of labour - management co-operation that appealed particularly to King .
Even more important than the praise of foreign leaders , however , was the fact that many , if not most , Germans and Italians liked what their dictators were doing .
The reason is fairly simple .
With the notable exceptions of Jews , Communists , social democrats , liberals , Roma , gays , dissident pastors and anyone with a shred of conscience – most Germans and Italians were materially better off than they had been .
All of this is worth keeping in mind today as the world heads into what many economists believe will be the worst slump since the 1930s .
Because the Great Depression teaches us two things .
First , capitalism does n't need liberalism or even democracy to be successful .
In fact , in the '30s , many came to the not illogical conclusion that an authoritarian market economy could provide a higher standard of living .
Second , in times of stress , people are susceptible .
They want strong leaders and fear outsiders .
They are desperate to hold on to what they have and anxious to find scapegoats .
A version of this kind of right - wing populism aimed at Muslims swept the U.S. , and to a lesser extent Canada , after the terror attacks of 9/11 .
An economic version is waiting in the wings today .
The signs are there .
In the U.S. , right - wing radio host Rush Limbaugh is treated by much of the media as a fool .
His rantings against President Barack Obama are deemed so beyond the pale that even Canadian - born , conservative ideologue David Frum has weighed in against him .
Yet Limbaugh is still avidly listened to by an estimated 20 million Americans each week , far more than read Frum 's learned treatises .
What 's more , Limbaugh 's message of anger and resentment resonates .
Many Americans are increasingly turning their rage against migrant Mexican workers believed to be stealing jobs .
That 's a Rush Limbaugh issue that 's now raised by even Hispanic members of the U.S. Congress .
As the economy worsens , the message of right - wing populism will almost surely resonate more .
In Europe , there are similar rumblings .
British workers have protested against Italian and Portuguese labourers imported to do local jobs .
While insisting that it is maintaining its open - door policy to other European Union members , the government there has quietly made it harder for non-EU immigrants to get work visas .
In France , the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy has persuaded carmaker Renault – in exchange for government aid – to move some of its auto production from Slovenia to Paris .
Sarkozy insists the move wo n't cost Slovenia any jobs .
But the decision has unnerved Eastern Europe 's low - wage countries that , until recently , were big fans of global trade .

Indeed , the recession has already brought political instability to Eastern Europe .
With export markets drying up and their currencies foundering , Hungary and Ukraine face bankruptcy .
Bulgaria and Lithuania have been hit by protests .
On Tuesday , the Czech government fell .
Meanwhile , the promises of those advocating the more liberal version of capitalism have proven remarkably hollow .
In the fall , leaders of the world 's 20 main economies , the so - called G - 20 , promised not to raise any new trade barriers – even those permitted under international treaties .
Yet since then , almost all of these countries have broken this vow .
The U.S. was the most flagrant with its Buy America provisions imbedded in President Barack Obama 's stimulus package .
But the World Bank calculates that at least 16 other members of the G - 20 , including Canada , have introduced similar trade - restrictions measures since November .
The international body targets Canada 's decision to subsidize North American auto plants in this country as one such measure that has caused distortions in the international trading economy .
None of which is to say that fascism is just around the corner .
History rarely repeats itself in such an obvious manner .
Indeed , the modern version of authoritarian capitalism , Chinese capitalism , is neither racist nor ( for the time being at least ) imperialist .
Besides , if governments are willing to admit the failings of the market economy , there are ways to deal with this slump that do not require dictatorship .
But simplistic and dangerous ideas do exist out there .
And if , as former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge suggested this week , the crisis continues for several years , and if governments can provide nothing more than ineffective market nostrums , these dangerous ideas will gain popular appeal .
That 's the part of history that does repeat itself .

America : Leading the way again
February 5 , 2009 by lestro
by lestro
Seems like for so long now , the rest of the world has looked down its nose and disregarded the US .
It ’s probably been only about five or six years , but it feels longer .
Anyway , today we get another sign that the rest of the world may again start taking its cues from the US .
Just one day after President Obama attacked Wall Street for giving out huge bonuses to the people who drove their companies into the ground after taking bailout money from the government and then he set caps on the salaries ( still more than 10 times the national average salary ) for people in firms getting our money , other world leaders are jumping on the bandwagon as well :
President Nicolas Sarkozy blistered financial traders and ruled out bonuses for managers of banks bailed out by state funds as he sought Thursday to reassure a nation still jittery following nationwide strikes sparked by the global economic crisis … .
Sarkozy sternly announced that there would be no bonuses in 2009 at banks that had received state aid .
He also said he would consider a cap on salaries for top managers of companies that received public funds but was skeptical about making it a hard - fast rule .
Why did he do it ?
He called on a joint European response to the crisis , which he said he had discussed in a recent telephone conversation with President Barack Obama .
” I told him that I feel an ally of the United States , but one country cannot lead the world . ”
I ’ll admit it : it ’s nice to be the Top Dog again .

U.S. Unemployment Government Statistics Hiding the Dismal Truth
Don Miller writes :
The dismal U.S. unemployment numbers have gotten more airtime recently than Jerry Springer .
And why not ?
The numbers are mind - numbing .
A total of 2.6 million jobs lost in 2008 – the most since World War II .
A jobless rate that 's at 7.2 % – and climbing .
About 11 million people out of work .
As usual , however , the “ official ” numbers do n't tell the entire story .
“ People say that they know how bad the economy is .
But they do n't know how it feels to have the reality hit home , ” said Stu Schweitzer , global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 's Private Bank ( JPM ) .
“ It 's not the facts — it 's how the facts feel .
And it feels terrible to have so many Americans losing jobs , and so many more likely to follow in the coming months . ”
As it did last week with the government 's inflation statistics , Money Morning will now take an in - depth look at how the U.S. jobless situation may be a lot worse than the U.S. government statistics appear to show .
And “ how it feels ” comes home to roost with a behind - the - scenes look at the dramatic impact those horrific numbers have on the lives of just a few people caught in the crossfire .
Government Unemployment Numbers — Not What They Seem
The official government estimates of the current unemployment problem are staggering in their own right .
791,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in 2008 , hitting the auto sector hardest .
260,110 people lost jobs in the financial sector , part of the overall service sector that accounts for some 80 % of all employment .
The construction sector shed 899,000 since peaking in September 2006 .
The retail sector shed 522,000 jobs for all of 2008 .
All told , 2.6 million people lost their jobs in 2008 .
And , to underscore the accelerating nature of the problem , more than half of those job losses occurred in the final four months of the year .
In December , a total of 11.1 million were unemployed .
An additional 8 million people were working part time – up sharply from 7.3 million in November .
The average workweek in December fell to 33.3 hours .
That 's the lowest average on record , dating back to 1964 , and a sign of more job reductions to come since businesses often cut hours before eliminating positions entirely .
Those are the “ official ” government numbers .
But , as a closer look demonstrates , the unemployment figures can be understated – and misleading .
The government actually compiles unemployment figures in six different categories ; as you might expect , the numbers tend to minimize the bad news .
The most commonly number quoted in the media is the “ official ” unemployment rate – known as U3 ( the bottom line of the three in the chart below ) – which now stands at 7.2 % .
But to get the real picture , you have to add both in what the government refers to as “ discouraged ” workers ( U4 ) and “ marginally attached ” workers ( U5 ) – those who have stopped looking for work , or who have n't looked for work recently ( represented by the middle line of the three in the chart ) .
That number ( U6 ) depicts an unemployment rate t that 's approaching an eye - popping 14 % .
And it gets worse .
If you include the people that the government does n't even count – such as unemployed farm workers , the idle self - employed , and workers in private homes – the unemployment rate approaches an astonishing 18 % ( top line ) .
In other words , unemployment has insidiously spread to almost one - fifth of the U.S. work force , a number much larger than the single - digit figure commonly bandied about in the press .
If you regard unemployment statistics as an important means of gauging the overall health of a given economy , these “ enhanced ” statistics paint an ugly picture of just how painful this financial slump has become for the U.S. economy .
Layoffs of this magnitude are more than a mere shot across the bow of the economy ; they 're actually a direct hit amid ship – below the water line , meaning that sinking is inevitable .
Fully 70 % of all domestic economic activity is powered by consumer spending .
People who are unemployed cannot buy homes , do n't shop heavily in retail stores , cut back on groceries , and are loath to take on added risk .
The numbers alone are bad enough .
But in America 's heartland , many of the approximately 80 % of workers thatarestill working are caught in the grip of unemployment vise as well .
No Runs , No Hits , Many Errors
Not only are record numbers of Americans suffering without jobs – they can't even tell their troubles to a human being anymore .
Most now have to navigate hard - to - use electronic systems , faceless entities that are ill - prepared to help so many people file for much - needed unemployment benefits .
With about 4.5 million Americans collecting jobless benefits , state government web sites and phone systems used to file for benefits are being overwhelmed by sheer numbers .
Electronic unemployment filing systems have crashed in at least three states amid an unprecedented crush of thousands of newly jobless Americans seeking benefits .
Other states are adjusting their systems to avoid being next , The Associated Press reported .
Systems in New York , North Carolina and Ohio were shut down completely in early January by heavy volume and technical glitches .
Labor officials in several other states are reporting higher - than - normal use .
And even some of the systems that are holding up under the strain are leaving filers on the line for hours before asking them to leave a message .
Still others are giving them the ultimate slap in the face : “ We 're sorry , all circuits are busy . ”
“ Regardless of when you call , be prepared to wait and just hang on .
Try not to get frustrated , ” Howard Cosgrove , a spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development , told The AP .
To stabilize a phone system that has been overloaded for weeks , his agency boosted its staffing of telephone operators by 25 % last month .
“ We sympathize , we 're on their side , we 're doing our best to help them out , ” he said .
Job Losses Gets Personal for Truckers
Depending on your geographic location , you might not notice when an automobile plant closes – but truckers do .
Any business closing – and the resulting layoffs – represents another loss of steady work for truckers , who are responsible for the movement of about 60 % of the nation 's freight , including food and hard goods .
As many as 785 trucking companies with a combined fleet of 39,000 trucks went out of business in the third quarter of last year .
Overall , more than 127,000 trucks , or 6.5 % of the industry were idled in 2008 , Donald Broughton , trucking analyst and managing director of Avondale Partners , told The Los Angeles Times .
That means tens of thousands of drivers previously on company payrolls are now competing with the nation 's independent owner - operators for a piece of a fast - shrinking cargo pie .
Joe Rini , from Grand River , Ohio , recently bid $ 3,400 to haul a load of building materials to the Pacific Northwest for one of his best customers .
Usually , the load would pay $ 4,400 , but with possible competitors in mind , Rini lowered his bid and got the contract .
Still , before he could pick it up , another trucker low - balled him with a bid of $ 3,000 .
Rini declined to match .
“ I did n't want to bid that low in the first place , ” he told The Times .
“ I start down that road and I 'm out of business . ”
Elsewhere , fleet operators who so far have managed to survive are putting increasing pressure on their sales force to maintain revenues .
Despite being in the hauling business since the 1860s , Ventura Transfer Co . of Long Beach , Calif . is feeling the squeeze .
“ Gone are the days where you can own a trucking fleet and just rely on the demand of the marketplace , ” said Brian Olsen , Ventura Transfer 's chief executive officer .
California Dreamin' No More
Even though he's had no trouble so far staying gainfully employed in California , Mike Reilly , a 38 - year - old engineering contractor , is leaving his home state 's lemon groves and beaches for the foothills of Denver .
California has often been called the “ promised land ” since the days of the Gold Rush .
But in 2008 , many families gave up their California dream and headed elsewhere .
With an unemployment rate of 8.4 % in November , and a record 236,000 foreclosures on the books in 2008 , the Golden State has lost some of its allure .
Barry Hartz lived in California for 60 years before moving close to his son's family in Colorado Springs .
Despite recent price declines from a glut of foreclosures hitting the market , he laments the escalation of home prices in the early 2000's , “ to the point our kids … could not live in the community where they grew up . ”
The number of people leaving California outnumbered those moving in by a net total of 144,000 in the first six months of 2008 – more than any other state , the Associated Press reported .
For the first time ever the state could lose a congressional seat .
With the state facing a $ 42 billion budget deficit , further tax increases and education cuts were the last straw for Reilly , the engineer .
“ You see wages go down and the cost of living go up , ” he said .
Years of rising taxes , unchecked illegal immigration and bumper - to - bumper traffic have convinced him to move on .
What 's Next …
Overall , 48 % of all companies downsized in 2008 , and a staggering 60 % are planning reductions in 2009 , according to a Society of Human Resource Management survey .
Economists predict a net total of 1.5 million to 2 million or more jobs will vanish in 2009 , and the “ official ” unemployment rate could hit 9 % or 10 % , underscoring the challenges that new U.S. President Barack Obama will face and the tough road ahead for job seekers .
Obama has called the jobs losses “ a stark reminder of how urgently action is needed ” to revive the nation 's staggering economy .
His administration is planning a stimulus package costing upwards of $ 800 billion , consisting of tax cuts and other ways to try to help individuals and businesses .
But unemployment is feeding into a vicious cycle that Washington policymakers are finding difficult to break .
The jobless are now forcing almost all U.S. consumers – employed or not – to retrench for an uncertain future .

There was a great comedy piece a few years back ( whose origin escapes us ) that gave examples of how the English would use their language when speaking to a non-native speaker to imply the precise opposite of what was actually being understood .
This allowed the English to feel superior without actually damaging international relations .
One example was the phrase “ with all due respect ” which is generally understood to imply that the speaker has a great deal of respect for their counterpart , while the speaker is actually implying that they have no respect in the slightest for their interlocutor .
The respect due being precisely zero .
This thought occurred to us when a few of us opened our email this week to see a draft ad being sent around by the Cato Institute ( i.e. Pat Michaels ) looking for signatories prior to being published in “ major US newspapers ” sometime soon :
There are a number of amusing details here .
While we are curious about the credentials of “ Dr. N. Here ” , we certainly understand why they are looking for a little more variety on the list .
More surprising ( and somewhat ironically ) the mailing list for signature requests includes a number of scientists who do n’t agree with these sentiments at all .
It ’s as if Michaels and Cato actually believe that these various lists of “ dissenting ” scientists are accurate reflections of support for their agenda .
They appear to be have been conned by their own disinformation .
As an exercise for our readers , perhaps people would like to speculate on who is going to end up on the published list ?
( If indeed it gets published ) .
Ginger Spice would be likely on past form , but they might improve the screening this time around …
But most amusing are the footnotes that they use to bolster their case .
There are four : the brand new Swanson and Tsonis ( GRL , 2009 ) , Brohan et al ( JGR , 2006 ) ( which is there to provide a link to the HadCRU temperature data ) , Pielke et al ( BAMS , 2005 ) , and the oft - derided Douglass et al ( IJoC , 2008 ) .
Of these papers , not one has the evidence to support the statements attributed to them in the main text .
To wit :
Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now .
1,2
Well , the first part of the statement is exactly what you expect with a modest long - term trend in the presence of internal variability and is not controversial in the least .
The “ global warming stopped ” meme is particularly lame since it relies on both a feigned ignorance of the statistics of short periods and being careful about which data set you use .
It also requires cherry - picking the start year , had the period been “ exactly a decade ” or 12 years then all the trends are positive .
The use of the recent Swanson and Tsonis paper is simply opportunism .
Those authors specifically state that their results are not in any way contradictory with the idea of a long term global warming trend .
Instead they are attempting to characterise the internal variability that everyone knows exists .
After controlling for population growth and property values , there has been no increase in damages from severe weather - related events .
3
This references a short comment in BAMS that did n’t present any original research .
The latest figures show that weather - related damages have increased markedly , though whether there is a climate change component is hard to tease out given the large increases in vulnerable infrastructure and relatively poor data .
The actual statement that a clear global warming - related trend in damages has n’t been clearly demonstrated does n’t imply that you can state definitively that there is no effect .
There might be one ( or not ) , but formal attribution is hard .
However , whatever the attribution ends up being , pointing out that there are other problems in the world does n’t imply that anthropogenic climate change is not worth worrying about .
One might as well state that since knee injuries on ski-slopes have increased over time one should n’t support flu shots .
The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior .

‘ Abjectly ’ ?
Very strange choice of word ….
and an even stranger choice of reference .
This is of course the same Douglass et al paper that used completely incoherent statistics and deliberately failed to note the structural uncertainty in the observations .
Unsurprisingly , Michaels does not reference the rather comprehensive demolition of the Douglass methodology published by Santer et al ( 2008 ) ( and on which one of us was a co-author ) .
More fundamentally however , the current temperatures are still within the spread of the models even if you cherry pick your start date .
No -one expects the real world ( a single realization ) to follow the mean forced trend at all times .
How is that a failure , abject or otherwise ?
More interestingly is what is not cited .
President Obama ’s statement “ The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear ” , ca n’t possibly refer to every issue in science or every potential fact .
Instead he is likely referring to the basic and pretty much uncontested facts that i) CO 2 and other greenhouse gases have increased due to human activity .
CO 2 emissions in particular continue to increase at a rapid rate ; ii ) the effect of these gases is to warm the climate and it is very likely that most of the warming over the last 50 years was in fact driven by these increases ; and iii ) the sensitivity of the climate is very likely large enough that serious consequences can be expected if carbon emissions continue on this path .
We would be astonished if Michaels disputed this since he is on record as agreeing that the IPCC climate sensitivity range is likely to be correct and has never questioned the human contribution to CO2 and other GHG increases .
He and his colleagues have even done analyses that show that after correcting for ENSO effects , there is no sign of a slowdown in global warming at all .
Instead this is a classic red-herring : Ignore the facts you do n’t dispute , pick some others that are ambiguous and imply that , because they are subject to some debate , we therefore know nothing .
Michaels ( and Cato ) presumably thinks this kind of nonsense is politically useful and he may be correct .
But should he claim it is scientifically defensible , we would have to answer :
“ With all due respect , Dr. Michaels , that is not true . ”
Apparently 175 mph is n't fast enough for people in Japan , where rail companies are pouring money into a magnetic levitation train that will streak across the countryside at more than 310 mph .
Here in the U.S. , the clickety - clack of Amtrak is the standard for rail and a proposed high - speed line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco would make the trip in about 2.5 hours .
The system Japan is developing would cover that distance in an hour , which shows how far behind we are .
The maglev train is n't expected to go into service until 2025 , so in the meantime there 's a plan to roll out a faster , sleeker version of the wildly successful Shinkansen bullet train .
The new Shinkansen , called the E - 5 Series and shown above , will hit the rails in 2011 .
It is based on the Fastech 360 prototype that JR East has been working on since 2002 , and the company says it will do nearly 200 mph and offer greater comfort thanks to improved car - tilting and suspension mechanisms .
Each E - 5 will feature an 18 seat " Super Green Car " that JR East touts as something akin to a first class cabin on steroids .
But the E - 5 is just the beginning .
JR Tokai , another Japanese rail operator , is moving forward with plans for a maglev train that will make the run from Tokyo to Nagoya at more than 310 miles per hour , cutting the travel time from 90 minutes to just 40 .
It 's huge news because it marks Japan 's first commercial deployment of high - speed maglev technology , which uses superconducting magnets to power and guide trains that " float " over the track .
Maglev research has been ongoing for years and there are several demonstration and test systems around the world .
but the only system in regular service is one that connects Shanghai and Pudong airport The Shanghai Maglev Train linking downtown Shanghai with Pudong airport opened in 2002 .
Japan launched the first urban maglev system three years later in Aichi ; the system spans 5.5 miles and includes nine stations .
It has a top speed of 62 mph .
The new train wo n't come cheap – sources in Japan put the cost of building the 168 mile Tokyo - Nagoya maglev line at $ 76 billion .
Some question whether it's wise to spend that kind of money in a country where the rail network is already good , but as the Los Angeles Times points out , the Japanese do n't think it 's enough for the trains to run on time .
They 've got to set records doing it .
Trains , the Times notes , are more than transportation in Japan ; they 're a measure of the country 's prosperity and technological prowess .
Japan 's maglev will be fast , but it wo n't be a record breaker , technically speaking .
That distinction goes to France's
TGV ( train à grande vitesse ) , which reached 357.2 mph during a 2007 speed trial , is the world 's fastest wheeled train , while a JR - Maglev test train running on a demonstration line in Yamanashi prefecture has done 367 mph .
Still , 300 mph is nothing to complain about .
If such a train were built in California , commuters could make the trip between San Francisco and LA in an hour .
For some of us , that 's less time than it takes to get to the airport .

The clear blue skies and the snow on the White House lawn would have been a perfect backdrop for a Rose Garden press conference .
That would have set off Gordon Brown 's budding relationship with the world 's favourite president and scotched the ugly rumours that the " special relationship " was experiencing a rough patch .
But it was n't to be .
Instead there were knots on the brows of British diplomats as the Prime Minister 's motorcade pulled up at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
They must have yearned for the two leaders to come strolling out to face the microphones , for the new President , to crack his trillion megawatt smile in Gordon Brown 's direction , sealing the first European leader 's visit to the Obama White House in the public imagination .
But overnight , the press conference had been cancelled and it fell to the familiar British practice of blaming the snowy weather .
The notion that President Obama , who recently endured an inauguration ceremony in sub-zero temperatures , was put off making an outdoor appearance because of a little snow was laughable .
Mr Obama had only recently called on Washingtonians to show some " flinty Chicago toughness " in the face of blizzards .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Instead of the hoped - for podium to podium event , the two men put on an unconvincing show of friendship sitting stiffly side by side before an unlit fire in the Oval Office , taking a handful of questions , an event known in the parlance of the West Wing as " a spray " or mini-press conference .
The two leaders wore virtually identical attire for the occasion – pale blue ties , dark navy suits , black shoes and white shirts .
An American journalist asked about the President 's alleged secret letter to the Kremlin over plans for a missile shield .
The President spent what must have seemed to Mr Brown like an eternity discussing Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Then it was back to the business in hand as a British journalist helpfully asked whether US - British ties had sunk to a mere partnership , instead of the more treasured " special relationship " .
Mr Obama complied with expectations , offering a lengthy if sometimes hesitant , response about the importance of the relationship to Americans and to him personally .
" My mother 's side of the family came from the UK , " he noted to relieved laughter from the Prime Minister .
Nobody was rude enough to ask about the bust of Winston Churchill recently returned to the British Embassy , which had once occupied a cherished spot inside the Oval Office after Tony Blair loaned it to George Bush shortly after the September 11 attacks of 2001 .
It 's not surprising that Mr Obama did n't want Churchill looking over his shoulder as it was Churchill who ordered the crackdown on the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya in 1952 , a time when Mr Obama 's grandfather Hussein Onyango Obama was labelled a subversive and thrown into detention .
Staying carefully on message Mr Obama added that " Great Britain is one of our closest and strongest allies and there is a link and bond there that will not break . "
The tactile US President stopped himself just short of touching Mr Brown on the arm at one point , and instead let his fingers hover an inch or two above the PM 's sleeve .
An evidently relieved Prime Minister responded by thanking " Barack " for his warm words .
It may , as Mr Obama noted , have been their third meeting , but the President addressed his remarks throughout to " Prime Minister Brown " until close to the end of the " spray " when it was briefly " Gordon " .
Mr Brown later offered to take on the younger man at tennis , rather than basketball but if that was meant to be a cue for an invitation to Camp David , it did not happen , although the President had evidently heard of Mr Brown 's skills with the racket .
Meanwhile , across town , at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , quite a different drama was unfolding as Mr Brown 's predecessor , once the darling of the Bush White House , held forth in his inimitable way about the need to grapple with climate change .
Tony Blair was addressing a packed room of senators , congressmen and US business leaders before a battery of no less than 14 television cameras .
Mr Blair 's appearance in Washington on the very day of the Prime Minister 's summit with Mr Obama could n't be helped , even though it can't have been helpful .
His presence only drew attention to the US President 's less than fulsome embrace of Mr Brown , despite his carefully rehearsed bromides about the enduring strength of the " special relationship " .
Like most programmers , I take a secret pleasure from using threads in my projects .
Oh , I know minor oversights can introduce deadlocks which will wreck hard - to - diagnose havoc , but let 's face it , threads are the gateway to delirious daydreams about how effectively your new script utilizes multiple cores ... or would utilize them , if anyone was actually using it .
Fortunately for those of us seeking that misguided high , Python makes putting together a sane thread pool quick and easy .
All you need is the standard library modules Queue and threading .
1. Queue .
Queue is a thread - safe queue , and threading .
Thread provides a simple interface for creating threads .
Let 's look at an example of safely using threads in Python .
Processing a CSV File with Threadpool
This script will walk through a comma-separated - values file and use a thread pool to process the received data .
from __future__ import with_statement from time import sleep from csv import DictReader from Queue import Queue from threading import Thread q = Queue ( ) workers = [ ] def worker ( ) : while True : line = q . get ( ) print " processing : %s
" % line q . task_done ( ) for i in range ( 10 ) : t = Thread ( target = worker ) t .
setDaemon ( True ) workers .
append ( t ) t . start ( ) with open ( ' myfile.csv ' , 'r ' ) as fin : for line in DictReader ( fin ) : q . put ( line ) q . join ()
A few notes :
This is Python2.5 , you 'd want to drop the from __future__ import for Python2.6 .
For 3 k you 'd switch the from Queue import Queue to from queue import Queue , as well as adding parens to print .
( Did I miss anything ?
Have n't actually used Py3 k yet ...)
We 're using csv.DictReader instead of csv.reader because it returns a dictionary of key= > value mappings ( treating the very first row as the keys ) , as opposed to csv.reader which returns an ordered tuple .
You do n't have to keep the threads in a list ( embodied by workers above ) , but it 's an easy way to keep references to them .
I use range here , as it is the last - function - standing in Py3k , but certainly it would be more appropriate to use xrange for Py2.x code .
We can make the above script a bit more robust with ample usage of the logging and optparse modules .
from __future__ import with_statement import logging , sys from optparse import OptionParser from time import sleep from csv import DictReader from Queue import Queue from threading import Thread def manage_csv_file ( file , logger , threads = 10 ) : q = Queue ( ) workers = [ ] def worker ( ) : while True : line = q . get ( ) try : print " processing : %s
" % line except Exception , e : logger .
error ( " worker - thread : %s " % e ) q . task_done ( ) for i in range ( threads ) : t = Thread ( target = worker ) t . setDaemon ( True ) workers .
append ( t ) t . start ( ) with open ( file , ' r ' ) as fin : for line in DictReader ( fin ) : q . put ( line ) q . join ( ) def main ( ) : p = OptionParser ( " usage : pool.py somefile.csv " ) p . add_option ( ' - t ' , '- - threads ' , dest = ' threads ' , help = ' quantity of THREADS for processing ' , metavar = ' THREADS ' ) ( options , args ) = p . parse_args ( ) filename = args [ 0 ] threads = int ( options .
threads ) if options .
threads else 10 loggerLevel = logging .
DEBUG logger = logging .
getLogger ( " FileManager " ) logger .
setLevel ( loggerLevel ) ch = logging .
StreamHandler ( ) ch .
setLevel ( loggerLevel ) formatter = logging .
Formatter ( " %( asctime ) s - %( name ) s - %( levelname ) s - %( message )s " ) ch .
setFormatter ( formatter ) logger .
addHandler ( ch ) if filename .
endswith ( ' csv ' ) : manage_csv_file ( filename , logger , threads = threads ) else : print u" Cannot handle filename %s " % filename .
split ( '.' ) [ 0 ] if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : sys . exit ( main ( ) )
From there you can tweak things a bit to meet your needs to do some real work after parsing the data .
Or you could extend the script to handle another format ...
Adding Support for XML Processing
You might call the rest of this article contrived , but I 'm brewing with freshly minted knowledge of ElementTree , so let 's throw together a manage_xml_file function .
Let 's say that we 're getting an XML document that is in this format ...
< list > < item /> < item /> < item /> </ list >
... and that we want to process each item .
But let 's throw in a wrench .
Let 's say that we know we want to process the root 's children , but that we do n't even know the name of the root , or the name of the children .
And , damn it , we want to do it fast and in a single pass .
Let 's get really crazy : let 's say that we want to extract as many well - formed elements as possible even if the XML document eventually turns out to be malformed .
2
First we need to add an import for ElementTree .
For Python 2.x it 's worth your time to try importing cElementTree if it 's available .
3
try : from xml.etree import cElementTree as ElementTree except ImportError : from xml.etree import ElementTree
In Python 3.0 the distinction between C and Python modules is largely eliminated , so this try ... except dance is unnecessary , and you can get away with just one import .
from xml.etree import ElementTree
Now let 's get our hand 's dirty .
def manage_xml_file ( file , logger , threads = 10 ) : def serialize ( e ) : ' Recursively serialize an ElementTree.
Element ' tag = e .
tag text = e .
text attributes = e . items ( ) kids = e . getchildren ( ) if text and not ( attributes or kids ) : return text else : d = {} if text : d [ ' _text ' ] = text for key , val in attributes : d [ key ] = val for kid in kids : tag = kid .
tag serialized = serialize ( kid ) if d .
has_key ( tag ) : val = d [ tag ] if type ( val ) == type ( [ ] ) : val .
append ( serialized ) else : d [ tag ] = [ val , serialized ] else : d [ tag ] = serialized return d q = Queue ( ) workers = [ ] def worker ( ) : while True : data = q . get ( ) try : print " processing : %s
" % data except Exception , e : logger .
error ( " worker - thread : %s " % e ) q . task_done ( ) for i in range ( threads ) : t = Thread ( target = worker ) t .
setDaemon ( True ) workers .
append ( t ) t . start ( ) item_tag =
None reader = iter ( ElementTree .
iterparse ( file , events = ( ' start ' , ' end ' ) ) ) reader .

A few notes on this script as well :
I find it much more pleasant to serialize the elements into a native Python dictionary and then process it .
Yes , the serialize function is a bit verbose .
And yes , on a sufficiently nested XML element it would run into Python 's limitations for recursion .
I 'm okay with that .
It turns out that serializing XML to any combination of dictionaries and arrays is a bit of a black art , but I think that serialize gets it pretty much right .
iterparse is kind enough to tell us what line and character it fails on , which is more generous than many XML libraries , so we get to extract as much data as possible and know where the error is .
You 're ( unfortunately ) going to be hard pressed to get a whole lot more out of XML .
iterparse is also the fastest XML processor for Python , which is a nice side - effect of it's other nice aspects .
Then we'd need to update main to check if files end with xml and then apply manage_xml_file .
if filename .
endswith ( ' csv ' ) : manage_csv_file ( filename , logger , threads = threads ) elif filename .
endswith ( 'xml ' ) : manage_xml_file ( filename , logger , threads = threads ) else : print u" Cannot handle filename %s " % filename .
split ( '.' ) [ 0 ]
You can see the updated version of this script on GitHub .
I hope this example serves as an introduction to the wonderful world of Python threadpools .
There is a lot of flexibility and efficiency to be squeezed out of your scripts and projects by incorporating a few threads here and there .
Sure , you 'll get burned eventually , but it means you 're a pro ...
Kind of .
Let me know if you have any comments or complaints !

Dear Skittles , What the fuck are you trying to do to us ?
Did you really think you 'd get away with it ?
Did you really think the righteous people of the world would stand idly by and let you rape their mouths without crying out for justice ?
Stop selling chocolate Skittles .
I have no demand beyond that .
Actually , no , that 's a lie .
I have a whole list of demands : 1 . Stop selling chocolate Skittles .
2 . Apologize publicly .
3 . Jettison all remaining chocolate Skittlesâor any regular Skittles which may have been tainted through accidental contactâ into space .
4 . Euthanize all the diseased , caged rabbits whose shit you harvest to produce the âpuddingâ flavor .
5 . Fire the Japanese guy in marketing who thought this was a good idea .
6 . Put the entirety of your research and development budget towards inventing the technology required to make me forget there ever was such a thing .
The worst part of all this , the bitterest betrayal , lies in the fact that you KNEW Iâd have to try them .
You know damn well Iâm not going stand in line at CVS to pay for my nasal spray and Donettes and not scan the candy rack .
And whatâs waiting there for me ?
Lo and behold , an airtight bag of baboon crap .
But I didnât know that .
How could I ?
To my naÃ¯ve mind , this was a new experience waiting to be enjoyed , an exciting opportunity to take my taste buds on a chocolaty ride to cocoa town , with a possible pit stop in the unincorporated municipality of Donetteville .
Of course , I had my doubts .
You donât survive Circus Peanuts and Lucas and not realize thereâs shitty candy out there .
But you had my trust , Skittles .
Youâre one of the respectable candies ; one of the good old boys .
Since time out of mind , youâve been there , right alongside M&Mâs and Snickers , reliable as a Toyota pickup hauling a load of delicious fruit that hurts to chew .
Even Sour Skittles were all right ; I mean , you waited for Warheads and Sour Patch Kids to pave the way , then you went in .
You were smart about it .
You didnât blunder down the hall of candydom farting on black licorice and trying to get me to eat it .
Austrian designer Christian Precht has designed a compact living environment called OrganiCube .
The conceptual nine square metre apartment is made of Corian and comprises facilities for living , sleeping , working and bathing .
Here 's some more information from Precht :
--
OrganiCube explores the creative potential of the material world on the one hand and a study of living in a limited space on the other hand .
Living on a small ground floor things have to get shifted to achieve the largest possible shell .
It is an alternate look of an income - appropriate living unit of 3x3x3 meter .
The idea is to take facilities that belong to living and to its tradition inherently and transform it into a coherent design .
Through its cubic shape , the OrganiCube can be easily stacked and implemented in many environments .
The infinitive space is conceived as a technological double skin , mainly manufactured out of DuPont 's Corian .
The design shows what the abilities of material in the future are : fluid , dynamic and curvilinear in one complex shape , which includes all needs for modern living .
Therefore the organizational and formal structure is based on functional elements .
OrganiCube defines a new architectural condition outside the orthogonal , off - grid and harmonic inside .
Getting all the facilities on a ground floor of 9sqm , functional elements have to be compact and compressed .
Through compression things get folded .
These foldings are a functional element as well and the Cube provides a high standard of accommodation for one or two people , defining main facilities : living / sleeping / working and a separate bathroom .
At one place a line shapes for example the wardrobe and a few steps further it flows into a completely different living setup .
All featured curves have their distinctive function and purpose .
Through this moving and fluid interior the cube should bring harmony to residents in a sensual way .
The last time bankers faced angry demonstrations , some responded by pouring champagne or photocopied £ 50 notes from windows , but it is unlikely that protesters targeting the City next week during the G20 summit will be met by similar shows of bravado .
Many staff are being advised to dress down next Wednesday and Thursday to avoid being marked out as City workers - if they cannot avoid the protests entirely by working from home .
Others have been advised to avoid leaving the office to attend meetings .
Concern about possible violence heightened when the home of former Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Fred Goodwin was vandalised early yesterday morning , leaving three windows shattered and the rear window of his black Mercedes smashed .
An anonymous email was sent to media organisations shortly after the attack threatening further action against " criminal " bank bosses .
The former RBS boss , who had not been at home and is at the centre of a row over the size of his pension from the taxpayer - owned bank , was said to have been " shaken " by the incident .
Many in the City believe aggressive media coverage of the financial crisis has declared a virtual open season on financial sector workers .
The financial advisory group Bluefin , which employs 500 staff in London , has set up a phone line offering staff updates next week .
Staff have been told not to go to its office in Mark Lane in the City unless absolutely necessary .
" As a responsible employer , the safety and wellbeing of our staff is always considered of paramount importance , " a spokesman said .
A UBS spokesman said the bank would continue to assess the level of threat as it got nearer the time .
" We are telling people to be cautious .
If you have client meetings , do you need to have them here ?
Some of the banks have said dress down or try not to move around .
It is all pretty obvious .
" It is quite co-ordinated among the banks .
We all talk to each other .
I think it is different if you are in a landmark building , some are more obvious than others . "
Another banker complained that we " are in an era of the demonisation of financial services " .
World leaders , including Barack Obama , are due to begin arriving early next week with the summit beginning on Thursday at the ExCeL centre in London 's Docklands .
The G20 Meltdown campaign is a loose alliance of organisations that will set off from four locations in London a day earlier and converge on the Bank of England , each marching behind one of the " four horsemen of the apocalypse " .
A separate climate change protest group intends to set up camp outside the European Climate Exchange on Bishopsgate .
Further protests are to take place outside the offices of RBS and there will be marches on ExCeL during the event .
Other action is rumoured to be planned to disrupt transport and cause chaos in the City in what many believe could be the biggest protests since the poll tax riots .
An additional 2,500 police have been drafted in at a cost of £ 7.5 m and plan a " ring of steel " around ExCeL .
Police chiefs last week called City firms to a briefing that gave advice on how to beef up security .
The protesters say they plan peaceful demonstrations .
" This is not a problem about a few greedy bankers or regulators who were asleep at the wheel , it is a systemic problem , " said Michael Rainsbro , who has helped organise the protests .
But even a cursory search on the internet finds more chilling threats , with one organisation , London Class War , showing Goodwin 's head in a guillotine on the front of its G20 newsletter and suggesting in its manifesto : " Direct action is necessary against the individuals and institutions " .
The email that followed the attack on Goodwin 's house was sent from the address bankbossesarecriminals@mail.com and said : " We are angry that rich people , like him , are paying themselves a huge amount of money and living in luxury , while ordinary people are made unemployed , destitute and homeless .
This is a crime .
Bank bosses should be jailed .
This is just the beginning . "
But many appeared to be relaxed .
" If you turn up for work in a bold pinstripe that might be an issue , " said a Merrill Lynch spokesman , " but we have all been here before . "
The banker 's tale : Morale is low and the media target us
I work for a large investment bank and can tell you it 's not a very pleasant environment at the moment .
It has n't been for some time : the bank has lost a lot of money over the past two years .
Lots of employees have been laid off and motivation is low .
The media's hex on bankers is unfortunate because the world needs good bankers .
People do n't understand that most of us working for banks are not making trillions but a good salary and a decent bonus , and generally work very hard .
This sort of public anger is fuelled by ignorance - as they think everybody is a top trader .
It 's true there were too many working in banking that did n't understand or care about the risks , but that should n't be held against the many diligent and highly skilled workers .
I am glad the industry has shed some dead wood - it was long overdue .
What I 'd like to know is whether Gordon Brown will forego his pension due to his role in the credit crisis ?
Global warming is expected to cause the sea level along the northeastern U.S. coast to rise almost twice as fast as global sea levels during this century , putting New York City at greater risk for damage from hurricanes and winter storm surge , according to a new study led by a Florida State University researcher .
Jianjun Yin , a climate modeler at the Center for Ocean - Atmospheric Prediction Studies ( COAPS ) at Florida State , said there is a better than 90 percent chance that the sea level rise along this heavily populated coast will exceed the mean global sea level rise by the year 2100 .
The rising waters in this region -- perhaps by as much as 18 inches or more -- can be attributed to thermal expansion and the slowing of the North Atlantic Ocean circulation because of warmer ocean surface temperatures .
Yin and colleagues Michael Schlesinger of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and Ronald Stouffer of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University are the first to reach that conclusion after analyzing data from 10 state - of - the - art climate models , which have been used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fourth Assessment Report .
Yin 's study is published in the journal Nature Geoscience .
" The northeast coast of the United States is among the most vulnerable regions to future changes in sea level and ocean circulation , especially when considering its population density and the potential socioeconomic consequences of such changes , " Yin said .
" The most populous states and cities of the United States and centers of economy , politics , culture and education are located along that coast . "
The researchers found that the rapid sea - level rise occurred in all climate models whether they depicted low , medium or high rates of greenhouse - gas emissions .
In a medium greenhouse - gas emission scenario , the New York City coastal area would see an additional rise of about 8.3 inches above the mean sea level rise that is expected around the globe because of human - induced climate change .
Thermal expansion and the melting of land ice , such as the Greenland ice sheet , are expected to cause the global sea - level rise .
The researchers projected the global sea -level rise of 10.2 inches based on thermal expansion alone .
The contribution from the land ice melting was not assessed in this study due to uncertainty .
Considering that much of the metropolitan region of New York City is less than 16 feet above the mean sea level , with some parts of lower Manhattan only about 5 feet above the mean sea level , a rise of 8.3 inches in addition to the global mean rise would pose a threat to this region , especially if a hurricane or winter storm surge occurs , Yin said .
Potential flooding is just one example of coastal hazards associated with sea - level rise , Yin said , but there are other concerns as well .
The submersion of low - lying land , erosion of beaches , conversion of wetlands to open water and increase in the salinity of estuaries all can affect ecosystems and damage existing coastal development .
Although low - lying Florida and Western Europe are often considered the most vulnerable to sea level changes , the northeast U.S. coast is particularly vulnerable because the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( AMOC ) is susceptible to global warming .
The AMOC is the giant circulation in the Atlantic with warm and salty seawater flowing northward in the upper ocean and cold seawater flowing southward at depth .
Global warming could cause an ocean surface warming and freshening in the high - latitude North Atlantic , preventing the sinking of the surface water , which would slow the AMOC .
Message To The Future
By Peter Chamberlin
16 March , 2009
Countercurrents.org
This is written for you , the survivors .
Two or three years ago , I decided to write this message to you .
My only intentions were to find the best solutions to the nightmare visions and ease the suffering billions of souls who were scheduled to pay the final price of a world system based on greed .
There is no sense in having a nightmare vision of the future that you know is real if it cannot be shared with others today , in real time .
Warning of an impending massive fatal mental illness as a timely prescription for avoidance is an act of futility , in a population inured of life and deaf and blind to any signs of greater “ Life . ”
I write to the future because it is you in the future who can see the terrible price levied against the human race and the planet itself by this evil cabal of ultra- wealthy men who have taken upon themselves to establish their mastery over the entire world .
My purpose in writing you is to place in your hands the explanation for the devastation of your lives and to remove any doubts that you might have that the ones who did this to you and yours might be trying to save the species , or that it might have been a gigantic series of accidents .
The old order , and all that was secured by it , were systematically destroyed , in order to stage the greatest robbery in history .
In some ways , not that much has changed ; the same power elite still owns a controlling interest in most of the earth ’s resources .
The wealthiest few own a slightly larger percentage of these resources than they did before the war and the great collapse , only now , their hands have been untied from previous legislation and popular opposition so that they might freely remove large numbers of “ useless eaters ” from their balance sheets .
I suspect that the time is not far - off when they too shall face their own day of reckoning , and by God ’s hands or those of man , the mighty shall be brought low .
Right now , under the guise of the “ common good , ” they are reorganizing the world into a more easily managed configuration , to facilitate the flow of wealth towards the center , which they alone occupy .
Pretending all the while to be laboring to “ revive ” the collapsed financial institutions which they have laid waste , the new global order is secretly being given life .
Under the new order , the economic powers have risen above governments , subduing all the nations under pyramidal schemes of “ financial aid ” and largesse .
The collapse of the world into the waiting hands of the power elite was not a natural event , part of the evolutionary process ; it was a carefully contrived event .
We see the problem clearly , men of ultimate means , have sought to protect their prosperity by looking into the future through whatever means available , even by attempted occult means .
Through deliberation and oracle consultation , they truly sought to see the future , so as to avoid economic pitfalls and to take advantage of all available opportunities .
These wise and delusional men concluded that the human race will self - destruct without outside intervention .
The exploding human population will surely consume itself or destroy the planet in their quest to consume and to procreate .
In mankind ’s best interests , the wise men concluded that they had to save mankind from himself ( since God was n’t going to do it ) .
From there it was a small step to the realization that if they were the only ones intelligent enough to see that the majority was too dumb to survive its own excesses , then they must be superior humans .
Just like the mythological “ fallen race ” theories cited from the earliest human history , these men saw themselves as replacement gods .
The obsessed “ superior ” humans took it upon themselves to design a grand plan to save the human race from itself .
A small segment of this elite group of forward - looking “ superior ” humans was n’t convinced that mankind would self - destruct , so they were determined to do everything within their power to make sure that we did .
An even smaller group of this malevolent group , the wealthiest most powerful leaders , knew to the depths of their souls that the prophecy of desolation would come and that all of it was simply part of the ancient evil plan .
These were the true believers in the power of darkness .
They are the heart of the cabal , above all the secret societies which their predecessors have created to breathe life into the plan that is as old as mankind itself .
What they had seen was not a fixed , inevitable outcome for the human race , even though growth in population and technology will inevitably combine into an explosive mixture conducive to wanton destruction .
The plan is to systematically stimulate this explosive mix , keeping it moments from detonation at all times , to produce a sufficient catalyst for change .
By skirting along the edge of total destruction , while fully utilizing the subliminal powers of modern media to convey the message that we are headed for certain destruction , the men who play with fire could carry - out their brainwashing program based on a strategy of tension .
The elites are convinced that they can maintain control over the people long enough to carry - out their mind - splitting psyop through their behavioral sciences of crisis management and conflict resolution .
Society could be slow - cooked in this way until there was a communal desire for release , at a time of the master manipulators ’ choosing .
For centuries initiates have known the planned future ( See : Albert Pike , H. G. Wells ) .
The wealthiest few have maintained and facilitated their grip on power over man by methodically gaining and exploiting the deepest scientific understanding of human nature within reach .
For centuries they have known that man could be driven by his needs and his fears and be drawn by his desires .
This taught the evil plotters that humankind could be conditioned by the proper application of this knowledge forcing mankind into accepting a new economic arrangement that was even less favorable to them than the present system ( which is hopelessly skewed towards the rich ) .
Possession of this knowledge reinforced the idea of personal superiority among the elite , giving sway to even more extreme and outlandish abuses of their fellow man .
A doctrine of the “ superman ” developed among the elite , who saw themselves as the “ New Man . ”
If they alone could foresee and plan for the great realignment of the earth then surely they were the new man , destined to be overseers of their inferiors .
They considered themselves to be evolutionary steps beyond man , the first “ post - humans . ”
The self - appointed overseers took to their task with a voracious appetite for increased profits and a desire to see the filthy masses of “ humans ” convinced of their own status as mere cattle to the more advanced economic wizards .
Scientists , doctors and intellectuals were recruited by the thousands to serve the master class , each of them enamored of the adoration showered upon them in gratitude for their willing service to the growing empire .
The financiers endowed foundations , libraries , hospitals and universities , where these geniuses could develop their knowledge of pharmacology and the behavioral sciences to devise the most certain methods for bending the minds and the wills of the subjugated species .
The more that they gave the more they embraced the idea that their crusade for greater profit was an evolutionary advancement of the species .
They developed and applied scientific techniques for manipulating human consciousness that amounted to full - spectrum warfare , directed against all systems of power and against all individuals .
Normal human associations that society had constructed for itself over the centuries had to be disrupted , so that a new totalitarian system of control could be substituted at the center of all human interactions .
The world of the fascist “ new man ” had to be brought into being .
All of our greatest artists and intellectual writers had been describing this new predetermined future in detail , for many years ; they were giving life to an image and implanting it into our imaginations .
From podium to pulpit , hired guns for the empire pounded it into our skulls that “ survival = control , ” the human race could only “ survive ” if we surrendered total control of our lives over to the ever - expanding center .
The fascist center has expanded the war against the human race by focusing their attacks upon our children .
The educational system became a battleground for introducing divisive “ progressive ” ideas into young minds .
Transcendentalism and Hegelian dialectics represented new fronts in the war against freemen , now recognized as a war against thought itself .
After this incendiary attack upon morality and truth , opposites became easily transposed over known realities , creating widespread doubt in established belief , particularly religious beliefs .
Through our own confiscated money they have financed a school system that is focused entirely on dumbing - down every one of our children ( except for those “ gifted ” ones absorbed into the system ) , through the concerted system of “ public education ” devised by the thoroughly evil man John Dewey .
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the conspirators what they had always wanted :
“ Give me control of a nation ’s currency and I care not who makes the laws . ” Mayer Amschel Rothschild .
The dark overlords could now open or close the money tap at will , leaving everyone who had any dealings with America or its banks vulnerable to outright extortion .
Through the power of the purse , economic shockwaves were generated over the earth , leading us directly into the First World War and the ensuing Great Depression .
With the election of FDR and his New Deal social programs , a sizeable portion of bank funds were placed beyond the bankers ’ reach , an unacceptable situation where Roosevelt actively righted some of the great wrongs that the great Robber Barons were busily committing .
This led the plotters to attempt an actual coup by approaching war hero Gen.
Smedley Butler to raise a private army for the purpose .
World War II brought an end to the depression and ushered - in a new age of patriotism that made it much more difficult to get away with any actions deemed unpatriotic .
This led the super - capitalists to take an openly benevolent approach to misleading the people , through the creation of a multitude of “ humanitarian ” foundations to study society ’s problems .
Unsurprisingly , one of their first “ discoveries ” was the “ population explosion . ”
Discovered by accident , while researching why devastating wars had produced accelerating birthrates amidst all the gloom and desolation left in the wake of modern warfare , analysts identified the “ baby boom ” produced at the end of the great war .
The results of their calculations and modeling projections provided them with tangible proof that the boom would trigger a human catastrophe of Biblical proportions .
Armed with this revelation , the world ’s elite went forth to convince the world that every nation had to reduce its birthrate , in order to avert the coming inevitable cosmic tragedy .
Their warnings and recommendations fell on deaf ears ; the world ’s population continued to skyrocket .
With the certain knowledge that the cattle - like “ human race ” would never voluntarily do the wise or correct thing , even to guarantee its own survival , the masters of our world set - out to increase the world ’s death - rate .
Suddenly new exotic diseases and multiple regional wars began to break - out all over the globe .
Sectarian and class - fueled conflicts became common , especially in strategic resource rich areas of the planet .
But all of that was not enough to satisfy the masters of death , millions more had to die .
It became necessary or logical for them to create a universal enemy , to unite mankind in dedication to a state of permanent total war .
Through large transfers of cash , governments all over the world were persuaded to secretly wage war against their own citizens .
The “ war of terror ” became the acceptable euphemism to describe this process of government staging terrorist attacks against its own citizenry .
The alias “ al Qaida ” was given to the network of intelligence agencies responsible for dispensing the terror .
In every nation government agents bombed , shot and kidnapped their own citizens ( in the CIA ’s case , attacked inside other nations as well ) to make examples of them , in the process of terrorizing the people of the nations into surrendering their own freedom for the hope of survival .
After many years of this kind of physical abuse , the final phase of the takeover has gotten underway in the Middle East and in the ongoing economic collapse .
This is the mechanism whereby all assets are moved into the overseer ’s hands .
As predicted , the vast majority people are screaming to save them by saving their banks .
The people are willingly giving their assent to the use of their savings , they will also willingly give their permission for the government to take the final , supremely ultimate steps of waging total global war to eradicate the unseen , nonexistent enemy .
We are being rushed to our own destruction and most of us will be happy that the government “ made the effort ! ”
This is the pre-collapse world envisioned by the elitist bankers and the other “ supermen ” for so very long now .
This is the world that must be resisted when it rears its ugly head against you and your families .
This is the future that no one is willing to fight against now , before it becomes a finished fact .
This is the world envisioned for so long by the evil “ post - humans ” and now , before the fact , by a mere handful of scholars and counter - researchers .
Before communications had developed enough for modern researchers to find the hidden truths about our overseers , only Prophets who had received wisdom from a superior unknown source had understood the depth of the evil that dwelled within the hearts of some men .
No normal human could conceive of such a monstrous evil ; this is our only excuse .
So this is the message I leave to you in the future , surrounded on all sides by the most venomous evil this earth has ever known .
Take hope in understanding that both Jesus Christ and Mohammed ( Peace Unto Them Both ) foresaw your time of struggle .
Both of them foretold of a greater life and a greater earth that would emerge from this epoch , after the time of resistance end is brought to an end .
Protect your families , whatever it takes !
Resist the new order in every conceivable way .
Just remember why you resist and the price of continued surrender .
Look around at what our surrender has cost you .
God be with you .

MUMBAI : Major economies of the world are staring at the threat of deflation , an economic state where there is decline in general price levels , often caused by a reduction in the supply of money or credit , according to a recent Citi report .
A term opposite of inflation , deflation has often had the side effect of increasing unemployment , since the process often leads to a lower level of demand in the economy .
It should be remembered in this context that the wholesale price index ( WPI - denoting inflationary pressure in India ) dipped to a 13 - month low , opening the door for RBI to reduce its interest rates .
According to finance ministry , the WPI inflation rate fell to 3.92 % in the week ended February 7 from 4.39 % in the previous week .
The threat of deflation is likely to become more serious as global economic activity slows in the first half of this year .
���Those areas where we forecast outright deflation this year include US , Japan and China .
However , many economies are at risk of experiencing falling consumer prices , ��� the Citi report added .
Economies like Japan , US , China and Europe are already under deflationary pressure with the consumer price index ( CPI - like WPI - denotes inflation trends in western countries ) dipping very near or well below the 1 % mark .
In an interview to ET a few weeks ago , John Praveen , chief investment strategist , Pramerica International Investment Advisors said : �� �Headline inflation is likely to dip to around zero ( in Y - o - Y terms ) in US and Europe in early 2009 , fuelling deflation fears .
However , this trend is likely to dissipate as developed economies pull out of recession .
The Indian government will not let the country slip into a deflationary situation ; it will jerk the economy up by have more interest rate cuts .��
�
One encouraging aspect for investors is that equity market performance during previous periods of deflation has not been as dismal as many believe .
Stock market performance during periods of deflation looks to be driven by the strength of real economy / earnings and valuations .
Those investors worried about sustained deflation should consider companies which offer pricing power , volume growth and strong balance sheets , the Citi report said .
According to Puneet Nanda , CIO , ICICI Prudential Life Insurance , even though inflation is dipping at a good pace , it is not likely to move into a deflationary or degrowth zone .��
� The government will hook inflation in and around 2 - 3 % ; it is will try to kick - start the economy by cutting rates and announcing fiscal packages ( by the new government ) .
In all probability , there is going to be a coalition party at the Centre post general election .
If the newly - elected government is headed by either of the two national political parties , there should n't be anything for India Inc to worry about .
Only a highly - fragmented coalition can scare corporate India and markets , ��� Mr Nanda said .
Sign Of The Times : Churches Drying Up
We have at least one thing to thank the economy for :
The churches and their schools are starting to dry up .
A number of churches and the religious schools they support are closing down all over the country , from what I have read in the news they are primarily Catholic organizations .
The number of people attending services are dropping and thus the amount of money the local tax - exempt businesses ..
er.. churches are making has gone down .
With less money to operate they are having to consolidate or close down chapels making less money ..
er.. having lower attendance ; because it ’s all about the faith folks , not the money .. right .
In case you ca n’t tell , I am very enthused about this .
The less money the Catholic church makes the less they can devote to spreading AIDS in Africa , moving around pedophile priests , and the various other crimes and intolerances that they commit and promote , respectively .
I ’m also happy about the possible reduction in the amount of proselytizing the church is able to do .
Hopefully this trend extends to the rest of the planet and the non-Catholic churches as well .
However I can see a potential downside in the reduction of church funds .
There are a number of outreach programs that the church runs , homeless shelters for example , and I do n’t know if these have been or will be impacted by this downturn .
I hope that at least other - more secular - organizations are able to come and fill up the gaps that may be left by the church because I know that if I were homeless I would prefer a free meal or place to sleep without a sermon .
Overall , a smaller and less profitable church is a good thing in my opinion .
Photographing animals can be a challenge and requires patience , determination and understanding of animal behavior so that you can expect how they will be likely to act or react and predict the moment for a good photograph .
Good exposure , color and blur settings in addition with proper shutter speed and focusing techniques are essential to produce stunning animal photographs .
Here are 30 beautiful pictures of animal photography .

She calls her costar 's new rap career antics " odd " and says he needs " to get some authenticity "
Gwyneth Paltrow has some advice for her friend and costar Joaquin Phoenix about his new career path :
Get some street cred .
Popular belief is that Phoenix ’s saying goodbye to acting and launching a hip - hop career could be an elaborate hoax , despite his publicist ’s assertions to the contrary .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ I think that there might be some other explanation or something going on .
I ’m not quite sure what , but I ca n’t believe that he ’s really going to quit [ acting ] forever to become a rapper , ” she told MTV UK during a promotional junket for Two Lovers .
“ It seems odd . ”
After three years in this country , French journalist Jacques Monin has come to the conclusion that we are obsessed with money , drowning in debt and morally bankrupt .
So where did it all go wrong ?
If I had to choose a single image that , for me , represents Britain today , it would not be a phone box or a postbox .
It would n't even be a double - decker bus .
It would be a simple briefcase .
A battered red one , the one the chancellor of the exchequer likes to brandish triumphantly in front of the television cameras when he leaves his residence at Number 11 , Downing Street every budget day .
It sums up , all by itself , the way this country now thinks .
The key words , the only words that really matter in Britain , are money , business , interest rates , profit , consumer spending , " good for the economy " .
I still do not understand why it is impossible , in this country , to talk about someone without mentioning their salary , the cost of their car , the value of their house .
Even if you 're talking about health , about a humanitarian act , it 's in the context of cost .
You have forgotten , it seems to me , that what matters is who you are and what you do .
Not how much you cost .
In Britain , now , it seems all political thought works this way .
In the battle against global warming , Gordon Brown professes to see an opportunity to save the world .
But really it 's about developing new business opportunities .
Money is the answer to everything : it is used to reward smokers who successfully give up , and to resocialise the most hardened criminals by paying them , in prison , to re-engage with a semblance of a social life .
Earning lots of money is A Good Thing because - unlike the way we French see things - the search for profit does not rule out generosity .
" Spend money and you 'll be doing good " might , in fact , be a motto for modern - day Britain .
Thanks to your fine charities ( which , on the whole , do work that is done by the state in France ) , you have managed to reconcile the social and the commercial .
Look : by doing business and making money , you are contributing to the happiness of others !
If morality very rarely intrudes on the business of making money , making money somehow becomes a moral act .
For some years now , it has been de rigueur for a certain elite in my country - and , of course , yours - to see in the British model the salvation of France , and to portray France as a kind of 1970s Britain : in genteel decline , needing a good dose of Thatcherism .
Right now , we 're not quite so sure .
Oddly , you see , France still values prudence in economic management .
Whereas here , the constant encouragement to borrow a lot and spend even more has caused the whole machine to crash , steaming , into the mire .
Borrow as much as you can afford , folks , then ( why not ? ) a little more , and spend , spend , spend !
That was New Labour 's magic recipe .
The more generous the prime minister 's praise of the City bankers , the more eager they were to dream up more and more sophisticated products .
The resulting toxic assets now easily stand comparison with the worst of America 's sub - prime problems .
Your government , meanwhile , is now up to its neck in debt , and you personally have probably borrowed too much , too .
Household debt in Britain now stands at a barely imaginable 173 % of gross disposable income , against 72 % in France .
Add all your debts together , in fact , and Britain is now further in the red than any other developed nation .
It was excessive borrowing that forced up British property prices to such an insane extent , creating a bubble that has now well and truly burst .
Credit , the hard drug pushed with such alacrity by the financial services industry , has finally succeeded in bringing the world to its knees : the banks are as good as belly - up , and individuals can no longer carry on spending with impunity .
Inevitably , the job losses are mounting .
The British model , presented to us all as exemplary , simply could not last .
It carried within it the seeds of its crisis .
And because you became so addicted to the credit drug , because you lost all idea of what constituted responsible or sensible behaviour , Britain will now fall further and harder than any other major European nation .
Inexplicably , you threw caution to the winds .
Reason was sacrificed on the temple of economic growth , at all costs .
When I objected to my English friends that this mad cycle of borrowing and spending would have to be paid for one day , they told me I was a pessimist .
When , as recently as last September , I decided on the title of my book , they thought I was being needlessly provocative .
Well , we 've all seen what happened .
Is it possible that money makes you blind ?
So now , all of a sudden , the government - having closed its eyes to the City 's depravities as long as it was generating that all - important growth - is now pointing a finger at the bankers and their bonuses , and denouncing " casino capitalism " .
Those who lit the fire , in other words , have the nerve to portray themselves as the firefighters .
And to cap it all , while he 's putting himself about as the saviour of Europe , Brown is unwittingly copying his French neighbours .
Today , he 's all in favour of greater state involvement in the economy .
Today , he 's happy to run up public debt , promise employment incentives and state support to sectors in difficulty .
The man who gave the Bank of England its independence now urges greater regulation .
He 's even meeting the unions .
During his state visit to Westminster in March 2008 , Nicolas Sarkozy , plainly dazzled by what he saw as Britain 's prowess , frankly told your MPs : " We must take inspiration from what you have achieved in these last 20 years . "
Would he say the same today ?
Britain has good reason to worry .
You may ( depending on which statistics you believe ) have dealt with mass unemployment , but you ditched protection for British workers in the process .
You 've invested enormous sums in public services in recent years , but for any French person the efficiency of your health and education systems , your energy and transport networks , leaves much to be desired .
The French may believe their model is failing ; the crisis , debt , unemployment weigh heavily on them .
But French benefits , French paid holidays , French pensions provide real , heavy - duty protection .
How on earth will you manage here , with your staggering levels of public and private debt ?
Where will you find the resources to modernise ?
What , in heaven 's name , are all the unemployed people to live on ?
Curiously , none of this seems to have done a great deal to change Britain 's political apathy .
You no longer imagine , it seems to me , that there might actually be such a thing as a " choice of society " .
Along with New Labour , the very idea of anything resembling an ideology vanished .
In France , on the other hand , politics still condition the life of the individual .
Rightly or wrongly , my fellow countrymen still want to believe that a choice of society really remains possible .
They might resist reform , as you like to point out , but they involve themselves - deeply - in politics .
Here , however , the boundaries between the major parties have been all but eroded .
This drift to the centre , combined with the weakness of the extremes , has anaesthetised British politics .
So the British do n't vote very much .
They do n't object very much .
They do n't dream very much .
The human has been replaced by the consumer .
And humanism by pragmatism .
Pragmatism , in today 's Britain , is all .
Cost - efficiency is what counts .
Here , you 're actively encouraged to denounce your neighbour , for not paying road tax or putting a bin out early or dishonestly claiming a benefit .
Closed - circuit TV surveillance is rife .
There are councils that spy on their taxpayers as if they were common criminals ; others that submit benefit claimants to a lie - detector test .
And while it 's capable of mislaying the personal data of millions of its constituents , the home office proposes to set up a database holding information on every telephone call made , every email sent , and every website visited by every single British citizen .
None of this would be possible in France ; there would be rioting in the streets .
Let 's be clear : the British and the French hold dear the same values of tolerance and fraternity .
We distinguish ourselves by the way we behave , by our sensitivities , by our relations with the world .
But the British model is , I 'd argue , displaying its limitations .
You have sacrificed everything to economic growth , but that has weakened the worse - off .
It has done nothing to even out Britain 's inequalities ( indeed , it has exaggerated them ) .
Your pensions are still a sad joke .
Your public services are still not what they should be .
Despite the all - consuming focus on efficiency , waste and incompetence continue to dog both the public and the private sectors ( think the NHS computer debacle ; think Heathrow 's Terminal Five ) .
The current crisis , it seems to me , is more than economic .
Britain is in a crisis of morality , and of identity .
It is unsure , in the wake of 7/7 , of its multicultural model ; immigration is now a source of concern .
Whole groups of young people are losing their bearings , becoming cut off from society , joining gangs , turning to knives .
You have a growing obesity problem .
Alcoholism is gaining a grip on the middle classes .
In France , by contrast , young people generally feel stronger family ties , there is a greater respect for gastronomic traditions and while drinking levels may have increased , a bingeing culture has not yet taken hold .
Britain faces big questions .
Who are you in a globalised world , in a country with a population so diverse it is no longer sure of its roots ?
How do your traditions accommodate modernity , monarchy , a republic , discipline , eccentricity , tolerance , violence , extreme wealth , great poverty ?
What is man 's place in a world where money and the media show are all that matter ?
What , in short , are your values now ?
Faced with questions of such complexity , your celebrated British pragmatism is not , I fear , enough .
I once shared my doubts with a British academic .
" In France , " he said to me , " you start from a principle , and you look at how best to apply it .
In England , we work from the bottom up .
We start from the facts , and we take a decision that will solve the problem .
It 's an approach that allows us to be simpler .
And more efficient . "
And perhaps , I believe after nearly three years in your magnificent country , to arrive at a rather simplistic vision of the complexity of man and of his aspirations .

Sen .
Webb : Prisons a ' national disgrace , ' must be reformed Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday March 26 , 2009
Print This Email This Proposed commission would seek to bring prison populations down , ' overhaul drug criminalization '
Even as President Barack Obama slapped down the hopes of American marijuana consumers as to his position on legalization , Senator Jim Webb ( D - Va ) was quietly preparing to introduce major legislation which has the potential to dramatically alter US drug laws .
Calling the US criminal justice system " a national disgrace , " two US senators called for a top - to - bottom review with an eye on reforms aimed at reducing America 's vast prison population .
Senator Webb , backed by Republican Senator Arlen Specter , introduced legislation to create a blue - ribbon panel that would conduct an 18 - month assessment and offer concrete recommendations for reform .
Sen .
Webb 's legislation enjoys not just bipartisan support , but " quiet encouragement from President Barack Obama , " reported The Virginian - Pilot .
" America 's criminal justice system has deteriorated to the point that it is a national disgrace , " Webb said , noting that the United States has five percent of the world 's population but 25 percent of the world 's prisoners .
According to a document released by Sen .
Webb 's office , " Its task will be to propose concrete , wide - ranging reforms to responsibly reduce the overall incarceration rate ; improve federal and local responses to international and domestic gang violence ; restructure our approach to drug policy ; improve the treatment of mental illness ; improve prison administration , and establish a system for reintegrating ex-offenders . "
The Virginia lawmaker noted soaring numbers of drug offenders in prison , and charged that four times more mentally ill people are incarcerated than are in mental health hospitals .
" We are doing something drastically wrong , " said Webb , whose plan also aims to improve the US response to armed gangs , especially drug - related groups , as it seeks to bring the prison population down from about 2.4 million people .
" The high - level commission created by the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2009 legislation will be comprised of experts in fields including criminal justice , law enforcement , public heath , national security , prison administration , social services , prisoner reentry , and victims ' rights , " read a statement from Webb 's office .
" It will be led by a chairperson to be appointed by the President .
The Majority and Minority Leaders in the House and Senate , and the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations will appoint the remaining members of the commission . "
About five million people are on probation or parole .
" We are not protecting our citizens from the increasing danger of criminals who perpetrate violence and intimidation as a way of life , and we are locking up too many people who do not belong in jail , " said Webb .
" Despite the president 's flippant comments today , the grievous harms of marijuana prohibition are no laughing matter , " said Jack Cole , a former undercover narcotics officer and founding member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , in a statement to RAW STORY .
" Certainly , the 800,000 people arrested last year on marijuana charges find nothing funny about it , nor do the millions of Americans struggling in this sluggish economy .
It would be an enormous economic stimulus if we stopped wasting so much money arresting and locking people up for nonviolent drug offenses and instead brought in new tax revenue from legal sales , just as we did when ended alcohol prohibition 75 years ago during the Great Depression . "
" Other supporters include the current Judiciary panel head , Sen. Patrick J. Leahy , D - Vt. , and the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate , Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , " noted the Times - Dispatch .
" In Webb 's home state , prison population has been growing steadily since 1995 , when Virginia dumped parole for fixed sentences -- an initiative of the Republican former governor Webb narrowly defeated in 2006 : George Allen . "
" Webb has succeeded in pushing major legislation through Congress before , as his 21st Century GI Bill passed last year , " noted The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder .
" And it 's hard for anyone to accuse the former Navy secretary of not being ' tough ' enough . "
Sen .
Webb 's office has published the legislation online .

Integration is the theme of the day today , with Broadcom ( s BRCM ) announcing that the Android operating system will run on its multiradio chip , which offers Wi -Fi , Bluetooth and FM radio .
It also announced open access to those drivers , allowing developers to play with the functionality offered by the chips and ( hopefully ) create new applications .
The move will serve to boost the Android platform , because now instead of three radios taking up space on small devices , a handset manufacturer will only need one — which means smaller and less expensive devices will be able to run on it .
In contrast , the 3G iPhone from Apple ( s aapl ) has a Wi -Fi radio from Marvell ( s mrvl ) , Bluetooth from CSR and no FM receiver , which some users have made clear they want .
Broadcom has bet big on integrating radios — something other chipmakers such as Qualcomm ( s qcom ) and ST - NXP have been working on as well — as connectivity to a variety of networks , and functionality such a location , become must - have features on phones and computers .
Porting Android to Broadcom ’s tri-radio chip is n’t going to change the world , but it will enable a smaller , cheaper Google ( s GOOG ) phone with more features and cooler apps .
Ginger and chilli are among the plants deemed “ hazardous ” by Thailand ’s Department of Agriculture in a recent announcement .
[ social_buttons ]
Instead of only regulating the toxic pesticides used by large - scale agriculture , Thailand ’s new law mandates that the plants themselves should be treated as hazardous substances .
Farmers take this to mean that even their small - scale organic farms must follow expensive safety regulations , or else face risk of jail time .
Organic farmers are fighting back and threatening to sue the government if the list is not removed from the law .
“ The committee listed the 13 traditional Thai herbs without consulting those who would be hardest hit , who are the farmers , not large - scale hazardous chemical pesticide producers , ” said Witoon Lianchamroon , founder of an NGO organic farmer association called Biothai .
Biothai , the Southern Alternative Agriculture Network , and other groups view the list as a direct manipulation of law to benefit large - scale agricutlure and hurt subsistence farmers , grassroots agriculture , and the organic movement .
They have given the Thai government one week to retract the list before filing a lawsuit .
The 13 herbs and plants are vital in traditional Thai cooking and are clearly not hazardous : ginger , chilli , neem , lemongrass , turmeric , Chinese ginger , African marigold , Siam weed or bitter bush , tea seed cake , Chinese celery , ringworn bush , glory lily , and stemona .
Rachada Singalavanija , director - general of the Industrial Works Department , tried to assure the farmers that the law was not directed at them , but towards chemical and pesticide - using farms .

Deep within the bowels of the iPhone OS are some property list files that describe the capabilities of the various iPhone and iPod touch models .
According to a reader with access to the latest iPhone OS 3.0 developer beta , there is a plist file for a new , unknown device .
Our source believes that the new device , referred to as N18AP , may represent updated iPod touch hardware .
The plist for the second - generation iPhone ( N82AP ) , for instance , simply includes the plist for the original and lists the updated features — like GPS and 3G capabilities .
Likewise , the plist for the second - generation iPod touch ( N72AP ) includes the plist for the original and lists only the updated features .
That leads us to the new discovery .
The plist file for N18AP apparently includes the plist for N72AP , the second - gen iPod touch , leading to the speculation that the device is an updated iPod touch model .
The only new capability listed , however , is " encode -aac . "
How this capability might relate to new features is not known .
It 's easy to speculate that it could include a recording feature , but the current iPod touch can already do that .
All we can say for certain from this information is that Apple has some device similar to an iPod touch that can encode AAC format audio and is expected to run iPhone OS 3.0 .
If or when it will appear as a new product , however , is known only to Apple .
US Justice Department memos : the specter of military dictatorship
4 March 2009
A set of nine secret memos released by the US Justice Department Monday reveal that in the weeks and months after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks the US government began erecting the legal scaffolding for a full - blown military dictatorship .
Attorney General Eric
Holder declared that the release of the documents , which were posted on the Justice Department 's web site , signaled a new era of " transparency and openness . "
The actions of the Obama administration in recent weeks , however , including the invocation of national security and state secrets to quell lawsuits challenging the worst abuses of the Bush era , make it clear that the threat revealed in these memos is far from over .
The thrust of the memos , written by former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo , then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and others in the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , was that the president , as commander - in - chief in the " global war on terrorism , " had the right to suspend the Constitution and treat American citizens on US soil as if they were soldiers in an invading foreign army .
In a September 25 , 2001 , memo , Yoo argued for the unfettered right of the White House to carry out warrantless domestic wiretapping .
He insisted that the Fourth Amendment 's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures was inoperative in the context of the war on terror , which had " changed the calculus of a reasonable search . "
In response to an inquiry from the White House concerning its authority to deploy US troops within the United States itself , Yoo and then - Special Counsel Robert Delahunty issued an October 23 , 2001 , memo insisting that nothing in the Constitution or the law could stop him .
In the document , Yoo and Delahunty acknowledged that what was under consideration included " deploying troops and military equipment to monitor and control the flow of traffic into a city ; attacking civilian targets , such as apartment buildings , offices , or ships where suspected terrorists were thought to be . "
The Justice Department officials admitted that the use of military forces against US citizens on American soil raised " novel and difficult questions of constitutional law , " but argued that such forces would not be bound to respect constitutional rights , allowing them to search houses and seize suspects , without the need for court approval or a search warrant .
In the same memo , they made the case that calling out the military on US soil could be joined with a sweeping suppression of freedom of speech .
" First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully , " they wrote .
Other memos explicitly rejected any power of the courts or Congress to limit the president 's actions .
This included a finding that Congress had no right to restrict the president 's treatment of detainees or their transfer to other countries , a practice known as rendition that was used to subject them to interrogation under torture .
They also asserted that the president was not bound to obey laws requiring court approval for wiretapping .
Included in the released documents was a January 15 , 2009 , memo — issued just five days before Bush left office — signed by the outgoing head of the Office of Legal Counsel , Steven Bradbury .
In it , Bradbury claimed that a number of the legal opinions expressed in the earlier memos were no longer operative and had been secretly " withdrawn or superseded . "
This document had the character of a legal cover for the government attorneys who are clearly complicit in the criminal activities of the Bush administration , including domestic spying , torture and extra-legal detentions .
This cover - up is essentially taken as good coin by the Obama administration and the Democrats in Congress .
The administration treats the earlier memos as " mistakes , " while Senator Patrick Leahy , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said that the memos exposed " the Bush administration 's misguided national security policies . "
Involved here were not " misguided " policies in an otherwise legitimate " war on terror , " but rather a deliberate and frontal assault on the Constitution and democratic rights .
No one , either in the Obama administration or in the Democratic congressional leadership , suggests that those responsible for these illegal policies should be held accountable , including by means of criminal prosecutions .
The American Civil Liberties Union , whose lawsuits were at least partially responsible for the release of the memos , welcomed their publication , but noted pointedly that " dozens of other OLC memos , including memos that provided the basis for the Bush administration 's torture and warrantless wiretapping policies , are still being withheld . "
Indeed , far from " turning the page " on the government criminality and dictatorial actions of the Bush administration , the Obama Justice Department is defending them .
In two cases before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California — one involving the rendition of suspects to torture centers overseas , and the second , the illegal wiretapping of US citizens — Obama 's attorneys have invoked the " state secrets privilege , " arguing that even to allow the cases to be heard would pose a threat to national security .
In the wiretapping case , a judge last Friday ruled against the government , ordering that a classified document proving that the National Security Agency illegally spied on an Islamic charity and its lawyers be released to the plaintiffs .
The Obama Justice Department responded with the extraordinary argument that the court had no right to release the document , and that the decision of the Director of National Intelligence to keep it secret could not be questioned .
In making this argument , the Obama administration is defending both illegal domestic spying — which continues to this day — and the principle of unchallengeable executive power , which was at the heart of the dictatorial conceptions laid out in the Bush Justice Department memos .
Continuity rather than change is what characterizes the Obama administration 's actions .
The Democratic Party and its congressional leaders were , after all , direct accomplices in the criminal actions of the Bush administration , from illegal wars of aggression , to domestic spying , rendition and torture .
More fundamentally , the turn towards police state methods of rule is driven not by an overarching fear of terrorism , but by the explosive tensions building up within American society itself , which is characterized above all by the highest levels of social inequality since before the last Great Depression .
Democratic forms are increasingly irreconcilable with the immense gulf dividing the masses of working people from the narrow financial elite that controls both major parties and all the institutions of government .
Under conditions of the unfolding meltdown of the capitalist economy , the tendencies toward dictatorial methods of rule will only accelerate , under Obama just as surely as they would have under Bush .

A chat with Sean Astin , Sean Astin interview , Color of Magic , Lord of the Rings , Rudy
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Sean Astin has been a regularly - working actor since the early ‘ 80s , but surely we can all agree that he first achieved cinematic immortality in his role as Mikey Walsh in “ The Goonies . ”
Later , we cheered him as the title character in “ Rudy , ” and his three performances as a hobbit named Sam Gangee that earned him millions more fans .
Now , Astin ’s returning to a world not entirely dissimilar from the one created by J.R.R. Tolkien : “ The Color of Magic " ( airing on Sunday , March 22 on ION Television ) , adapted from Terry Pratchett ’s “ Discworld ” saga .
We spoke with Astin about whether he had any worries about typecasting , how much green - screen work he had to deal with this time around , and how much familiarity he had with Pratchett ’s novels prior to signing on .
We also chatted about his appearance in a “ Rudy ” parody on “ My Name Is Earl , ” some of his favorite unheralded films , and how he reacted when his brother - in - law assured him that “ Encino Man ” was his best work .
Bullz - Eye : Hello ?
Sean Astin : Hey , is this Will ?
BE : Yes , it is .
SA : Will , it ’s Sean Astin .
BE : Hey , man , how are you doing ?
SA : Good .
I ’m terribly sorry I ’m so late .
You know what happens when the first interview gets behind , and now I ’m just sort of tanked for the rest .
I ’m calling everybody late .
BE : No problem .
I was forewarned , so it ’s not a big deal .
SA : Oh , okay .
BE : So I ’m curious : prior to doing this film , what was your knowledge of “ Discworld ” and the realm of Terry Pratchett ?
On his dreams of being cast in “ The Color of Magic ” : “ I thought , ‘ It ’s going to be an English production , and there ’s no way that I will be considered for it . ’
That was my thought .
Most people read a book and enjoy the story .
I look at it and think , ‘ Dang , I ’m not going to get hired for that job . ”
SA : I had been made aware of it .
I actually met Terry Pratchett three or four years earlier , in New Zealand , when I was doing another Robert Halmi production : “ Hercules . ” Paul Telfer , the English actor who played Hercules , said , “ You have to come down with me ; I ’m going to get a book signed by Terry Pratchett . ”
I had never heard of him .
He explained what the “ Discworld ” was , about the turtles and the elephants and the disc and the whole of the “ Discworld , ” and the wizards and dragons , and I was just really excited .
So I went down with him , and we waited in this long line in Auckland .
We got to the front of the line , he signed our books , and then somebody told him …or maybe I told him or Paul told him or…well , anyway , somebody told him who I was , and he got such a kick out of the fact that there was a hobbit in line .
He just thought that was hilarious .
So we really bonded over that , and we went to a lecture of his .
He ’s really a brilliant man , and I bought every book that they sold of Terry Pratchett ’s at the book store .
I did n’t read all of them right then , but I was actually kind of a devotee , and …as God is my witness , when I was reading “ The Colour of Magic , ” I read Twoflower ’s character – you know , the first description of him – and I had this kind of sad feeling because I thought , “ Of course they ’re going to make this into a movie .
They have to make this into a movie .
With the world of computers and whatever , this is a movie , and if they do n’t make it , I will . ”
That kind of thing .
But I thought , “ It ’s going to be an English production , and there ’s no way that I will be considered for it . ”
That was my thought .
Most people read a book and enjoy the story .
I look at it and think , “ Dang , I ’m not going to get hired for that job . ” ( Laughs )
So I was in my house , three years later or something , I ’m in my room , and my wife Christine came in and says , “ I just got off the phone with the agents , and they …you ’re being offered the role of Twoflower . ”
And she just had the “ Two ” out of her mouth , and my eyes opened up wide .
She finished saying , “ Twoflower in ‘ The Colour of Magic , ’ ” and I just … it was awesome .
I was just floored .
It ’s not like “ Lord of the Rings . ” With “ Lord of the Rings , ” I did n’t know what it was , but then I was desperate to do it , and I was on pins and needles waiting to hear back , and when I finally got it , I was relieved and fell to my knees in thanks to the heavens .
With this one , as soon as she said , I knew exactly what it was , and I knew exactly what I was going to do .
I was just elated .
BE : So after you immediately said , “ Yes , ” did you then suddenly realize it might be a little intimidating doing the work of such an iconic author ?
Or did you get all of that out of your system with “ Lord of the Rings ” ?
( Laughs )
SA : No , you know , I think I was n’t really burdened by that at all during “ Lord of the Rings . ”
It just did n’t bother me .
I knew that …you know , I became more and more aware of what was out there , but I just felt like I owned that experience for myself and that character for myself .
But I lived in perpetual fear , and I continue to of Twoflower and having screwed it up , you know what I mean ?
I think there was a lot about “ Lord of the Rings ” that I did n’t understand .
You know , a lot of the layers and meaning that I just either was n’t old enough or I was just too focused on my life in a particular way or my craft in a particular way .
I think …you know , every time I re-read “ Lord of the Rings ” or read new passages of it or chapters or it now , I think , “ My gosh , how did I miss that ? ”
But I really understood “ The Colour of Magic ” when I was reading it .
I think that level of understanding and how many layers there were and knowing that all of it ca n’t kind of …I definitely was trepiditous and nervous about it , but Terry was incredibly generous , and his enjoyment of what we were doing really kind of put me at greater ease .
Not at total ease , because there are those fans and they are kind of crazy .
BE : Sure .
Now , was there any trepidation , even momentarily , where you were thinking , “ Hmmm , I could get pigeonholed here ” ?
SA : No .
I mean , you ’re definitely aware that there is kind of a niche now .
I ’ve over the last seven years kind of built a science fiction thing , and I like it , it ’s good .
If I thought that it was going to impede my ability to get … I mean , most of the people who are doing more “ serious ” or “ dramatic ” work , or stuff that is n’t genre specific , are n’t really that steeped in the genre stuff .
So the odds of them seeing …even “ Lord of the Rings , ” even as famous and successful and whatever as “ Lord of the Rings , ” you know if you ’ve got somebody who ’s doing a piece on a prison movie or something like that , the odds …it ’s a better than even chance that they wo n’t have seen “ Lord of the Rings . ”
So no , I do n’t worry about being pigeonholed .
Sometimes I worry about getting bored of doing the same thing , but “ The Colour of Magic ” is so fun and interesting .
I always said after “ Lord of the Rings ” that I kind of wished that I could go back and do it again and take myself a little less seriously and enjoy it more .
Well , I got to do that with “ The Colour of Magic . ” I really had fun doing it .
I was determined to have fun , and I did .
BE : So how much of the film required green screen work or staring at things that were n’t actually there ?
SA : A good bit , you know .
A lot .
I mean , I could n’t give you a percentage , but we spent a lot of time with it .
But , you know , I kind of made my piece with that a couple years back .
( Laughs )
But as always , he hired really good actors , and it was a mostly English cast , except for …well , no , Tim Curry is English as well .
Yeah , it was almost entirely an English cast .
There ’s a sense of …I do n’t know , just a confidence about performance , and that ’s the realm you ’re in .
You know , if you ’re on stage in the West End and you ’re doing your performance , you ’re not actually out riding a dragon or something , so there ’s kind of this comfort .
The green screen becomes the fourth wall , almost .
I mean , there is a fourth wall behind you instead of in front of you but you know what I ’m saying .
You ’re inside of yourself .
You ’re inside of your own dynamics of the actor , so it ’s …and , technically , it ’s now getting a lot easier , and not just for the actors .
I mean , actors , I think , are much , much more comfortable now with … not even following a tape mark or Styrofoam , we can actually …a lot of us can , most of us , if not all of us , can see the image in our imagination and the general area where we are supposed to be looking , so you do n’t need all the time , like , a dot on the wall .
You just kind of know what you ’re looking at , and I think that ’s why movies are getting more fun : because the actors really look like they are interacting with those elements .
And the technology itself and the technicians who operate it are all so conversant now that it ’s really about the software .
It ’s really about what you ’re saying , why you ’re saying , and what it is you ’re seeing more than , “ Well , you ’re going to have to look over here , but you ’re not going to see anybody , ” and blah , blah , blah .
So I feel pretty good about it .
BE : You were talking about being in an all - English cast .
You actually had the advantage , I guess , by playing the tourist , so that you could have an American accent .
SA : Yes , there was never any question in anybody ’s mind .
Well , no , maybe we did talk about it for a second , but I think Terry loved it , you know .
Because there is a little bit of …hmm , what ’s the word ?
I ca n’t come up with a word that would be both accurate and flattering .
But there ’s this idea…hmm , a conceit ?
Maybe there ’s a conceit about and kind of a stereotype about Americans that everyone , including myself , was able to enjoy poking fun at .
Which you can only do if you feel confident about yourself and your nationality .
I would have to qualify everything .
But it was fun .
It was fun to be the American on the set .
BE : And you got to wear casual attire for at least a significant portion of it .
SA : I loved it .
BE : How many of those “ tacky tourist ” shirts did you go through ?
SA : Um , I think they had , like , five of them , probably .
But they also had the fabric , and I would cut out the flowers and put two of them …like , two flowers …on my script , or two flowers on the back of my chair .
I just loved the idea of Twoflower .
BE : Oh , nice .
And , y’know , I did n’t realize until today actually that the film had gotten a theatrical release in some markets .
SA : I do n’t know where all it was seen .
I know that it was made , you know , produced by Sky Television .
And it was a major Sky television event in England .
So I do n’t know where all it ’s gone .
I know that Ion is going to be airing it here , since that ’s why we ’re talking today , but I do n’t know what other theatrical venues it ’s been in .
BE : I heard it was playing in New York .
I just did n’t know if you had been able to catch it on the big screen .
SA : No , I have n’t .
BE : So Christopher
Lee does the voice of Death , so did he even turn up on the set ?
I ’d guess that all of his stuff was done in a studio somewhere .
SA : Yeah , Death looped himself .
BE : Seeing Tim Curry and Jeremy Irons doing epic material like that is always fun .
On working with Tim Curry : “ I had n’t seen ‘ Rocky Horror Picture Show ’ when we made the film .
I mean , I had my deference and my reverence and all the things you ’re supposed to have for Tim Curry , ( but ) I just felt …well , really , I felt like I had not done my homework . ”
SA : You know , I did n’t even get to meet Jeremy Irons .
But he was so good .
I mean , he was just so chewing the scenery up with that one .
And Tim , you know I had n’t seen “ Rocky Horror Picture Show ” when we made the film , and I felt this sense of , you know , guilt or whatever .
I just felt …well , really , I felt like I had not done my homework , you know what I mean ?
So my wife took me to see “ Rocky Horror Picture Show , ” and it was , I do n’t know , months and months afterwards .
I mean , I had my deference and my reverence and all the things you ’re supposed to have for Tim Curry , just because of how great he is on so many other things .
My favorite thing was “ Clue . ”
You know , where he ’s playing that butler , and he ’s doing all of the re-enacting at the end of the movie ?
I loved that .
But when I saw what he did in “ Rocky Horror , ” I just thought , “ Ffff … ” ( Trails off )
Well , I ca n’t say it out loud , but , let ’s say , uh , “ Fudge , that ’s crazy ! ” ( Laughs ) _
But , anyway , it was fun to be there .
BE : Cool .
I wanted to ask you about a couple of other things you ’ve been in real quick .
The “ Rudy ” parody on “ My Name is Earl ” was genius .
SA : Ah , most excellent .
Did you see my brother ?
Did you know that was my actual brother ?
My henchman was my brother Mackenzie .
It ’s important to have your own henchmen .
BE : Did you enjoy revisiting the character in a humorous way ?
SA : You know , I did n’t revisit the character .
BE : Well , sorry , not the character but the film .
SA : Yeah , Earl was Rudy .
I do n’t know who I was .
Was I , like , Dan Devine ?
I basically was just there to lend some sort of authenticity to the satire .
But I had fun .
I mean , playing a jerk comes easily to me .
It was cool seeing Charles Dutton and Chelcie there .
That was really cool .
BE : Were you a fan of “ 24 ” before you turned up as Lynn McGill ?
SA : ( Snaps ) Who wants to know ?
( Laughs )
No , y’know , I had seen the pilot right right when it …well , actually , before it even aired because I wanted to be directing television .
I thought it was absolutely brilliant .
I called the agent , and somewhere between the time he put it in the envelope to send to me to look at and the time that I watched it twelve hours later and called him back , it was clear that only the top - flight or experienced directors were going to get a crack at that .
So I did n’t watch it after that .
( Laughs )
And I was at my chiropractors actually , it was n’t even my chiropractor .
I had met Ratzenberger at a big celebrity fundraising poker tournament , and then I saw him in our little community here in Calabasas , at Starbucks or whatever .
He said “ how are you doing ” or whatever , and I told him my back was hurting .
He said , “ Oh , you ’ve got to see Spags , my chiropractor , he ’s walking up in a second . ”
So here walks this Joe Pesci looking guy , Spagnoli , Michael Spagnoli , “ Hey , how you doing ?
Good to see you . ”
He ’s , like , “ Come across the street , I ’ll have a look at you . ”
So I said , “ Okay , I ’ll come over in an hour . ”
So I went over there , and I ’m sitting in the outer waiting room waiting for him , and he comes out and goes , “ Hey , do you like ‘ 24 ’ ? ”
And , of course , I just said , “ Yeah , I love ’ 24 . ’ ”
It was in the third season , or the fourth season was about to start .
So I said , “ I love it , ” even though I did n’t know anything other than the pilot from three years ago .
He said , “ Well , come on and meet the producer , Joel . ”
So he walks me back , and he opens the door , and there is Joel , the producer , in his underwear , face down on the chiropractic table .
He goes , “ Sean loves ’ 24 , ’ ” and he says , “ You do ?
Do you want to be on the show ? ” I said , “ Yeah . ”
He goes , “ Great , you ’re on the show . ”
I said okay , we shook hands , I got my chiropractic adjustment , and went across the street to Barnes and Noble and bought all three seasons of “ 24 , ” went home and watched them in one stretch .
That ’s the way it always seems to work out for me .
BE : Do you have further plans to direct ?
I know you did an episode of “ Angel , ” and you ’ve done several other things too .
SA : Yeah , I would like it very much .
Episodic directing is so … there are so many great directors , and there are only so many slots , so it ’s really competitive .
I think if I was to focus all of my effort and attention on it , I might be able to build over time a good television directing career .
But I sort of have n’t been willing to do that .
You know , I get offered acting jobs , and I go do those .
At some point , I kind of figure somebody who has appreciated my work , who ’s doing a show that I really like , will end up kind of connecting , and I ’ll end up directing maybe an episode of that show , and then maybe I ’ll get to do more .
But it ’s been a little bit of a challenge for me to figure out how to do that .
Having said that , I ’m also adapting … or just finished adapting , with my wife …a screenplay for a book that we optioned called “ Number the Stars . ”
BE : Yeah , I ’m pretty sure I ’ve heard of the book .
“ When somebody brings up a movie that I have n’t heard about in a long time , I feel like …a 70 year - old pitcher at a bar somewhere , and somebody walks in and says , ‘ Oh , my God , I was in St. Louis and I saw you .
You pitched a shutout . ’
It ’s real .
I really did do that . ”
SA : You might ’ve .
It ’s by Louis Lowry , and it won a Newbury Award in ’ 89 , so it ’s been taught in middle schools for 20 or whatever some odd years .
It ’s about two ten - year - old girls in Denmark in 1943 .
One is Jewish and one is Lutheran , and they live in the same apartment building .
And in ’ 43 , the Nazis started to round up the Jews in Denmark , they had n’t done that before hand .
There were about 9,000 Jews in Denmark and the Danish people just would n’t have it .
They smuggled their neighbors and friends and family into fishing boats and however they could , and Sweden , a neutral , agreed to take them .
So the movie is the book , and what will be the movie is the story of these two ten - year - old girls and their friendship , set against that backdrop .
They were very successful .
They rescued 95 % of their Jews .
9,000 some odd Jews were rescued out of like 9,500 .
So I ’m really excited about directing and producing that .
Writing it and producing it with my wife , and then directing it .
We ’re just starting to actually produce it .
We were writing forever , and now it ’s ready and now we ’re producing it .
BE : Is there a particular project that you ’ve worked on over the years that did n’t get the love that you thought it deserved ?
SA : Oh , wow .
Well , you know , nowadays you pretty much know what is going to happen with a movie , you know what I mean ?
A “ Blair Witch ” is really rare , where you go , “ Oh , my God , that little thing that nobody would have ever thought was anything is now 150 million , ” or whatever .
So I did this movie , “ The Final Season , ” this baseball movie in Iowa , and I knew it would be a really strong home video title and cable and whatever , and we kind of hoped it would get a theatrical release .
And it got a theatrical release , but it was kind of limited .
We knew who was paying for the P.R. campaign , we knew what kinds of screens it was in , and it just did n’t do very well theatrically , which we kind of expected .
So I do n’t know if I would have thought it should have gotten more recognition .
In fact , now in my kids school , people are coming up to me everyday because so and so , their friend from Iowa said , or so and so who’s
little league manager said .
So it ’s doing exactly what I thought it would do , which is to have its own life on DVD and satellite and whatever else .
So I ’m just trying to think … there was a movie that I did called “ Caught in the Act , ” it was released as “ Caught in the Act ” .
Oh no , sorry .
“ Caught in the Act ” is what we filmed it as .
It was released as “ Bigger …
BE : “ Bigger Than the Sky ” ?
SA : Yeah , “ Bigger Than the Sky . ”
Anyway , I loved that and I thought that was really sweet and really funny .
I do n’t think anybody saw it .
It ’s one of my favorite characters that I ’ve ever played .
Ken Zorbell was like this pompous actor , prancing around the stage , saying , “ I ’m an actor , I ca n’t work with this . ”
And my mom is in it .
She plays a little satire on her “ Patty Duke Show ” by playing two characters , like a kind of school marm , officious lady and then the kind of boozy , wardrobe lady .
So that was kind of fun .
I got a real kick out of that .
But I do n’t think many people saw it .
That ’s one that I think was deserving .
You know : could have , should have , would have gotten more attention .
Other ones , you kinda know what they are when you make them .
They get the attention that they are meant to get .
BE : Is there any film on your resume that people regularly come up to you and cite as a favorite that still surprises you ?
I mean , where it ’s a case of , “ Really ?
That ’s what you remember me for ? ”
SA : Well , there are several .
There ’s “ Harrison Bergeron ” every now and then .
And it ’s not just the fact that they bring it up , but it ’s the intensity with which they talk about it .
It was a Kurt Vonnegut adapted short story , and people really … some people really connect to it .
“ Encino Man ” is one that …not withstanding the fact that my brother - in - law , when he was 16 , and he was probably 12 when we made the film , but a few years later said “ Sean , ‘ Encino Man ’ is your best work . ”
First of all , I did n’t even know if he knew what that meant .
When people come up to me , I always think of my brother - in - law saying that to me .
What else is surprising ?
There are a few that when people say stuff I kind of …I ’ve almost forgotten about it .
‘ Toy Soldiers ” is one I was always proud of , that I had a good time with .
Every now and then somebody will throw that out there .
“ Where the Day Takes You , ” where I played a drug addict .
BE : Yeah , I remember that .
SA : Yeah , every now and then … ( Pauses )
You remember all of these ?
BE : Well , I definitely remember that one .
Lara Flynn Boyle was in it .
SA : Yeah .
Dermot Mulroney , too .
And it was Will Smith ’s first movie .
So there was a good cast in it .
But , you know , people will come up and they will say it and it almost …
I feel like an old pitcher , you know .
A 70 year - old pitcher at a bar somewhere , and somebody walks in and says , “ Oh , my God , I was in St. Louis and I saw you .
You pitched a shutout . ”
It ’s real .
I really did do that , because someone today remembers it .
That ’s the feeling I always get when somebody brings up a movie that I have n’t heard about in a long time .
BE : And last one : I swore to myself I would n’t let you get off the phone without getting the latest status of the long gestating “ Goonies ” sequel .
SA : I maintain now , as I always have , that it will happen .
I can offer no more details than that , but I say with certainty that “ The Hobbit ” will happen and “ Goonies 2 ” will happen .
BE : You can offer me no further specifics ?
SA : I can offer you no specifics .
Call it intuition , reading the tea leaves , whatever you want , but I am absolutely convinced both of those things will happen .
BE : Fair enough .
I ’ll take that .
SA : Look , I ’m just hurting myself because you go ahead and print that , and then everybody reads it or hears it will be , “ So I heard you said it ’s going to happen , what do you know ? ”
Well no , I just meant that I know in my heart and maybe a little more than my heart that it ’s going to happen .
BE : I talked to Ian McKellen two months ago and asked him about “ The Hobbit , ” and he said , “ There is no contract , but I have set aside 2010 for a trip to New Zealand , ” and that ’s all he would say .
SA : Well , he was reported to sort of be lock , stock , and …well , he was reported to be in it .
BE : He said it came down to him just waiting for them to make sure that Guillermo was up for him being in it because he did n’t know if Guillermo wanted him to stick with Peter Jackson ’s casting or if he wanted to have his complete own vision .
But he said he definitely got the impression they were going to maintain the same sensibility between the two .
SA : Well , you know , you ’ve got to dance with the girl that brung you .
But I ’m sure he ’ll have his own thing .
You know , I hear different things , and I have no independent knowledge of anything that ’s going on with it .
I would n’t expect to be asked to go back down there .
Obviously , I would if I was .
Oh , it ’s going to be brilliant if and when they make it .
When they make it , it ’s going to be brilliant .
BE : And if they call you will come running ?
SA : Of course .
They know that .
Running , flying , swimming , boating , yachting , whatever .
BE : Whatever it takes to get there .
Whatever it takes .
A dragon , even .
I ’ll take a colored , magic dragon down there .
By any means necessary .
Last night , I attended a workshop about “ homosexual activism in the public schools . ”
The meeting took place at a church and it was sponsored by the Illinois Family Institute , a conservative group .
About 80 people were packed into a tiny room .
My observations :
I overheard one man sitting near me talking to a friend of his before the event started .
He quoted the Edmund Burke line , “ All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . ”
He was referring to homosexual activists versus Christians .
Funny .
I was thinking the same line , but in a completely different way …
line , “ All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . ”
He was referring to homosexual activists versus Christians .
The speaker spoke about the myth that Christians “ hate ” homosexuals .
We do n’t hate homosexuals , she said , adding : “ We ’re not like Fred Phelps ! ”
So at least we have that in common .
We all think Phelps is one crazy mofo .
They may not hate homosexuals , but they do hate homosexuality .
( And apparently , they hate the word “ gay . ”
Because it was barely uttered all evening .
“ Homosexual ” must sound more evil and un-Christian . )
! ” I learned it ’s ok to say being gay is wrong .
We ca n’t worry about hurting people ’s feelings .
If we did , that would make it impossible for us to say plagiarism and promiscuity are wrong because that would hurt the feelings of plagiarists and promiscuous people .
Therefore , it ’s ok to attack homosexuality .
I ’ll admit that ’s the first time I ’ve heard homosexuality compared to plagiarism .
The speaker told the crowd that speaking out against homosexuality was not hate speech .
Her argument for this ?
“ Homosexual supporters speak out against polygamy and pedophiles all the time .
Is that considered hate speech ?
No .
So neither is our anti-gay speech . ”
Not for the first time that evening , she compared gay people to pedophiles .
The speaker mentioned a local high school in which students “ had to read ” Tony Kushner ‘s play “ Angels in America . ”
She asked if everyone picked up the handout listing excerpts from the book ( after warning us that it would be graphic ) .
This was how she began a part of her talk against those homosexual activist English teachers .
There was no mention of the facts that excerpts do not a book make .
( You want to play the excerpt game ?
You want to take things out of context ?
Because the Bible is great fodder for that . )
There was no mention that the book was for an Advanced Placement class for seniors , or that parents had to approve the book first before their children could read it ( or opt for an alternative book instead , which would be ok ) , or that only a handful of students ( and their parents ) decided to take the alternative option .
Most were fine with the book .
‘s play “ Angels in America . ”
She asked if everyone picked up the handout listing excerpts from the book ( after warning us that it would be graphic ) .
There were several jabs at homosexual teachers and superintendents and administrators ( they named names ) who were trying to push that awful , hideous belief that it was ok to be gay .
( Can you believe their gall ? ! )
There was a lot of talk about the upcoming Day of Silence , during which gay students and straight allies choose not to speak for the day to bring attention to the silencing experienced by GLBT students .
IFI wants parents to remove their children from the classroom for the day if students are taking part in this .
The speaker ’s arguments ?
Let me quote from her handout ( PDF ) : Parents should call their children ’s middle schools and high schools to ask whether the administration and / or teachers will be permitting students to remain silent during class on the Day of Silence .
If students will be permitted to remain silent , parents can express their opposition most effectively by calling their children out of school on the Day of Silence and sending letters of explanation to their administrators , their children ’s teachers , and all school board members .
One reason this is effective is that most school districts lose money for each student absence .
School administrators err when they allow the classroom to be disrupted and politicized by granting students permission to remain silent throughout an entire day .
The DOS requires that teachers either create activities around the silence of some or many , or exempt silent students from any activity that involves speaking .
Furthermore , DOS participants have a captive audience , many of whom disagree with and are made uncomfortable by the politicization of their classroom .
I teach high school students .
Some of them are silent every day .
I do n’t see Christian parents complaining about that .
Also , the DOS does n’t “ require ” anything .
It ’s sponsors do n’t run my classroom and I ’m not required to “ do ” anything .
Personally , I think it ’s irresponsible of teachers to be silent on that day because we still have a job to do ( just like pharmacists should n’t be able to not sell people birth control or morning - after pills because of their own beliefs ) , but it ’s fine if students want to be silent for one day — it wo n’t throw me off as a teacher .
I can still do my job .
I ’m amazed these parents are willing to remove their kids from a day of instruction because other students are choosing to remain silent for a day .
Are you kidding me ?
The Day of Silence thing reminded me of a similar incident happening earlier this year .
In fact , when you put these incidents together , the IFI sounds downright hypocritical .
Earlier this year , I had students remaining silent because of the Pro-Life Day of Silent Solidarity .
It was fine by me and I taught my lessons as planned .
But how come I was n’t hearing anything about that day ?
Would the speakers be in favor of pro-choice parents removing their students from the classroom ?
They never mentioned that .
So I asked them about it .
The conversation went something like this :
Me : Is n’t the pro-life silence day the exact same idea as the Day of Silence ?
Them : Umm … yes .
And we do not support the pro-life silence day .
Me : Well , that ’s good to hear .
But I do n’t remember getting any press releases from your organization asking parents to remove their children from school because some students were also going to remain silent for political reasons and personal beliefs .
Them : Umm … yeah … we should really have sent one out about that .
I ’m not keeping my fingers crossed that they ’ll mention it next year .
A quick search on IFI ’s website lists several results dealing with the Day of Silence .
I ca n’t find a single result having to do with the Day of Solidarity .
When the speaker discussed how many schools were putting on the pro-homosexual play “ The Laramie Project , ” she tried to cite a dubious 20 / 20 segment in which it was asserted that Matthew Shepard was not killed in a hate crime , but rather that he was the victim of a drug - induced rage .
That segment has been debunked , but we did n’t hear that side of the story .
And really , going after Matthew Shepard and the play written about him ?
That was low .
was not killed in a hate crime , but rather that he was the victim of a drug - induced rage .
That segment has been debunked , but we did n’t hear that side of the story .
During any mention of the word “ transgender , ” there was something of an eye roll from the speaker and people in the audience .
It was obvious the speaker did n’t think transgendered people actually existed .
“ A man is not a woman , ” she said , adding that her mother had cancer and had to get her uterus removed , but that did n’t make her any less of a woman .
I failed to see any connection .
The speaker said she knew one student who “ claimed ” to be transgendered .
He said he was a woman trapped in a man ’s body .
I knew that boy well , she said .
“ He was troubled . ”
The speaker mentioned the homosexual agenda .
Not just as a general idea , though .
She mentioned an actual , specific agenda written by Harvard - trained psychologists Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen .
I ’d never heard of them … am I the only one that does n’t know who to take my orders from ?
and .
I ’d never heard of them … am I the only one that does n’t know who to take my orders from ?
My favorite line of the night , referring to how Christians need to fight back against the gays :
“ There ’s a great reluctance of churches in getting involved in the political arena . ”
They did n’t really say that , did they ?!
Yes .
Yes they did .
It was pointed out that being anti-gay does not constitute prejudice .
We are not pre-judging , they said .
We are coming to our conclusions after careful consideration !
Therefore , it is not technically prejudice .
I guess they won the battle of semantics … so make sure you do n’t call homophobic people prejudiced .
They ’re not prejudiced .
They ’re “ Christians who love everybody . ”
Got it ?
One bright side to all this : I found out we liberals are winning the Culture Wars !
( Congratulations , you sodomites ! )
The first 20 minutes of the talk , I wondered how much of my own rhetoric I ’d be willing to say to their faces .
I concluded I would probably tone it down a bit … try to engage them more .
Maybe speak their language .
As the evening progressed , I became less eager to please them or to even talk to them .
I wanted to point out all the flaws in their thinking , all the parts where they were n’t telling the whole story , all the times they were flat out lying to the audience .
I really wanted to know what the speaker would have said if there were openly gay people in the audience .
The speaker made a point to say that there was a Facebook group against her formed by students at the school at which she used to work .
A transgendered student wrote to the group that she was actually a nice lady .
As the student did this , the speaker did n’t even acknowledge the student ’s sexual identity — could n’t even fathom that there was a real issue there .
I did n’t see that “ nice lady ” side of her , and the more she speak , the more I felt the desire to stoop to her level .
It ’s not a side of me I want to see come out .
Afterwards , I walked out of the church and away from that group of people .
And good riddance .
I should point out one additional part to this story .
When I mentioned the other day that I was attending this event , I got an email from an acquaintance .
She asked if I was going to this particular church ( she gave me a name ) for the event .
That was the one I was going to .
It turns out that ’s her regular church .
She would n’t be able to make it that night , but she wanted to let me know that the church did a lot of great things to support the local community and the people there were really nice and caring .
I really believe her .
I believe that they mean well and they have the best of intentions .
But , as I told my friend , it ’s hard for me to focus on that side when at the same time they are propagating these ridiculous notions .
It ’s also hard to believe I ’m the only person there who felt that way .
I did n’t really say much at the event .
I basically listened to them and observed other people .
But I wonder if I was the only person there last night who held a contrary view to what was being said .
Where were the Christians who believe that it ’s ok to be gay — that God loves gay people and straight people equally ?
Why were n’t they there to ask questions and challenge what was being said ?
Is what I saw typical of what others have seen ?
Almost mistaken for a pile of onions , these prizes in a Japanese boob claw machine beat almost every stuffed animal we can think of in terms of uniqueness .

A popular smoking cessation drug dramatically reduced the amount a heavy drinker will consume , a new Yale School of Medicine study has found .
Heavy - drinking smokers in a laboratory setting were much less likely to drink after taking the drug varenicline compared to those taking a placebo , according to a study published online in the journal Biological Psychiatry .
The group taking varenicline , sold as a stop - smoking aid under the name Chantix , reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol and less intoxicated when they did drink .
They were also much more likely to remain abstinent after being offered drinks than those who received a placebo , the study found .
Additionally , there were no adverse effects associated with combining varenicline with alcohol in the doses studied .
When combined with low doses of alcohol , varenicline did not change blood pressure or heart rate , nor did it seem to induce nausea or dizziness .
" We anticipate that the results of this preliminary study will trigger clinical trials of varenicline as a primary treatment for alcohol use disorders , and as a potential dual treatment for alcohol and tobacco use disorders , " said Sherry McKee , associate professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study .
Smokers are more likely to drink alcohol and to consume greater quantities of alcohol , and they are four times more likely to meet criteria for alcohol use disorders .
Diseases related to tobacco use are the leading causes of death in alcoholics .
" A medication such as varenicline , which may target shared biological systems in alcohol and nicotine use , holds promise as a treatment for individuals with both disorders " according to McKee .
McKee said that 80 % of participants receiving varenicline did not take a drink at all , compared to 30 % of the placebo group .
The findings suggest that varenicline has the potential to be at least as effective in reducing drinking as naltrexone , another drug found to reduce alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers .
Unlike naltrexone , varenicline is not metabolized by the liver and may be safe to use by those with impaired liver function , a frequent consequence of heavy alcohol use , McKee said .

Cars , power plants and factories in the United States could all soon face much tougher pollution limits after a government declaration Friday set the stage for the first federal regulation of gases blamed for global warming .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a big step in that direction , concluding that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases are a major hazard to Americans ' health .
That was a reversal from former president George W. Bush 's administration , which resisted such a conclusion and said it would be costly for companies to meet new emission limits and therefore could harm the national economy .
" In both magnitude and probability , climate change is an enormous problem [ and ] the greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endangered public health and welfare , " said the EPA , concluding the dangers warrant action under federal air pollution laws .
It was the first time the federal government had said it was ready to use the Clean Air Act to require power plants , cars and trucks to curtail their release of climate - changing pollution , especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels .
The agency said the science pointing to man-made pollution as a cause of global warming is " compelling and overwhelming . "
It also said tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles contribute .
EPA administrator Lisa Jackson cautioned that regulations are not imminent and made clear that the Obama administration would prefer that Congress address the climate issue through a broader " cap- and - trade " program that would limit heat - trapping pollution .
Though quite uncommon it is not entirely outrageous for people to have covert hidden places inside their home .
These places sometimes act as a panic room that keeps the inhabitants of the home secure during an emergency .
But more often it is for the sheer thrill of having a secret niche within their homes that makes people design these spaces .
Here are a few such secret places that we uncovered !
A very notable firm that does business in this line is Creative Home Engineering .
They have an impressive array of hidden passageways , book cases that coceal secret routes and many ways to cover up secret rooms .
Here is another trick bookcase !

Having hidden places may be fun , but we shudder at what could happen to a person if they fall into one such place accidentally .

A few miles from California 's state capitol , on a pasture of land bounded by a railroad track and the tranquil American river , a large cluster of homeless men and women has settled in what 's been dubbed Tent City .
With perhaps hundreds of makeshift tents , no running water or bathrooms , and trash strewn everywhere , the encampment conjures up images of populations from developing countries living in America - so stunning it drew Oprah Winfrey 's attention last month , and then a crush of national and international media coverage .
Now , Tent City is coming down .
Sacramento , California , mayor Kevin Johnson said yesterday officials plan to close the encampment within the next few weeks and move residents to shelters , apartments , and other accommodations .
" We 're not going to go in and sweep them out of there , " the mayor said at a news conference .
" We 've got to have tough love , but we 've got to be compassionate . "
The burst of media coverage is not the kind of publicity the mayor , a former basketball star , might have hoped for during his first months in office .
Some stories portrayed Tent City as a modern day Hooverville , a reference to the shantytowns built by homeless men driven into poverty during the Great Depression .
With foreclosure rates in the Sacramento region among the highest in the US , the ragtag camp has been depicted as a symbol of the economic meltdown - people who'd lost their homes and were suddenly pitching tents along a riverbed .
The truth is somewhat less dramatic .
Although a sliver of the roughly 200 Tent City residents are recently working - class people who lost their homes , the overwhelming majority – 80 % to 90 % by several estimates - have been homeless for years , even decades .
Some residents said yesterday they have enjoyed the camaraderie of Tent City .
" We all take care of each other , " said Michelle Holbrook , 34 , who arrived with her dog , Angel , about a month ago after losing her job caring for an elderly man .
" I 've become the camp mother - I do most of the cooking and make hot water for coffee . "
Still , living conditions are deplorable .
Yesterday , one woman used a jug of water to bathe herself next to her tent .
With no portable toilets , a man said he had no choice but to relieve himself a short distance from the living area .
Although a garbage company recently placed a dumpster nearby , litter is everywhere .
" It 's nicer than being in prison , " said David Ewing , 39 , who has lived within a half - mile of the Tent City site for nine years .
" But it 's a little bit rough out here . "
Loaves & Fishes , a homeless facility about a 10 - minute walk from Tent City , has provided meals and showers for the encampment dwellers .
And in recent weeks , shelter officials have assumed the additional duty of ushers to news reporters and TV crews .
" What 's different about the tent city is that so many people are gathered in such a visible site , " said Joan Burke , Loaves & Fishes ' director of advocacy .
" I think the media attention is a positive because it lets the public know there are people actually living in third world conditions . "
Typically the homeless are n't allowed to gather in such large numbers , but a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of the homeless against the city and county , combined with the media attention , caused law enforcement to ease up on enforcement of the city 's anti-camping ordinance .
" It sort of created a window of tolerance , " said Tim Brown , who oversees a Sacramento initiative to end chronic homelessness .
Some Tent City residents are anxious about the pending shutdown and the prospect of moving again , but others are taking a wait - and - see approach .
" Right now it 's day by day , and whatever happens happens , " Holbrook said .
While the impression of Tent City as a haven for foreclosure victims is n't accurate , it is true economic stress is driving up demand for homeless and social services in the area .
The director of Sacramento's St John 's Shelter for Women and Children , Michele Steeb , said she 's now having to turn away more than 200 people each night , a tenfold increase from just two years ago .
Many of the women seeking help lost jobs recently , or were forced out of their apartments or homes when landlords lost their properties to foreclosure .
" We are seeing a lot more people affected by this economy , " Steeb said .
City leaders are grappling with how to respond to the bigger problem , realising the measures announced yesterday may dismantle Tent City , but they wo n't eliminate the forces that created it .
Some have suggested the city officially sanction a Tent City at a different site in Sacramento , and provide water and sanitation .
Other cities , such as Portland , Oregon and Phoenix , Arizona , have created tent encampments for the homeless .
" I do think , " Johnson said , " that a tent city could potentially be a viable option . "

When art conservators joined hands to restore two rare portraits of Shakespeare they thought they were removing paint daubed on the canvases more than 100 years after the Bard 's death to reveal " authentic " portraits beneath .
Now it has emerged they were , in fact , wiping away priceless insights into the changing appearance of Britain 's greatest playwright .
The images which had been superimposed on both paintings had actually been painted in Shakespeare 's own lifetime , the Art Newspaper will reveal next week , and showed how he looked as he aged .
The so - called " restoration " could now go down in art history as one of the biggest blunders on record .

A newly discovered picture of Shakespeare called the Cobbe portrait ( painted when he was still living ) and another version called the Folger portrait were both irreversibly " cleaned up " in this way .
New research has revealed both portraits were probably altered during Shakespeare 's lifetime , or within a decade or so of his death in 1616 , while his friends and associates were still alive .
In the Cobbe portrait , the sitter was given a bouffant hairstyle , whereas in the Folger portrait , his hair at the front was replaced by a bald forehead .
But why the changes ?
The Cobbe work is believed to have been painted for the Earl of Southampton .
The Shakespeare expert Stanley Wells suggests the Bard had dedicated his erotic sonnets to him .
It is possible the Earl may have wanted a more flattering image .
The Folger portrait , on the other hand , may have been altered to reflect Shakespeare 's appearance at the time of his death , six years after the original painting .
The original represented Shakespeare aged 46 .
Rupert Featherstone , director of the Hamilton Kerr Institute in Cambridge , which undertook technical investigations into the Cobbe portrait , admitted that in hindsight , it was unfortunate conservators had removed the overpaint .
" We can no longer peer down a microscope to look at the physical evidence of the overpaint , " he said .
When the overpaint was removed from the two portraits , in 1988 and 2002 , it was not thought that either depicted Shakespeare .
Some critics doubted that the Bard sat for either portrait .
The Cobbe portrait was restored in 2002 as part of ongoing conservation work of the Cobbe family 's pictures .
It was then thought that it depicted an unknown sitter by an anonymous artist .
The conservation work was undertaken by Mr Cobbe , who is a professional restorer .
Research now shows the Cobbe painting is an original portrait completed in Shakespeare 's lifetime , and that the Folger picture is an early copy , painted in 1610 when the playwright was still alive .
Mr Cobbe now believes his portrait may have had the hair repainted as early as a few months after the original work had been completed in 1610 .
The Folger painting , which was conserved in 1988 , is in the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington .
It was acquired in 1932 as an image of Shakespeare , but later downgraded to an anonymous portrait .
The Android Dev Phone 1
Did you know ...?

Your editor 's long - suffering spouse will attest that gadgets are never in short supply in the house .
Many of them pass below her interest , but a new one has come in which has attracted attention throughout the household : an Android Dev Phone , otherwise known as the fully unlocked version of the G1 phone offered by T - Mobile .
This phone is certainly a fun toy , but it has the potential to be a lot more than that .
The details of this device have been well publicized for a while now .
It includes a nice touchscreen display , QWERTY keyboard , GPS receiver , accelerometer , 3.2 megapixel camera , and more .
The whole thing is powered by Google 's Linux - based Android platform .
The Dev Phone is essentially the same device as that sold by T - Mobile , but with a crucially important difference : it is unlocked in all senses .
This means not just that it can be used with any mobile carrier 's SIM , but also that the base operating software has not been locked down .
This is a phone for which the entire system can be rebuilt and replaced at will .
The Dev Phone thus joins the OpenMoko Neo Freerunner on the very short list of truly open mobile handsets .
This device , though , has the advantage of being a bit more of a finished product with what appears to be a rather stronger software development team behind it .
It also , for what it 's worth , has some nice hardware capabilities that the Neo lacks : quad - band GSM , 3G ( though not on the bands used by your editor 's carrier , alas ) , keyboard , etc .
Your editor believes that it will be a successful product .
Over the course of the next few months , your editor plans to dig into this device and report on what he finds .
How open is the device really ?
What does it take to put a new kernel onto it ?
What might it take to put a different operating system onto it altogether ?
And , in general , how does this whole Android thing work ?
Assuming that he does not brick the device early on , your editor hopes to get a real sense for what can be done with this device , how close its software is to what we normally think of as Linux , and where it might go into the future .
It should be a fun project .
First , though , one has to get through the stage of simply playing with the new toy .
So the rest of this article will be a user - level review of sorts .
The hardware : it feels generally solid .
The device is larger and heavier than handsets your editor has used in the past , but that is to be expected .
The keyboard works better than one might think given its size ; even your relatively fat - fingered editor is able to type with reasonable speed and accuracy .
The vibrator lacks strength .
The camera seems to take nice photos ( for a phone camera ) , but it is exceedingly slow .
As with most color - screen devices , the display is entirely unreadable when the backlight is off .
A nice touch with this phone is an indicator LED which blinks when the phone has something to tell you - an unread text message , for example - but the use of the LED seems to be somewhat inconsistent .
Your editor has yet to get a sense for what the battery life would be in the absence of children playing with the device all day long .
Complaints about battery life can be found on the net , but it appears that the phone should be able to get through two or three days of moderate usage where the GPS receiver is off most of the time .
On the other hand , if you let your kids use it to mess around on video sites , the battery runs down relatively quickly .
On the software side , this phone gets off to a bit of a rough start .
It first requires the user to configure the phone to access data service from the carrier , a process which must be done by hand if that carrier is not T - Mobile .
Your editor 's last new phone recognized the carrier from the SIM and handled this task automatically .
More annoying , though , is that the phone requires the creation of a Gmail account as part of its setup process .
The fact that one does not have - and does not want - such an account is not relevant .
So now your editor has an entry in the Gmail account database which will never be used .
That , of course , ties in to why Google has gotten into this exercise in the first place .
There are many features of the Android platform which are designed to tie the user in more closely to services provided by Google .
Some features , such as the calendar , are really just an extension of the online offerings .
The phone wants to sync the contacts list to ... somewhere ... and turning the feature off leads to unpleasant behavior .
It is possible to use many of the features of the device without connecting back to the Google mother ship , but it 's not the natural mode of operation .
Another example is email handling .
There is a separate icon for Gmail which just works ; that application offers the features ( such as threading ) provided by that service .
One can run a different mail application to connect to a POP or IMAP account somewhere , but it 's a separate setup process .
Later , with luck , one discovers the improved K9 client , which must be installed separately and which requires one to go through the setup process again .
Even with K9 , the non-Gmail mail client is not what it should be .
There is no threading of messages , many basic commands ( refiling messages , for example ) are missing , etc .
Then there 's little problems like refusing to connect to a server if it does n't think it can trust the SSL certificate and failing to authenticate if the user 's password contains special characters .
One assumes that this client will improve , or that other clients will be ported to the platform , but , for now , it does n't seem to be a priority for the Android developers .
More generally , though , the Android software is pretty slick .
A fair amount of thought has been given to how interaction should work on this kind of device .
Once one gets used to a few specific differences ( holding a finger on an item on the screen for a few seconds often brings up otherwise hidden options , for example ) , navigating through applications comes fairly naturally .
Only in some cases do inconsistencies pop up - some applications have different notions for how to zoom in and out than others is one that your editor has noticed .
As a whole , the interface comes across as polished and attractive .
That said , use of the display could be improved .
On a small display , there will always be a certain tension between getting enough information on - screen and avoiding the creation of headaches through severe eye strain .
Different users will do better with small fonts than others .
But if Android offers an option to configure default font sizes , your editor cannot find it .
So it becomes necessary to manually zoom almost every web page , almost every email , etc. to get a sufficient amount of information onto the screen .
That gets a little tiresome after a while .
The " Android Market " offers a wealth of applications , most of which are available as free software or , at least , in a free - beer mode .
When browsing applications , one runs into the Android security model , which is oriented around a long set of capabilities which can be granted to applications .
A program which needs do things like access the net , obtain location data , change hardware settings , etc. must declare the capabilities it needs ; these are then presented to the user at installation time .
Most users will probably just say " yes , " but it is worth taking a closer look .
Your editor decided to decline the installation of a Mahjongg game after being unable to figure out why it was asking for full network access .
Beyond the inevitable games ( including one of the worst Tetris implementations seen in a while ) , there is a wide variety of available applications .
The " Locale " tool makes up for the ( surprising ) lack of the sort of " profile " feature found on almost every handset your editor has ever seen ; it performs tricks like using the GPS receiver to automatically change profiles when the phone enters the office or a theater .
The " bubble " application ( shown on the left ) turns the handset into a portable level .
There 's no shortage of " smart shopper " applications , most of which can read a barcode using the camera and look up prices for items .
There is a " power manager " which attempts to configure the device for optimal power use in a number of situations ; it provides a basic profile functionality as well , though the user should be prepared to spend some time configuring the options into a workable form .
There 's plenty of travel - oriented applications which will fetch weather reports , currency rates , or call a taxi .
One notable omission , with both the base phone and the available applications , is voice over IP functionality .
This handset should be able to do VOIP beautifully , but almost no such functionality is available .
There appears to be a tool for Skype users , but that 's about it .
There are a couple of applications that are of particular interest to your editor .
ConnectBot is an SSH client which works surprisingly well ; the developers are clearly working toward the creation of a tool useful for people logging into Linux - like systems .
And the terminal emulator provides that all - important feature : a shell prompt on the device .
Even more fun , on the Dev Phone , a simple " su " with no password will yield a root shell .
Playing around on the device , your editor sees that the ARM processor provides a mighty 383 bogomips .
It appears to have a little over 100 MB of usable memory .
It 's running a 2.6.25 kernel ( known to be heavily modified ) with a single loadable module called " wlan . "
And so on .
As useful as the keyboard is , trying to use it to type commands at a shell which lacks a history mechanism gets painful after a while .
Time to go looking for an SSH server .
There are other useful applications , of course , such as the one which actually makes phone calls .
Like the others , it lacks perfection , but one can only assume that , on a platform driven by free software , that imperfect applications will be improved or replaced .
How easy it is to do such things is part of what your editor intends to find out in the coming months .
Stay tuned .

FDA funded research at the University of Texas show that watermelon can boost libido .
It turns out that this delicious and watery fruit contains citrulline amino acid .
Citrulline is beneficial to our cardiovascular system and also helps relax the blood vessels and increase sex drive .
In fact , watermelon influences our body the way well - know Viagra does , but without adverse effects .
Note : Eating 6 slices of watermelon is enough to boost your sex drive .
It should bring the same effect you get after taking one Viagra pill .

The global derivatives market exposure is worth $ 1.144 QUADRILLION .
That 's $ 190,000 for every human being on Earth .
Something tells me that most of those derivatives ain't worth the hard - drive sectors they 're stored on .
Whilst outstanding derivatives are notional amounts until they are crystallised , actual exposure is measured by the net credit equivalent .
This is normally a lower figure unless many variables plot a locus in the wrong direction simultaneously .
This could be because of catastrophic unpredictable events , ie , " Black Swans " , such as cascades of bankruptcies and nationalisations , when the net exposure can balloon and become considerably larger or indeed because some extremely dislocating geo-political or geo-physical events take place simultaneously .
Also , the notional value becomes real value when either counterparty to the OTC derivative goes bankrupt .
This means that no large OTC derivative house can be allowed to go broke without falling into the arms of another .
Whatever funds within reason are required to rescue failing international investment banks , deposit banks and financial entities ought to be provided on a case by case basis .
This is the asymmetric nature of derivatives and here lies the potential for systemic risk to the global economic system and financial markets if nothing is done .
Would you refuse -- for your parent , your child or yourself -- a treatment for a terrible ailment because it was developed with embryonic stem cell research ?
Would you want your doctor to keep you in the dark about such a treatment because he or she is morally opposed to it ?
Before I get into the arguments about the ethics of embryonic stem cell research , I wanted to get those questions out there .
The issues at hand are not just arguments for scientists , politicians , clergy and theologians .
These are questions that you and I may one day face .
On Friday the White House confirmed with Mark Memmott at The Oval that on Monday President Obama will address the Bush administration restrictions that limited researchers using federal funds to just 22 embryonic stem cell lines , while there are 1,000 or more available today .
And unquestionably , there are some tough calls ahead .
Rep. John Boehner ( R - OH ) is certain that the same goals of medical science and research can be reached with adult , cord blood , and pluripotent stem cells .
He said ,
Taxpayer dollars should not aid the destruction of innocent human life .
But the Rev. Thomas Reese a senior fellow , Woodstock Theological Center , Georgetown University and a Jesuit priest who is squarely opposed to abortion , points out that Obama could put limits on this research .
Such limits may make it " less ethically repugnant " by moving toward what he calls " middle ground . "
Embryos for research should only be excess embryos from fertility clinics , embryos which were going to be destroyed anyway .
It should be forbidden to buy , cell or create embryos expressly for research .
Researchers should show that their work could not be done with any other form of stem cell -- yet .
But their goal should be to move toward using only non-embryonic stem cells , Reese suggests .
I 've never seen anyone move to middle ground on this issue .
Have you ?
Do you think such suggestions could work ?
Or are we Americans , legendary for impatience , in such a rush to find treatments or cures for dread diseases that we want research to proceed on every scientific front right now ?
Consider :
Not everyone has the same understanding of the status and value of the embryo .
Not every culture , religion and philosophy is in alignment on the ethics of research that destroys embryos .
And consider where this is all headed -- toward medical treatments or cures .
This brings me back to my opening questions .
If this research is eventually successful in the lab , those questions could be coming to home to all of us .
Would you accept the benefits of research you opposed ?

The world 's best efforts at combating climate change are likely to offer no more than a 50 - 50 chance of keeping temperature rises below the threshold of disaster , according to research from the UK Met Office .
The key aim of holding the expected increase to 2C , beyond which damage to the natural world and to human society is likely to be catastrophic , is far from assured , the research suggests , even if all countries engage forthwith in a radical and enormous crash programme to slash greenhouse gas emissions – something which itself is by no means guaranteed .
The chilling forecast from the supercomputer climate model of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research will provide a sobering wake - up call for governments around the world , who will begin formally negotiating three weeks today the new international treaty on tackling global warming , which is due to be signed in Copenhagen in December .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The treaty , which is due to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , is widely seen as the Last Chance Saloon for the community of nations to take effective action against the greatest threat the world has ever faced .
But the Met Office 's new prediction hits directly at the principle guiding all those hoping for an effective agreement , with the European Union in the lead : that of stopping the warming at two degrees Centigrade above the " pre-industrial " level ( the level of average world temperature pertaining two hundred years ago ) .
Today , world average temperatures stand at about 0.75C above the pre-industrial , and many scientists and politicians agree that further increases have to be stopped at 2C if catastrophic impacts from the warming are to be avoided , ranging from widespread agricultural failure and worldwide sea level rise , to countless species extinctions and irreversible melting of the world 's great ice sheets .
But the Hadley Centre 's simulation indicates that even if global emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas causing the warming , were to be slashed at a very high rate the chances of holding the rise at the C threshold are no better than even .
The scenario , prepared for Britain 's Climate Change Committee , the body recommending the UK 's future carbon " budgets " , visualises world CO2 emissions peaking in 2015 , and then falling at a top rate of 3 per cent a year , to reach emissions of 50 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
At the moment , global emissions are thought to be rising at nearly 3 per cent a year – so turning that into a 3 per cent annual cut would be a gigantic slashing of what the earth 's factories and motor vehicles are pumping into the atmosphere .
There is as yet nothing remotely like that on the table for potential agreement in Copenhagen , and if a deal of this ambition were to be done , it would be regarded as a triumph .
Yet even with that , the Hadley Centre research suggests , the chances of keeping the rise down to about 2C by 2100 would be only 50 - 50 .
Furthermore , the simulations suggest that there is a worst - case scenario – about a 10 per cent chance – of the rise by the end of the current century reaching , even with these drastic cuts , a level of 2.8C above the pre-industrial , which is well into disaster territory .
With any action that is slower than the scenario above , the likeliest outcome is a much higher eventual temperature – and in fact , the model indicates that each 10 years of delay in halting the rise in global emissions adds another 0.5C to the likeliest end - of - the - century figure .
So if emissions do not peak and start to decline until 2025 , we can expect a 2.6C rise by 2100 , and if the decline only begins in 2035 , the figure is likely to be 3.1C – even with 3 per cent annual cuts .
These new figures suggest quite unambiguously that the world is on course for calamity unless rapid action can be taken which is far more drastic than any politicians are so far contemplating – never mind the general public .
If action is sluggish or non-existent , the model suggests that climate change is likely to cause almost unthinkable damage to the world ; under a " business - as - usual " scenario , with no action taken at all and emissions increasing by more than 100 per cent by 2050 , the end - of - the - century rise in global average temperatures is likely to be 5.5C , with a worst - case outcome of 7.1C – which would make much of life on earth impossible .
" Even with drastic cuts in emissions in the next 10 years , our results project that there will only be a 50 per cent chance of keeping global temperatures rises below 2 C , " said Dr Vicky Pope , the Met Office 's Head of Climate Change Advice .
" This idealised emissions scenario is based on emissions peaking in 2015 and changing from an increase of 2 - 3 per cent per year to a decrease of 3 per cent per year .
For every 10 years we delay this action another 0.5C will be added to the most likely temperature rise .
If the world fails to make the required reductions , it will be faced with adapting not just to a 2C rise in temperature but to 4C or more by the end of the century . "
Remember how the RIAA was getting ISPs to help battle copyright infringers after they gave up lawsuits , and AT&T was all " no comment " ?
Now AT&T confirms they 're working with the RIAA .
UPDATED .

AT&T says they 're not doing any of the actual spotting — the RIAA is handling that part — they 're just " forwarding notices from content providers to our customers " to edumacate them .
Cnet 's Greg Sandoval reports that a Comcast executive said that they 've sent customers two million warning notices about infringement .
[ A Comcast spokesperson later added that these letters were n't part of any new campaign , see below . ]
What happens if you ignore AT&T 's notices ?
Will they disconnect you ?
Here is their lovely wishy - washy answer that really does n't say anything at all : " We are not suspending or terminating our customers ' service .
With that said , we do refer customers to our Acceptable Use Policy , which governs use of our service . "
Just keep in mind , it 's the same AT&T that was plotting a massive , intelligent anti-piracy dragnet that would sweep their entire network for pirated content .

Update : Comcast adds via spokesperson that nothing 's changed :
" Comcast , like other major ISPs , forwards notices of alleged infringement that we receive from music , movie , videogame , and other content owners to our customers .
This is the same process we 've had in place for years - nothing has changed .
While we have always supported copyright holders in their efforts to reduce piracy under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , and continue to do so , we have no plans to test a so - called ' three - strikes - and - you ' re - out ' policy . "
Probably not a distinction they want , but since they 're the only major ISP that 's not seriously clamping down on bandwidth usage and hanging out with the RIAA at bars — the RIAA 's new buddy group reportedly includes AT&T , Comcast and Cox — Verizon still looks like the best ISP around for people moving around less - than - legally shiny material ( i.e. , everyone on the internet ) , especially if you get FiOS .

Palin's Ex : Need to ' Mature ' Before Marriage Father of Bristol Palin 's child confirms marriage off , does n't rule out reunion .
March 15 , 2009 -- Levi Johnston , the former fiance of Bristol Palin , says the couple broke up " a week , two weeks " ago but leaves open the possibility that they could reunite .
" We 'll see , we 'll see how it is , " Johnston , 19 , said March 13 in an exclusive interview at his Alaska home with Neal Karlinsky of " Good Morning America . "
" We 'll just remain friends for now .
We 're both cool with that decision , and we 'll see . "
For the first time , Johnston described the circumstances of his split with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's eldest daughter , and talked about becoming a father .
Watch the full interview Monday morning on " Good Morning America . "
Also , check Neal Karlinsky 's Twitter page .
He 'll be tweeting some behind - the - scenes details about the interview .
" We were just , we were in a fight , " the teen said .
" And trying to see if we can make things work .
But this is what it kind of ended up turning into .
But we 'll see what happens . "
Johnston said he felt they needed time to grow up before following through on marriage plans .
" It 's just us not , me not being mature enough , or something , and having a kid and thinking ... it could be better -- better for us to separate for a while , " Johnston said .
The young couple 's relationship came under intense focus in the heat of last year 's presidential campaign , with the announcement that Bristol Palin , then 17 , was five months pregnant .
The revelation came just days after Sarah Palin was tapped as the Republican vice presidential candidate .
At the time , Sarah Palin announced that the parents - to - be planned to marry .
Last month , Bristol Palin told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News that the plan was still on .
" Eventually , we 'd like to get married , " Palin told Van Susteren .
" We 're focusing on getting through school though , getting a career going . "
Palin gave birth to a son , Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston , on Dec. 27 , 2008 .
Johnston : ' I 'd Give Anything ' for Tripp
Johnston sees his son regularly and described how becoming a father had changed his life .
" I 'd give anything for [ Tripp ] , to be with him , " he said .
" [ There are ] a lot of changes when you 're a father , when you hold him for the first time , you know .
I do n't do a lot of things I used to anymore , I 'll tell you that . "
" Yeah , [ I 'm ] growing up a lot , " he added .
" So , it 's fun .
It 's good times . "
Asked if he felt any pressure from the Palin family , Johnston said he did not .
" No , " he said .
" Not at all . "
Johnston Thrust Onto National Stage
Johnston first appeared on the national stage at the September 2008 Republican National Convention , which he attended with the Palins .
He came under early scrutiny when a MySpace page emerged on which Johnston was quoted as saying " I 'm a f----- redneck , " and " I do n't want kids . "
Johnston said his friends created the page and he had nothing to do with it .
Sarah Palin said that having a baby would make her daughter " grow up faster than we had ever planned . "
Bristol Palin told Van Susteren that no one had pressured her to have the child .
" It was my choice to have the baby , " the 18 - year - old said .
" It does n't matter what my mom 's views are on it .
It was my decision . "
While campaigning for governor of Alaska in 2006 , Sarah Palin came out strongly against abortion and said that abstinence should be taught as part of sex education in public schools .
Her decision to give birth to her youngest son , Trig , who was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome , has been held up by conservatives as exemplary of anti-abortion values .
Palin on Abstinence , Teen Pregnancy
Sarah Palin discussed abstinence and teen pregnancy in the interview with Van Susteren .
" You get behind that , that ideal of , yes , abstinence , you know ? " the new grandmother , 44 , said .
" Hey , do n't get pregnant .
Well , get beyond that when it happens , and then you deal with it .
Life happens .
Life happens and you deal with it , and Bristol 's dealing with it wonderfully .
" Not the most ideal situation , " she added .
" Certainly you make the most of it . "
Last October , Johnston told the Associated Press he had been dating Bristol Palin since freshman year of high school and the couple had long planned to get married .
" We were planning on getting married a long time ago , with or without the kid , " Johnston told the AP .
" That was the plan from the start . "
He went on to describe rough wedding plans , even naming two friends he had asked to be groomsmen .
" We both love each other .
We both want to marry each other .
And that 's what we are going to do , " Johnston said at the time .
Changing Plans
Four months later , in the interview with Van Susteren , new mother Bristol Palin sounded more tentative about the couple 's wedding plans .
But she said Johnston saw the baby every day and described him as a " hands - on " dad .
News that the couple had ended their relationship first emerged last week .
Johnston told the AP on March 11 that he and Palin had decided " a while ago " to end their relationship .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Chicken nuggets .
Sandwiches .
Pizza .
Baseball games .
Play - Doh .
These are some of the basics of childhood that could prove deadly to my 4 - year - old son , Teddy .
Teddy took his first sip of milk in 2005 , triggering a strong allergic reaction as seen in this family photo .
Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis , a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing .
He has to steer clear of milk , eggs , wheat , peanuts and tree nuts -- even places like baseball stadiums where peanut exposure can't be avoided .
We found out about Teddy 's allergies partially through trial and error and then through allergy testing when he was 18 months old , and we did n't want any more missteps .
Now our job is to try to prevent contact with those foods until he either outgrows them or he becomes old enough to police himself .
Watch what we go through to protect Teddy »
Our vigilance starts before food even enters the house .
When we are in the grocery store , we have to read every label to see if the food contains something harmful .
See tips about living with food allergies »
We 'll get all the way through one of these and be thinking , " hurray ! " and then see " caramel coloring " and have to put it back .
There 's still enough wiggle room in food labeling , apparently , to not have to list what 's in that -- often milk -- or what 's in " natural flavoring . "
Devil in the details
And just because a food item was OK last week does n't mean the recipe has n't changed .
And just because the package looks right does n't mean you 've picked up the right package .
I was in a hurry when I picked up rice cheese in December , so I did n't carefully read the label .
Teddy saw the cheese when I was unloading the groceries and asked for a slice -- and then another .
Although the cheese looked like our regular vegan cheese without milk , it was an almost identical package that contained milk protein .
Teddy ended up in a hospital emergency room with hives all over his arms , legs , tummy and back .
His nose was running and he was drooly .
He got a shot of epinephrine before he could develop breathing problems .
It 's a harsh reminder that we can never let down our guard .
Once we get food into the house , we try to label it .
We have stickers , or we use markers to warn away from giving a particular product to Teddy .
Labels are n't enough for baby sitters .
We set out a bin of " Teddy safe " snacks .
School : Lots of cupcakes , no Play - Doh
School is tough , too .
The macaroni necklaces my 8 - year - old daughter Catie once made for me in pre-K were charming .
Who would think that something so simple could make another kid very sick ?
There 's no Play - Doh .
It can have wheat in it .
Same for papier - mache .
Teddy 's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products .
But it can be exhausting .
Child Food Allergies 1 to 2 percent of children have true food allergies
Some kids grow out of them by age 4
Allergies to peanuts , tree nuts , shellfish usually last lifetime

Every month , it seems , there is another " holiday " at school .
And all seem to be connected to food celebrations .
Every time other parents send food in , we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe .
I try to always be the " cupcake mom , " because I can make cupcakes without milk , eggs or wheat that still taste good .
( Even the teachers fight to get them . )
When someone else brings cakes , I try to find out in advance so I can make a Teddy - safe alternative .
If there is no warning , the school has a bin of Teddy - safe snacks .
Challenges in the kitchen
I try to cook mostly Teddy - safe food at home .
The first reaction many people have to hearing of Teddy 's allergies is a dumbfounded , " What does he eat ? "
There are actually many foods that are OK for him : meats , vegetables , fruits and most grains .
We just do n't often get the chance to use convenience foods .
I have alternatives for meatloaf and tacos that work OK .
But sometimes I just want to make pasta for the family .
I know that I could just make rice pasta for everyone .
But , frankly , it 's about three times the price and does n't taste as good .
So I have to be careful .
I can't use the same spoon to stir both .
And even when I 'm draining the pasta , I have to remember that if I do n't drain the rice pasta first , I have to use two colanders .
So I try to keep that straight .
This is why it 's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant .
It 's very easy for a contaminated utensil to be used in the kitchen without us knowing .
And that would be after getting the restaurant staff to show us labels from all food items .
Teddy - Safe Cupcakes Base mix : Bob 's Red Mill Gluten - Free Chocolate Cake Mix
Instead of eggs : Ener - G egg substitute
Instead of milk : Silk Enhanced soy milk
Instead of butter , margarine : Earth Balance Soy Garden
To regular mix , add single - serve container of applesauce and about a half - teaspoon of cinnamon ( just because I like cinnamon . )
Add other ingredients as package directs and bake as it says .
Decorate with safe jelly beans or sprinkles and prepared frosting with no milk or egg ingredients .

This month , we will be meeting with some staff members at Teddy 's new elementary school , where he 'll be entering kindergarten in August .
When we start a new school or new situation , it 's always an anxious time .
We 're going to talk with the school nurse and cafeteria manager about strategies to keep Teddy safe .
Teddy will need a classroom as free from danger as possible , and that can be an issue .
As soon as we talk about not having peanut products in his classroom , some people think we do n't want their kids to have peanut butter sandwiches for lunch .
No , we just want peanut products eaten only in the cafeteria .
In the lunchroom , Teddy can be watched so that if peanut butter touches him or milk is spilled on him , he will be decontaminated as quickly as possible .
( If milk touches Teddy , he gets hives -- he does n't even have to ingest it .
This is a lot different from " lactose intolerance , " which some people confuse with a milk allergy .
Lactose intolerance produces gastric distress for someone .
A milk allergy can be life - threatening . )
We 'll probably post signs the way we 've done at his day cares and preschool , showing him in reaction to an allergen and listing what action to take .
Fears of budget cuts
We 're hoping that the school nurse does n't fall victim to budget cuts , because that is our emotional safety net right now .
We 're comforted by the thought of someone with anaphylaxis experience being close to Teddy .
It 's all part of the constant vigilance , doing our best to keep him safe .
If we 'd been handed a list of Teddy 's allergies when he was freshly born at the hospital , I think we'd have been overwhelmed .
But we found out a bit at a time , and we 've been dealing with it now for more than three years .
Despite some bumps , Teddy 's been able to survive our stumbles and thrive .

If you happen to follow the public debate on climate change , you might we aware that , in some circles , 2008 is being viewed as the definitive end of global warming .
After all , it marks a decade where temperatures have trended downwards , and an especially cold start to the year was heralded as " wiping out a century of warming . "
So , it might come as a surprise to learn that , now that the year 's numbers have been crunched , NASA 's Goddard Institute and the UK's Climactic Research Unit rank 2008 as the 9th and 10th warmest year ( respectively ) in the 150 years or so humanity has been keeping careful track of these things .
The facts are that 2008 was cooler than the last few years , but warmer than most in recent history , which lends itself to spin based on the predilections of the person talking about it .
But some of that spin specifically plays upon the widespread innumeracy of the public , which is n't well prepared to separate trends from short - term variability , or recognize when certain figures are selectively chosen .
We 'll try to separate out some of these in a way that will hopefully help readers make a bit of sense out of the conflicting noise .
Parsing 2008 's temperature
Why was 2008 colder than the past several years ?
The short answer is La Ni?a .
The tropical Pacific Ocean undergoes a cyclical change in surface temperatures called the El Ni?o- Southern Oscillation , which has a dramatic impact on global temperatures .
( NOAA has a tutorial and an FAQ about the ENSO , for the curious . )
I 've taken an image from a Goddard Institute analysis and modified it to highlight this impact .
Blue bars , which are roughly centered on the cool La Ni? a events , are often associated with a drop in global temperatures .
Warmer , El Ni? o events tend to correspond to warmer periods in the global temperature record .
This relationship is n't absolute , as the ENSO is n't the only thing influencing short - term variations — the drop in the early 1990s is thought to be the product of the massive eruption of the Pinatubo volcano , for example .
If 2008 was chilly , there 's a good chance that the La Ni? a event was a major contributor to that .
The ENSO and global temperatures
The other thing that should be apparent from this photo is that the data are noisy — they vary rapidly between many of the adjacent three - month periods shown in the upper portion of the graph .
That makes drawing any significant conclusions based on a short time window — such as when a single month 's readings were used to conclude that the earth was " wiping out a century of warming " — a very dangerous thing .
As should be clear from the information above , temperatures rose enough later in the year to turn it into one of the warmest on record .
The other thing that should be apparent from the graph is that temperatures swing both ways .
If we were to conclude that the trend towards a warmer globe had ended back in February , what should we have concluded in the late 1990s , when a strong El Ni? o event shot the temperatures up to previously unprecedented levels ?
It certainly was n't taken as evidence that the seas were on a trajectory to boil at the time .
Pick your trends carefully
Those exceptional temperatures are the product of an exceptional year , as the CRU has 1998 it as the warmest year on record , and Goddard places it in a statistical dead heat with the warmest .
I first became aware of its significance two years ago — I know it was two years ago , because I was told that global warming had stopped eight years earlier .
Now , those statements have been replaced with ones indicating that the earth has been cooling for a decade .
One of the most significant things these statements have in common is their starting date : 1998 .
It 's instructional to perform a similarly superficial analysis with the surrounding years .
Looking at the 1990s until now , using the deviation from the 1950 - 1980 mean in C
All the numbers indicate how much warmer that year was than the mean temperature from the 1950 - 1980 period .
The data should make clear that , to get a drop in temperatures using that measure , you need to pick 1998 as your starting point ; neither of the two neighboring years will work .
CRU ( top ) and Goddard data , showing smoothed trends .
( Click for larger version )
You'd get a different result using CRU data ( which rates 1998 as warmer , and recent years as a bit cooler ) , but the message would be the same : the years you choose for your analysis can determine your trend .
In fact , a quick look at the chart above shows that you could pick a decade to support any conclusion you want .
In fact , the start of the instrument era is , in effect , an arbitrary year , as is the present .
So , how can we tell anything ?
To deal with this , both the CRU and Goddard apply smoothing to their data ; Goddard provides a moving five - year average , CRU more dramatic smoothing , as shown below .
Both of these make the overall temperature trends clear by limiting the ability of the variability in the underlying data to obscure it .
In both cases , the temperatures of 2008 combine with several years of largely similar data to create a slight drop in the trend .
Drops of a similar magnitude appear in the past , meaning that the current one is consistent with an overall upward trend in temperatures .
Should the current dip turn into a longer trend , then it would be cause for a significant revision of our understanding of the climate .
The clearest indication of whether that 's going to happen might be the next time an El Ni?o arrives — assuming Mount Pinatubo does n't go off again in the meantime .
Information Age Prayer is a site that charges you a monthly fee to say prayers for you .
A typical charge is $ 4.95 per month to say three prayers specified by you each day .
" We use state of the art text to speech synthesizers to voice each prayer at a volume and speed equivalent to typical person praying , " the company states .
" Each prayer is voiced individually , with the name of the subscriber displayed on screen . "
Prices , however , are dictated by the length of the prayer .
As noted in the Information Age Prayer FAQ , " A discounted prayer will cost less than other prayers of similar length . "
I 'm fascinated by the intersection between religion and technology , as are some well - known science fiction writers .
For example , if a machine can say a prayer for you , why not have a fully robotic pope and clergy ?
In his 1971 story Good News From The Vatican , writer Robert Silverberg tells the story of a robot cardinal who might one day become pope :
" Rabbi Mueller removes his sunglasses ...
' I can tell you that his Eminency is tall and distinguished , with a fine voice and a gentle smile ...'
' But he 's mounted on wheels , is n't he ? '
Kenneth persists .
' On treads , ' replies the rabbi , giving Kenneth a fiery , devastating look .
' Treads , like a tractor has .
But I do n't think treads are spiritually inferior to feet , or , for that matter , to wheels ...'
' Every era gets the Pope it deserves , ' Bishop Fitzpatrick observed somewhat gloomily today at breakfast .
' The proper Pope for our times is a robot , certainly ... ' "
In Roger Zelazny 's Hugo award - winning 1967 novel Lord of Light , he describes a pray - o - mat :
" It was a machine , gleaming and metallic , before which they moved .
A man inserted a coin into the mouth of a steel tiger .
The machine began to purr .
He pressed buttons cast in the likenesses of animals and demons .
There came then a flashing of lights along the lengths of the Nagas , the two holy serpents who twisted about the transparent face of the machine .
The man drew down upon the lever that grew from the side of the machine cast in the likeness of the tail of a fish .
A holy blue light filled the interior of the machine ; the serpents pulsed redly ; and there , in the midst of the light and a soft music that had begun to play a prayer wheel swung into view and began spinning at a furious pace .
The man wore a beatific expression . "
I should also note that one of the manifestations of Number Six in the most recent incarnation of Battlestar Galactica is very religious .
" Head - Six " ( or " inner six " ) often tries to get Baltar to believe in the Cylon God and to accept his place in God 's plan .
Fans of Douglas Adams might also recall the Electric Monk from Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency :
" The Electric Monk was a labour - saving device , like a dishwasher or a video recorder ...
Electric
Monks believed things for you , thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task , that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe . "
Bow your head and click , that you might see these stories more clearly :

As many are aware , JW 's have for years had a two - tier class system in place .
In fact , when I was at Bethel , Freddy used to tell us for years they called them " Secondary Christian " aka " second class " .
According to the boys in writing , God put this second class system in FULL SWING OR place in 1935 .
So this afternoon I get a call from this non -JW I have known for some years .
I told him the next time a JW stopped by to ask them this question : " How do you prove from the Bible that 1935 was the year that the selection to heaven stopped due to being filled ? "
On Saturday , 2 friends stopped by his house in service .
He and his wife invited them in and allowed them to go through their little funky CANNED presentation from this month 's KM .
After their friends finished , they said , " We have a question , " and they asked them to show them from their KJV or their JW Bible where it indicates that in 1935 the door to heaven was shut ?
We all know what happened .
They could not take them to the Bible and show them that , so they asked to return on Sunday with someone who was more INFORMED ON EXPLAINING THE DEEEEEEEPER THINGS IN THE BIBLE so the couple agreed .
Today the brother returned with one of the ELDERS .
YEP they get to COUNT it as a RV .
Anyway the elder prepared himself before they came .
JW 's have a very up - to - date Kingdom Hall , you see .
They have a computer in the Elder 's Office at the hall so the elder printed out a ton of WT publications to take over .
I guess to show the non -JW that it does states 1935 as the year the door was closed " IN PRINT " .
Due to the fact that I had prepared him , the non -JW was ready .
The elder went into the talk that Rutherford gave in DC , and showed him all the articles that stated the door shut in 1935 .
The non -JW was ready with his questions .
SO HE ASKED HIM a series of questions : 1 . Were ANY of the publications that stated 1935 as the year , INSPIRED ?
2 . Was the Writer of those articles INSPIRED ?
3 . WAS J.F. Rutherford INSPIRED
WHEN he gave that talk in DC stating that 1935 was the date ?
We all know what the poor elder had to say to ALL those questions 1 . NO 2 . NO 3 . NO .
SO THEN MY MAN said he asked the elder again , " Could you take me to the Inspired Word of God using either your Bible or mine and show me where it indicates 1935 as the year the door to heaven was shut ?
Once again the poor elder could n't do it .
So my friend asked him , " Since you can't take me directly to the Bible and show me this , unlike if I asked is stealing ok then would you agree that it calls for some form of INTERPRETATION ? "
OUR DEAR ELDER MADE a serious mistake here for he said , " Yes it does . "
So my dear friend asked him , " Who in the JW religion does the interpretation ?
In my faith , it 's the Pope , who does it for you ? "
Well , the bro told him the FDS helps us to understand the deeper meaning of things .
So he asked him , " Are you saying that they INTERPRET THE BIBLE FOR YOU ? " and the elder said , " Yes they do . "
I had already told him that JW 's normally say ( if they are UP - TO - DATE ) : " We do n't try to interpret the Bible , the Bible says interpretation belong to Jehovah . "
So the dear elder opened his mouth and inserted his foot .
So the non -JW told him that he had spoken to a former Bethelite who worked at the World Headquarters of JW 's aka " 1 " who indicated to him that , " As JW's , we do n't do interpretations since it only belongs to Jehovah . "
So he said at this point , the poor elder just started to get bent out of shape .
He was lost , so the elder told him that what he needed was A BIBLE STUDY .
THIS WAY HE COULD LEARN THE DEEEEPER THINGS IN the Bible ; but first he needed to learn the basics .
So my man asked him , " If I have a Bible study , will I then be able to turn to the Inspired Word of God and find the 1935 date showing that God shut the door ? "
The poor elder told him , " No , he would not .
BUT you would understand how we came to understand that 1935 was the date according to the Bible . "
You 've got to feel sorry for the dear elder and especially the poor publisher who saw an elder bring a ton of UNINSPIRED printouts and could n't just take the Word of God and answer the man 's question .
So the next time a JW stops by , ask for Inspired Word of God Bible text that says that in 1935 the door was shut .
Do n't settle for anything less than the real Inspired Word of God , not some Knock off brand called the WT publications .
Is it not amazing how when a non -JW knows just a little about the organization and WT teachings how they can bring your average 20 - 40 year JW to his knees just by asking a few simple questions .
How sad !
Levi Johnston and Bristol Palin had been dating for three years
Bristol Palin , the 18 - year - old daughter of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , has split from her fiance , Levi Johnston .
Miss Palin 's pregnancy by Mr Johnston , 19 , made headlines shortly after Sarah Palin was named as John McCain 's running mate in last year 's elections .
The couple 's son , Tripp Johnston , was born in December .
Mr Johnston told Associated Press ( AP ) that the couple had mutually decided " a while ago " to end their three - year relationship .
Speaking outside his family 's home in Wasilla , north of Anchorage , Mr Johnston said some speculation about the break - up , circulating on the internet , had been inaccurate .
In a statement issued through Sarah Palin 's political action committee , Miss Palin said she had been " devastated " by some media intrusion into their relationship .
" Unfortunately , my family has seen many people say and do many things to ' cash in ' on the Palin name , " said the statement .
" Sometimes that greed clouds good judgment and the truth . "
Sarah Palin 's spokesman , Bill McAllister , declined to comment on the break - up .
Talking point
The Alaska governor revealed her daughter 's pregnancy - and engagement - just days after being named as the Republican vice - presidential candidate by John McCain .
Mrs Palin is a social conservative who is opposed to abortion and the pregnancy became a talking point during the campaign .
In December , Mrs Palin said that her daughter and Mr Johnston were " committed to accomplish what millions of other young parents have accomplished , to provide a loving and secure environment for their child . "
Bristol Palin said in an interview with Fox News last month that Mr Johnston saw the baby every day and described him as a " hands - on " father .
The couple had said they were considering a summer wedding .
Anna Lark turns 100 today .
She intends to celebrate by doing what she has done for the past 47 years -- helping schoolchildren safely cross the road .
Cleveland 's oldest municipal employee works as a crossing guard at the corner of Lee Road and Tarkington Avenue .
Every morning and afternoon during the school year , she shepherds dozens of students from Emile B. de Sauze Elementary School across four lanes of busy traffic .
She took that post on Sept. 17 , 1962 , according to the city .
Lark is now protecting the grandchildren of some of the first children she guided across the street on Cleveland 's southeast corner .
But do n't ask her about retirement .
" Would you like to be home sitting around doing nothing ? "
Lark asks .
" This gets me out of the house .
I like to be busy .
" She 'll have more to do today than usual .
The school plans to honor Lark -- a neighborhood institution known as " Gramma " or " Mama " to more than a few of the young walkers -- with a celebration for her century of life .
The birthday party 's planned for 11 a.m .
" She 's amazing to me , just amazing , " marveled Margaret Bates - Moore , the school 's principal .
" That 's a different kind of stock . "
She certainly showed her mettle Wednesday afternoon .
The soon - to - be centenarian stood outside in the drizzle for more than 40 minutes waiting to guide students across the street .
Business ran slow , though .
Only a few youngsters hoofed it home in the cold and rain .
Oh , the kids of this generation .
They could learn a little something about flinty toughness from the lady wearing the neon - orange ball cap and safety vest .
Lark rarely misses a day , no matter the weather .
She typically walks the two blocks from her house to the corner .
" If the school 's open , she 's there , " said one of Lark 's grandchildren , Vanessa Griffin of Cleveland .
" She 's protective of those kids . "
She shows it , too .
Lark marches into the crosswalk with authority when she 's leading students .
She holds her red-and - white octagonal stop sign high and puffs away on her trusty whistle .
( From the sound of it , she should have no trouble extinguishing 100 candles on a cake . )
Those who inch too close to Lark 's kids can expect an icy glare and a disapproving waggle of the stop sign .
She 's been known to point to each letter on her sign at times for impatient drivers .
" They get the message , " Lark said .
She has a way of getting her point across .
For instance , her late husband , Walter , initially asked Lark not to take this crossing guard gig 47 years ago .
He wanted his wife to stay at home .
She halted that thought the way she now does an SUV in the street .
" I told him , ' Now listen .
I 'm going to take that job , and do n't say nothing , ' " Lark said .
" I straightened him out .
I 'm not somebody who 's going to sit at home all day and do nothing . "
On Wednesday , she crossed her last group of students at 4:34 p.m .
She hung around a few more minutes , her sharp eyes scanning the Tarkington sidewalk for any sign of another backpack - toting child .
Then she started for home with plans for a cup of tea .
God willing , she says , she 'll keep coming back for more shifts .
" He 'll stop me when I 'm ready to stop , " Lark said .
And she 'll go until that day .
Sepp Blatter , the Fifa president , claims that the increasing global popularity of the Premier League is damaging the appeal of football in other countries .
Blatter , who also criticised the lack of competition within the English top flight and reiterated his desire to limit the number of foreign players plying their trade in the Premier League , said that other leagues were having " difficulties to match it " .
" I have my concerns because the Premier League is the strongest in the world , definitely , " Blatter told BBC Radio 5 Live .
" It is taking over in such a manner that the other leagues have difficulties to match it . "
" In a competition where two - thirds or three - quarters of the participants in the league play not to be first , but not to be relegated , there is something wrong , " he said .
Blatter added that he would meet the chief executive of the Premier League , Richard Scudamore , to discuss his continued intention to impose a minimum quota of English players .
" I want to try to , if not persuade him then at least influence him in his thoughts that to have a minimum of local players will enhance the quality of his league , " Blatter said .
The Fifa president , who turns 73 on Tuesday , also voiced concerns over the increasing foreign ownership of English clubs , which he described as a " risk " and warned that there were no guarantees that England 's plans to bid for the 2018 World Cup would be successful .
" What is the advantage of England ? " he said .
" If you look at the technical infrastructure for stadiums and the organisation of football matches on the level of 50,000 people and upwards then they are ready to organise it , but they are not the only ones . "

A family of four has been found dead in a suburban Columbus , Ohio , home in what 's believed to be a murder - suicide , authorities said Thursday .
Police tape surrounds a Whitehall , Ohio , house , where a family of four was found dead Wednesday .
Police in Whitehall , east of Columbus , responded to a call around 2 p.m. Wednesday and found the bodies of Mark Meeks , 51 ; his wife , Jennifer Dallas - Meeks , 40 ; and children Jimmy , 5 , and Abbigail , 8 .
" We 're confirming all four victims had gunshot wounds , and a gun was found at the scene , " Sgt. Dan Kelso said .
A suicide note purportedly written by Meeks also was found at the scene , but police are not releasing the note 's contents , Kelso said .
Authorities believe Meeks shot his wife and two children and then himself , Kelso said .
It was the second time this week that a family died in an apparent murder - suicide .
On Tuesday , the bodies of Ervin Antonio Lupoe , his wife and five children were found in their Los Angeles , California , area home after Lupoe faxed a letter to a local television station explaining that he and his wife had lost their jobs and felt it was better to end their lives .
Police resisted the suggestion that the killings were motivated by finances or job loss .
" Out of respect for the family , detectives are not releasing the actual motive , but it 's not financial , and he was employed , " Kelso said .
The vice president of operations at Immke Northwest Honda , where Meeks was a service manager , confirmed that he was a current employee .
" We as a dealership decline to comment on this devastating tragedy , except to say that all of us here at Immke Northwest Honda are very sad and our condolences go out to the family , " Tom Spicer said .
Meeks ' brother said the family was struggling to come to terms with the possibility that his older brother -- a lifelong car buff and devoted family man who adored his wife and children -- could be responsible for their deaths .
" They were just great people , and they seemed to be an extremely close family , " Mike Meeks said .
" I like to say they were so close they were mushy ; they showed affection toward each other and their kids . "
Meeks said that he last saw his brother about three weeks ago when he came by to pick up firewood and that he seemed happy , giving no clue that anything was amiss .
" There was no indication of anything like this coming .
Nothing , " the brother said .
" I think that 's why everyone 's feeling a sense of shock . "

Benn Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Benn Steil is also the only living man who thinks that French crank Jacques Rueff -- who blamed the Great Depression on a sudden strengthening of labor union power at the start of the 1930s - - " demolished " the " foundations " of Keynesian economics :
Keynes and the triumph of hope over economics :
One of these good economists was Bastiat ’s fellow Frenchman Jacques Rueff , who in a 1947 journal article attacking " The Fallacies of Lord Keynes ’s General Theory " pointed out that governments “ have a choice between only two solutions : to allow the apparatus of production to adapt itself to ... the will of the consumers ... or to adapt the desires of consumers by authoritative regulation ... ” Nobel Prize - winner Paul Krugman , who calls today “ The Keynesian Moment ” , justifies such a trillion dollar investment programme on precisely the Keynesian foundations that Rueff demolished – the claim that money “ would otherwise be sitting idle ” .
When Mr Krugman buys his stimulus bonds , I am curious where the “ idle ” money will come from .
Will he sell stocks ?
Bonds ?
Withdraw funds from the banking system ?
If it is not to come from a cash box , it is not idle ...
But that 's what recessions are : times when money that in normal times greases the circular flow of economic activity instead sits idle .
You can see this on graphs of monetary velocity : when recessions hit the velocity of circulation collapses as money sits idle -- and adding the fourth quarter of 2008 and the forecast velocity for the first quarter of 2009 onto the Economagic velocity graph shows us just how fast the amount of idle balances are piling up right now -- the idle balances that Rueff and Steil claim cannot exist .
I had not noticed that the Council on Foreign Relations was such a strong source of wingnut welfare .
Let us collectively beg CFR President Richard Haass : rather than have his think tank continue its descent into disinformation and irrelevance , please hire a real economist instead .
In a drive to increase energy security and combat global warming , ministers said they would present a bill next month that would allow the building of nuclear reactors on existing sites and introduce a new carbon tax as part of a program to cut carbon emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
The decision is significant because Sweden was at the forefront of anti-nuclear sentiment after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 .
It voted in a referendum a year later to phase out its plants .
The Swedish Prime Minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , said he did not feel bound by the referendum because it did not specify how nuclear power should be replaced .
But the Government must still convince Parliament before it becomes law .
You can't have it both ways .
If you believe that anthropogenic CO2 is causing dangerous climate change , it is crazy then to spurn nuclear power as an alternative to coal .
However , that is what most Western governments are doing , including Australia 's But now Sweden , one of the foremost opponents of nuclear power , has conceded that nuclear power must play a role if there is to be a " low - carbon " economy .
Australia should be doing the same .

It 's disconcerting to me that we need to keep reiterating for Washington and the Beltway Punditocracy that the American people WANT for us to return to respecting the " rule of law " in this country .
Was our vote not enough of a repudiation of the last eight years ?
Luckily for us , there are a few in DC and the media corps who DO get it .
Right at the top of the list : Senator Russ Feingold and Bill Moyers .
They sat down this weekend for a conversation on Feingold 's hopes for the incoming administration and his desire to raise us out of the moral turpitude of the Bush administration .
Feingold also blogged about it at Daily Kos :
Our founding fathers laid down a basic principle -- that we are a nation of laws and that no one , including the president , is above the law .
From Guantanamo Bay and warrantless wiretapping to torture and excessive secrecy , the Bush administration has turned this principle on its head .
The Constitution states that it and the laws of the United States are " the supreme Law of the Land . "
Yet , the current administration has claimed unprecedented powers as it has ignored or willfully misinterpreted the laws on the books .
While Americans ’ decisive call for change this election was a clear repudiation of the Bush administration ’s conduct , failing to act swiftly to reverse the damage could essentially legitimize that conduct and the extreme legal theories on which it was based .
That is why it is critically important for President - elect Obama to unequivocally renounce President Bush ’s extreme claims of executive authority .
Full transcripts of the video clip below the fold .
You can watch the full episode here .
BILL MOYERS : What do you want from the Obama administration ?
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD :
Well , I would like the new president to do exactly what he said he 's going to do , first of all .
He wants to bring the country together as much as he can .
And that does n't mean , I think , giving up your principles .
But I think it does mean saying even though the Democrats have the House and the Senate and the presidency , that we should engage Republicans who are willing to work with us as much as possible .
Because the public is so turned off by the fighting and by the sniping that goes on .
Those of us who really believe in progressive government have got to portray a government that can work together with as many people as possible .
At the same time , I would like to new president , of course , to stick to the kind of things he campaigned on , such as making sure that we close down Guantanamo , making sure that we do end the war in Iraq in an orderly manner .
He should not go away from this to simply look like he's in the middle .
And I do n't think he 's going to do that
BILL MOYERS : I had dinner the other night with Ted Sorensen , who 's 80 years old now .
He was John F. Kennedy 's alter ego , soul mate , the author of so many , with Kennedy , of those great speeches .
And I said to him , " Ted , you know , the one thing people remember from Kennedy 's inaugural address was I 'm — you know it , as you were a young man listening at the time — ' Ask not what your country can do for you , but ask what you can do for your country . ' "
And I said , " What 's the one thing that you think Barack Obama could say that would be the most memorable , the most riveting , and the most compelling , and the most urgent ?
And he said , echoing Russ Feingold , " Restore the rule of law . "
You 've been talking about this for some time now .
Why is that so important for Obama to put it on the marquee early on ?
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD : Well , of course , the new president , minutes after he 's sworn in , in this wonderful moment — it will be cold out there .
It will be short speech .
But included in the speech , I would hope , would be some attempt by this new , wonderful president to renounce the extreme claims of executive power .
To simply renounce these claims that were made by the Bush administration .
If he does not say it in some way , at least there , or soon thereafter -
BILL MOYERS : Such as ?
What do you mean ?
What claims do you think are most abusive ?
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD :
The most important thing — there are many examples , such as torture issue , Guantanamo , detainees , many other things — the fundamental thing is to get away from this argument that under Article Two of the Constitution , the president can basically look at a clear statute , such as the wiretapping statue , and say , " You know , actually , I can do whatever I want in this .
I do n't have to follow the clear laws of the Constitution , because under the Commander - in - Chief powers , I can basically do whatever I want . "
That is essentially the argument , the extreme and dangerous argument that the Bush administration has advanced .
So I would like to see this new president say , " You know , that goes too far .
I believe in presidential power .
I will protect the prerogatives of the president . "
But at some point — and I think this is where the Bush administration went too far — they 've actually undone the basic balance that our founders believed in .
BILL MOYERS : But he must be heading to the White House concerned that there could be a 9/11 on his watch .
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD : Absolutely .
BILL MOYERS : And that he can't be as prudent or as prudish as a constitutional lawyer , as he might have been before 9/11 .
What would you say to him if he asks you about that ?
" Russ , I do n't want 9/11 to happen on my watch . "
Bush did n't want it to happen again .
He turned to John Ashcroft and said , " John , do n't let this happen again . "
So what would you say to Obama about the balance between the fear he has that Mumbai could happen here , and your concerns , all of our concerns , for the Constitution ?
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD : Well , he would be absolutely right to have that concern .
And I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee -
BILL MOYERS : Right .
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD : - and the Intelligence Committee .
There 's -
BILL MOYERS : And the Judiciary Committee .
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD : And judiciary .
BILL MOYERS : Yeah .
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD :
And these are all — the three committees that really relate to this issue .
My top priority is to stop us from being attacked again , is to protect the physical safety of the American people .
That 's my top priority .
That 's going to be President Obama 's top priority .
Though he will do nothing — and I will support nothing — that will undo the ability of us to go after those that we have a reasonable reason to believe are going after us , that are going to harm us .
What he will do as president , and what he understands , is you can do that without going after people 's library records , where there 's absolutely no evidence they 've done anything wrong .
Or , for example , allowing , as the new Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act does , the bulk collection of every single international conversation that anyone does , even though there may be no proof at all that anybody 's done anything wrong .
Our system of government is based on the belief that we have a rule of law .
And although , as Justice Goldberg once said , " The Constitution is not a suicide pact , " it is our faith .
That doing things under our system of government is not only the right thing to do , but is also the efficacious thing to do , the thing that will actually produce the most result and cause people to feel free .
For example , in a minority community in the United States , where they might know somebody in their midst who is potentially a problem .
They 're going to be a lot more likely to talk to us about that if they believe that their fundamental rights as innocent Americans are being protected .
That 's the balance we need to have .
BILL MOYERS : What do you think happens if Obama decides that this can't be his top priority ?
What happens if he does n't act to reverse what President Bush and Dick Cheney have done ?
SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD :
He's in the amazing position of having to have about fifteen top priorities .
And nobody envies his job .
Look , he 's got to deal with the financial issues .
He 's got to deal with the stimulus issue .
He 's got to deal with energy and health care .
So he does n't need to sort of make this the number one issue .
Hillary Clinton , when she called me after her appointment as Secretary of State because I 'm a member of the Foreign Relations Committee , said , " We have to learn how to walk and chew gum at the same time . "
Well , that 's exactly what President Obama 's going to do .
He can change these things in the rule of law , relatively quietly .
He can get rid of Guantanamo by executive order .
He can get rid of the bad torture policies by executive order .
He can get rid of the practice of assuming that something 's a classified document , and bring it back to what it was under the Clinton administration , where the presumption is in favoring of opening information .

Second day of testing .
Geoffroy is much faster than yesterday .
I gave up following him with my mountain bike and watched him turn and turn around the block .
A smile on his face says it all , the bike is well born .
13/02/09
Geoffroy was the first one to test the bike .
He is a front drive beginner but managed to ride without any problem .
The front end is lighter and easier to steer and Marc 's steel bike as expected .
The balance seem good and it feels faster than a VK2 according to the rider .
Well the bike weighs about 6.8Kg complete and that could explain the good up - hill speed also .
The frame behaves well on bad road and the back end looks a bit too stiff but it might just be a visual effect from the large seat .
07/02/09 I will now start the paint job and I have a surprise for my friend Black adder .
The steering clamping system is not final .
The frame feels stiff enough .
This bike can be a SUB 7 with a lighter crank .
My next bike which will be an evolution of this one should be much lighter . :)
27/01/09 The Shimano bar end shifters have been fitted .
The 4th gear was missing so we decided to open it .
Well that was a bad idea , it took 5 minute to open it and about 2H to reassemble it .
The first spring was tricky to fit .
It really looks like a Swiss watch inside .
I am not convinced they need that many seal and gasket .
Never mine !
I also fitted a set of Tecktro levers .
They are fitted facing backwards on purpose to keep the cable as long as possible in the handle bar .
The crank has been drill at 150 mm .
The ends will be reduced later .
This baby weight a tonne !
I just bought a Broken stronglight carbon crank and I will try to reduce it soon .
16-01-09
The seat has been bonded to the frame so as the bottom bracket .
I now need to reduce the crank length from 170 mm to 150 mm .
5th January 2009
The seat and handle bar need ajusting on the frame .
The seat will be bonded on the frame to improve the side stiffness of the frame and save a bit of weight .
The drawback is that it is impossible to adjust the bottom bracket length .
Hope it will be OK ....
The stem is now built and taped to the U handle bar .
The stem is longer than necessary and will be trimmed to fit the rider 's position .
The handle bar is now fully covered with carbon .
At this stage is weighs about 200g .
It really looks like a Batman boomrang .
The handle bar is made in a piece of foam and covered with two layers of carbon ( 300g at 0/90 and 400g at +/-45 ) .
The tubes are made over a PVC tube but this is not very accurate as the overlap creates a bump .
A female mould would be a better idea to get the 22 mm diameter .
29 December 2008
A friend of mine ( Gilles ) has decided to build a similar bike and he has started by a 3D drawing of the bike and it is a good exemple to show how accurate drawing can help to spot problems .
Theis on wheels .
I still need to increase the cut -outs in order to make the bike look lighter .
I am now waiting for the bearings to arrive for the US and for the seat + handle bar drawings .
The bike should be ready in a fortnight and I hope that stiffness will be ok .
The front part of the frame has been built in a few hit .
A male foam mould has been used to give the basic shape then volume has been added to increase stiffness .
This might not be necessary but for the first frame it is safer .
The next stage is to build the head tube with a female mould and a bladder .
Well this is not easy and the result is ' just ' acceptable because the bladder lost pressure .
The front of the frame should weigh about 1.2Kg with paint .
The rear frame is now complete and weighs 900g so it should be around 1.1Kg after painting .
I made a carbon tube 1 " 1/8 to fit the headset bearings .
I tried to keep the frame very narrow ( 35 mm ) between the legs because it can be painful if your legs wear on it for a long time .
The back of the frame is built with my usaul method : foam core + carbon socks .
I made a groove in the foam to fit a 9 mm plastic tube to hide the rear brake cable .
I am back on track for this new bike .
The frame has been designed full scale on a sheet of MDF and I realised that the chain would not fit if the frame was to be built like my sketch .
A clear film has been used to sketch possible modifications and improvements .
A V - brake should fit the tight space between the crank arms .
Chris King bearing will be used .
I tried to enclose the wheel in the frame so it will be easy to fully fair the wheel for racing .
Laurent Dechenne came last week to finalise the next bike for Marc Lesourd ( Vipère ) .
Marc is currently riding a ' speculos ' made of steel by Laurent and this type of bike proved to be very very fast up - hill compared to a Baron so we decided to make a carbon version to give Marc an Edge for next year .
The bike currently weighs about 12 - 13Kg and we should be able to make a much lighter bike at around 7.5Kg to 8Kg .
Light weight carbon frame , semi faired front wheel , airfoild U handbar .
The chainset will be enclosed in a box if we can .
This drawing was produced about 3 years ago to show what could be done in carbone .
The bike geometry was wrong but it opened a long discussion with Laurent Deschenne and a metal prototype was built .
Cheney has moles in Obama Administration , reporter says John Byrne and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday April 1 , 2009
Print This Email This Former Vice President Dick Cheney has moles in the Obama government which report back to him from the Pentagon , investigative reporter Seymour Hersh told NPR and MSNBC on Tuesday .
Speaking with NPR 's Terri Gross , Hersh revealed that the former Vice President -- who he characterized as " really smart " -- has individuals that report back to him from key positions in government .
He called these individuals " stay - behinds , " an intelligence term generally applied to insiders left behind in foreign governments after the occupying power is driven out .
" Hes put people back , " Hersh said .
" They call it a stay - behind .
It s sort of an intelligence term of art .
When you leave a country and , you know , youve driven out , you know , youve lost the war .
You leave people behind .
It s a stay - behind that you can continue to contacts with , to do sabotage , whatever you want to do .
" Cheneys left a stay behind , " Hersh continued .
" Hes got people in a lot of agencies that still tell him whats going on .
Particularly in defense , obviously .
Also in the NSA , theres still people that talk to him .
He still knows whats going on .
Can he still control policy up to a point ?
Probably up to a point , a minor point .
But hes still there .
Hes still a presence . "
The audio , captured by ThinkProgress , is available here .
Hersh expanded on his comments in an interview with MSNBC's Keith Olbermann Tuesday night .
The former New York Times reporter said that the types of individuals that would be well suited to play the role of a Cheney mole would be military officers that were promoted at Cheney or Rumsfeld 's behest .
" There are always a group [ of officers ] who are political and play kiss - up , " Hersh said .
" And so inevitably you 're going to have a group of officers that got promoted ahead of the curve because they were closer and more friendly to Rumsfeld , to Cheney and their policies .
And so you have a group of people that were very loyal to the Rumsfeld / Bush / Cheney policies , who had been promoted in big jobs across the spectrum ...
They have a loyalty . "
" Cheney has enormous influence with a lot of the senior officers in the Pentagon , " he added .
" So I have been told to put the word -- it was the word that I was told about , what they call " stay - behinds . "
He has people he can count on to keep him informed of what 's going on .
That does n't necessarily mean he has much influence on policy .
But he , certainly in the Pentagon .
And I think because certainly at the National Security Council for weeks and weeks after the Obama Administration took over , there was a long delay in getting staff turned over .
So there were a lot of people around in the first few weeks , in the first months of this administration that had served very closely with the Cheney / Bush operation . "
In his NPR interview , Hersh even said that some of his sources who'd told him to call them after Bush left office are still nervous about talking .
" I had a lot of people that had told me in the last year of Bush told me , call me next February , " he said .
" So far , even people that are out are still chary , because not so much Bush , " but because of Cheney .
He said Cheney 's intelligence is significantly greater than most people believe .
" Cheney is really underestimated , " Hersh said .
" It 's easy to make a caricature of him , but he 's very , very bright .
He 's also , in person , much more open - sided in a sense -- not politically -- the most disparate people in the world go and have social meetings with him and his wife -- as long as you do n't get into politics , and uh , movies and stuff like that .
He 's easy to make a caricature but he 's much more formidable than people think .
He 's got a rat - trap memory . "

Mr Saberi says he has been kept in the dark on Roxana 's whereabouts Iran has confirmed that it is holding an Iranian - American journalist , Roxana Saberi , in a Tehran prison .
An Iranian judiciary spokesman said she had been arrested on the orders of the revolutionary court , but he did not know what the charges were .
The foreign ministry said on Monday Ms Saberi had been detained for working illegally as a journalist .
Ms Saberi , 31 , worked briefly for the BBC three years ago , before her Iranian press credentials were revoked .
Ms Saberi has also worked for the American public radio network NPR and the TV network Fox News .
Speaking from his home in North Dakota , her Iranian - born father Reza Saberi said a lawyer would be sent to Tehran 's Evin prison .
" We have been very anxious and worried because they kept us completely in the dark , " Mr Saberi said .
Ms Saberi worked for the BBC for a few months in 2006
She was reportedly arrested in late January and had been allowed to call home only on 10 February , when she told her father she had been arrested for allegedly buying alcohol .
" We are happy that at least they are acknowledging she is in the prison , " Mr Saberi said in comments quoted by AFP .
" We want a fair trial ...
They are accusing her of nothing , " he added .
Ms Saberi has both Iranian and US citizenship , although the Iranian authorities do not recognise dual nationality and are believed to be treating her as one of their own nationals .
NPR reportedly acknowledged that Ms Saberi 's press credentials had been revoked but the authorities had continued to allow her to report short news stories .
Iran and the US have not had diplomatic ties since 1979 .
Their relations are generally strained , with differences particularly sharp over Iran 's nuclear programme and the US military involvement in the Middle East .

Convicted murderer Charles Manson , 74 , is shown in a photo released from Corcoran State Prison in California on March 18 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Courtesy of Corcoran State Prison / Handout
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California corrections officials released a new photograph of imprisoned mass murderer Charles Manson on Thursday , showing the balding , gray - bearded killer at the age of 74 .
The picture , which was taken at Corcoran State Prison in Central California , also reveals a glum Manson still bearing the swastika he carved into his forehead during his sensational 1970 murder trial .
Manson became one of the 20th century ’s most infamous criminals during the summer of 1969 , when the Beatles - obsessed ex-con directed his mostly young , female followers to murder seven people .
Among the victims was eight - months pregnant actress Sharon Tate , the wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski .
She was stabbed 16 times by members of the Manson Family in the early morning hours of August 9 , 1969 .
Four other people were also stabbed or shot to death in Tate ’s home that night by the group , who scrawled the word “ Pig ” in blood on the front door before leaving .
The following night members of the family stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death , using their blood to write “ Rise , ” “ Death to Pigs ” and “ Healter Skelter ” -- a misspelled reference to the Beatles song “ Helter Skelter ” -- on the walls and refrigerator door .
Manson was convicted and sentenced to death in 1971 but was spared execution when California abolished the death penalty the following year .
He has been denied parole 11 times and is next scheduled for a hearing in 2012 .
Security forces on both sides of the Irish border were hunting last night for a dissident republican bomb , after intelligence reports the Real IRA has smuggled a large device into Northern Ireland from the south , the Guardian has learned .
The alert began on Monday before Continuity IRA killed PC Stephen Carroll .
He will be buried tomorrow after requiem mass in his home town of Banbridge , County Down .
As border security tightened with extra checkpoints and patrols , sources in Dublin and Belfast said " intelligence traffic " indicated a plot to explode a bomb in the north , and the device had been transported across the border by car .
" The red light went up on Monday and there is a panic on that the next thing to happen is a bomb somewhere in the north , " one veteran security officer said yesterday .
" The problem is that no one either in the PSNI [ Police Service of Northern Ireland ] or the Garda appears to have specific intelligence where it is destined for . "
The security forces believe the device is similar in size to the 300lb car bomb that dissidents left abandoned in Castlewellan , County Down last month .
With political parties united in condemning the dissidents for the recent killings , the focus turned yesterday to peace rallies that took place in Belfast , Londonderry , Newry , Lisburn and Downpatrick .
Five thousand people joined the demonstration in Belfast , with protesters bearing placards that read : " No going back . "
In Dublin the taoiseach , Brian Cowen , told the Dáil that co-operation between police on both sides of the border had never been closer .
He said he would be joining Northern Ireland 's first minister , Peter Robinson , and deputy first minister , Martin McGuinness , in the US , where they flew yesterday for a visit lasting a week that will coincide with St Patrick 's Day .
" It is important that the voices of the democratic representatives of the people are heard loud and clear at this moment , when the democratic institutions which have been established by the Irish people are being challenged , " he said .
" Those institutions are being challenged by a tiny and unrepresentative group of evil people who have no mandate and no support .
Their actions are futile .
They cannot succeed and they will not succeed . "
Pope Benedict XVI yesterday described the murders in Northern Ireland as " abominable acts of terrorism " .
Meanwhile , fears over possible loyalist paramilitary retaliation in response to the upsurge in Real IRA and Continuity IRA violence eased yesterday after the Ulster Defence Association ruled out revenge attacks .
Jackie McDonald , UDA leader , also praised McGuinness for his condemnation of the dissidents , who killed two British soldiers and a member of the PSNI since the weekend .
McDonald said McGuinness 's denunciation of the two dissident groups as " traitors to the entire island of Ireland " had instilled confidence in the loyalist community .
He described McGuinness 's call for republicans and nationalists to co-operate in the police inquiries to catch both killer gangs as " very helpful " .
He told the Guardian there was " no danger of retaliation " by the largest loyalist paramilitary force .
" The IRA blew the two communities apart during the Troubles but the Real IRA and Continuity IRA have actually united the people like never before , " the UDA 's chief said while attending yesterday 's peace rally at Belfast City Hall .
" There is no place in this society for [ dissident republicans ] but it 's up to the police alone to deal with them .
People on the loyalist side are determined not to fall into any more traps .
That 's what groups like Continuity IRA and Real IRA want us to do .
There is no reason to go there again and nobody wants to go back .
Loyalism has matured an awful lot in recent years . "
The UDA commander also revealed that the organisation 's political allies , the Ulster Political Research Group , held talks this morning with the Sinn Féin lord mayor of Belfast , Tom Hartley .
Hartley later confirmed that the ground - breaking meeting between himself and the UDA 's political voice had taken place .
" I think it was very important that loyalists have a role to play in the building of peace , " he said .
" The meeting today was the first and it was very helpful and I was encouraged by what the UPRG were saying . "
A British army agent who infiltrated the South Armagh IRA for the secretive Force Research Unit predicted that the current dissident campaign could survive even without any major support base within the republican community .
The agent , known as Kevin Fulton , said today there was an intelligence gap regarding the dissidents because the British government " dismantled the security apparatus that was in place in Northern Ireland " .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Governors of five U.S. states urged the federal government to provide $ 1 trillion in aid to the country ’s 50 states to help pay for education , welfare and infrastructure as states struggle with steep budget deficits amid a deepening recession .

The governors of New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Ohio and Wisconsin -- all Democrats -- said the initiative for the two - year aid package was backed by other governors and follows a meeting in December where governors called on President - elect Barack Obama to help them maintain services in the face of slumping revenues .
Gov. David Paterson of New York said 43 states now have budget deficits totaling some $ 100 billion as tax revenues plunge .
“ It ’s clear that the federal government needs to step in and jump - start the economy , ” said Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts .
The latest package calls for $ 350 billion to create jobs by building or repairing roads , bridges and other public works ; $ 250 billion to maintain education ; and another $ 250 billion in “ counter - cyclical ” spending such as extending unemployment benefits and food stamps , which are typically a responsibility of the states .
The remainder would be used to fund middle - class tax cuts , stimulate the embattled housing market , and stem the tide of home foreclosures through a loan - modification program .
Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey said he hoped some of the $ 700 billion authorized by Congress in the Troubled Asset Relief Program would be available to help the housing market .
The governors said during a conference call with reporters that the plan had been discussed with Congressional leaders and the incoming administration , which had indicated its willingness to help .
“ The Obama team has been very receptive in listening to us , ” said Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin .
He said “ quite a number ” of other governors back the initiative .
The Republican Governors Association , however , said the level of federal aid being sought would create a burden for the future .
“ The proposal by the Democratic governors goes beyond things like ‘ shovel - ready ’ infrastructure projects and is essentially a bailout of these states ’ general funds , ” Nick Ayers , executive director of the Republican Governors Association , said in a statement .
“ Now is the time to focus on finding cost - effective ways to provide essential services without burdening future generations with ever greater debt . ”
Doyle of Wisconsin said the plan would allow states to maintain essential services at about the current level until 2010 , when the national economy is expected to begin a recovery .
The proposal comes amid expectations that the Obama administration , which takes office on January 20 , will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in economic stimulus to boost the shrinking U.S. economy and halt the loss of jobs .
Paterson of New York said his state ’s budget deficit has surged to $ 15.4 billion currently from $ 5 billion in April 2008 , despite a 3.2 percent cut in the education budget .
Corzine said the money called for represents about 3 percent to 3.5 percent of the economy , equivalent to the amount that the economy is expected to contract by over the next two quarters .
In light of the $ 700 billion provided to bail out the financial industry , “ It ’s not shockingly large , ” he said .

Learn How ... Obama : ' pursue every legal avenue ' to block AIG bonuses RAW STORY
Published : Monday March 16 , 2009
Print This Email This UPDATE ( at bottom ) : NY Attorney General subpoenas AIG
Obama coughed during his speech and joked , " Excuse me .
I 'm choked up with anger here . "
Responding to a populist firestorm over the news that AIG planned to pay out millions in bonuses to many of the executives viewed to be responsible for the firm 's near - collapse in 2008 , President Obama announced he has directed Treasury Sec. Timothy Geithner to " pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses . "
Noting the substantial sums AIG has received from the federal government , Obama said late Monday morning Geithner should use that leverage in pursuing a block of the bonuses .
" This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed , " said Obama .
" Under these circumstances , its hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 million in extra pay .
How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? "
He added that Geithner is working " to resolve this matter with the new CEO , Edward Liddy , who came on board after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year . "
" This is nt just a matter of dollars and cents .
It s about our fundamental values .
All across the country , there are people who work hard and meet their responsibilities every day , without the benefit of government bailouts or multi-million dollar bonuses .
And all they ask is that everyone , from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington , play by the same rules , " he added .
Barney Frank told NBC's Meredith Vieira that he want to consider taking action against some of the AIG executives receiving bonuses .
" These people may have a right to their bonuses , they do n't have a right to their jobs forever .
The federal government is now an 80 % owner .
One of the things we can do to make sure this does n't happen again , " he said .
" We 've got people who are so irresponsible .
It does appear we 're rewarding incompetence .
Forget about the legal matter .
These bonuses are going to people who screwed this thing up enormously , who made terrible decisions , " said Frank .
If the bonus payments can't be stopped then Frank wants to consider firing some executives .
" Since the federal government -- thanks to the Federal Reserve 's use of the power under the 70 - year - old statute -- now essentially owns the company , maybe it 's time to fire some people .
We can't keep them getting the bonuses , but we can keep some of them from continuing in their jobs , " he said .
UPDATE : Cumo subpoenas AIG for executive bonus details
" New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has issued a subpoena to American International Group Inc. seeking a list with the names of executives receiving bonuses , " reported Albany Business Review .
" ' We had given AGI up to 4 o'clock today to provide the information on the latest round of bonuses that they paid out , ' Cuomo said .
' Four o'clock has come and gone . ' "
" During a conference call with reporters , Cuomo said the subpoena had been issued ' as we speak . ' "
" In the letter to AIG 's CEO Edward Liddy , Cuomo said he was disturbed to learn over the weekend of AIGs plans to pay millions of dollars to members of the Financial Products subsidiary through its Financial Products Retention Plan . "

Men who wore a penile extender every day for six months were able to increase the flaccid length of their penis by up to 32 % and their erectile function by up to 36 % , according to an independent clinical study published in the March issue of BJU International .
Researchers from San Giovanni Battista Hospital at the University of Turin , Italy , are now suggesting that this treatment could provide a viable alternative to surgery , as the results were significant and patient satisfaction with the technique was high .
“ Twenty - one highly motivated patients , with an average age of 47 , were enrolled and 16 completed the 12 - month study , ” says consultant urologist Dr Paolo Gontero .
“ Having undergone psychosexual counselling , to make sure that the treatment would be beneficial , the men were asked to wear the Andro - Penis device for between four and six hours a day for six months .
The device comprises a plastic ring , two dynamic rods that produce the traction and a silicon band to hold the penis in place .
The men were told to increase the traction from 600g in month one to up to 1200g in month six .
Follow ups were performed in months one , three , six and 12 . ”
Key findings included :
Men who took part in the study wore the device for an average of five hours in the first month , five hours in the third month and four hours in the sixth month .
The men ’s average flaccid penile length was 7.15 cm ( 2.82 inches ) at baseline and had increased by 32 per cent to 9.45 cm ( 3.72 inches ) in month 12 .
The men ’s average stretched penile length was 9.62 cm ( 3.79 inches ) at baseline and had increased by 18 per cent to 11.32 cm ( 4.45 inches ) in month 12 .
No significant increase in penile girth , which averaged 10.4 cm ( 4.09 inches ) at baseline , was reported .
Average erectile function scores improved by up to 36 % , from 19.9 out of 30 at baseline to 27.1 out of 30 at 12 months .
Four patients discontinued the treatment for four different reasons : pain and penile bruising , satisfactory results after three months , lack of efficacy and inability to follow the protocol .
Another was lost to follow - up .
High satisfaction levels were reported in all categories except penile girth .
The average score for overall satisfaction was 2.8 on a scale of zero to four , where four represents the optimal result .
Flaccid penile length scored 2.31 on a scale of zero to three , where three represents significant improvement .
Penile length during erection scored 2.37 out of three and sex life 2.3 .
Penile girth scored 1.1 .
“ A number of surgical procedures are available that aim to elongate the shaft of the penis or enlarge the penile girth , ” says Dr Gontero .
“ However these have a number of disadvantages , including a lack of standardisation , potential risk of complications and high patient dissatisfaction .
“ It should also be pointed out that the majority of men who seek help for a small penis fail to meet the clinical criteria for surgery .
For example , only one of the men in our study had a flaccid penis length of less than 4 cm and American guidelines strongly discourage surgery if men exceed this measurement .
Twelve had dysmorphia ( excessive dislike of a body part ) and the remaining eight had undergone surgery for curvature of the shaft . ”
The authors believe that the results are significant .
“ Our study showed that the penile extender device produces an effective and durable lengthening of the penis , both in the flaccid and stretched state , ” concludes Dr Gontero .
“ If these results are confirmed by further research , we propose that the device should be used as a first - line treatment option for men seeking a penile lengthening procedure . ”
Fans of Isaac Asimov still haunted by the film adaptation of “ I , Robot ” will get their chance to wipe it from their memory banks : a movie version of Asimov ’s “ Foundation ” novels is in the works , Variety reported .
On Thursday , Columbia Pictures won a three - way auction for film rights to Asimov ’s science - fiction epic , whose first volume concerns a mathematician put on trial after predicting the collapse of his civilization .
Columbia , a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment , beat Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox for the rights .
The studio plans to develop the film for Roland Emmerich , the director of the cataclysmic sci-fi movies “ Independence Day ” and “ The Day After Tomorrow . ”
Financial terms were not disclosed , and a release date for the film was not announced .
BONUS : Paul Krugman explains how the “ Foundation ” novels convinced him to become an economist at his Conscience of a Liberal blog .
BAY CITY , Mich . - Police say a 15 - year - old boy has died after being Tasered while they tried to break up a fight .
State Police are investigating the death .
The name of the teen was not released .
The death occurred after Bay City officers answered a report of an early morning fight early yesterday .
Two males were arguing in an apartment , and one of them " attempted to fight the officers , " a police statement said .
Police say officers used the Taser to subdue the teenager , and his reaction led them to immediately call for emergency medical help .
He was pronounced dead at Bay Regional Medical Center .
Tasers use electrical shocks to stun attackers and disrupt voluntary control of their muscles .
Deputy Police Chief Thomas Pletzke told WNEM - TV that the department has placed one officer on administrative leave in connection with the episode .

Sunsoft is pressing forward with their WiiWare manga plans with a newly created series by Leiji Matsumoto .
His previous works include Space Battleship Yamato and Galaxy Express 999 .
Like those Out of Galaxy : Gin no Koshika takes place in deep space .
You , the woman with blonde hair , and Hajime start their quest to save the galaxy on September 9 , 2099 .
Japanese Wii owners can read the first chapter on April 14 when distribution begins on the Wii Shopping Channel .
The manga viewing software and first episode will cost 500 Wii Points ( $ 5 ) .
Future chapters can be purchased for 200 Wii Points ( $ 2 ) a piece .
Sunsoft has not outlined how many chapters of Out of Galaxy will be produced .
Surprisingly , Out of Galaxy : Gin no Koshika will have English subtitles even though it has only been announced for Japan .
Sunsoft ’s previous WiiWare manga Princess
Ai also had English subtitles , but those were based off Tokyopop ’s existing localization .
Since Out of Galaxy will make its debut on WiiWare this translation is brand new .
It ’s hard to imagine the localization paying for itself if Sunsoft only releases Out of Galaxy in Japan so … should we expect an international release ?
The World Wildlife Fund releases footage of a small family of Javan rhinos in the Ujung Kulon National Park
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Fresh video images of the world 's most endangered mammal – the elusive Javan rhino – were released today .
Just 60 of the 2,300 kgs animals are thought to remain alive in the Indonesian jungles .
But the Javan rhinos , which grow more than three metres long , are extremely shy and efforts to capture pictures of them with stills cameras were often frustrated because the animals flee at the sound of the shutter .
Now the environmental group WWF has caught images of the rhino on video cameras in the rugged Ujung Kulon National Park on the southern tip of Java , Indonesia .
The grainy clips show a mother and calf , accompanied by a large male , wallowing in muddy holes .
Other footage shot at night reveals the female rhino chasing a pig away .
Few of the WWF researchers who have studied the Javan rhino for the past 20 years have ever seen the animal .
The latest project used a web of 34 video cameras activated by movement sensors that were set up in likely haunts .
" The videos are showing a lot of young animals but not many calves , " said WWF Asian rhino co-ordinator , Christy Williams .
" So there 's evidence of breeding , but not enough .
A healthy rhino population should be increasing at about 7 % a year , or three or four calves .
Here we 're only seeing three or four calves every four or five years . "
" To kill the vampire you had to remove the shroud from its mouth , which was its food like the milk of a child , and put something uneatable in there , " said Borrini .
" It 's possible that other corpses have been found with bricks in their mouths , but this is the first time the ritual has been recognised . "

Gallium Additions To Aromaticity
New main - group compounds expand the bounds of metalloaromaticity
Robinson 's octahedral Ga 6 compound ( top ) and Power 's digallatabenzene ( bottom ) demonstrate new possibilities for aromaticity .
Aromaticity , a phenomenon in which delocalized bonding enhances the stability of cyclic molecular frameworks , has traditionally been the province of organic chemistry .
But no more .
Enterprising chemists have been showing with greater frequency that carbon is n't always necessary for aromaticity ; metal - containing compounds of all sorts can mimic the behavior of classical aromatic systems .
A pair of chemists reported the latest manifestations of metalloaromaticity in the form of two novel gallium compounds during presentations before the Division of Inorganic Chemistry at the ACS national meeting taking place this week in Salt Lake City .
Creation of these types of compounds is helping chemists gain an ever - better understanding of chemical bonding .
Gregory H. Robinson of the University of Georgia described his group 's synthesis of a Ga 6 cage compound , the first example of a neutral aromatic gallium species with an octahedral structure .
And Philip P. Power of the University of California , Davis , discussed his group 's preparation of the first aromatic metallabenzene containing two gallium atoms .
Both researchers have previously dabbled with making gallium - containing ring compounds .
Alexander I. Boldyrev of Utah State University , whose research includes computational and gas - phase studies on metalloaromatic species , notes that the Robinson and Power compounds " represent remarkable advancements of delocalized bonding in main - group inorganic chemistry . "
These researchers are helping to move the field forward by making stable , isolable solids that " show us the great potential for aromaticity and antiaromaticity concepts beyond organic chemistry , " Boldyrev says .
Robinson 's group made its compound , Ga 6 R 4 L 2 , where R is mesityl and L is an N - heterocyclic carbene , by reducing the precursor compound LGaRCl 2 with potassium metal ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009 , 131 , 3168 ) .
The compound has 14 delocalized valence electrons in its skeleton and exhibits spherical aromaticity , similar to closed - cage boranes such as B 6 H 6 2 ???.
The synthesis was part of a larger effort Robinson discussed to use N - heterocyclic carbenes as versatile ligands for main - group compounds , including diatomic boron , silicon , and phosphorus species .
" The metalloaromaticity of the Ga 6 compound is traced to the stabilizing electron - donor capabilities of the N - heterocyclic carbene , " Robinson told C&EN .
Power 's group prepared a digallatabenzene , K 2 [ C 4 H 2 Ph 2 Ga 2 R 2 ] , where Ph is phenyl and R is a bulky terphenyl , by inserting phenylacetylene into the digallene RGa=GaR , then reducing the cyclic product with potassium metal .
The dianion ring has six π electrons , the same as benzene , with the negative charges balanced by potassium cations .
Power discussed the digallatabenzene as part of a presentation on his group 's exploration of adding hydrogen , ammonia , and small unsaturated hydrocarbons to digallium and other group 13 and 14 metal compounds ( Angew . Chem. Int. Ed. 2009 , 48 , 2027 and 2031 ) .
Looking beyond digallatabenzene , Power believes that getting three or four gallium atoms into a stable six - membered aromatic ring is feasible .
Wearing a white T - shirt and blue jeans and sporting a compact moustache , Chris Gay , fully shackled in the back seat of a sheriff 's cruiser , stayed mostly quiet as his home state of Tennessee – and the likelihood of a long prison sentence – drew ever nearer .
Coffee County , Tenn. , Capt .
Donnie
Thomas did n't know the diminutive prisoner in the back was one of America 's most notorious cons , a man one Tennessee police chief calls " the Cool Hand Luke of the 2000s . "
The deputy made it back to Tennessee .
His prisoner did n't .
Mr. Gay 's much - publicized prison - break in 2007 to reach his dying mama 's side failed , but only after he led authorities on a five - state , five - day chase that ended with him being arrested driving the country singer Crystal Gayle 's stolen tour bus in Florida .
Now police around the flyspeck burgs of northern Tennessee are back on full alert after another audacious escape by Gay in Kennesaw , Ga. , on Tuesday .
" How people portray him , he 's an outlaw , " says Michael Douglas , the police chief of Pleasant View , Tenn .
The details of Gay 's Houdini - like escape – a wily thief up against a veteran small - town Tennessee deputy – is remarkable for its " Smokey & The Bear " allure at a time when outlaws are found mostly online .
Indeed , with the US firmly entrenched in the Homeland Security era , Gay 's criminal , but non-violent , exploits and escapes have made him an unlikely figure :
The latest in a long tradition of American counter - heroes , a modern - day Pretty Boy Floyd .
" After 9/11 , law enforcement has kind of become omnipotent , but there 's a yearning , perhaps stronger than ever , for someone to thumb their nose at authority , and that 's why [ Gay ] is very appealing in his own kind of curious , if somewhat perverse , way , " says Stephen Mihm , a historian at the University of Georgia and author of " A Nation of Counterfeiters : Capitalists , Con Men and the Making of the United States . "
" Law - abiding folks view these people with perhaps misplaced admiration , but one that has a lot to do with whatever resentments ordinary people might nurse against authority , whether it be a bank or the local sheriff 's department , " he says .
The Gay story has as many twists and tragedies as the best country song , which is what songwriter Tim O'Brien picked up on when he first read about the case in a small paper in Telluride , Colo. , in 2007 .
The Grammy winner turned the tale into a popular bluegrass song , " The Ballad of Christopher Daniel Gay . "
Knowing his mom was dying , the 5 - foot - 5 , 140 pound Gay escaped from a prisoner transport in January 2007 at a welcome center on the Alabama line , exploiting a sodden rain that stymied a team of tracking dogs .
The first leg of the pursuit ended just 50 yards from his mother 's trailer in Coopertown , Tenn. , north of Nashville , where he crashed a stolen Walmart tractor - trailer into a field and headed for the woods once again .
An accomplice picked him up on a nearby back road and took him to Nashville , where he stole Ms. Gayle 's tour bus and drove it to a NASCAR track in Florida , littering it with chip bag wrappers and empty bottles .
" What he done was wrong , but he knows his mama do n't have long , " his mother , Annie , had told the press , after her wayward son had come within 50 feet of her front door .
Two weeks after Gay 's arrest , Annie passed on .
His mother 's death is n't the only tragedy in Gay 's life of crime .
According to a Maxim magazine article about Gay , he grew up in an alcoholic family and learned to subsist on his own , once as a kid catching and boiling a couple of roosters for sustenance .
As his sister , Leann Newman , told Mr. O'Brien , " If you want , he 's got stories for songs for days . "
Poor , sidelined , and one of millions of witnesses to a world of riches beyond his legal grasp , Gay made use of his diminutive anonymity with brazen cons .
A sometime roofer , his thefts grew more audacious as he settled on his preferred targets : heavy construction equipment .
But at the same time , he had a desire to finally break out of his anonymity , to become someone bigger .
" Truth told , Gay did n't particularly want to be invisible any longer , " Stephen Russell writes in the Maxim article .
" Underneath the need to see his mother , another urge was bubbling up : to finally stand out from the crowd . "
With Tuesday 's escape , Gay has sealed that wish , becoming what Prof .
Minh calls " a classic trickster legend . "
" Here it looks like it 's curtains for this guy , and what do you know ?
He outwits his pursuers yet again , " he says .
According to published accounts , including those of his wife , Erica Tapola - Gay , Gay is seen by friends as a Robin Hood - like criminal who has given $ 100 bills to homeless people and cooked dinner for hungry neighborhood kids , even mowing his mother - in - law ' s grass and watering her roses .
Unlike Eric Rudolph , the convicted Olympics bomber who eluded a massive FBI dragnet in the western North Carolina mountains for five years , Gay 's favorable reputation is heavily tied to his nonviolent demeanor .
" What he has done is definitely wrong , and he is a criminal , but I am still proud of him as a person , " Ms. Tapola - Gay wrote in a letter to a Nashville TV station after his arrest in 2007 .
Poor people , especially , are sympathetic to Gay 's plight , chiefly because he uses his country smarts and Broadway - caliber talents to outwit " the man , " says O'Brien , the songwriter .
" He 's kind of the wild and crazy guy meets ' Dumb and Dumber , ' though it 's not that he 's dumb , maybe just foolish , " he says .
" I think the justice system wants us to believe that they can get everybody , so you kind of want him to see his family and escape somewhere and live happily ever after somehow .
The only way to do that is to be an outlaw , and maybe it 's still possible .
I think it is . "
Gay 's exploits are headed for legend , set first to song and now to film .
Indeed , after this latest escape , the Hollywood director Craig Brewer ( " Hustle & Flow , " " Black Snake Moan " ) will have to go to rewrite for his upcoming movie based on Gay 's exploits .
Cheatham County Assistant District Attorney Bob Wilson is n't so awe - struck .
" He 's a little thief , a little con , " says Mr. Wilson , who has an outstanding warrant for equipment theft ready to serve to Gay .
" I 'm just looking forward to seeing him . "
In Pleasant View , Tenn. , one of a handful of little towns and backcountry burgs where Gay grew up and still seems most comfortable , Police Chief Michael Douglas credits Gay with " being pretty good at what he does . "
Pleasant View is where this tale really began .
In 2006 , Gay conned a Nashville towing company , convincing them to pick up a bulldozer at a local construction site .
Over his career , Douglas says
Gay stole millions of dollars worth of equipment , part of a fencing ring that would misappropriate heavy equipment , scratch out the VIN numbers , and paint them to look like new .
After being nabbed for stealing an RV in Alabama , Gay was being extradited to Tennessee to face the bulldozer charge when he escaped the first time , using a paper clip hidden in his mouth to unshackle himself from both handcuffs and leg irons .
During his 2007 run , he stole Gayle 's tour bus not by hotwiring it , but by walking into the management company 's office and asking for the keys .
" He has n't gotten through life killing people , but outwitting them , " says Prof .
Mihm .
Indeed , even Tennessee law enforcement officials view Gay 's coolness and lock - picking skills with begrudging respect .
Police , in fact , gave him the nickname " Little Houdini . "
Touched by Gay 's attempt to see his mother .
Coopertown , Tenn. , police chief Dave Barrera made it known that Gay could see Annie one last time if he turned himself in , a reunion that never happened .
This week , Gay did what he has always done : Greet opportunity when it walks through the door .
Perhaps aware that Capt .
Thomas did n't know his reputation , Gay started working on his escape after Thomas stopped to eat at a Waffle House in Kennesaw .
When Thomas returned , Gay asked to use the restroom .
When the deputy opened the door , Gay , suddenly unshackled , bolted .
Though police have never known
Gay to be violent , and Georgia media described him as " not dangerous , " college officials locked down the Kennesaw State University campus on Tuesday , as unconfirmed eyewitness accounts described Gay walking through a dining hall as cool as a Sunday breeze .
Though there 's no evidence that Gay has a gun , authorities have labeled him as " armed and dangerous . "
" If a guy is wanting to escape as much as he is , we feel like he 's going to try to do anything to get out , " says Chief Douglas in Pleasant View .
Capt .
Thomas , a 35 - year - veteran , almost refused to come back to Tennessee until he caught up with Gay , says Coffee County Sheriff Steve Graves .
In response to the escape , the sheriff 's department has already mandated more intense background checks on prisoners lined up for transport .
" [ Thomas ] definitely wants to be the one who goes and picks [ Gay ] up when he gets caught , " says Sheriff Graves .
" But this time I 'll send someone with him . "
Effective problem solving involves unleashing synergies that address core problems .
The Obama Administration and Congress are obviously aware of this .
Consider the following example related to the emerging economic stimulus package : During his Inaugural Address , the President stated his intention to “ rebuild our schools . ”
Reflecting this vow , the House stimulus package includes nearly $ 140 billion for school construction .
It is good that jobs and education have been tied strategically .
With a bit more reflection by the Senate , the strategic intersection of four crises – jobs , education , healthcare , and food security – could be even more elegantly addressed using school lunch programs across the nation .
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack has assured Americans that the USDA will put “ nutrition at the center of all food assistance programs . ”
This reflects among other goals , the Administration ’s desire to address a core cause of the healthcare crisis : Type 2 diabetes .
The Centers for Disease Control estimate that if current dietary habits persist as many as one third of this nation ’s kids will become diabetic .
The major culprit is a form of malnutrition tied to highly processed , pre-prepared , and fast foods that are long on sugar and fat and short on vitamins and complex carbohydrates .
The national costs of caring for tens of millions of Type 2 diabetics is draining public coffers and personal wealth .
According to the National Diabetes Information Clearing House , the US spent nearly $ 120 billion to treat diabetes in 2007 , 94 % of which was Type 2 .
One reason children eat poorly is that since the early 1980s we have been systematically cutting public investment in school lunch at all levels of government .
Consequently , children no longer learn what a balanced , healthy meal looks like from their school lunch plates .
Many kids , particularly those from low - income families , are robbed of what could be the most nutritious meal of their day .
Today , if kids eat school lunch at all , it usually comes in a prepackaged tray devoid of nutrition provided by food service companies .
Most likely the meal has been shipped from afar in refrigerated trucks .
It is then thawed and heated at a central location , packed in a heat retaining case , and delivered to a school in rolling racks .
Because we believed it would save money , school cafeterias , lunch staffs , and healthy fresh food were cut .
The cuts in school lunch programs help to cause the diabetes epidemic , which will literally cost taxpayer funded healthcare programs trillions of dollars to treat .
Although the House stimulus bill does contain $ 198 million for replacing “ school food service ” equipment , it will not fix school lunch .
It may in fact make it easier to continue using the current approach by providing more microwaves and rolling racks .
The Senate can do better .

A wise Senator could offer an amendment to create a USDA block grant program to reignite school lunch cafeterias that would replace the outsourced food service system .
Funds could be passed to cities and counties to hire builders to reconstruct the cafeterias and nutrition experts to develop healthy menus to meet cultural preferences .
School districts could hire distribution companies to reorient the food sourcing toward healthy local farms and ranches that use sustainable or organic production practices , enhancing regional food security , creating additional agricultural jobs , and improving ecological health .
School principals could hire home economics teachers and contract with organic gardeners or local farmers to teach our children how to improve and maintain their own health by eating food they learn to glean or grow , cook , and preserve by canning , pickling and drying .
With school lunch infrastructure in place from the stimulus package , the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition
Act this fall should render more positive results .
This is particularly true , if the federal contribution to the budgets for school breakfast and lunch programs is increased , as they should be if we want more healthy kids .
I urge the Senate to think a bit more deeply about strategic use of the stimulus package in order to optimize the bill ’s transformative capacity .
Let ’s begin by enlarging the education and nutrition investment goals to create not only more jobs and better education , but also lower healthcare costs and more secure regional food supplies .

I have no idea why I did this comic , so do n’t ask me .
Raccoons and iPods ?
Whatever .
The multi-hair - colored young lady in panels 1 and 2 is long time friend of HijiNKS Ensue , Stacy .
She is soon to be an Apple Genius at our local Apple store but has n’t yet completed the ritual blood rights or the “ Sacred Hunt . ”
They send you out into the mall and if you do n’t come back with the half eaten heart of a PC user you have to battle 7 food court employees including the manager of Sbarro .
He ’s enourmous and armed with a calzone .
My only regret , art - wise , is that I was n’t able to showcase all of her facial piercings in this limited pixel format .
Sorry Stacy .
I tried .
I do n’t have a strong opinion about the new 3G iPod Shuffle or the feaux - controversey surrounding it ’s total lack of buttons .
If you like it , buy it .
If you hate it , do n’t .
I do find it interesting , however , that every SNL sketch and Onion story that mocks Apples disdain for all things button seems to come true .
Soon enough , purchasing an iPod will actually REMOVE buttons from your other devices .
It will litterally have negative buttons .
Things are a bit slow around here .
GMAT is taking most of my free time and day job been busy .
Last week I had some free time and decided to take on this small project .
By popular demand here it is , a long tutorial explaining how to reverse / crack a Mac OS X application , starting with tools ( GDB and otx ) and then a step by step of how to crack a time trial protection .
Writing such tutorial is not an easy task , trust me !
It ’s not easy to explain things you know now by instinct and translate them to words .
I did my best and it should break some ground , making things easier for those who want to come to Mac reversing world .
I think the most interesting part is how to work with GDB , which should be the hardest part for anyone coming to Mac OS X without any experience with it .
It is assumed you have knowledge about x86 assembler ( there are already too many excellent tutorials about this ) .
If you have any comments , improvements , errors feel free to leave a comment .
All help is appreciated .
The target app is SlidePad .
I leave here the binary I used so everyone can follow the tutorial and not have problems with different versions .

Have fun !
fG !
The Libyan leader turned on the king , saying : " It has been six years you have been avoiding a confrontation with me .
You are propelled by fibs towards the grave and you were made by Britain and protected by the US . "
" A gripping lesson in Newton 's Three Laws of physics . " ( 2000 ) This account is a testament to the intelligence teenagers , who are prone to recklessness -- a fact I should have borne in mind .
Six years ago , on a Sunday afternoon , our gang of five had taken it into our brains that , since we live near the sea , it would be fun to play on the cliffs .
We took turns riding our bikes up to the cliff edge and braking at the last possible moment , the object being a typical competition between young males .
The drop to the water was over one hundred feet .
After one boy almost flew off the cliff , we made it ' safer ' by tying rope around our waists , attached to separate pegs anchored securely in the ground .
This , we thought , would avert trouble .
Uh huh .
One boy 's bike squeaked terribly when he braked , and it was getting on everyone 's nerves .
So he took care of the squeak in an ingenious way : he oiled the brakes .
Some of you might already realise that this presents another problem , but we did n't see it .
When it was his turn , he rode up to the cliff with the ironic cry , " Watch this ! "
Indeed we did watch .
We watched him apply the brakes , we watched his expression change to terror , and we watched him disappear from sight as he sailed over the cliff .
The rope did its job , and halted his descent .
But his rope was longer than the others , and suffered the strain of 60 feet of falling teenager , as did the waist around which the rope was tied .
The impact of stopping broke several ribs and almost cleaved him in two .
Not surprisingly , he fainted .
At the top of the cliff , the four remaining kids telephoned for help , but the cliff was so remote that we could n't get through .
Instead of running for help , we decided to winch him up ourselves .
We set about digging up the peg he was attached to .
When it finally came free , there was only one person holding it , and he was pulled over the cliff by the weight of the first boy .
Sensibly , he still had his harness on , but the 45 - foot drop he endured mearly knocked this boy out .
Meanwhile , the extra 45 feet of rope let the first boy plunge into the ocean , where he unfortunately drowned .
The last three boys on the cliff summoned help from the Coast Guard .
Half an hour later , a large Sea King helicopter attempted to lift the dangling boy to safety .
By this point , the knot that tied the rope around the boy 's waist had come loose , and he was hanging on for dear life .
Whirling helicopter blades build up a massive amount of static electricity as they beat against the air .
Each helicopter therefore carries a cable to earth itself after a flight .
As that cable approached the boy , he grabbed for it , heedless of people shouting warnings from the helicopter .
When he did grab ahold of the cable , the electric shock blew him against the cliff , and he fell into the sea .
Fortunately he did not drown .
He was airlifted to hospital , where he made a full recovery .
Six years later , I still have the scar on my hand where I touched that earthing cable .
I owe my life to the work of the Coast Guard that day .
Thank you , Coast Guard , for helping idiots like me stay alive long enough to tell the story to other idiots .
Cheers !

It was a neocon moment : there they were , the organizers of the Foreign Policy Initiative , the new neoconservative think - tank – Bill Kristol , Dan Senor , and Robert Kagan , with Clifford May , Randy Scheunemann , and junior neocon James Kirchick in tow .
It was the occasion of FPI ’s first public event – their Washington coming out party , so to speak – and who should show up but I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
A more fitting symbol of the neoconservative tendency in American politics – its history , its methods , and its essential criminality – could hardly be conceived .
While John McCain was ostensibly the main attraction , the real focus of the conference was a celebration of the man who defeated him .
As David Weigel put it , the FPI conference turned into a " Neocons for Obama " festival , as super - hawkish foreign policy maven Fred Kagan hailed President Obama ’s Af - Pak offensive as the best thing since the Iraqi " surge " : " He ’s definitely saying no to pulling back .
It was a gutsy and correct decision . "
Yet all is not rosy : " Kagan worried / predicted that Obama ’s base would bristle at the plan , so ‘he will be counting on some significant amount of support from his political opponents . ’ "
Not to worry .
The brain - dead Obamaites are shamelessly eager to grant their Glorious Leader a pass , no matter what he does .
So far , there is not a peep out of Obama ’s liberal supporters , except a few voices raised at the Nation , even as the president mounts a major escalation of the Long War .
Not only that , but his supporters are rallying around their commander in chief , now that we ’re fighting the " right " war in the " right " way .
And take a good look at some of his supporters …
FPI is the latest in a long line of neocon front groups , all of them – the Committee on the Present Danger , the Committee for a Free World , the Project for a New American Century [ .pdf ] – aimed at whipping the country into a militaristic frenzy .
There is not only an ideological legacy here , but a genealogical one , as the catalytic role of a member of the Kristol family has always been instrumental in organizing these groups – Irving back in the day , his son William more recently .
The one and only aim of this ideological Mafia is to conjure enemies and agitate relentlessly for a more aggressive foreign policy .
The neocons may shift from Left to Right and back again when it comes to economic issues , but what they really care about – where their hottest passions lie – is in maintaining and expanding America ’s overseas empire .
They are ecstatic that Obama is launching a major offensive on the Afghan - Pakistan front , and they are urging him to do more .
Their latest campaign is undertaken in cooperation with the " progressives " over at the Center for American Progress and the Center for a New American Security , both conduits for recent and future administration appointees .
The Af - Pak popular front means an alliance of convenience between the neocons and the White House , not at all a surprising development if one knows the history of these former Scoop Jackson Democrats turned " conservative " Republicans .
They can function quite well no matter which party is in power , and they always have a prominent public forum , no matter how discredited their views are in the public mind .
Of one thing we can be sure : the infiltration of the Obama administration has already begun , with Dennis Ross – who signed on to more than one PNAC letter urging war with Iraq – now ensconced as a envoy dealing with Iran .
First on the program , John A. Nagl , the Center for a New American Security ’s president .
CNAS is enormously influential in the foreign policy councils of the Obama administration , and Nagl is a key figure among the so - called national security Democrats .
He is the chief theoretician of the " nation - building " counterinsurgency doctrine espoused by Gen.
David Petraeus , architect of the Iraqi " surge " that now is backfiring in our faces .
Nagl is paired with Robert Kagan , a second - generation neocon , co-founder , with Kristol the Younger , of PNAC , and a tireless cog in the War Party ’s propaganda machine .
The topic under discussion : " Internationalism vs. Isolationism . "
Yes , the " internationalists " of both parties can put aside their differences and unite against the dreaded isolationists , those fearsome , anti-social troglodytes who insist on minding their own business and wish that the American government would , too .
Moderating this anti-" isolationist " hate - fest was Jackson Diehl , deputy editorial page editor at the Washington Post , a newspaper that serves as the voice and guardian of the bipartisan " internationalism " that rules out any real debate when it comes to foreign policy .
Rep. Jane Harman , noted Democratic hawk and chair of the House intelligence subcommittee , also spoke , alongside Republican John McHugh of New York , who was on the House floor the other day demanding that Congress " ensure the [ president ’s Afghan - Pakistan ] strategy is fully funded , resourced , and executed . "
It does n’t matter to these people that the nation is sick of war and near bankruptcy : they live inside the Washington bubble , the Imperial City , where hubris permeates the air .
It does n’t matter how many times the neocons have been repelled , they just keep bouncing back .
This is a crew of respected " analysts " and policy wonks that has never been right , not about anything .
From their gross overestimation of Soviet military power in the Cold War era , to the " domino theory " that kept us in Vietnam , to their willfully erroneous assumption that Iraq possessed " weapons of mass destruction , " their foreign policy prognostications leave behind them a trail of uninterrupted error .
It is a record unequaled in the history of ideas , yet the neocons ’ influence , while it is currently waning , never disappears altogether .
The neocons always make a comeback , and a well - funded one to be sure .
The innocuous - sounding Foreign Policy Initiative is just the sort of camouflage the neocons need in the age of Obama : no more proclamations of a " New American Century , " but rather more sober - sounding , " pragmatic " slogans .
Together with their newfound liberal and " progressive " allies , they beat the drums for more military spending , a rising confrontation with Russia , and , of course , a showdown with Iran .
Having exhausted their previous host , the GOP , the neocons have no qualms about moving on .
The Democrats will do just as well .
Whoever ’s in power is the object of their affection .
Their role is to whisper in the ear of the prince , to make sure he gets the " right " information – and then sabotage him if he fails to respond to their ministrations .
As the neocons hail Obama , their new conquering hero , the irony of all this underscores the difficulties of instituting real change in our foreign policy .
The same old faces turn up no matter which party is in power , and the same old ideas – shopworn " internationalist " bromides – dominate a consensus that never questions whether an empire is good for the American people .
Defence chiefs are facing an inquiry into the safety of the United Kingdom 's nuclear deterrent after British and French submarines , each laden with missiles powerful enough for 1,248 Hiroshima bombings , collided while submerged in the mid-Atlantic .
HMS Vanguard , the lead boat of Britain 's fleet of four V - class submarines armed with Trident nuclear missiles , limped back into its home port of Faslane in Scotland on Saturday showing significant damage .
Witnesses said the hull was scarred with dents and scrapes .
The weather was rough in the middle of the night of 3 and 4 February when the British submarine , which was carrying 135 crew , struck Le Triomphant , the flagship of the French nuclear strike force , destroying the French vessel 's fibreglass sonar dome , which juts out from the bow and , among other tasks , is supposed to detect other submarines .
In London , the Ministry of Defence tried to maintain its policy of total secrecy about the movements of Briain 's nuclear fleet , but it was forced to confirm the embarrassing collision between strategic allies after the French Navy posted details of the accident on its website .
Both countries insisted that neither the missile - launching capacity nor the nuclear safety of the submarines , carrying 265 crew and 32 intercontinental ballistic missiles , were affected .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Admiral Sir Jonathon Band , the First Sea Lord , said : " Recently , the two submarines came into contact at very low speed .
Both submarines remained safe and no injuries occurred .
We can confirm that the capability remained unaffected and there has been no compromise to nuclear safety . "
Defence sources said the accident was the result of the " infinitesimal " coincidence that both submarines were operating at the same depth and location in the Atlantic .
Such a claim is undermined because Nato allies routinely share information at a top - secret level about the deployment of submarines to ensure they do not occupy the same area of ocean , an arrangement in which the French , whose nuclear deterrent remains independent , are understood to participate .
But nuclear - armed submarines often gravitate towards the same " nesting grounds " – deep , quiet sectors of ocean – to allow them to fulfil their mission by sailing continuously with minimal noise and remaining within range of potential targets .
For many years , Britain and France have maintained their nuclear deterrent by ensuring they have at least one of their missile - carrying submarines at sea 365 days a year with the ability to launch within seconds ' notice .
Vanguard and Triomphant , which was at the end of a 70 - day tour , each carry 16 intercontinental missiles , armed with between six and eight warheads in each .
Politicians said the incident raised serious questions about the precautions to protect the V - class nuclear vessels , which , at nearly 16,000 tonnes and 150 m long , are among the largest submarines ever built .
Similar questions were being asked in France , where the 14,335 - tonne Triomphant returned to its base at L'Ile Longue , near Brest .
The boat will spend up to four months in dry - dock undergoing repair .
The French Navy intially claimed the submarine had been in a collision " apparently with a container " .
Angus Robertson , the leader of the SNP in Westminster , said : " The MoD needs to explain how it is possible for a submarine carrying weapons of mass destruction to collide with another submarine carrying weapons of mass destruction in the middle of the world 's second - largest ocean . "
Nick Harvey , the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman , said : " While the British nuclear fleet has a good safety record , if there were ever to be a bang it would be a mighty big one .
The public entrust this equipment to the Government confident that all possible precautions are being taken . "
Naval experts , who underlined that the two nuclear submarines were built with hulls designed to withstand huge pressures , expressed surprise that the sonar arrays of both had failed to detect either vessel .
Sonar technology is now so sophisticated manufacturers boast it can recognise a small fish .
That it does not seem to have been able to pick out a submarine nearly the length of two football pitches and the height of a three - storey building could be explained by the development of stealth technology , making the submarines less visible to other vessels .
Stephen Saunders , the editor of Jane 's Fighting Ships , said : " The modus operandi of most submarines , particularly ballistic - missile submarines , is to operate stealthily and to proceed undetected .
This means operating passively , by not transmitting on sonar , and making as little noise as possible .
A great deal of technical effort has gone into making submarines quiet by reduction of machinery noise .
And much effort has gone into improving the capability of sonars to detect other submarines ; detection was clearly made too late or not at all in this case . "
Anti-nuclear campaigners said the two vessels had been moments from a potentially catastrophic accident which could have resulted in the widespread release of radioactive material .
Kate Hudson , chairwoman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said : " This is a nuclear nightmare of the highest order .
It is the most severe incident involving a nuclear submarine since the sinking of the Kursk in 2000 and the first time since the Cold War that two nuclear - armed subs are known to have collided .
Vanguard is likely to be confined to port for months with a multimillion - pound repair bill .
Gordon Brown should seize this opportunity to end continuous patrols . "
Several serious accidents have befallen the UK 's submarine fleet .
In 2002 , HMS Trafalgar suffered considerable damage when it ran aground on rocks off Skye in a training exercise .
Last week , an inquest heard how two sailors on the Trafalgar 's sister vessel , HMS Tireless , died in an explosion caused by a faulty oxygen generator .
Crewmates battled for 40 minutes to reach the two men after the force of the blast closed and buckled hatch doors .
You knew this was coming .
In the wake of President Obama 's gaffe on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno yesterday about Special Olympics athletes , Gov. Sarah Palin , whose son has Down syndrome , is blasting him for disparaging the special - needs community .
“ I was shocked to learn of the comment made by President Obama about Special Olympics , ” Palin said in a statement .
“ This was a degrading remark about our world ’s most precious and unique people , coming from the most powerful position in the world . "
She added :
“ These athletes overcome more challenges , discrimination and adversity than most of us ever will .
By the way , these athletes can outperform many of us and we should be proud of them .
I hope President Obama ’s comments do not reflect how he truly feels about the special - needs community . ”
Obama 's office has tried to clarify his remark since the initial blunder and the president apologized to Special Olympics Chairman Timothy Shriver .
Meanwhile , Palin has come under fire this week for refusing stimulus money slated to help special - needs education programs .
Her stance on funding for such programs as governor led to attacks during the campaign as well .

Many harms associated with cannabis use result from prohibition rather than the drug itself , an Australian academic has told a United Nations review of drug policy .
Professor Robin Room , a sociologist at the University of Melbourne 's School of Population Health has spent much of the past week telling meetings in Vienna that international conventions on cannabis are out of touch and do little to influence the number of users .
Prof Room said while penalties were generally low for cannabis use and possession globally , young people and minorities were more likely than other groups to become caught up in the legal system .
Arrests caused significant suffering , such as personal and family humiliation , as did convictions , which often excluded people from certain jobs and activities .
" A lot of young people 's lives get messed up because of arrests over something that is almost impossible to overdose with and where its possible harm is of medium seriousness , " Prof Room said .
Censorship and tradition mean there is no great history of political cartoons in the Middle East
By Tim Franks
BBC News , Jerusalem
SAYING THE UNSPEAKABLE
How do you say the unspeakable ?
The refuge , in many places , at many times , has been the cartoon .
But in the Middle East , there has not been much of that tradition .
It is partly censorship .
It is partly , also , the religious tradition : Islamic tradition has discouraged figurative depiction of human beings ; in Judaism , pictures are used only sparingly .
Now , an exhibition which is currently touring the West Bank , aims to spread the word about the power of cartoons .
Lighting Lamps is sponsored by the British Council , and has just opened at the Duheishe refugee camp , close to Bethlehem .
It features cartoons from across the Middle East , as well as a smattering from the British cartoonist , Steve Bell .
There is a strip from the Palestinians , Amr Shomali and Basel Nasser ( pictured above ) .
Two men are talking .
Man A : " Are you Fatah or Hamas ? " Man B : " I'm Palestinian . "
A : " Habibi ( matey ) do n't be clever .
We 're all Palestinian .
Who are you with in the civil war ? "
B : " I 'm against the civil war . "
A : " We 're all against it , but it happened .. so who are you with ? " B : " I 'm against both . "
A : " Do n't drive me crazy .
You have to choose between Fatah and Hamas . "
B : " Between Fatah and Hamas , I choose Canada . "
One of the contributors is Emad Hajjaj , from Jordan .
Despite a thin history of figurative drawing , cartoons have , he says , become very popular in Arabic newspapers over the last 50 or 60 years .
" It 's one of the few things that make you laugh about your problems . "
Freedom is , still , curtailed .
Being a cartoonist is , says Mr Hajjaj , " unfortunately a very tough job in our region " .
Emad Hajjaj is says being a cartoonist " unfortunately a very tough job in our region "
" But we use symbolism to say many things that we cannot say directly : like criticising our political regimes , like criticising religious issues , " Mr Hajjaj says .
Next to us , at the exhibition , there was an unflattering depiction of Tony Blair and the former British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , erupting from George W Bush 's backside , in a Steve Bell cartoon which was published in the Guardian newspaper .
" I wo n't hide that I wish I could have the situation that Steve Bell has , " Emad Hajjaj confessed .
" I did draw my king once it was the first time that our king had been portrayed in a cartoon . "
That was nine years ago .
Emad Hajjaj said that the drawing was not a " hard " one .
" But there were many , many problems afterwards . "
At least , he said , Jordan is in a " much , much better situation " than Syria , among other Middle Eastern countries .
WALKING ON A MINEFIELD
You might think that Israel , given the often scabrous nature of its press , would have a vibrant tradition of cartoons , to rival the ferocity of anything in Britain .
Not so .
The cartoons in Israel are not vicious , certainly in comparison to some of the comments on the op - ed pages .
Tzipi Livni : " Do you accept the principle of 2 countries for 2 people ? "
Binyamin Netanyahu : " Yes : with Likud in power in one , and Kadima in opposition in the other . "
Michel Kichka is a cartoonist who came to Israel 35 years ago from Belgium , a country with a rich history of cartoons and illustrated books .
( You can see his work here : http://kichka.com/blog/ )
He says history and technology have left Israeli cartoons softer than they might otherwise have been .
The history is partly that of a lack of illustration in religious texts ; more recently , that " there is a residue of trauma " about the cartoons which were part of the Nazis ' anti-Semitic propaganda .
And it so happened that the cartoonists who emigrated to the new Jewish state came from central Europe where the tradition was less biting .
Now , though , Michel Kichka says " it is like walking on a minefield " .
Since the enormous controversy over the publication , first in a Danish newspaper , of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad , Mr Kichka says " you ca n't draw what you write " .
There were moments , he says , when the cartoons were savage : for example , when David Ben-Gurion ( Israel 's first Prime Minister ) and Menachem Begin were arguing over whether Jews should accept reparations from Germany .
" But today , you publish in your country , and it can go anywhere in the world .
When I criticise my government 's policy , I do n't want my cartoon used in a country which only wants to destroy my country . "
Here are a selection of your thoughts on Tim Franks ' diary : I find the caption about " no great history of political cartoons in the Middle East " odd .
I also agree with Itsik 's comment .
Alas , Tim Franks forgets names such as Naji Al - Ali , Ali Farzat , Bahgouri , and many others in the Middle East , who have produced plenty of political or social cartoons .
If anything , the murder of Naji Al - Ali and the problems which Farzat ran into indicate that cartoonists in the Middle East were censored by regimes , not by religion .
Nor is there evidence that religions or their representatives tried to discourage cartoons as " figurative " ( with one exception may be - Saudi Arabia . )
Generally , satirical cartoonists in the Middle East are still there , alive and kicking .
Gottfried Stutz , Paris - France I saw the " Are you Fatah or Hamas ? " exchange and immediately thought of Naji Al - Ali 's famous cartoon where someone asks : " Are you Muslim or Christian ?
Sunni or Shiite ?
Druze or Alawite ?
Coptic or Maronite ?
Greek Catholic or Greek Orthodox " only to receive the reply " I am Arab , you imbecile ! " .
And this dude does n't even mention him ...
Marcus , London
I 'm not sure on what basis it is argued that " Censorship and tradition mean there is no great history of political cartoons in the Middle East . "
The political cartoon has been a mainstay of Arabic publications - both newspapers and magazines - for quite some time , offering some of the most pointed critiques of the situation in the region and daring to comment on matters from which commentators in other media would shy away .
The Palestinian cartoonist , Naji al - Ali is but the most well - known Arab political cartoonist , offering trenchant criticisms of American and Israeli policies , and Arab regimes alike .
His daylight assassination in the streets of London has not deterred subsequent political cartoonists in the Arab world from taking to task their own leaders as well as others .
Joseph Farag , Cairo , Egypt I do not know where you got that there 's no cartoon tradition in the Middle East .
I find Palestinian cartoonists much more humorous and blunt than Western ones .
Check out Naji al - Ali , probably the best cartoonist in history , and artist and a visionary .
He 's Palestinian
It 's nice to write about this exhibitions , but do n't rush to assumptions .
Wissam , Dubai " It is partly censorship .
It is partly , also , the religious tradition : Islamic tradition has discouraged figurative depiction of human beings " Nonsense !
Whoever wrote this has a superficial understanding of Islam and the region .
Plus , caricature does have a history in the Middle East , and particularly in Palestine .
Naji Al - Ali anyone ?
Hanthala lives on ...
Inad , Qatar
This looks like the writer wrote this with pre-drawn conclusions before he looked into the matter .
Maybe that 's the BBC 's version of investigative journalism .
Anyone who has spent time in Israel has seen a plethora of cartoons coming from Israelis and from Arab cartoonists .
While it is true that Jewish tradition discourages images of people , even some religious literature dating back hundreds of years has immaculate illustrations .
As the others who have posted here , I do n't know why this piece was written or published .
It does not depict truth by local standards .
Jerry Waxman , Sderot , Israel I grew up with the cartoons of Salah Jaheen in the daily al - Ahram .
Cartoonists in the Arab world consider themselves intelligentsia and their talent is saying the unspoken despite censorship .
Check the Algerian Khalil Bendib .
He 's excellent .
The examples above are poor samples .
Mona , USA I 'm surprised there 's no mention of Naji Al - Ali , the prominent Palestinian political cartoonist who created the famous Handala character .
The religious prohibition against images seems overstated here , and used as a replacement for actual historical research .
Inmi , Seattle , WA , USA
It is a pity that the writer knows so little about the history of Arab cartoons .
What about Naji Ali - the greatest cartoonists who was assassinated in UK of all places by a Fatah squad run by Israeli Mossad ( so it is still not clear whether his murder is Fatah , Israel 's responsibility or a co-production ) .
Franks could go no further than BBC to learn about Naji's work ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6911815.stm)
Yuri , Jerusalem I am glad cartoons and the like are covered here .
I was very surprised , especially from the BBC , because Naji Al - Ali's cartoons had no limits , not Islam or Jesus Christ .
He was a very sharp and vicious artist .
Interestingly , his cartoons were what got him shot in London 1987 .
It seems the article has little research background behind it .
Ahmed A. , US I do n't know what planet Franks is living on or what ' countries ' he 's describing without that tradition .
I am an Egyptian cartoonist and I know for a fact that the cartoon business has been thriving in Egypt for more than 100 years .

Flummoxed , Cairo , Egypt
The translation of the last cartoon is wrong .
It should read : Livni : Can you say ' Two countries for two people ? '
Netanyahu : Yes .
Likud to power , Kadima to opposition !'
It is about the Likud 's lack of willingness to engage with Kadima .
Like the other Israelis , I 'm perplexed at the idea that political cartoons are not a major feature in Israeli journalism .
True , they are different to Steve Bell 's cartoons , but then , you 're not going to find the likes of his cartoons in the US or France either .
It 's a question of cultural style .
Oron , Edinburgh , Scotland I find this article troubling and uninformed .
There is a large tradition of cartoon images and political satire .
Why is this idea of secularism within Arab countries so bizarre to the writer here ?
Certainly he lacks the historical knowledge of the cinema of Adel Imam , the mini jalabas of the 1960 and the very democratic -- if not probematic -- reforms in many Arab countries which democratized society more radically than in the West ( ie. Bourghiba 's reforms in Tunisia ) .
Bouzid and of M'Quidech by Algerian cartoonist Menouar Merebtene , El - Labbad for Cairo's al - Karaoun newspaper , Ahmad al - Higazi , Sha'ban ' Abd al - Rahim are just some of the many cartoonists from the Muslim world who have been prominent since the mid twentieth century .

How can you talk about political cartoons in Israel , without mentioning ' Dry Bones ' , an English language satirical cartoon strip in the Jerusalem Post that 's been running for 36 years by Jacob Kirschen .
Some of them have been turned into posters , especially the Passover during the First Gulf War .
They can also be seen , for free , from the Dry Bones blog by Kirschen .

No collection of Middle East cartoons would be complete without mentioning the late great Mahmoud Kahil who drew for the Saudi " Arab News " newspaper for over 20 years before his death in 2003 .
For years I would buy the paper and eagerly flip straight to the opinion page , and rarely would Kahil 's insightful and often hilarious wit disappoint .
He will be missed .
Mohamed H , State College , USA and Dhahran , KSA Political cartoons have been around in the Middle East since the time of the Pharaohs ( plenty of ancient tombs with stick figures in unfinished tombs poking fun at Pharaoh , to name just one type ) .
Also , in the Arab world , newspapers have traditionally been the realm of the secularists , who do n't feel the same need as their religious co-nationals might feel to refrain from drawing people .
In Israel , an ethnocracy ( not a theocracy or a democracy ) , political cartoons are plentiful , mostly in attack of the rest of the Middle East .

The translation of the Hebrew cartoon is as wrong as the statements about ' softness ' of Israeli cartoons .
I have seen Israeli cartoons making very provocative and biting anti-government stance even during wars , in mainstream newspapers .
The author should probably learn a bit more on the subject than just one exhibition .

An article that discusses Middle Eastern cartoonists is incomplete without mentioning Naji al - Ali , who was the most influential cartoonist in the Arab world .
His drawings were critical of anything - including Arab regimes - that has ever hindered the future of a Palestinian child .
If only the media today looked at the world from the same perspective .

There are thousands of smaller publications and bits of printed AgitProp that swirl all over the Islamic / near - Islamic world , replete with visuals / cartoons from the clever and scathing to the merely obscene , derivative and hateful .
There have been for decades ( I edited some of them back in the 1970s ) .
And as usual , the Beeb forgets Turkey , land of the printed word , where political cartoons often reach a level that makes Steve Bell look like the uninformed NW3 poser he is ...

The comments below are correct .
There is actually quite a long history of political satire , including cartoons , throughout the Middle East - despite and * because * of censorship and other forms of political repression .
Iran , for example , witnessed tons of very influential cartoon satire during the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 - 1909 as well as the 1940s and early 1950s .
Arta , New York , USA
Well due to the fact that the author of this article lives in Jerusalem , not the Arab world , he does not really have the clear view of the Arab cartoonist world .
The author has forgotten to mention Palestinian Naji al - Ali , who was the most prominent cartoonist in the Arab world , who openly satirized Arab governments ( probably why he was shot in London ) .
A.A. , Jordan
You should read the ' Dry Bones ' cartoons .
They 've been a prominent part of Israeli cartoonship for many years and are quite apposite a reflection of what goes on in Israel .
Ros Morris , London , UK " Islamic tradition has discouraged figurative depiction of human beings ; in Judaism , pictures are used only sparingly . "
Yes , but Israel is a democracy not a theocracy .
In addition it has a free uncensored press , unlike the nations that surround it .
Also as an Israeli , I would like to point out there has long been appreciation of satirical cartoons both political and simply humorous in Israel .
I am really not quite sure what point of view you are trying to convey ...
But please do n't confuse Israeli society with the rest in the region .
Thank you !
John Bookbinder , UK Tim Franks translation of the Hebrew cartoon is not accurate , what Tzipi Livni actually says is : " Let 's see if you can say : ' Two States for two Peoples ' " , which is a little different in tone from the translation offered .
The Arabic cartoon obviously has only one phrase in Arabic script included in the clip -
But the sentiment is one I hear from my Arab contacts ( expressed more forcefully ! )
Meira , Israel
As an Israeli I find this diary a little strange .
I grew up on cartoons which dated way back to the 50's .
Nasser and Arafat as well Begin and Sharon all had their fare share of coverage with " Dosh " ( Israeli cartoonist ) .
The Arab world is full of cartoons and was full of them for a while now .
Secular Arab world was around for a long long time .

Sometimes when you think you 're guessing , your brain may actually know better .
After conducting some unique memory and recognition tests , while also recording subjects ' brain waves , scientists conclude that some gut feelings are not just guesswork after all .
Rather , we access memories we are n't even aware we have .
" We may actually know more than we think we know in everyday situations , too , " said Ken Paller , professor of psychology at Northwestern University and co-researcher on the study .
" Unconscious memory may come into play , for example , in recognizing the face of a perpetrator of a crime or the correct answer on a test .
Or the choice from a horde of consumer products may be driven by memories that are quite alive on an unconscious level . "
The findings were published online Sunday in the journal Nature Neuroscience .
The research , done with only a couple dozen participants , adds to a growing body of conflicting evidence about decision - making .
In one study done in 2007 , researchers found that quick decisions were better than those given lots of thought .
But a study last year suggested neither snap judgments nor " sleeping on it " trump good old - fashioned conscious thought .
The new study
During the first part of the memory test in the new study , participants were shown a series of colorful kaleidoscope images that flashed on a computer screen .
Half of the images were viewed with full attention as participants tried to memorize them .
While viewing the other half , the participants were distracted :
They heard a spoken number that they had to keep in mind until the next trial , when they indicated whether it was odd or even .
In other words , they could focus on memorizing half of the images but were greatly distracted from memorizing the others .
A bit later , they viewed pairs of similar kaleidoscope images in a recognition test .
" Remarkably , people were more accurate in selecting the old image when they had been distracted than when they had paid full attention , " Paller said .
" They also were more accurate when they claimed to be guessing than when they registered some familiarity for the image . "
Splitting attention during a memory test usually makes memory worse .
" But our research showed that even when people were n't paying as much attention , their visual system was storing information quite well , " Paller said .
The brain 's role
During the tests , electrical signals in the brain were recorded from a set of electrodes placed on each person 's head .
The brain waves during implicit recognition were distinct from those associated with conscious memory experiences .
A unique signal of implicit recognition was seen a quarter of a second after study participants saw each old image .
Other related research has shown that amnesia victims with severe memory problems often have strong implicit memories , Paller and his colleague , Joel L. Voss of the Beckman Institute , said in a statement .
" Intuition may have an important role in finding answers to all sorts of problems in everyday life , " Paller said .
Then there are the effects we can predict .
If we really let Citigroup go bust -- wipe out everyone except the depositors up to the FDIC insured limit -- there are some fairly predictible effects .
Being an economics writer , and therefore prizing gains from trade , I will outsource my explanation to another blog :
Remember back to last September .
What was the lesson of Lehman Brothers ?
The most important asset a bank has is confidence .
If people are confident in a bank , it can continue to do business ; if not , it can't .
For the last six months , where has that confidence been coming from ?
Not from the banks ' balance sheets , certainly .
And not , I would argue , from the dribs and drabs of capital and targeted asset guarantees provided by Treasury and the Fed .
It has been coming from a widespread assumption that the U.S. government will not let the creditors of large banks lose money , out of fear of repeating the Lehman debacle .
The story goes something like this .
Let 's say that Citigroup were restructured - via bankruptcy , or via government conservatorship - in such a way that creditors did not get all their money back .
( None of this applies to FDIC - insured deposits or to recently - issued senior debt that is explicitly guaranteed by the government . )
They might be forced to convert debt for equity , or they might be stiffed altogether .
The first - order concern is that this would have ripple effects that could take down other financial institutions .
According to Martin Wolf , bank bonds comprise one quarter of all U.S. investment - grade corporate bonds ; losses would be spread far and wide , hitting other banks , pension funds , insurance companies , hedge funds , and so on .
If Citigroup did not support its derivatives positions , then institutions that bought credit default swap protection from Citi would face further losses .
( I believe that most U.S. banks were net buyers of CDS protection , however . )
The fear is that it will be impossible to predict how these losses will be distributed and who else might go down .
The second - order concern is bigger .
After all , Lehman did not seem to force any major financial institution into bankruptcy , although it may have twisted the knife that AIG had already stuck in itself .
Once investors figure out that bank debt is not safe , they will refuse to lend to any banks , and we are back in September all over again .
Or almost : it is possible that the Federal Reserve 's massive efforts to provide liquidity to the banking system will be enough to keep banks functioning .
But who wants to take that risk ?
This is why , for the last five months , the government has been doing everything it can to imply that bank creditors ( at least for " systemically important " banks ) will be protected , without saying so explicitly , because that would suddenly increase the potential liabilities of the government by trillions of dollars .
WASHINGTON , Feb . 6 — A House committee report on Tuesday questioned whether some of the billions of dollars in cash shipped to Iraq after the American invasion — mostly in huge , shrink - wrapped stacks of $ 100 bills — might have ended up with the insurgent groups now battling American troops .
The report was released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at a hearing when Democrats sharply questioned the former American civilian administrator in Iraq , L. Paul Bremer III , about lax management of the nearly $ 12 billion in cash shipped to Iraq between May 2003 and June 2004 .
Mr. Bremer defended his performance as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq , noting that the United States had to bring tons of American dollars into Iraq because the country had no functioning banking system .
“ We had to pay Iraqis in cash , ” Mr. Bremer said of the money , most of which came from Iraqi oil sales .
“ Delay would have been demoralizing and unfair to millions of Iraqi families . ”
An 11 - year - old boy was used as a human shield by Israeli troops during their 22 - day offensive in Gaza – including when they came under fire – according to a report by UN human rights experts published yesterday .
The report says that on 15 January , as Israeli tanks moved into Tel el Hawa in Gaza City , forces moved into a building from which families had been evacuated with personal belongings .
The 11 - year - old boy was told to open the bags – one of which had a lock which a soldier shot at , though without injuring the boy , the report said .
The boy was then ordered to walk in front of a group of soldiers as they moved through the neighbourhood , it added .
When the soldiers arrived at the headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society , the boy was made to enter first and when the patrol was later shot at as it moved through the streets , " the boy remained in front of the group " .
He was released when the unit arrived at al - Quds hospital .
The report said that the incident " appears to be in direct contravention to a 2005 Israeli High Court ruling on the illegality of the use of human shields " .
Radhika Coomaraswamy , the UN Secretary General 's special envoy for the protection of children in conflict , also accused the forces of shooting Palestinian children , bulldozing a home with a woman and child still inside , and shelling a building they had ordered civilians into a day earlier .
The Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) said troops were instructed not to make use of the civilian population .
A spokesman said that it would investigate any detailed claims the UN put to them , which it had not yet done .
But it added : " The forces did the maximum to prevent harm to Palestinians despite the extensive use Hamas made of them as human shields . "
Responding to complaints by Israeli soldiers that permissive rules of engagement allowed the shooting of unarmed Palestinian civilians during the operation , Israel 's military chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazy said the IDF awaited a criminal investigation ordered after the complaints were made public " but my impression is that the IDF acted morally and ethically " .

Belfast Telegraph
RAMALLAH , West Bank , April 17 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama 's Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , called on Friday for an Arab peace initiative to be part of a planned U.S. drive to create a Palestinian state .
The 2002 Arab initiative offers Israel normal ties with all Arab states in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it seized in the 1967 Middle East war , creation of a Palestinian state and a " just solution " for Palestinian refugees .
" The U.S. is committed to the establishment of a sovereign independent Palestinian state where the aspirations of the Palestinian people to control their destiny are realised .
We want the Arab peace initiative to be part of the effort to reach this goal , " Mitchell said after talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah .
Mitchell met on Thursday with Israel 's new prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , who has yet to commit to restarting U.S. - backed talks with Abbas on core issues such as statehood borders , and the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees .
Israeli officials quoted Netanyahu as telling Mitchell that his right - leaning government wanted the Palestinians to first recognise Israel as a Jewish state .
Palestinians have long rejected such explicit recognition of the Jewish nature of a state where one in five people is Arab .
" It is clear that there is a government in Israel that rejects signed agreements , that insists on continuing settlement activities , " senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said .
Erekat said Abbas asked Mitchell to " exert every possible effort " to pressure Israel to commit to a two - state solution and to meet other obligations , including a freeze in Jewish settlement building in the occupied West Bank and a halt to home demolitions in Arab East Jerusalem .
Netanyahu's two - week - old government has yet to take a public position on the Arab peace initiative .
But in their meeting on Thursday , Netanyahu spoke to Mitchell about " the need to involve in the process important moderate Arab states " , including Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia , a senior Israeli official said .
" They have an important role to play in strengthening the peace process and we see their greater involvement in the peace process as something positive , " the official added .
Another senior Israeli official quoted Mitchell as telling Netanyahu that " we intend to seriously examine the Arab proposal " .
A senior Western diplomat familiar with the Obama administration 's deliberations said Washington wanted to pursue the Arab peace initiative but was keeping its options open .
" We have put the flag squarely in the two - state solution camp but we have n't said how you get there , " the diplomat said .
Netanyahu 's predecessor , Ehud Olmert , said he saw positive points in the Arab peace initiative .
But Israel opposes the return of Palestinian refugees to their former homes in what is now the Jewish state and wants to hold on to major settlement blocs in the West Bank .
Mitchell 's next stop is Egypt .

Duke Energy Plans Third Wyoming Wind Farm , Latest Step on Renewable Path
April 1st , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Duke Energy said today it will build a third wind farm in Wyoming and the Charlotte , N.C. , based company plans to have the facility online by the end of this year .
[ social_buttons ]
The Silver Sage Windpower Project will generate 42 megawatts of electricity with 20 2.1 MW Suzlon wind turbines .
It will join Duke ’s 29 - MW Happy Jack Windpower Project in Cheyenne and the 99 - MW Campbell Hill Windpower Project near Casper which should also be online by year ’s end .
Duke Energy ( NYSE : DUK ) entered into 20 - year power purchase agreements to sell all of the electricity generated at the site to Cheyenne Light Fuel & Power ( CLF&P ) , a utility subsidiary of Black Hills Corp. , and Colorado - based Platte River Power Authority .
While windy Wyoming is a target rich environment for wind farms , one of the more interesting aspects of this announcement was Duke ’s update on its wind generating capacities .
The company says it is currently generating 500 MW of wind power and has 5,000 more megawatts under development .
If all those projects come to fruition , Duke would be generating just under 14 percent of its power from wind .
It ’s another big step for a utility that has made some interesting alternative energy moves , including investments in wood biomass , small scale solar power generation and overall efficiency .
“ The Silver Sage project is another sign of the momentum we ’re building in our renewable energy business , ” said Wouter van Kempen , president of Duke Energy Generation Services , Duke ’s renewable power subsidiary .
As long as renewable energy keeps generating solid return on investment for publicly traded Duke you can expect that momentum to continue .

Act City , Hamamatsu .
Hamamatsu is a very underrated city and one of my favourites in Japan - it 's located about an hour to the south and a bit to the east of Nagoya , about a third of the way to Tokyo , and has an awesome climate as well as a great music scene for a city of its size ( 800,000 ) .
It also has a lot of Brazilians and Japanese - Brazilians , children of former Japanese immigrants to Brazil that have since returned .
Over at city hall there is also a Portuguese service window , and a lot of cities nearby also have quite a few Brazilians , extending into Aichi - ken , where Nagoya is located .
Here are some parts of the article from the Yomiuri Shimbun
経済情勢の急速な悪化の影響で、浜松市に住んで働いているブラジル人の６割超が失業しているか解雇を予告されていることが、市が行った調査で明ら
かになった。市は「調査方式から、結果には偏りがある可能性はあるが、予想以上に深刻な結果」としており、市も参加する支援団体「がんばれブラジル人会
議」は、仕事など生活関連の情報をブラジル人に提供する催しを１５日に市内で開くなど、支援を強化する方針だ。
An investigation by the city of Hamamatsu has revealed that due to the effects of a rapidly worsening economy have resulted in 60 % of Brazilians working in Hamamatsu being unemployed or being told that they are to be laid off .
The city says that " due to the method of investigation the results might be a bit skewed , but it 's still a worse result than we had expected " .
The " Let 's Go Brazilians Council " , in which the city also participates , intends to increase support by such methods as an event on the 15th to give information on work and daily life to Brazilians in the city .
同市内には約１万９０００人のブラジル人が住む。調査は、景気後退を受けた市の緊急経済対策の一環として１月２４日～２月１３日に実施し、市内に
住む１５～７３歳のブラジル人２７７３人が回答した。ポルトガル語を話すことができる調査員が、ブラジル人が多く集まる場所に出向き、対面方式で行った。
About 19,000 Brazilians live in Hamamatsu .
The survey was part of an emergency economic strategy for the city after being hit by the economic downturn and was carried out from January 24 to February 13 , interviewing 2773 Brazilians within the city from 15 to 73 years of age .
Surveyors fluent in Portuguese went around to places where Brazilians gathered in large numbers to interview them .
調査によると、２７７３人のうち１３１３人が「失業している」と回答したほか、「解雇を予告されている」と答えた人も３８４人に上り、全体の
６１・２％が事実上失業状態だった。
According to the survey , 1313 of the 2773 said they were unemployed and 384 said they had been told they were laid off , giving an unemployment rate of 61.2 % .
一方、働いてい る１０５６ 人に雇用形態を尋ねたところ、「派遣」が６５・４％を占め、不安定な雇用形態に身を置く人が多数に上る実情が明らかになった。
Also , of the 1056 people that were employed , 65.4 % said that they were involved in temp work , showing that the majority of those employed were still in an uncertain situation .

In the afternoon of the 15th there will be a " Let 's go Brazilians ! " event from 1 to 7 pm at the Act City Hamamatsu Exhibition Event Hall ( downtown Hamamatsu ) where Brazilians will be given information in Portuguese on flat - rate benefits ( a policy enacted in 2008 to aid foreigners living in Japan ) and employment .
On the 18th the International Rotary Clubs of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures will give the food and aid money gathered to the council , which will be used to help Brazilians .

The Structure of Conficker video.avi
Have you every wondered , how the structure of worms and virii looks like .
We have created a little video that displays the functions inside Conficker and their relations .
The video has been recorded during one of our analysis steps .
Network Scanner Another option is to actively scan for Conficker machines .
There is a way to distinguish infected machines from clean ones based on the error code for some specially crafted RPC messages .
Conficker tries to filter out further exploitation attempts which results in uncommon responses .
Our python script scs2.py implements a simple scanner based on this observation .
Here is a sample output : $ ./scs2.py 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.5
Simple Conficker Scanner v2.1 -- ( C ) Felix Leder , Tillmann Werner 2009 , 2010
[ UNKNOWN ] 10.0.0.1 : No response from port 445/tcp .

[ CLEAN ] 10.0.0.3 : Windows Server 2003 R2 3790 Service Pack 2 [ Windows Server 2003 R2 5.2 ] : Seems to be clean .
[ INFECTED ] 10.0.0.4 : Windows 5.1 [ Windows 2000 LAN Manager ] : Seems to be infected by Conficker D .
[ INFECTED ] 10.0.0.5 : Windows 5.1 [ Windows 2000 LAN Manager ] : Seems to be infected by Conficker B or C .
done Update : Version 2 of our Simple Conficker Scanner is now capable of detecting machines infected with the newest variant ( also called version E ) .
Here is the MD5 checksum of the ZIP archive : fd67e35f41e35f9e2de4af913af4e29f scs2.2.zip Update : Version 2.1 and 2.2 support scanning for infections on other ports than 445/tcp ( e.g. , 139/tcp ) .
However , you have to call the scanner script directly ( the second argument is the port number ) : scanner21.py localhost 139 Simple Conficker Scanner v2.2 requires the installation of the impacket python library .

Nonficker Vaxination Tool Conficker uses different global and local mutexes to ensure that only the most up - to - date version is run on the system .
This fact can be exploited to scan for and to prevent infections .
We have developed our Nonficker Vaccination dll that can be installed as a system service and pretends to be a running Conficker by registering all mutexes from version .A , .B , and .C ( and possibly .D depending which naming scheme you refer to ) .
A setup tool to install the dll as system service is provided as well .
Removal instructions :
Open your favorite registry editor ( e.g. Start -> Run...->regedit.exe->ok )
Go to registry key : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion \SvcHost
Remove the " aaaaanonficker " from the " netsvcs " key
Remove registry key and all sibling keys : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\aaaaanonficker
Besides vaccination , the mutexes can be used to scan for local infections .
We have developed a small mutex scanner that tells you if you are infected .
Update : Infections with Conficker .D/.E ( from April 8th ) were already prevented by the previous Nonficker Vaxination .
Both tools and source code can be downloaded here :
Memory Disinfector
It is hard to identify files containing Conficker , because the executables are packed and encrypted .
When Conficker runs in memory , it is fully unpacked .
Our memory disinfector scans the memory of every running process in the system and terminates Conficker threads without touching the process it runs in .
This helps to keep the system services running .
Update : Conficker .D/.E ( from 8th April ) can be detected and removed , too .
We had to change the name since applications that have " killer " or " conficker " in their names are killed by conficker itself .
The tool itself and the source code can be downloaded here :
Detecting Conficker Files and Registry Despite other reports , the file names and registry keys Conficker .
B and .C use are not random .
They are calculated on the basis of the hostname .
We have developed a tool that you can run on your system to check for Conficker 's Dlls .
Unfortunately , Conficker .
A really uses random names and can therefore not be found this way .
It is at a very early development stage , but usable .
We would be grateful to benefit from your changes if you develop it further .
Tool and source code are here :
Intrusion Detection Signatures Conficker uses a hardcoded xor - key for encoding its shellcode .
This creates static patterns , which allow to detect exploitation attempts and may be used to identify infected machines .
The signature we have created for Conficker .
A and .B are : Conficker .

Downatool2
The domain names of different Conficker variants can be used to detect infected machines in a network .
Inspired by the " downatool " from MHL and B. Enright , we have developed Downatool2 .
It can be used to generate domains for Downadup / Conficker .
A , .B , and .C .

A and .
B created 250 domains per day , from which they try to download updates .
Conficker .C , unlike its predecessors , creates 50.000 domains per day .
Furthermore , the length of Conficker .
C domain names is only 4 - 9 instead of 8 - 11 characters as variants .
A and .B .
The large number and the shorter domain length results in a lot of collisions with real domain names .
We have pre-computed all domain names for April 2009 and looked up the domains in order to find collisions .
Figure 1 shows the number of collisions for each day .
The list of collisions as well as the list of Conficker .

Figure 2 : Number of collisions for each IP address in April 2009 Conficker .C will create about 150 - 200 collisions with existing domains per day .
The large number of generated domains and the fact that not every domain will be contacted for a given day will probably prevent DDoS situations .
Figure 2 shows the number of conflicts each IP address generates .
There are some IPs with a remarkable number of occurrences .
You may want more than just Conficker .
C domains and probably more than just April .

Location , location , location
The Global Positioning Satellite ( GPS ) system can help you find yourself , or the nearest drycleaner , or a missing Christmas manger , or a hidden geocache .
But our expectations of GPS are that it works accurately , instantly , and reliably on all our devices .
That 's asking a bit much from what is fundamentally 1990s - era technology .
Fortunately , there 's help .
Assisted GPS ( AGPS ) and a variety of complements and supplements to GPS can shrink the wait for a positive fix on a location — the Time To First Fix or TTFF — from multiple minutes down to as little as under a second without sacrificing accuracy .
Reducing that wait means that your pictures are instantly tagged with coordinates ( geotagged ) , a map drops a pin on your current location before the map itself finishes loading , and a device you 're using in a remote location knows right away that it's in the middle of nowhere .
Oh , and Google and others can give you the right ads for your location without any tedious waiting on their part , either .
Typically , AGPS systems help a GPS figure out where the satellite signals that the receiver is picking up are located precisely at that moment .
Related systems that are n't technically AGPS use a variety of means to combine with , replace , or enhance GPS data into providing a geographic result .
In this article , I 'll explain how AGPS and alternatives work , and I 'll conclude with a discussion of what 's coming in the future for even more precise or esoteric location finding .
GPS basics
The GPS system , run by the US Department of Defense through an Air Force space division , uses a constellation of 32 satellites that each orbit the earth twice per day .
A GPS receiver should be able to get signals from about 10 satellites at a time in ideal circumstances , but far fewer can be picked up reliably in most real - world conditions .
All the satellites constantly transmit data — the navigation message — over the same set of frequencies , using an encoding that allows 50 bits per second ( really ! 50 bps ! ) for a total of 1,500 bits of data to be demodulated from each satellite each 30 seconds .
On every minute and half - minute , each satellite transmits its notion of the precise time and its health , followed by its location and a path in orbit that 's valid for as long as four hours ( the ephemeris , pluralized ephermerides ) .
It also transmits a subset of data about the other satellites in orbit , including a rougher position ( the almanac ) .
It takes 25 navigation messages , all received perfectly over 12.5 minutes , to assemble a full almanac .
A timestamp is also included as part of each 300 - bit ( six - second ) segment or sub - frame of the message .
With the timing information and the ephemerides from four satellites , a GPS receiver can perform trilateration , which allows a point to be plotted accurately to within about 5 to 15 meters ( 15 to 45 feet ) .
Although geometrically only three satellites are needed , atmospheric effects and other issues introduce small errors in timing .
A fourth satellite corrects those errors and allows an accurate and corrected time and elevation as well .
( Some techniques for assisting or supplementing GPS can avoid the need for a fourth satellite , or even use fragmentary data from two satellites . )
A cold start
From a cold start with typically older GPS receivers — where the receiver has never been turned on , has been off for several weeks , has lost a battery charge , or has been moved a few hundred miles since its last activation — the entire almanac has to be retrieved over 12.5 minutes .
And that 's outdoors with good overhead visibility .
Jean - Michel Rousseau , a staff product manager in the group at Qualcomm that handles GPS technology , explained that that 's " the maximum time that the user would get a position assuming it had absolutely no knowledge of the GPS constellation . "
While you can still buy certain kinds of standalone GPS devices with this lag — like the ATP Photo Finder used for geotagging digital camera images — most modern gear uses techniques to have enough information to avoid this cold start problem .
Most chipmakers and manufacturers of standalone GPS hardware now claim about 30 to 60 seconds for a warm start , with a few exceptions .
" GPS receivers ship with some default almanac data in memory ; as a result a receiver no longer has to decode this data off the satellites , " Rousseau said .
Qualcomm 's gpsOne , for instance , can fire up in 35 seconds in a device that works in standalone mode , with none of the assistance available that we 're about to learn about .
We think the political scandals in America are juicy , but nothing compares to the bombshell that Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo recently dropped on his public !
It seems that the recently elected head of state , who was previously a bishop in the Roman Catholic church , had a steamy love affair with 26 - year - old Viviana Carrillo which resulted in a 1 - year - old bouncing baby boy .
The leftist leaning leader was the reigning bishop of the San Pedro province of Paraguay up until 2004 , when he resigned and announced his plan to run for president of the South American country .
At the time , President Lugo received permission directly from the Pope to leave the priesthood and campaign for the highest political office in Paraguay .
But the President was still registered as a bishop until last year , when Pope Benedict XVI decided to relieve Lugo from the vow of chastity that all Roman Catholic priests must take .
The 58 - year - old political leader freely admitted to the romance with the woman almost 30 years his junior saying , " I assume all responsibilities having to do with the fact that I had a relationship with ( the mother of the child ) , and I recognize paternity . "
But he refused to comment further on the matter , expressing concerns about the privacy of the baby boy .
Ay , the drama !
Does n't it all sound like the plot of a classic telenovela ?
Paul : Bill to tax bonuses an ' outrage ' and unconstitutional David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : House overwhelmingly passes bonus tax Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) yet again went against the grain in Congress when he stood up in the House and argued against a proposal that would tax 90 percent of AIG executive bonuses , saying that it was a " disgrace , " a " distraction " and an " outrage " that undermined the Constitution .
" I rise in opposition to this rule and the bill because of the problem -- because of the lack of need for this and the disgrace that this has brought upon us , " Paul said .
" Yesterday , for instance , the Federal Reserve met and they came out and they announced that they would create new money to the tune of $ 1.25 trillion . "
Paul , a dark horse Republican candidate for president in 2008 who still enjoys considerable popularity with a base of hardcore supporters , noted that the value of the dollar went down significantly after that announcement by the Fed .
" Today ... on emergency legislation , we 're going to deal with $ 165 million of bonuses , which obviously should n't have never been given , but who 's responsible for this ? "
Paul said .
" It 's the Congress and the president who signed this [ $ 787 billion stimulus bill that allowed the bonuses to go forward ] .
So this is a distraction , this is an outrage . "
He chided his fellow House members who were considering supporting the new tax legislation for only caring about the millions in bonuses when they should be concerned with the trillions in deficits the country is facing .
" So everybody can go home that voted for this bill , say , ' Look , I 'm clamping [ down ] on this $ 165 million but I do n't care about the previous $ 5 trillion the Fed created and the $ 1.25 trillion they created yesterday , ' " he said .
" Think of the loss of purchasing power in less than 24 hours . "
Paul urged his House members to support his bill , H.R. 1207 , which would change the way the Federal Reserve is audited .
" Let 's quit appropriating funds in an unconstitutional manner .
Let 's quit bankrupting this country , " Paul said .
" The Fed is not even required to answer any questions .
So it 's about time we have an open book about the Federal Reserve and solve some of these problems . "
House passes tax bill Thursday afternoon Despite the protestations of Paul and a few others , the House voted overwhelmingly to pass the bonus tax legislation Thursday afternoon .
Roll Call reports the vote was 328- 93 to impose a 90 percent tax on employee bonuses at companies that received federal bailout funds .
" While the vote was bipartisan , the GOP was split on the bill , with Minority Leader John Boehner ( Ohio ) voting against it and Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( Va. ) voting in favor of it , " reported Roll Call .
CNN notes that the measure , which now heads to the Senate for consideration , would tax individuals on any bonuses received in 2009 from companies getting $ 5 billion or more in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Those with incomes more than $ 250,000 would see their bonuses taxed at the 90 percent rate .
" We can't have any concept of we 're getting even , but we must have a concept that we 're trying to show that Congress ... cannot tolerate that , " said Charlie Rangel ( D - NY ) , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday .
Said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , " We must also protect the American taxpayer from executives who would use their companies ' second chances as opportunities for private gain .
Because they could not use sound judgment in the use of taxpayer funds , these AIG executives will pay the Treasury in the form of this tax . "
Speaking before the House on Thursday , Boehner questioned why they were only taxing 90 percent of the bonuses .
" Why 90 percent ?...
We can get 100 percent back because the Treasury Secretary has the ability to get it all back .
The Administration has the ability to get it all back , " Boehner said .
" Why dont we just get it all back ?
Why are we bringing this bill to the floor today to give members political cover when in fact the Treasury Secretary has the authority , the Administration has the authority to get all of it back ? "
Correction :
This article has been updated to correct a misstatement about which bill the amendment that excluded executive bonuses agreed to before February was attached to .
An earlier version stated that it was the March omnibus spending bill .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Horses were first domesticated on the plains of northern Kazakhstan some 5,500 years ago -- 1,000 years earlier than thought -- by people who rode them and drank their milk , researchers said on Thursday .

Taming horses changed human history , influencing everything from transport to agriculture to warfare .
But experts have struggled to pinpoint when and where it first happened .
Now archaeologists think they have the answer , after finding the world ’s oldest horse farm among the Kazakh people of the ancient Botai culture .
Remains of bones , teeth and shards of pottery , used to store mare ’s milk , all indicate horses were selectively bred and exploited for domestic use east of the Ural mountains around 2,000 years before they are known to have been used in Europe .
Alan Outram from Britain ’s University of Exeter said the new findings , published in the journal Science , changed understanding of how early societies developed .
“ Once you have horse riding you ’ve got much greater transport and trade capability , as well as potential advantages in warfare , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ If it was happening this early , then you ’ve got to think about those forces for social and economic change happening earlier too -- and it is possible that there are yet earlier sites we have n’t found . ”
Archaeologists have suspected for some time that the Botai people were the world ’s first horsemen but previous sketchy evidence has been disputed , with some arguing that the Botai simply hunted horses .
Now Outram and colleagues believe they have three conclusive pieces of evidence proving domestication .
They found that the leg bones of ancient Botai horses were similar to later Bronze Age domestic horses and very different from wild ones , suggesting breeding by humans .
They also identified clear markings on the horses ’ teeth , indicating they wore bits or bridles , and finally an analysis of organic residues in broken pots found traces of horse milk .
Mare ’s milk , usually fermented into a slightly alcoholic drink called “ koumiss , ” is still drunk in Kazakhstan .
The Future of Work Belongs to Freelancers
Flashback to 1860 when many were living the American dream of working for themselves .
While it may seem that the American Dream is redefined today , people still have a strong preference to work where they want , when they want , and on the work of their choosing , according to Freelancing in America 2018 .
Switcheroo : Reasons Not to Direct Link Images Reason 25 : Misery profiteers suck
Some ghoul on eBay is hawking those tasteless crappy World Trade Center - shaped candle holders that we made so much fun of right after The World Was Changed Forever ( as TV journalists , who never change , keep telling us ) .
It 's bad enough for this seller to be trying to profit from misery ( not to mention by selling such a crappy and tasteless product , and promoting it with a garish , " Star Spangled Banner " - sound file playing , browser - crashing , image - heavy mess of a page ) but he is also helping himself to my bandwidth by hot - linking four images from my website .
The seller 's handle is " Discovering New Deals " probably some down - &- out Roosevelt nephew .
If his New Deals are anything like his uncle 's , they wo n't turn out to be deals at all .
He 's got a Javascript that rotates my images .
Aww .
How kind of him .
How shall I thank him ?
I know !
I 'll spiff up the images for him you know , tailor them to his business niche : Below are all the images now rotating in an endless loop on his auction page : Instead of this :
This : Instead of this :
This : Instead of this :
This :
And instead of this :
This :
Here they are , in situ : Update , 25 oct2007 :
So the idiot finally caught on that instead of horrific images capitalizing on a human tragedy , his listing was displaying just plain horrific images of human tragedy .
But instead of figuring out why the images had been switched , he went right back to my site and got the new image names , restoring his listing to its previous state .
Unacceptable .
So I switched the images again and his auction is once again displaying the second kind of horrific images .
The originals are now named : stop_hotlinking_or_next_time_you_get_the_goatse_01.jpg
stop_hotlinking_or_next_time_you_get_the_goatse_02.jpg
stop_hotlinking_or_next_time_you_get_the_goatse_04.jpg
stop_hotlinking_or_next_time_you_get_the_goatse_05.jpg . . . which means that if he hotlinks the images again you guess it quick boss !
he gets the goatse .
And so we wait .
While we 're waiting , you can occupy your time gazing upon another crass 9/11 - exploiting product from the same idiotic seller :
The seller offers the following item description : Artist and entrepreneurour brave little seller is two kinds of failure !
They grow up so fast .

Co-producer Selome Gerima said the film was " very sensitive "
An Ethiopian film about the regime of the country 's former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam has won the chief prize at Africa 's main movie awards ceremony .
Teza was the unanimous winner of the Golden Stallion of Yennenga at the event in Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso .
Director Haile Gerima 's award was accepted by his sister Selome , who also co-produced the film .
The silver award went to South African film Nothing But The Truth , and Algerian comedy Mascarades was third .
The audience award went to Burkina Faso film Le Fauteuil , while Moroccan film - maker Leila Kilani 's documentary about political oppression in her country won its category .
Selome Gerima said during the week - long Fespaco event in the west African city that their film had taken 14 years to bring to the screen .
She added it made Ethiopians remember what life was like under Mengistu , who ruled the country from 1974 - 91 .
The film focuses on a scientist who goes back to Ethiopia under the dicator after living in Germany .
It covers the issues of dictatorship , emigration , war and the position of women in Ethiopian society during the period .
It has proved a huge hit in Ethiopia since its premiere on 3 January .
At the Venice Film Festival , Teza won best screenplay and was given a special jury award .

I 'm currently designing what I call an engine , but is basically a framework for my upcoming game project .
I 'm having some serious issues concerning access of modules by different modules .
My engine base class is the EngineApp , which consists of a number of modules , like a texture manager , window manager , renderer , error manager , etc . Now , this EngineApp should , in my opinion , be globally accessible because each module might need to access different modules .
For example , if something goes wrong in the texture manager because the renderer tries to access a non-existant texture , the error manager should handle the error , which in turn may mean it needs to tell the window manager to exit .
Since these modules are all defined in EngineApp , the simplest thing to do ( to me ) is to make the engine app a singleton class .
However , in a game , it would be useful to derive a class from the EngineApp ( say GameApp ) .
However , if I make the EngineApp singleton , the GameApp class will call the functions from EngineApp ( so GameApp:: GetSingletonPtr ( ) ->
Run ( ) ; would actually execute EngineApp:: GetSingletonPtr->Run ( ) ; ) .
This is not intended obviously .
Is there a way , with or without singleton usage , to fix these global access problems ?
I could obviously pass pointers to all modules that are needed when working in some module , but that does n't seem like a very good idea to me .
Now I know how most people think about singletons , and I try not to use them if I can do without , but for now I do n't see another solution that works equally well .
Who can help me ?
Edit : not that I think it matters , but for the record , the engine code should ultimately be put in a lib or dll , while the game code ( and thus also the GameApp class ) is in another project that uses the library .
( CNN ) --
A senior Spanish judge has ordered prosecutors to investigate whether key Bush aides should be charged with crimes over the Guantanamo Bay detention center , a lawyer said Sunday .
Garzon says the case can be brought under Spanish law because several Spaniards were held at Guantanamo .
Investigating magistrate Baltasar Garzon has passed a 98 - page complaint to prosecutors that accuses former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and five others of being the legal architects of system that allowed torture in violation of international law , human rights lawyer Gonzalo Boye told CNN .
Prosecutors will review the document to determine if a crime has been committed .
The prosecutor 's office will make a decision within five days , said Boye , one of the report 's authors .
Garzon accepted the complaint under Spanish law because there were several Spaniards at Guantanamo who allegedly suffered torture .
The complaint was filed in March 2008 by Boye and the Association for the Rights of Prisoners .
It names Gonzales -- who was President George W. Bush 's counsel when the Guantanamo Bay detention center was established -- and other top Bush administration officials John C. Yoo , Douglas J. Feith , William J. Hayes II , Jay S. Bybee and David S. Addington .
A former top aide to Colin Powell , who was secretary of state in the early days of the Bush administration 's " war on terror , " testified before Congress last summer that the six officials " colluded " to develop a legal rationale for allowing detainees to be subjected to harsh treatment .
Lawrence Wilkerson was Powell 's chief of staff in President Bush 's first term .
Yoo , the author of a memo which critics say authorized torture , also testified before Congress last year .
The former deputy assistant attorney general said that his role in the administration had simply been to provide legal advice .
" We were functioning as lawyers .
We do n't make policy .
Policy choices in these matters were up to the National Security Council or the White House or the Department of Defense , " he said .
Gonzales was Bush 's legal counsel at the time and later became attorney general .
Yoo and Bybee were at the Department of Justice , Haynes and Feith worked for the Department of Defense , and Addington was Vice President Dick Cheney 's legal counsel .
Addington proved difficult to pin down when he testified under subpoena before a House of Representatives subcommittee June 26 with Yoo , who testified voluntarily but repeatedly refused to answer questions .
Addington , by then Cheney 's chief of staff , delivered a flat " No " in answer to a question from New York Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler about whether Addington " contributed to the analysis or assisted in the drafting of the August 1 , 2002 , interrogation memo . "
But when Nadler followed up with : " You had nothing to do with that , " Addington again replied : " No . I did n't say I had nothing to do with it . "
Addington never clarified what , if any , his role was .
Garzon , Spain 's best - known investigating magistrate , issued the precedent - setting arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998 .
The judge has investigated human rights abuses in former military governments in Chile and Argentina , Islamic terrorists operating in Spain , the armed Basque separatist group ETA , as well as major drug traffickers .
-- CNN 's Per Nyberg contributed to this report .
One peckish person bit into his snack and saw the son of God staring back at him .
The vision of Jesus ’s face in a KitKat was sent to a Dutch website that had asked visitors to upload oddball religious discoveries and this was certainly a surprise entry .
On the site , Nu.nl , the finder of the biblical face said : “ I was amazed .
I took a bite and then I saw the face of Christ . ”
But one site visitor said it looked like Darth Vader .
Another said it was Guy Fawkes .
They obviously did n’t know the face materialised on Good Friday .
Pat Hingle : ' Commissioner Gordon ' Has Died 1924 -2009
Pat Hingle 1924-2009
Veteran actor , 84 , whose career spanned over fifty years , died at his home in Carolina Beach , North Carolina on Saturday , January 4 , 2009 .
Cause of death was reported to be leukemia , a blood cancer .
He was best known for his portrayal of Commissioner Gordon in the first four Batman films .
His body of film work had him in roles opposite many prominent actors , including Clint Eastwood , Sally Fields , Warren Beatty , Marlon Brando and Anjelica Huston .
His greatest love was Broadway .
He had roles in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , The Dark at the Top of the Stairs and J.B .
He told The Times in his later years : " The stage is an actors ' medium .
When the curtain goes up , there are those crazy actors .
The story comes through them .
The director can pull his hair in the back of the house and the producer and playwright can cry on each others shoulders .
But there go those galloping actors . "
Said his very close friend , James Morrison , who currently plays Bill Buchanan on 24 : " You were the most important thing when you worked opposite him .
He was present , right there , in his life and in his work .
He was the most authentic man I 've ever met . "
Hingle is survived by his wife Julia , five children and 11 grandchildren .
Check out photos as well as video of Hingle playing Commissioner Gordon below .
The French reputation for broadband superiority rests mainly on a start - up company called Iliad .
This provides more than a million French subscribers with a " triple play " package called Free , which includes 81 TV channels , unlimited phone calls within France and to other 14 countries , plus 24 megabits internet for just € 29.99 ( £ 20 ) a month .
Free 's Freebox was the system demonstrated on last week 's BBC 2 Money Programme , The Broadband Boom and You ( http://tinyurl.com/), where the British guinea pigs were taken across the channel and given a real taste of the inferiority of the services available in the UK .
So how was it done ?
The foundation was laid by the French government which , in a spirit of deregulation , brought in what we call LLU - Local Loop Unbundling - in 2000 .
This enabled rival firms to install equipment in France Telecom 's exchanges in order to provide an independent service .
LLU is what has tempted TalkTalk into the UK broadband market .
But then Iliad 's young , entrepreneurial founder , Xavier Niel , decided he did n't want to use the usual ADSL equipment supplied by big companies such as Alcatel .
Instead , Iliad designed and made its own Freebox terminal , to deliver TV , internet and VoIP ( Voice over Internet Protocol ) phone calls .
Even more unusually , Iliad also developed its own Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer ( DSLAM ) , the complicated exchange equipment that bundles up all the local traffic from separate lines and feeds it into the backbone network .
You would not expect a start - up to introduce new technologies and pick up more than a million customers in less than three years without some teething problems .
For example , Wikipeida describes Freebox as " a rather erratic ADSL modem " and at least some users have had problems getting the things working , or working consistently .
On the other hand , that 's also true in the UK , where some broadband providers have generated customer hatred for their inability to deliver a reliable service in a reasonable time .
