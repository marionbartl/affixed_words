World Ca n’t Wait
By Cheryl Abraham
Despite heroic efforts by Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) to bring 35 Articles of Impeachment against Bush , the wildfire of information and affirmation of these articles in print and in the blogosphere , and the efforts of so many within the impeachment movement , the main - stream media continues to marginalize Kucinich ’s effort by either ignoring the story altogether or publishing simplistic 200 word articles about it .
Main - stream media insists , despite polls that say otherwise , that impeachment is not popular and because George W. Bush is a lame duck at this point , impeachment is unnecessary .
Is George W. Bush a lame duck ?
Is impeachment at this point unnecessary ?
What kind of future can we look forward to if Bush is never impeached ?
In order to answer these questions it is important to look at what impeachment is and what it would do .
“¢ Impeachment would open up investigations by the judiciary committee into the 35 Articles of Impeachment against George W. Bush .
“ ¢
If the judiciary committee finds that these investigations show that crimes have been committed a resolution will be issued to the House , which then goes on to a Floor vote , and if voted through by a majority will lead to a trial in the Senate .
“ ¢
The trial in the Senate would be run similar to a court trial , with the full Senate acting as jury with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , ( John Roberts ) , acting as judge .
Once the arguments of the prosecution and defense are heard the Senate would meet in a closed session to deliberate , the Senate would then vote in open session on each Article of Impeachment “ “ a two - thirds vote is needed for a conviction .
On conviction the official , ( Bush ) , would be removed from office , if a two - thirds vote is not reached the official would be acquitted .
If convicted Bush would be removed from office , but even if Bush was not convicted in the course of the impeachment spectacle the crimes of the Bush administration would be aired , debated , and proclaimed to the world .
No longer could the media ignore the vast legacy of criminality that the Bush regime has perpetrated for the last seven years , and the people of the world would hear all the dark dirty secrets and crimes that this regime has kept and committed and there would be a resounding outcry for justice .
Not only would the Bush regime ’s deadly crimes be laid bare , but it is highly probable that an impeachment trial would completely prevent Bush from attacking Iran .
Article XXI charges Bush with : “ Misleading Congress and the American People About Threats from Iran , and Supporting Terrorist Organizations Within Iran , With the Goal of Overthrowing the Iranian Government ” .
Surely with such a charge pending trial and with a public challenge on the validity of any action against Iran being heard in the Senate , no declaration of war could be acted upon during that time .
The fact that George W. Bush has pushed and continues to push for war with Iran shows that he is far from a lame duck .
Bush and his administration are continuing their agenda unabated and virtually unchallenged .
Impeachment could be instrumental in preventing Bush from starting another illegal , pre-emptive , and baseless war .
Not only can impeachment lay bare the crimes of the Bush regime for the world to see , remove Bush from office , and at the same time prevent war with Iran , impeachment can also serve another extremely vital function : the impeachment process can serve as an example to future leaders of what will happen to them if they decide to subvert the rule of law .
But what will happen if Kucinich ’s 35 Articles of Impeachment quietly die in judiciary committee and the crimes of the Bush regime are not investigated ?
If the Bush regime ’s crimes are not investigated will these crimes then become accepted behavior by America ’s leaders ?
If no one is held to account for authority over - stepped , laws undermined , rule of law flouted , and torture codified , what ’s to stop the next president , and the next and the next and the one after that from following suit ?
To allow George W. Bush to go virtually unchallenged in any significant and legal way now is to allow a foundation of corruption and despotism to be laid at the feet of every president after him : an absolutely flawless model for sidestepping accountability and practicing unchecked and unfettered powers .
Imagine a progression and a continuation of the agenda of the Bush regime year after year .
Imagine the aftermath that a pre-emptive and deadly bombing of Iran will have on the world , not only the horrendous death and destruction such an act would immediately cause , but the worldwide economic fall - out , and the possibility of an increase in the ferocity of the wars already being waged and the likely increase in terrorism in retaliation for the actions of George W. Bush .
Such a future portends to be a much darker version of our current reality .
A future without impeachment paints a frighteningly bleak picture , a picture that at this point many of us can see but too few of us are acting to prevent .
If ever there was a time to act , now is that time .
Congressman Kucinich has promised to re-introduce the 35 Articles of Impeachment against Bush within 30 days of the first introduction if the judiciary committee does not act .
That ’s just a few short weeks from now .
It ’s time , right now , to promote the necessity of impeachment as widely as possible .
It is imperative that the Bush regime be driven from office and held accountable for its many crimes – it ’s time to act now .
At this point the future in unwritten , which one we get is up to us .

Water from the lake is being drained through a man-made sluice
Chinese troops have begun draining a " quake lake " at Tangjiashan , formed behind a landslide after the 12 May earthquake in Sichuan province .
Water started draining through a sluice and channel built to release some of the water threatening to break through the make - shift dam .
More than 250,000 people have already been evacuated to higher ground .
Experts had warned the lake could burst at any time , sending millions of cubic metres of water down river valleys .
" Emergency work is still proceeding urgently , but in the foreseeable future there 's no risk of the dam collapsing , " Xinhua News Agency quoted Chengdu Military Region Deputy Commander Fan Xiaoguang as saying .
Engineers are monitoring bridges and river banks downstream to see if they will hold under the rush of water .
Work crews are trying to dig a secondary channel to improve the flow , China Central Television and the Xinhua News Agency reports .
Plans are in place to quickly evacuate an estimated 1.3 m people who live in the surrounding area of the lake , just above the town of Beichuan .
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has warned of heavy rain across China , including Sichuan , over the weekend .
The threat posed by more than 30 quake lakes formed during the earthquake has become one of the most pressing issues in the aftermath of the quake .
Government figures put the quake death toll at 69,130 with another 17,824 people missing .

June 2016 Update : Lol-ing about this post .
Geez …
The primary elections start in little less than a year and speculations are rife about which individuals are likely to run as Republican presidential candidates .
Let us take a look at the roster of potential candidates .
Jeb Bush , Florida Governor from 1999 to 2007 , seems to be getting a lot of support .
Poll results in South Carolina , Iowa , and New Hampshire show Jeb Bush scoring double - digit support in all three states .
Scott Walker , Governor of Wisconsin , also shows double - digit support in all three states .
Bush is considered by many to be the party ’s standard bearer .
He has heavyweight political credentials and connections , with his intimate familial connections to former presidents .
He is Florida ’s one and only Republican Governor to hold the position for two terms .
Some surmise , however , that his left leaning beliefs may work to his disadvantage .
That said , Bush is shockingly one of the only candidates with any true business experience !
While other candidates have worked in law and medicine , there is a surprising lack on any real business experience amongst the current line - up .
Frankly I find this a bit disturbing , and it is definitely an area where Bush has an edge .
Some will debate whether business experience is really all that important for a president to have , citing Romney ’s failure to get elected in 2012 despite Romney ’s strong business resume .
These polls conducted by NBC News and the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion indicate that the Republican race is wide open – with other candidates getting double - digit support in one or two of the above - mentioned states .
Experts surmise that the fight for the Republican nomination may turn out to be a free - for- all .
The other strong contenders for the nomination are the following :
Mike Huckabee – Arkansas Governor from 1996 to 2007 .
He was also a candidate for the presidential elections of 2008 .
Huckabee , known for his stalwart faith as an Evangelical Christian , is a Southern Baptist minister .
People believe that when it comes to the race for the upcoming nomination , he has strong staying power due to the many early Southern primaries .
Chris Christie – Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to present .
He presently holds the post of Chairman of the Republican Governors Association , assuming the position in 2013 .
Senator Randal Howard Paul of the Commonwealth of Kentucky , physician and ophthalmologist , is the incumbent U.S. Senator of Kentucky , having assumed office in 2011 .
U.S. Texan Representative Ron Paul is his father .
Lindsey Olin Graham , native son of South Carolina , is senior U.S. Senator , serving in this capacity since 2003 .
Ben Carson is a well - received author , philanthropist , and neurosurgeon – Director of the Pediatric Neurosurgery Department of Johns Hopkins Hospital .
James Richard Perry assumed the position of Governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015 .
Prior to that , he was Lieutenant Governor to George W. Bush , assuming the position of governor when then - Governor Bush was elected to office as U.S. President in 2000 .
Perry is the longest - serving governor in the history of Texas .
He was a presidential candidate in the 2012 elections but failed to perform according to expectations .
His effort to secure the Republican presidential nomination for the 2016 elections may very well be his last one .
Ted Cruz was educated in Harvard and Princeton .
This brilliant lawyer , highly acclaimed for his exceptional oratory gift , is considered one of the strongest and scholarly principals of the tea party movement .
Rick Santorum served as Senator from Pennsylvania for two terms .
He presently enjoys the strong support of a dedicated and steadfast base which is expected to grow , expanding his demographic strength in time for the nominations .
Marco Rubio was West Miami City Commissioner before being elected as Senator .
He is now considered as one of the candidates with very strong chances at winning the bid for the Republican nominations .
What do you think of this line - up ?
I think Hillary better look out because she has a lot of heavy hitters to contend with here !

Omega Centauri is a strange thing .
It ’s been classified as a star , then a nebula , then a globular cluster and now it ’s thought to be a dwarf galaxy missing its outer stars .
Why is it in such a mess ?
How can this oddball galaxy be explained ?
New research suggests it has an intermediate - black hole living in its core , Â giving astronomers the best idea yet as to where supermassive black holes come from .
Omega Centauri might hold one of the most profound secrets asÂ to how the largest objects in the observable universe are born …
Two thousand years ago , Omega Centauri was classified as a single star by Ptolemy .
Edmond Halley studied this “ star ” but thought it looked a bit diffuse and re-classified it as a nebula in 1677 .
Then , in the 1830s , John Herschel was the first astronomer to realize this “ nebula ” was actually a galaxy , a globular cluster galaxy .
But now , new observations by the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) reveal that this “ globular cluster ” is n’t what it seems … it ’s actually a dwarf galaxy , stripped of its outer stars , some 17,000 light years away .
See an observation video zooming into the location of Omega Centauri in the constellation of Centaurus .
So what led to astronomers thinking there was something strange about this cosmic collection of stars ?
It rotates faster than other globular clusters , it is strangely flat and it contains stars of many generations ( globular clusters usually contain stars of one generation ) .
These reasons plus the fact Omega Centauri is ten times bigger than the largest globular clusters have led scientists to believe that this was no ordinary galaxy .
The main theory is that this unlucky galaxy may have crashed into the Milky Way in the distant past , shedding its outermost stars during the collision .
This explains the lack of stars in its outer region .
But why is it rotating so quickly , especially in the center ?
These stunning images were taken by the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope , which continues to do amazing science after 18 years in orbit .
Combined with ground - based observations by the Gemini South telescope in Chile , astronomers have been able to deduce that a black hole may be at the root of a lot of the anomalies seen in Omega Centauri .
The research carried out at the Max - Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics ( in Garching , Germany ) , headed by Eva Noyola , shows stars near the center of Omega Centauri orbiting something very fast .
In fact , this something is invisible for a reason .
Calculating this invisible object ’s mass , it is most likely that the group are observing an intermediate - size black hole with the mass of 40,000 solar masses .
They have investigated other possibilities , perhaps the fast - orbiting stars could be accelerated by the collective mass of small , weakly radiating bodies such as white dwarves , or the orbiting stars ’ have highly elliptical orbits and the point of closest approach is currently being observed , giving the impression they are going faster .
However , the intermediate - size black hole theory appears to fit the situation far better .
This is a highly significant discovery , as so far there has been little linking theÂ smaller , stellar black holes with the supermassive ones that sit in the center of large galaxies such as our own .
There have been many theories put forward about how these huge black holes may have formed , but to find an intermediate - sized black hole may be the missing link and will help astrophysicists understand how supermassive black holes are “ seeded ” in the first place .
“ This result shows that there is a continuous range of masses for black holes , from supermassive , to intermediate - mass , to small stellar mass types [ … ]
We may be on the verge of uncovering one possible mechanism for the formation of supermassive black holes .
Intermediate - mass black holes like this could be the seeds of full - sized supermassive black holes . ” – Eva Noyola .

" So I have no regrets about taking the case and I think our decision in the case was absolutely right .
But if you ask me ' Am I sorry it all happened ? '
Of course I am sorry it happened there was no way that we were going to come out of it smelling like a rose .
When people are made to think quickly , they report feeling happier as a result .
They also say they are more energetic , more creative , more powerful , and more self - assured .
In short , they reported a whole set of experiences associated with being “ manic . ”
Fast thinking , or “ racing thoughts , ” is most commonly known as a symptom of the clinical psychiatric disorder of mania ( and of the manic part of bipolar disorder or “ manic - depression ” ) .
But , according to Princeton University psychologist Emily Pronin , most healthy people also have experienced racing thoughts at some point in time–perhaps when they are excited about a new idea they have just learned , or when they are brainstorming with a group of people , or even when they lie in bed unable to fall asleep .
Pronin and her Harvard colleague Daniel Wegner decided to explore whether inducing people to think fast might lead them to feel some of the other experiences also associated with the manic experience .
To examine this question , they experimentally manipulated the pace at which participants read a series of statements .
Half of participants read the statements at a fast pace ( about twice as fast as normal reading speed ) and the other half read the statements at a slow pace ( about twice as slow as normal reading speed ) .
They then completed a questionnaire assessing their mood , energy level , self - esteem , etc. , using standard psychological measures .
As an added twist , some of the participants read statements that were very depressing in content ( e.g. , I want to go to sleep and never wake up ) while others read statements that were very elating in content ( e.g. , Wow ! I feel great ! ) .
The researchers found that regardless of the content of the statements , people felt happier , more energetic , more creative , more powerful , and more grandiose when they read the statements at a fast rather than a slow pace .
In fact , the effect of thought speed was just as powerful as the effect of the content of the thoughts .
In other words , the speed of people ’s cognitive processing was just as important as what they processed in determining their mood .
Even thinking sad thoughts at a fast pace made people relatively happy .
The article , titled “ Manic Thinking : Independent Effects of Thought Speed and Thought Content on Mood ” appears in the September issue of Psychological Science , and was co-authored by Emily Pronin of Princeton University and Daniel Wegner of Harvard University .
The reported effect of fast thinking on mood could have important applications in both clinical ( psychiatric ) and normal populations .
The authors note that simple manipulations of thought speed could perhaps be used to improve individuals ’ mood , self - esteem , feelings of creativity , feelings of power , and energy level .
Such manipulations could be useful in everyday situations , where people would like a quick mood , energy , or self - esteem boost on a day they are feeling tired or downcast .
Manipulations of thought speed might also prove useful as part of treating depression , which is characterized by slow thinking , and also by the absence of things like positive mood , energy , feelings of power , and self - esteem .
The authors note that : “ The results of our experiment suggest the intriguing possibility that even during moments when people feel stuck having depressed thoughts , interventions that accelerate the speed of such thoughts may serve to boost feelings of positive affect and energy . ”

The Salvation of Doug
by William T. Sullivan
On a hill overlooking an automobile factory , lived Doug , a retired biochemist , and a retired geneticist ( nobody knew his name ) .
Every morning , over a cup of coffee , and every afternoon , over a beer , they would discuss and argue over many issues and philosophical points .
During their morning conversations , they would watch the employees entering the factory below to begin their work day .
Some would be dressed in work clothes carrying a lunch pail , others , dressed in suits , would be carrying briefcases .
Every afternoon , as they waited for the head on their beers to settle , they would see fully built automobiles being driven out of the other side of the factory .
Having spent a life in pursuit of higher learning , both were wholly unfamiliar with how cars worked .
They decided that they would like to learn about the functioning of cars and having different scientific backgrounds they each took a very different approach .
Doug immediately obtained 100 cars ( he is a rich man , typical of most biochemists ) and ground them up .
He found that cars , consist of the following : 10 % glass , 25 % plastic , 60 % steel , and 5 % other materials that he could not easily identify .
He felt satisfied that he had learned of the types and proportions of material that made up each car .
His next task was to mix these fractions to see if he could reproduce some aspect of the automobile 's function .
As you can imagine , this proved daunting .
Doug put in long hard hours between his morning coffee and afternoon beer .
The geneticist , not being inclined toward hard work ( as is true for most geneticists ) pursued a less strenuous ( and less expensive ) approach .
One day , before his morning coffee , he hiked down the hill , selected a worker at random , and tied his hands .
After coffee , while the biochemist zipped up his blue jump suit , adjusted his welders goggles , and lit his blow torch to begin another day of grinding , the geneticist pueered around the house , made himself another pot of coffee , and browsed through the latest issue of Genetics .
That afternoon , while the automobiles were rolling off the assembly line , Doug , wet with the sweat of his day 's exertions , took a sip of beer and as soon as he caught his breath began discussing his progress .
" I have been focusing my efforts on a component I consistently find in the plastic fraction .
It looks like this ( he draws the shape of a steering wheel on the edge of a napkin ) .
Presently I have been mixing it with the glass fraction to see if it has any activity ..
I am hoping that with the right mixture I may get motion , although I have not had any success so far .
I believe with a bigger blow torch , perhaps even a flame thrower , I will get better results . "
The geneticist was only half listening because his attention was drawn to the cars rolling off the assembly line .
He noticed that they were missing the front and rear windows , but not the side windows .
As soon as the biochemist finished speaking ( geneticists are very polite conversationalists ) , the geneticist proclaimed , " I have learned two facts today .
The worker whose hands I tied this morning is responsible for installing car windows and the installation of the side windows is a separate process from the installation of the front and back windows . "
The following day the geneticist tied the hands of another worker .
That afternoon he noticed that the cars were being produced without the plastic devices the biochemist was working on ( steering wheels ) .
In addition , he noticed that as the cars were being driven off to the parking lot , none of them make the first turn in the road and they begin piling up on the lawn .
That evening , to Doug 's dismay , the geneticist concluded that steering wheels were responsible for turning the car and , in addition , that he had identified the worker responsible for installing the steering wheels .
Emboldened by his successes , the next morning the geneticist tied of the hands of an individual dressed in a suit and carrying a briefcase in one hand and a laser pointer in the other ( he was a vice president ) .
That evening the geneticist , and Doug ( although he would not openly admit it ) , anxiously awaited to see the effect on the cars .
They speculated that the effect might be so great as to prevent the production of the cars entirely .
To their surprise , however , that afternoon the cars rolled off the assembly line with no discemible effect .
The two scientists conversed late into the evening about the implications of this result .
The geneticist , always having had a dislike for men in suits , concluded that the vice president sat around drinking coffee all day ( much like geneticists ) and had no role in the production of the automobiles .
Doug , however , held the view that there was more than one vice president so that if one was unable to perform , others could take over his duties .
The next morning Doug watched as the geneticist , in an attempt to resolve this issue , headed off towards the factory carrying a large rope to tie the hands of all the men in suits .
Doug , after a slight hesitation , abandoned his goggles and blow torch , and stumbled down the hill to join him .

The Demise of Bill
by Douglas R. Kellogg
On a hill overlooking an automobile factory , lived Bill , a retired geneticist , and a retired biochemist ( nobody knew his name ) .
Having spent a life in pursuit of higher learning , both were wholly unfamiliar with how cars worked , and they decided that they would like to learn about the functioning of cars .
Having different scientific backgrounds they each took a very different approach .
Bill , not being inclined towards hard work ( like most geneticists ) , immediately came up with a scheme that he thought would lead him to an understanding of cars .
The next morning he went down the hill and tied the hands of one of the workers in the factory .
He then went back up the hill and sat down to a cup of coffee .
As he was just starting to sip his cup of coffee , he heard some banging noises and went out to the garage to see what was going on .
When he looked in the garage he found that the biochemist had gotten one of the cars from the factory and was already covered with grease and oil as he was doing something under the hood .
When Bill asked the biochemist what he was doing , he replied : " I 'm taking the car apart to see how it works " .
The geneticist laughed and then sat down to enjoy his cup of coffee while he made fun of the biochemist .
Bill spent the entire day drinking coffee while the biochemist struggled and sweated under the hood of the car . ''
Towards the end of the day , as the exhausted biochemist was washing up , the geneticist pointed at the factory below .
Cars were rolling out of the factory , and each one lacked a particular circular device ( the steering wheel ) .
Moreover , each of the cars failed to make the first turn in the road as they left the factory , and all the cars were piling up on the lawn .
" Hah ! " exclaimed the geneticist , " The worker whose hands I tied up today is responsible for installing the circular device , and the circular device is responsible for steering the car " .
The geneticist then asked the biochemist what he had learned that day .
The biochemist said that he had been focusing on a small white object ( the spark plug ) and that he did not yet know what it did .
The geneticist hooted with laughter .
The next day , the geneticist , emboldened by his success , went back down the hill and tied the hands of another worker .
He then went back up the hill to get a cup of coffee .
As he sat down to his coffee , he heard an explosion in the garage .
He ran out to see what happened , and he found the biochemist picking himself up off the ground , his face all black and most of his hair burned away .
When Bill asked in amazement what had happened , the biochemist simply replied : " I have found that the liquid in the tank of the car is fairly explosive " .
Later that day , when they looked down at the factory to see the effect of Bill 's experiment , they observed that there were no cars coming out of the factory .
Bill seemed puzzled .
This continued for many days .
The geneticist gloated over his every discovery .
For instance , at the end of one day the cars that rolled out of the factory were missing the front and rear windows , but not the side windows .
Bill told the toiling biochemist : " The worker whose hands I tied today is responsible for installing the front and back windows , and this process is independent of installing the side windows . "
One evening , as they were drinking some beer and arguing , the biochemist asked Bill " Now that you have learned so much , tell me how the car works . "
Bill seemed puzzled by the question , but after thinking awhile he said that he had noticed that whenever the cars do n't have the round things ( the tires ) they are completely unable to go anywhere at all .
He therefore concluded that these round things were actually responsible for moving the car .
The biochemist had another sip of his beer and noticed how beautiful the sunset can be after a good day of hard work .
Meanwhile , the biochemist , after many hard months of work , thought that he was beginning to define some pathways .
In one pathway , he found that the explosive liquid in the tank moved through a small tube to a device that turned it into a vapor , and that the vapor was sucked into some cylindrical chambers .
In another pathway , an electrical current flowed from a battery to the white devices he had studied earlier , and then formed a spark that ignited the explosive vapor , thus forcing a piston out .
The biochemist had also gone down the hill and taken the time to look at the cars that failed to leave the factory when Bill had tied the hands of some of the workers .
He found that they were lacking carburetors , spark plugs , drive shafts , gasoline , etc .
By studying these cars , he was able to confirm some theories that he had developed regarding the functions of the cars components .
After awhile , the geneticist decided that he now knew enough about cars , and he wanted to get one so that he could go out while he waited for the results of his experiments .
He decided to get a Volkswagen Camper Van .
The day he got his van , he stopped by the garage to see what nonsense the biochemist was up to .
The biochemist was sitting in the car pumping the clutch , and each time he did a stream of liquid shot out from underneath the car .
He told Bill that he thought the liquid in the tube leading from the clutch pedal to the clutch played a critical role in disengaging the gears from the drive shaft .
Bill laughed and then drove off to spend the day at a Three Stooges Film Festival that was showing at a nearby theater .
One day , several weeks later , Bill spent the day surfing and then got in his van to go home .
But when he turned the key , nothing happened .
He was n't sure what was wrong , and he wondered whether or not his car might need new wheels .
He tried the key several more times and then got out and started to walk .
Pretty soon it started to rain .
He tried to hitchhike but nobody seemed to want to pick him up , and he did not make it home until late that night .
When he got home , the biochemist asked him where he had been , and Bill told him what had happened .
Bill confessed that he did not know what to do , but the biochemist said that he might be able to help .
The next day , they drove back to Bill 's stalled van in the biochemist 's car -- a 1964 Valiant with a V8 engine and a push - button transmission .
The geneticist could n't help noticing how smoothly the biochemist 's car ran .
When they got to Bill 's car , the biochemist rapidly determined that one of the battery cables no longer made a good connection , and he had the car running in no time at all .
As Bill drove away , he just shook his head .
Bill 's car kept breaking down , and every time it did the biochemist had to go out and fix it .
He tried to teach Bill how cars work , but Bill did n't seem to understand and was always more interested in his hand - tying experiments .
The story came to an end when Bill 's car crashed into a tree .
He had been driving along just fine when a fruit fly crawled into his eye and caused him to swerve off of the road .
Unfortunately , he was not wearing his seat belts because when he had tied the hands of the worker that installed them , the cars that came out of the factory seemed to function fine , and Bill had concluded that seat belts were vestigial and not important to the functioning of the car .
Remarkably , Bill survived the accident , but as soon as he got out of the hospital he got a new car and had the biochemist help him start taking it apart .

The world 's oldest gorilla celebrated her 55th birthday today with a four - layer frozen fruit cake and banana leaf - wrapped treats .
Jenny 's caretakers at the Dallas Zoo say she 's having a few joint issues and her eyesight is n't what it used to be but she still looks good for an old ape .
" It 's a special milestone for us , " said Todd Bowsher , curator of the zoo 's Wilds of Africa exhibit .
" It signifies that we 've made great strides in veterinary care , nutrition and animal husbandry . "

Tea -time : Jenny has a reputation for being bossy with her keepers at Dallas zoo
The International Species Information System , which maintains records on animals at 700 institutions around the world , said Jenny is the oldest gorilla in its database .
" I think it 's amazing , " said Kristen Lukas , curator of conservation and science at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo in Ohio and the gorilla species survival plan coordinator for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums .
" I think it 's a testament to the good care that she 's received at the Dallas Zoo and also the resilience of gorillas in general . "
Lukas said gorillas in the wild normally would live to age 30 or 35 .
Health care and protection from predators has extended the lifespan in zoos .
Jenny gave birth in 1965 to a female named Vicki , who was sent to Alberta , Canada , at age 5 .
Zoo officials are n't sure why Jenny has n't conceived again .
Jenny 's keepers describe her as very sweet though a little bossy .

Tasty treat :
Jenny the gorilla carts off her birthday cake this morning as she turned 55
" If she does n't want to go out on a certain day , she doesn't , " Bowsher said .
" But she really likes people . "
There were plenty of them at the Jake L. Hamon Gorilla Conservation Research Center Thursday , chowing down on giant sheets of chocolate and vanilla birthday cake as they peered at Jenny through the glass .
Born in the wild of western central Africa in 1953 , the exact date of her birth is unknown but the zoo marks it on May 8 .
Jenny lived with a family on the Cape Verde islands before the Dallas Zoo acquired her in 1957 .
" I remember the day she arrived , " said Nancy Hamon , 89 , of Dallas , whose family bought the gorilla for the zoo and continues to be among its strongest supporters .
Jenny , a 213 - pound ( 97- kilogram )
Western lowland gorilla , is one of four gorillas at the zoo .
" It 's a good time for the zoo , " said Sean Greene , director of Community Relations for the Dallas Zoological Society .
He said the upbeat birthday party was a welcome contrast to the tragedy that occurred in 2004 when another gorilla , 13 - year - old Jabari , broke out of his enclosure .
He went on a 40 - minute rampage in which he snatched up a toddler with his teeth and attacked three other people before officers shot him .
So to what does Jenny attribute her longevity ?
She 's not saying .
But her vegetarian diet could n't hurt : seeds , cereal and one of her favorites , banana peels .
Quotations from Without Precedent : The Inside Story of the 911 Commission , by Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton
" We were set up to fail " ( 14 ) .
" The chief obstacle was the White House , which argued that the congressional inquiry was continuing , and that an independent investigation would distract the government from waging the ongoing war on terrorism " ( 17 ) .
" The two sides decided to split the difference , allowing eighteen months for the inquiry — a period of time that proved insufficient " ( 20 ) .
" The White House also suggested some candidates for executive director for our staff .
The importance of this position cannot be overstated " ( 22 ) .
" …we seriously only considered one candidate : Philip Zelikow … .
Zelikow was a controversial choice .
In the 1990s , as an academic , he had co-authored , with Condoleezza Rice , a book about German unification , and he later assisted Stephen Hadley in running the National Security Council transition for the incoming Bush administration in 2000 - 2001 " ( 28 ) .
" … our office space and employees had to be cleared by the FBI and CIA to handle top- secret information … " ( 34 )
" After Philip Zelikow came on board as executive director , he began recruiting and interviewing candidates … .
Zelikow was selected with little consultation with the rest of the committee , but several commissioners had concerns about the kind of inquiry he would lead " ( 35 )
" … Zelikow drove and organized the staff 's work … " ( 38 )
" The House Republican caucus and Speaker Dennis Hastert 's office remained the most difficult obstacles .
Throughout the life of the commission , and indeed through the passage of intelligence reform legislation based upon our recommendations , the strongest congressional wariness came from House Republicans " ( 45 )
" We had to decide : How deep and how far do the roots of 9/11 run ?
That is a difficult question to answer … .
In a way , we would define what information was relevant to 9/11 by asking for it " ( 58 )
" We soon encountered problems , both in obtaining information and with the laborious conditions placed on our access to some information " ( 63 )
" We decided against an aggressive use of subpoenas for several reasons … .
Furthermore , we knew that many of the most important documents we sought were potentially the subject of an executive privilege claim — meaning that the president might not be legally compelled to share that material with another branch of government , even with a subpoena " ( 64 )
" We were supposed to be independent , not necessarily confrontational .
We were investigating a national catastrophe , not a White House transgression ; this was 9/11 , not Watergate " ( 65 )
" When the Joint Inquiry report was released , there were twenty - eight blank pages where information had been ' redacted ' from public view … .
By being secretive , the government opened the door to cynicism and conspiracy theories … .
The core of the problem is the fact that people in government can get in trouble for revealing something that is secret , but they can not get in trouble for stamping SECRET on a document .
Thus the default rule becomes : when in doubt , classify .
Particularly in our early days , the 9/11 Commission faced this problem " ( 69 )
" The White House wanted strict limitations on both of these fronts — limiting staff with access to White House documents to just two or three people , limiting the commissioners with access to certain materials to just the chair and vice - chair , and restricting the amount of notes the staff could bring back to the 9/11 Commission 's office " ( 72 )
" … the FAA had turned over to us the distilled product of their own internal investigation into 9/11 , but had failed to turn over the extensive raw materials that had gone into that investigation , even though that is precisely what our staff had asked for " ( 83 )
" There were also discrepancies between things NORAD was telling us about their performance on the morning of September 11 — things that the agency had stated publicly after 9/11 — and the story told by the limited tapes and documents the commission had received ….
These were puzzling and disturbing developments , and they account in part for some of the more bizarre and inaccurate conspiracy theories about 9/11 . "
" Farmer believed that NORAD was delivering incomplete records with the knowledge that the commission had a fixed end date that could be waited out " ( 86 )
" Many interviews were recorded , though we were not permitted to record those conducted with current officials from the Executive Office of the President " ( 98 )
" The FBI and CIA were fairly responsive ; the Department of Defense was less so .
But it was clear that the government 's interrogators were not asking the detainees the kinds of questions we wanted answered … .
We also had no way of evaluating the credibility of detainee information … .
In some cases , we could corroborate the truthfulness of what a detainee was reported to have said by comparing that information with other evidence .
But in some cases we could n't ; and in others , detainees offered contradicting accounts " ( 119 )
" Where we could corroborate these detainee reports from other witnesses or evidence , we did .
Where we could not , it was left to the reader to consider the credibility of the source — we had no opportunity to do so " ( 124 )
" Senior officials from the FAA and NORAD — Jane Garvey and Craig McKinley — made statements about the timeline of 9/11 that were later proven to be inaccurate " ( 127 )
" Staff statements also gave us a chance to work out a process for clearing material for publication by the White House .
We were determined to avoid the fate of the Joint Inquiry and its redacted pages " ( 134 )
" The evidence showed that some of the hijackers had been here unlawfully , and had not obeyed immigration laws in the United States .
Two of the surviving passports had been doctored , and the other two had what our staff referred to as ' suspicious indicators . '
Three hijackers had made false statements on visa applications that could have been detected — for instance , saying they had not previously applied for a U.S. visa when they had .
Five hijackers had entered the United States more than once , and three of those five had violated immigration laws that could have led to their being barred from reentry , for instance , by entering the United States on a tourist visa and then enrolling in a flight school … .
In total , at least six of the nineteen hijackers had violated immigration laws while in the United States " ( 136 )
" The hijackers were nineteen for twenty in getting into the country ; they were nineteen for nineteen in getting onto the four flights with lethal knives , box cutters , and — in some cases — probably Mace or pepper spray ( which were banned items ) " ( 138 )
" Speaker Dennis Hastert continued his staunch opposition to any extension for the commission " ( 148 )
" Then , on March 30 , the White House surprised us by offering to have both President Bush and Vice - President Cheney meet with the full commission … .
Another condition was that there could not be a recording or transcript of the meeting ….
We were permitted one staff member — Philip Zelikow , our staff director — to attend as a note taker , and commissioners also took notes " ( 206-207 )
" The point is terrorists exist in a shadowy world ; contacts are made under ambiguous circumstances , for ambiguous reasons " ( 250 )
" Throughout the course of our inquiry , the topic that invited the most skepticism — and thus the most conspiracy theorizing — was the performance of the FAA and NORAD on the day of September 11 , 2001 " ( 256 )
" Fog of war could explain why some people were confused on the day of 9/11 , but it could not explain why all of the after - action reports , accident investigations , and public testimony by FAA and NORAD officials advanced an account of 9/11 that was untrue " ( 261 )
" General Myers asserted that the chain of command was in place , though there were gaps when Secretary Rumsfeld was in the Pentagon 's parking lot , and since the president was sometimes out of reach " ( 265 )
" At the outset of our work , Philip Zelikow and Ernest May prepared an outline along these lines , and they presented it to the two of us in July 2003 ….
[ May ] and Zelikow had collaborated on books in the past and had a strong mutual regard … .
His primary role was advising Zelikow and occasionally weighing in on debates within the staff " ( 270 )
" … Zelikow had an overarching vision for how the report should flow … .
Ultimately , the responsibility for final staff edits of the respective chapters was divided up among Zelikow , Kojm , and Marcus " ( 273 )
The following quotations are from Ernest R. May , " When government writes history , " The New Republic , May 16 , 2005 .
www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050523&s=may052305
" To some extent , the concept of the report as a narrative history influenced the recruitment of staff .
Here were many other constraints .
The urgent reporting deadline made it advantageous if a potential member of the staff already had high - level security clearances .
( Zelikow had them as a member of the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board .
I had them as a member of the Intelligence Science Board . )
That meant preference for people who could be detailed from national security agencies or who had been on the staff of one of the congressional intelligence oversight committees .
Of the fifty - odd men and women who counted as professional rather than administrative staff , at least half had such backgrounds . "
" And no language appeared anywhere in the final text unless Zelikow or I or both of us — and all the commissioners — had accepted it . "
" A reader of the commission report should bear in mind that its documentary base was extraordinarily deep but also extraordinarily narrow "
" We never had full confidence in the interrogation reports as historical sources … .
I think the commission could have successfully challenged the CIA on both access to detainees and release of names , but it chose not to fight these battles . "
" Third , and most troubling to me , the report is probably too balanced .
Its harshest criticism is directed at institutions and procedures , particularly the CIA , the FBI , and communications links within the counterterrorist community .
But many of the staff had worked in these or other national security agencies .
They felt loyal to them and some of them expected to return to work there .
Collective drafting led to the introduction of passages that offset criticism of an agency with words of praise .
Not all these words were deserved . "
At its heart , liberty means renouncing the use of coercion against others .
That is why those who would employ coercion against others must invent arguments to defend their actions as consistent with liberty .
That is also why slavery — the opposite of liberty — is a useful touchstone in evaluating defenses that coercion is consistent with liberty , when it always increases the enslavement of someone .
One of those most adept at using slavery to test supposed justifications for coercive policies was F.A. Harper .
He recognized that ' Strange is a concept of ' liberty ' [ where ] … you enjoy the right to be forced to bow to the dictates of others . '
He rebutted arguments for why obvious violations of people 's liberty — as with innumerable government price controls , regulatory restrictions and tax impositions — do not ' really ' take it away , by showing that they were consistent with slavery .
Mere rhetorical tap - dancing cannot demonstrate that liberty is maintained by government acts or approaches that are consistent with slavery .
Harper 's use of this approach was particularly pronounced in Liberty : A Path for its Recovery .
There he used them to clarify Abraham Lincoln statement that ' We all declare for liberty , but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing .
With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself , and the product of his labor ; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men , and the product of other men 's labor .
Here are two , not only different but incompatible things . '
Consider some common ' liberty is not really lost ' defenses that are offered and Harper 's responses .
Our liberty is maintained because the federal government can only do what advances the general welfare .
Suppose that the master pleads innocence of slaveholding on the ground that he is spending the slave 's earnings for what he considers to be the slave 's own welfare .
Would that change the degree of liberty of the slave ?
Is liberty to defined in such a way as to allow me to take from you the product of your labor , so long as I claim that I shall use it for your welfare , or for the ' general welfare ' ?
Should the robbing of banks be allowable under liberty , provided the bank robbers promise to put the proceeds of the robbery to some use they claim to be worthy , or even to some use that a majority of the people have judged to be worthy ?
Our right to petition the government for redress of our grievances guarantees that liberty is maintained .
Being able to review a decision or to request its review … does not assure that liberty will be protected .
Reinstatement of lost liberty can be requested and refused time and time again , without end .
A slave , similarly , might ask his master for his freedom time and again ; he is not considered to be free by reason of the fact that his is allowed to ask for liberty .
Though our power to vote , infringements on our liberty are prevented .
[ L] iberty is …the right of a person to have control over his own affairs … the expansion of governmental activities …[ requires that ]
Minorities become the slaves of the others …
Participation in these steps that make it possible for someone to rule others does not ensure liberty .
It is fantastic nonsense to assert that the democratic process will assure liberty to the individuals of any nation … it would be more accurate to say that it is a most certain path to slavery .
[ C ] hanging of top personnel in the government , or ' reform governments , ' [ is not ] any answer to the basic problem .
The gaining of better administration of an evil in the form of unwarranted power is a victory without virtue .
The most efficient and best possible administration of slavery will not transform it into liberty .
Government does not violate our liberty because it just provides goods and services people want .
The excess that the government takes is no longer available for the citizen to spend as he wishes , as required under liberty .
It may be said that the people want these services and would buy them anyhow if they were performed by private business instead of by government .
But the slave who is given some turnips by his master cannot be called free economically because of the fact that he might have wanted to buy some turnips with some of his wages as a free man , had he been free .
The citizen , likewise , is not judged to be free because of the fact that he might have bought , in a free market , services similar to those offered by the governmental monopoly where users and non-users alike are forced to pay the costs in their tax bills .
In the same sense that the welfare state grants benefits , the slave - master grants to his slaves certain allotments of food and other economic goods .
In fact , slavery might be described as just another form of welfare state , because of its likeness in restrictions and ' benefits . '
Liberty is maintained because there is nothing like slavery in America today .
Partial liberty under slavery is well illustrated … masters granted their serfs two days out of the week to work for themselves .
They had that degree of economic liberty …
The test of economic liberty … [ is ] the right to the product of one 's own labor .
One who is deprived of these rights is a slave .
To whatever extent he is deprived of these rights , he is to that extent a slave .
[ A ] temporary grant of freedom by the welfare state … [ is like ] when a master allows his slave a day off from work to spend as he likes … the person who is permitted some freedom by the welfare state is still a vassal of that state just as a slave is still a slave on his day off from work .
Slavery cannot be transformed into no slavery by having a group of owners combine to do the same thing …even when it is government that does the taking …
[ T ] he slavery of person to person … has been judged to violate the rights of persons to be free .
But there is rapidly arising a form of slavery even more dangerous and deadly …
The superstition prevails that if the government takes from unwilling people the product of their labor to pay for governmental costs of which they disapprove , it becomes a commendable act unlike that of the master taking from his slave …as though … robbery becomes a commendable act if a large enough number of people approve of it … the government is …engaging more and more in the enslavement of the citizens .
If this process had involved the complete enslavement of certain persons , it would be more noticeable and we would then be able to see it in its true light .
Our voluntary tax system demonstrates that our tax burdens are consistent with liberty .
The mere fact of taxes having been paid is no test of basic willingness ; it is no evidence that a form of slavery does not exist … that a slave works in his master 's field , similarly , is no evidence that slavery is not involved .
The giving of one 's wallet to the hold - up robber is no evidence that the robbery did not take place … there is an overhanging threat which causes the seemingly peaceful submission ; the unfortunate victim is allowed no alternative consistent with liberty .
Acquiescence of the citizens to that part of their taxes in excess of what is necessary to preserve liberty is no evidence that liberty has not been lost thereby .
Loss of liberty is not to be measured by the extent of refusal to pay taxes any more than slavery is to be measured by the degree of rebellion of the slaves .
Slaves are none the less slaves because they are not always attached to their masters by a chain !
The size of the tax burden is not so large as to infringe on liberty .
The administrative costs …of control operated by the government greatly understates the total loss of liberty which it entails …
Iike that of a slaveholder who may spend no more than the equivalent of one - tenth of what the slave produces as the cost of hiring an overseer to hold the slaves under the yoke of complete slavery ; it is not necessary to spend all that the slave produces as the cost of depriving him of his liberty .
F.A. Harper 's powerful use of slavery to test liberty claims gives new life to Patrick Henry 's famous 1775 declaration : ' Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ?
Forbid it , Almighty God !
I know not what course others may take ; but as for me , give me liberty , or give me death !'
He reminds us of the fact ' [ T ] hat some other person or persons will decide what you shall do , and force you to do it …[ is ] a definition of slavery rather than of liberty , ' and demonstrates that ' The belief of the master that his judgment is superior to that of the slave or vassal , and that control is ' for his own good , ' is not a moral justification for the idea of the welfare state . '
He showed how inadequate supposed proofs that the modern coercive state has not destroyed liberty are by bringing us back to the fact that ' Liberty … specifies the right to do what [ one ] desires , rather than the obligation to bow to the force of others in doing what they desire him to do ; otherwise slavery becomes ' liberty , and true liberty is lost . '
Harper saw how confusion about liberty , constantly bent , spindled and manipulated by the misleading assertions of those who wish to justify their coercion of others , was a dangerous threat to maintaining it .
And he knew how high the stakes were — that ' [ I ]t is , in fact , a main purpose of liberty that the blind are free to follow those who can see .
The danger is that in the absence of liberty the blind may become authorized to lead those who can see — by a chain around their necks !'
If we are to stop or reverse the continuing erosion of our liberty , we need to see that as clearly as he did , so that we can better defend the truth about liberty , allowing other open - minded individuals to also discover it , despite persistent attempts to cloud the most essential issues .
Myth busting Motherisms
1 . " Stop cracking your knuckles ... it will give you arthritis ! "
For some odd reason , young boys love cracking their knuckles .
Whether it's the sound of the crack or the feeling it makes , we feel relieved when one cracks a knuckle .
After getting all that finger stress out , Mom smacked you upside the head , reminding you of the extreme arthritis you 'd get because of all that cracking .
A study of 300 people who had bad habits of cracking their knuckles did not find any evidence that doing so leads to arthritis .
Some of these individuals did lose strength in their hands and also had soft tissue damage .
The " cracking " noise you hear when you crack a knuckle is merely a release of gases contained in joint fluids .
Arthritis is usually a symptom that you feel later in life and is usually inherited from your parents .
Mom was half - right though : Cracking your knuckles is not particularly good for you .
2 . " If you shave your facial hair , it will come back thicker . "
One of the most important times in a young man 's life is the first sight of facial hair growth .
A teen can sometimes grow a beard in their early years while others try to catch up to their more - manly brethren .
Mommy does n't want her little boy to grow up to quickly , and devised the reverse psychology technique of telling you that shaving would make your beard come back fuller .
So you shaved constantly and mom had a boy for a little while longer .
Shaving your hair has nothing to do with the growth of new hair .
If it did , would n't your balding father would be spending extra time shaving his head ?
The reasons for thinking this way relates to the thickness of new hair as opposed to the older , thinner hair that you most recently shaved off .
In addition , hair is only alive in the scalp , so cutting it off does nothing to affect its growth .
3 . " Watching TV too close will hurt your eyes and make you go blind ! "
The first things you did after school involved plopping your little butt down in front of the TV and catching some cartoons .
G.I.Joe , Transformers , & My Little Pony - all of these wonderful programs kept us at bay for hours .
We kept our eyes glued to the action - all at the risk of going blind , something mom loved to point out .
If you were watching the television your Grandmom had as a child , then maybe it could happen .
Very early television sets did emit a form of radiation , which causes all kinds of problems .
Other than that extreme case , there 's really nothing wrong with sitting closer to the TV then if you were farther away .
It can put a strain on your eyes , but the notion of going blind is simply untrue .
4 . " It 's cold outside - if you do n't bundle up you 're going to get sick ! "
When was the last time you saw an adult who was happy that it was cold and snowing outside ?
The upside of cold weather included snowball fights , Christmas , and missing days from school .
The downside ?
Catching a cold , supposedly .
Mom always had us put on multiple layers of clothing .
Was mom just being too over protective of her freezing young ones or just a little crazy ?
This old wives tale is a rather obvious one to debunk once some simple understanding of how common colds work in the first place .
Colds are the result of a simple virus that we get from breathing in from the air .
People stay inside more during winter , with all the doors and windows shut .
This makes for a drop in fresh air circulation , creating more opportunities for you to breathe in those pesky cold viruses .
5 . " Make sure to clean behind your ears - if not , potatoes will start growing there ! "
Taking a bath was on the most hated list of things to do , right up there with cleaning your room and going to bed early .
Mom knew this , as she spent years dragging you into the water and forcing that Johnson 's & Johnson 's baby shampoo all over your noggin .
When it was time to wash ourselves , the " potato ears " were just frightening enough to keep them squeaky clean .
Mom grew up with the potato threat to get her bum in the bath , and she passed it onto you to do the same .
And if we did n't wash behind our ears ?
Then you probably smelled funny and were made fun of a lot , but there were never any potatoes .
6 . " If you swallow a watermelon seed , if will grow inside your stomach ! "
Kids love watermelon , meticulously picking out the seeds as they ate the favorite summertime treat .
Everyone remembers the time that one got through - what did we do ?
We ran to mom to tell her what happened and that we were scared of the watermelon that would eventually grow inside of us .
Luckily , mother 's warning was merely a way for us to make sure we did n't choke on any of the seeds , as little ones tend to do from time to time .
Other small complications could arise from swallowing seeds , such as one being lodged in the appendix or damaging an intestine , but these would just be rare occasions .
One note of caution though :
Be sure you never swallow a fir seed !
7 . " Do n't swallow that gum - it will stay in your stomach for seven years ! "
When it came time for us to be allowed to chew gum , mother only did so with the strict knowledge that swallowing that gum would hurt our little tummies for years to come .
Then came the day when you simply forgot about the Juicy Juice that you were chomping down on one minute and before you know it , down the hatch it went .
Wrong again mom !
Accidentally swallowing gum every once and awhile is not going to turn your stomach into Bubble - Yum .
Gum is made up of two major components , sugar and a type of plastic .
Your body breaks down the sugars and the plastic gum ends up in your stool .
There 's really no way gum can " get stuck " inside your belly .
8 . " You 're too young to start drinking coffee - it will stunt your growth . "
When you are a kid , the notion of being grown up seems so cool , which just proves how innocence and stupidity go hand and hand .
Every parent started their day off with a nice fresh cup of joe .
As you wanted something that made you feel more grown up , mom was there to mention coffee would stunt your growth .
Back to coco we went , because being short was like being a kid forever !
Coffee has never been responsible for stunting anyone 's growth .
The reason behind the lie used by parents is to deter their teenagers from drinking coffee because of it's other side effects .
Caffeine is the most addictive drug in the world , and mom knows that .
Having a lot can create anxious teens with too much energy .
9 . " Eating your carrots will improve your eyesight enough to see in the dark . "
The white lies that mom threw at us were to make sure we stayed safe .
Now carrots , on the other hand , were something that she encouraged us to eat - because , eating them would make our eyesight better .
Already we had come to terms with going blind from sitting too close to the TV , so if there was a way to reverse its affects by eating carrots , then we were all over it .
The reality of carrot intake actually improving our eyesight to the levels of being able to see in the dark are ridiculous .
The myth probably started when one mother found out that Vitamin A is one needed to maintain healthy eyesight , with carrots of course being rich in the vitamin .
Of course , no amount of carrots could be eaten to actually improve our vision .
10 . " Stop playing with that toad - you 'll just get warts on your hand ! "
While we had a dog or cat growing up , what was even cooler was getting to play with animals that you did n't see on a regular basis .
And when it came to animals in the backyard , finding a frog or toad jumping around was a rare occasion , resulting in chasing it down and giving it the mason jar treatment .
Until we learned about the warts .
No , mom , you can't get warts from playing with a toad .
Warts , in fact , are very similar to colds - they are caused from a virus that infects the underlying layers of skin and are passed from one person to another via direct contact .
The myth that the toad is responsible probably arises from the wart - like growths that toads have to camouflage them in their environment .
Another reason has to do with people who are allergic to certain types of toads , and have developed wart - like rashes .
11 . " Wait an hour after eating before getting into the pool or you 'll get cramps and drown ! "
Splashing around in the pool was all day affair .
Once the hot dogs and hamburgers were gone , it was back to the pool for any unfinished water business .
Then mom warned that if we jumped in the water too soon , it might be our last time .
All of a sudden that pool of refreshing water turned into a pool of fire .
During digestion of food , more blood is sent to help in the process , with less left around to tend to our muscles .
It is possible to get a cramp if you 're using those muscles more than your body can handle .
Drowning because of cramp is just another of mother 's exaggerations .
12 . " If you keep making that face , it might stay that way forever ! "
One if the earliest forms of making fun of your classmates was using your facial expressions .
Flashing a tongue , crossing our eyes , pushing our nose up - all of these things either made some unsuspecting friend cry to mommy .
That is , until mom caught on and let us know that those crazy faces could end up becoming permanent .
Mom completely lied when she told you that your face could freeze just because you were sticking your tongue out at others .
Usually a child with complications or loss of control of facial muscles has these symptoms from conditions they are born with , sadly .
Other diseases , such as Parkinson and Huntington 's disease can affect these muscles , but are not developed until later in life .
13 . " You 're going to poke someone 's eye out with that ! "
Growing up , whatever resembled a lightsaber from Star Wars probably at some point got used as a weapon .
Whether it was a toy , a broom handle , or even the cardboard from a roll of wrapping paper , Mom would always warn us about " poking someone 's eye out " which either scared us enough to stop or made us swing even harder .
Playing with toy swords and brooms could result in a number of injuries , but probably would n't result in the " poking " of one 's eye out .
It is possible that the eye could be severely damaged in the process , but an eyeball flying out of the socket is not going to happen without pulling it out with your fingers .
14 . " Eating too many spicy foods will give you ulcers . "
Teenage boys tend to enjoy spicier foods .
You have young men everywhere seeking out the spiciest things around in the hopes that they can brave the heat to sit at the table with the " big boys " like Dad and Uncle Ron .
" Bring on the wings , the salsa , the jalapeno " , you say .
And mom chimes back with , " and " do n't forget the ulcers ! "
Eating spicy food does not have anything to do with causing ulcers .
The work conducted by Australians Robert Warren and Barry Marshall ended up in the awarding of the Nobel Prize , who concluded that stomach ulcers are actually developed by a strand of bacteria known as helicobacter pylori .
15 . " Get down from there - you 're going to fall and crack your head open ! "
Thanks to all the comic books that were read as a child , it 's no shocker that many a young gal or lad were caught climbing trees like Spiderman .
Mom of course shouted for you to come down before you " cracked your head open " .
The mere thought of your head spilling out its insides like Humpty Dumpty sealed the deal .
It 's probable you could obtain hundred other possible head injuries ; everything from a minor concussion to traumatic brain damage could have occurred .
However , other than landing on a well placed axe , your chances of breaking your skull open were small .
16 . " If you keep playing with it , it will fall off someday . "
Out of all the lies that mom mentioned to us over the years , perhaps none was taken more seriously by adolescent boys then the possibility of it it " falling off " .
How dare mother get involved in the first place - she did n't have one , so how could she know for sure ?
Then the epiphany kicked in - of course , that 's why she did n't have one !
She knows because it happened to her !
The most frightening mom myth turned out to be the biggest lie of them all !
Of course mom had to do something about the situation - her little boy was finally growing up to be man , something every mother has to deal with at some point .
However , health professionals will tell you that , no mater how much you " play " with it , it 's never going to fall off !

Three Things I Love About Git
git-commit -- amend
One of the benefits of using version control is organization .
When you commit a set of changes , you are implicitly marking that set as defining a certain feature set , or otherwise having something in common .
Have you ever committed something , then realized you forgot to include something with it ?
Maybe it's a new file , or maybe it's an extra small change you forgot to make .
Enter git - commit -- amend .
The amend option adds to the tip of the current branch , and actually replaces the last commit with the combined change !
It even seeds the message editor with the last commit 's description , so you do n't have to type it in again .
git -checkout -b
I often like to work in branches , even if what I 'm implementing is not large enough to make a branch - commits - merge cycle really necessary .
I find that making frequent small commits , without needing to think about whether the product is fully stable each commit , helps me focus and develop more quickly and cleanly .
In most VCSs , branching is something that takes a bit of effort , and for maximum ease , you want to plan it ahead of time .
Sometimes I start developing , and suddenly decide what I 'm working on is going to be big enough that I want to use a branch .
I 'm now forced to decide whether I want to make the effort to " backport " the work done so far .
With git - checkout - b , it becomes a very easy decision .
This command says " create a new branch , based off the last commit , and transfer my working copy to this branch in - place , so I can commit to the branch as I please . "
I just execute git- checkout -b new_branch_name and keep going , with no interruption to my train of thought or work flow .
( Bonus : merging is relatively painless in git , especially compared to most centralized version control systems .
Which just makes the ease of branching even more valuable . )
Fine - grained commits
Like I mentioned , one valuable benefit of using version control is organization : by making intelligent commits , code content diffs are automatically organized by feature set .
Sometimes , when I 'm ready to commit , I have changes I want to include mixed in with some I do not .
Or , I decide it would make more sense to split the current set of changes across several commits .
An example from this week : I was editing a Makefile , and realized it contained three sets of changes that really had nothing to do with each other .
Had the make file been split up into several physical files , perhaps it would have been trivial to put into separate commits , but it in reality it was just one physical file .
Most VC tools I know of can resolve commit changes only down to the individual file level - they do n't get fine grained enough that you can tell them , " commit this part of this file , and that part of that file , but not these other parts " .
You can always hack around it , by manually editing and reverting , etc .
But that 's often not easy nor quick .
But lo !
I have a friend in git - commit -- interactive .
This starts up a shell that allows you to selectively add individual changes , what git calls " hunks " , to the staging area for committing .
In this case , the Makefile had three of these hunks .
You can split up any hunk into smaller hunks , if you want to control what you 're committing with even finer granularity .
You can review the change set as you build it , adding , deleting or refining changes as you like .
When satisfied , I exit , and the change set is automatically committed .
That 's for the simple case of one file .
It can be an even more powerful tool with a larger change set .
I 'm bored today so I decided to update my programming rules , make a 2.2 if you will , I know the smart ones out there never trust a 1.0 anyways ...
My Rules ( 2.2 ) :
1. Kludges that we 'll fix in the next release never get fixed in the next release ...
2 . If you do n’t do it right now , you ( or some poor bastard that replaces you ) will have to do it right later ...
3 . It always costs more to do it later ...
4 . You 're not going to have more funding for the next release .
( thanks Decius ) 5 . Beware of anyone in a suit ...
6 . The man in charge usually did n't get there by being better than everyone else ; keep that in mind .
7 . If you do n't talk to your customers to see what will make them happy , then sooner or later someone else will ...
8 . Sales guys can be powerful allies for interoffice BS , but if you make yourself too available they will never leave you alone ...
9 . Management has no idea what the customer wants ... 10 . Engineering has even less idea what the customer wants ...
11 . Assume every engineer you work with is an idiot , try not to let on that you know ... if you find engineers that are obviously not idiots , find a way to keep them ...
12 . Never outsource your core competency ...
13 . Laziness and incompetence are contagious ...
14 . No - one cares if you read Wikipedia all day every day if you get your work done on time ...
15 .
If they do care , find another place to work ...
16 .
Your code is not finished until you 've tested it ... 17 .
Never assume they have tested their code ... 18 . Simple regression testing is best done when it ’s automated ; it ’s less error prone too .
19 .
Engineers that think lack of documentation is job security should be fired sooner rather than later ( otherwise you 'll make them right ) ... 20 .
Contrary to popular belief , third party libraries reduce portability of your code ... 21 . " Cool " is not a business case ...
22 . Engineering ’s job is to say yes , no matter how stupid management 's requests are ... good engineers find ways to say yes that spotlight their intelligence and managements stupidity ...( e.g. if they ask you to turn lead into gold , tell them you will if they allocate a few trillion dollars and a fusion reactor ) ...
23 .
The night before its due is probably not the best time to start integrating your code in a large project ...
24 .
You can be really good at your job , and a dick , or you can be so so at your job and a really nice guy ... you can not be a dick and bad at your job ...
25 .
Time estimation is really hard ... it will take longer than you think it will ...
26 .
Demonstrating that your competitors suck is n't enough to get anyone to buy your product ...
27 .
Do n't ship anything you 're not proud of ... 28 .
Your code will be used in ways you never thought of ... plan accordingly ... 29 .
If you can't settle on one way of doing something , do it both ways and make it a configurable option ... 30 .
Do n't ever have arbitrary limitations , or if you do , hide them better ( e.g. " max users 256 " ...hmmmm ? ) ... 31 . Strive to make a really good 1.0 , then move on to other , more fun projects ... you 'll still get all the glory for that first project , but you wo n't have to do the work anymore ...
32 .
In general , meetings are the opposite of getting things done ... 33 .
An engineering manager 's job is to keep his engineers sheltered from politics or any other " real world " consideration , so all they have to think about is coding ... 34 .
Do n't ever let your company make you do something you would not be proud of ; you may have to work with them now , but you 'll have to live with yourself and your reputation for the rest of your life .
35 .
If your company makes a habit of asking you to do something you 're not proud of , find a new job .
36 .
If its been done before its boring ... 37 .
Keep your code for work very separate from your code for play ... 38 .
Anyone that repeatedly declares things impossible should find their way to your kill file ... 39 .
Writing drivers for open source kernels that keep changing their internal APIs like some sick game of musical chairs ( read as Linux ) should be avoided at all cost ... 40 .
Be careful how you mix your licenses .
Using GPL 'ed code everywhere might speed up your startup 's time to market , but it could all be for nothing if your code ends up being forced into becoming GPL .
41 .
Never commit to anything in emails that you 're not actually committing to , if you must commit to it over the phone or in person with no witnesses ... otherwise learn phrases like " I 'll look into that " or " we 'll see what we can do " ...
42 . Do n't work any harder than you will be rewarded for ... 43 .
Only listen to the boss that can fire you , the others are just useful for stopping bucks before they hit you ...
44 . " Working from home " does n't count against vacation time ...
45 . Coupling == inevitable nasty rewrite ... 46 .
Try to design things so that likely coding mistakes can't happen ( e.g. do n't make the length field in a TLV include the size of the TLV header , or some jackass will not account for invalid lengths ) ... 47 .
Chances are your customers are not as dumb as you think they are ... 48 .
If you force developers to be more accountable for the bugs they cause , then the bad programmers will spend more time fixing bugs , and less time adding more bad code to the project ... 49 .
Odds are ( java|soap|xml|other wiz-bang thingy ) wo n't be as revolutionary as you think it will be ... C is still alive and well and not going anywhere ... so is COBOL for that matter ... 50 .
In general , " revolutionary " products , are n’t ... 51 . If it can be made non-interoperable , it will be ( e.g. IPSEC ) .
52 . RFC's are just a jumping off point to start negotiations ; protocols are almost always implemented differently .
53 .
Do n't trust any RFC with updates on April 1st ( e.g. IPSEC ... jerks ) ... 54 . IEEE specs are worse than RFCs ... 55 . ITU specs are worse than IEEE specs ...
56 . Stop using ASN.1 its more trouble than its worth ...
57 . Comment your code as if you were going to have to pick it up and use it again in 15 years ... 58 .
If you get bored , make your engineers swap code with each other ... either you 'll get better code out of them , or they 'll kill each other ... either way it should be fun to watch ... 59 .
If you 're made responsible for something ( like security ) but you are not empowered to make sure it happens , then your real job is to be the person blamed when something goes wrong .
60 .
No - one notices when you come in early , management always notices when you stay late .
61 . If you 're supposed to be in the office at 10 am and you 're going to be late , come in at noon and bring lunch .
Everyone will assume you 've been there all along and you 're just coming back from lunch .
You 'll get a better parking space too .
62 . Open source code is filled with bugs .
63 . Closed source code is even more filled with bugs .
64 . It does n't matter how secure your product is if no - one is willing to use it .
65 . 1.0 rhymes with " oh no ! " 66 .
Any time you use open source code in a project , be prepared to maintain your own branch of that code .
You never know when the developers will get bored and leave you hanging .
67 . Writing a technical book is way more work than you probably think it is .
68 . From time to time every rule must be broken ( even some of these ) ; one of the tests of a good engineer is knowing when those times are .
What do I mean when I say " do it right " ? :
Before I get the replies on this I want to clear something up about what I mean when I talk about doing something the " right " way .
It ’s important to distinguish doing something right , and doing something ideal .
Often there is not enough time to implement the ideal solution , there is always time to implement a right solution .
So what do I mean when I say do it right ?
Its the difference between a release with all the features you could ever want , all done the way you want , and shipping a release without all the features you want , but none of the code there is going to be a major road block for the next release , and its not going to impose an unreasonable burden on the user .
Doing something right in this game is mostly a matter of process and learning how to avoid problems before they happen and it usually does n't add any extra time to the schedule .
That sounds like something that you should expect from any software release , but getting things done the right way is nearly impossible in many software houses .

THE novelties of race and gender have largely distracted the nation from the more profound aspect of the 2008 presidential election :
This campaign presents the potential for a new cycle of American history .
The idea that American politics moves in cycles is usually associated with the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , but it has an even longer currency .
Ralph Waldo Emerson noted the political oscillations between the party of memory and the party of hope , the party of conservatism and the party of innovation .
Henry Adams believed that “ a period of about 12 years measured the beat of the pendulum ” during the era of the founders .
Schlesinger , borrowing from his historian father , estimated that the swings between eras of public action and those of private interest were nearer to 30 years .
What matters more than the length of the cycles is that these swings , between what Schlesinger called periods of reform and periods of consolidation , clearly occur .
If we somewhat arbitrarily fix the age of Franklin D. Roosevelt as 1932 to 1968 and the era of Ronald Reagan as 1968 to 2008 , a new cycle of American political history  a cycle of reform  is due .
The Republican coalition  composed of the religious right on social issues , the radical tax cutters or “ supply - siders ” on economic issues , and the neoconservatives on foreign policy  has produced only superficial religiosity , a failed war and record deficits .
Traditional conservatives , who are dedicated to resistance to government intrusion into private lives , fiscal discipline and caution on military interventions , have yet to re-emerge , and may not .
The character of the next Republican Party will result from an intraparty debate that has yet to begin and might occupy a decade or more .
Last week we wrapped up production on Secret Agent Clank for North America , and this week we ’ve been working to complete the game for the rest of the world .
That being said , things are moving to completion quickly and fans should be seeing the game soon .
One of the coolest things about Secret Agent Clank is that not only do you get to play Clank in a starring role , but that you also get your Ratchet fun in with the prison arena challenges , some quick thinking Gadgebot puzzles , and even a chance to suit up with the big guy and have Qwark pummel a few bosses into submission .
High Impact Games has done a fantastic job in keeping the fun that is Ratchet & Clank , but taking the game in a new direction .
We hope you ’ll agree that the team really outdid themselves in taking all that is cool about spy technology , exciting chase scenes , and even a bit of stealth gameplay and wrapped it up into the thrill - ride that is Secret Agent Clank .
The funny thing is , I ’ve only listed some of the great moments from the game , and there ’s way more to come …
While most of the High Impact team are finally getting a chance to take a breather , we thought we ’d clue you in on an exciting promotion we ’re doing with GameStop .
Basically , head over to the nearest GameStop and pre-order the game to get your Secret Agent Clank figurine ( while supplies last – yes , I was told to say that )
If you guys ca n’t possibly wait until the game hits the shelves , you can download the free ( yes , I said FREE ) Secret Agent Clank demo that High Impact put together that showcases some of the Clank gameplay directly from the PLAYSTATION Store .
While you ’re there , you might as well grab the free PSP theme they made !
If you happen to be the person that was sitting next to me on the plane this morning , yes , this is where I got it . ;)
“ This looks like random incompetence mostly , ” said Lawrence Jacobs , a political scientist at the University of Minnesota .
“ But Franken has taken a pounding , getting tattooed by story after story , which is preventing him from making this a referendum on the incumbent . ”
In March , Mr. Brodkorb reported that Mr. Franken ’s corporation , Alan Franken Inc. , owed a penalty of $ 25,000 to the state compensation board in New York for failing to carry workers ’ compensation insurance from 2002 to 2005 .
State officials said they sent Mr. Franken 12 letters on the matter , but received no answer .
Mr. Franken , who has since paid the debt , declined an interview on the issue .
Andy Barr , a spokesman for the campaign , said Mr. Franken had not known of the oversight by the corporation ( which consisted of Mr. Franken , his wife , Franni , and an assistant or two ) , and received none of the letters .
The state ’s letters were sent to the Frankens ’
New York apartment , officials there say ; the couple moved to Minnesota at the end of 2005 , though the family still owns the apartment .
In April , Mr. Brodkorb wrote that Mr. Franken ’s company was in forfeiture in California .
Other reporters found the reason : California authorities said Mr. Franken ’s company had failed to pay franchise tax fees from 2003 to 2006 , and owed nearly $ 5,000 , which Mr. Franken has since paid .
Mr. Franken ’s company paid no franchise taxes to the state in those years , Mr. Barr said , because Mr. Franken believed his accounting firm had shut down the corporation after 2002 .
The reports led Mr. Franken to hire a new team of financial advisers to review his finances .
Late last month , Mr. Franken announced the findings : although he had paid state income tax on his earnings , his accountant had , in some cases , paid it to the wrong states .
Like professional athletes , entertainers are , in some instances , required to pay taxes to states where they earn money .
He had paid more than $ 917,000 in state taxes to New York and Minnesota from 2003 to 2006 , but should have sent parts of that sum ( the total would actually have been about $ 4,000 higher ) to 17 other states where he performed .
Mr. Franken ’s supporters , and several Democratic - leaning blogs , have dismissed the problems as meaningless , an accountant ’s bureaucratic errors .

“ We ’re in two wars and a recession , ” Mr. Barr said .
“ This is not the time to try to have an election about something else . ”
In national elections , Republican candidates count on a big money advantage over Democrats .
Not this year .
Fund - raising by Republicans is down sharply from past election cycles .
But the Republican National Committee is quietly banking millions more than its Democratic counterpart , hoping to amass $ 120 million to fund an RNC campaign on behalf of John McCain and help offset Barack Obama 's vaunted money - spinning machine .
Democrats expect the rival party to run a more aggressive anti-Obama ad campaign than the McCain campaign would , but Robert M. " Mike " Duncan , the chairman of the RNC , told the Globe last week that the party intends to abide by McCain 's desire for " a respectful campaign . "
The RNC is the GOP 's only bright spot these days in the money race , holding a $ 26 million cash - on - hand advantage over the Democratic National Committee in most recent reports .
The party 's House and Senate campaign arms are being trounced by their Democratic counterparts , and McCain , the party 's presumptive presidential nominee , has struggled , raising less than one - third as much money as Obama , his likely Democratic opponent in November .
By most indicators , the Republican Party is in trouble , saddled with an unpopular president leading an unpopular war and a government chalking up huge budget deficits during an economic slowdown .
The outlook darkened greatly after the GOP 's stunning loss of another special congressional election last week , the third time in two months that a " safe " Republican seat flipped to the Democrats .
Waiting in the wings , meanwhile , are outside advocacy groups , many with Democratic sympathies , that will spend a combined hundreds of millions of dollars before the campaign is over .
In the face of these challenges , the RNC is stockpiling funds to help McCain and has been jointly raising funds with the Arizona senator for the past month .
A recent event in New York City took in $ 7 million .
An updated finance report to be filed this week will reflect April as " the best month we 've had , " Duncan said in the interview .
In the first four months of the year , the party collected contributions from " around 700,000 donors , " he said .
The RNC , which , on average , raised $ 108 million more than the Democratic National Committee in the four previous election cycles , is unlikely to achieve that dominance this year , but it hopes to build on its current advantage over the DNC .
Mindful of the fund - raising gap , Howard Dean , the chairman of the DNC , decided not to wait until the Democratic race is settled and announced Wednesday that the party had reached a joint fund - raising agreement with Obama and Hillary Clinton .
The agreement , similar to one used by McCain and the RNC , will allow major donors to write a single check for up to $ 33,100 - with $ 28,500 going to the party , and $ 2,300 each to the candidates ' primary and general election funds .
" Once the DNC and the nominee are seen as one in the same , our fund - raising will take off , " said Stacie Paxton , a spokeswoman for the DNC , predicting Democrats will erase the GOP 's lead .
Still unresolved is the issue of public funding in the general election , the period after both candidates are formally nominated at their parties ' conventions .
Even if a candidate agrees to take $ 84.1 million in federal funds and limit spending to that amount , there would still be plenty of money available through the parties and outside advocacy groups .
By law , each party may spend no more than $ 19 million in coordinated expenditures with the candidates ' campaigns .
But the parties may also expend unlimited funds on " independent expenditures " and so - called hybrid advertising that mentions the candidate with generic references to the party .
In the 2004 cycle , those expenditures exploded , with the DNC spending $ 120 million on independent expenditures , mostly negative advertising aimed at President Bush , and $ 24 million on hybrid ads , according to the Federal Election Commission .
The RNC , which initiated the hybrid or generic ads , spent $ 18.2 million on independent expenditures and $ 45.8 million on hybrids in 2004 .
Frequently , independent party expenditures are used to run negative advertising that frees the candidates they are helping from responsibility .
But Duncan , the RNC chairman , said , " Senator McCain and I talked about running a respectful campaign , and we 've certainly done that and are following his lead .
. . .
The American people deserve to have this election framed in terms of the big issues of the day . "
Asked whether the RNC will respond in kind if the Democrats run negative ads , he said , " It 's not my intent to get into that .
Hope springs eternal .
We want to run a respectful campaign . "
What worries Republicans most is the demonstrated ability of the Democrats to generate enormous sums , much of it via the Internet at virtually no expense .
Through the most recent reporting period , Obama 's campaign had raised almost $ 235 million and Clinton 's $ 176 million , compared with McCain 's $ 75 million .
At the congressional level , the Republicans ' challenges are daunting .
The National Republican Congressional Committee , outspent by its Democratic counterpart , is all but tapped out after the string of recent defeats , all in conservative districts .
Prospects are not much brighter in November when its rival , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , hopes to target up to 75 House seats , including many of the 26 being vacated by Republicans at the end of this term .
In the recent special elections to fill congressional seats in Illinois , Louisiana , and Mississippi , the DCCC outspent the NRCC about $ 4 million to $ 3 million , and had a $ 37 million advantage in cash on hand through the most recent reporting period .
That is a sharp reversal from the four previous election cycles , when the GOP congressional committee outraised the DCCC by an average of $ 70 million per cycle .
The ingredients I like to put in my superpower collapse soup are : a severe and chronic shortage in the production of crude oil ( the magic elixir of industrial economies ) , a severe and worsening trade deficit , a runaway military budget and ballooning foreign debt .
The heat and agitation can be provided most efficaciously by a humiliating military defeat and widespread fear of a looming catastrophe .
In this book , Dmitry gives his view of what may be on the other side , and how one might prepare for it .
Dmitry starts with a recipe for collapse of a modern military - industrial power :
Dmitry Orlov 's new book , Reinventing Collapse : The Soviet Example and American Prospects , was published very recently .
I pre-ordered a copy because Dmitry has had first hand experience with the collapse of the Soviet Union , and he believes , as I do , that economic collapse is likely to come first , if a society is on an unsustainable course .
The great mystery to me is what lies on the other side of an economic collapse .
He then goes on to explain how the Soviet Union followed this recipe in the late 1980s , leading to its collapse , and how the United States , with its conflict in Iraq , may be following a similar course .
Many readers are familiar with Dmitry 's talk , Closing the ' Collapse Gap ' : the USSR was Better Prepared for Collapse than the US .
In that talk , as in the book " Reinventing Collapse " , he points out that the USSR provided housing , transportation , fuel , and garden plots for Soviet citizens , so when financial collapse came , citizens could still get along fairly well .
The United States lacks this safety network , so financial collapse is likely to be more of a problem here .
The kinds of things Dmitry expects after financial collapse are shortages of fuel , food , medicine and consumer items ; outages of electricity , natural gas and water ; transportation breakdowns ; hyperinflation ; widespread layoffs , plus a lot of despair , confusion , violence and lawlessness .
According to him , we should not expect " any grand rescue plans , innovative technology programs , or miracles of social cohesion " .
The political establishment is likely to remain intact , at least initially , and will attempt to keep up appearances .
There will be paralysis due to the government 's inability to spend money in the usual way .
There will be less respect for authority , and many laws will be ignored .
There is likely to be a flood of internal refugees , as places that require heat or air conditioning become uninhabitable .
In this setting , Dmitry expects a new informal economy to emerge -- one that is based more on barter , and is often semi-criminal .
One of the biggest sources of revenue initially will be dismantling and reselling parts of what are now stranded assets -- homes that cannot longer be used , airplanes that are no longer needed , and even equipment used in some factories .
Dmitry has some thoughts on how one survives and even thrives in this new setting .
He mentions the possibility of a new political party , the " Collapse Party " .
If it is clear collapse is inevitable and the current political parties have nothing to offer , the logical thing would be to have a Collapse Party , to dismantle institutions that have no future and to save what can be saved .
He does n't think such a party is likely to succeed , however .
If it is not really possible to mitigate , he believes that what one must do is adapt -- psychologically as much as any other way .
In the new order , relationships with other people will become more important , and relationships based on deeds , contracts , notes , and the like will recede in importance .
We will need to lower our standards as to what is acceptable in many areas , including body odor , straight teeth , and medical care .
Dmitry has several creative suggestions for occupations .
Dmitry suggests that some may choose to be nomadic , since there are advantages to having multiple bases of operation .
I very much enjoyed the book .
Dmitry describes his book as a " series of intentionally provocative thought experiments " .
None of us can know what is ahead , but Dmitry offers us some helpful insights .
Dmitry has a wonderful sense of humor , so we find ourselves laughing rather than crying about the future .
Fortunately there are legislators and candidates for office that do understand both the problems and the complexity in finding answers where options are not immediately responsive or popular .
For the rest it often becomes easier to try and unify a constituency by invoking an enemy – someone who can , by their actions , be blamed for constituents ’ problems .
Sadly the world ’s history has been filled with stories of such scapegoats , as an easy way of switching attention .
Today it is possible that as oil prices rise , both OPEC and Saudi Arabia may become the villain in articles and political slogans .
Given the possible outcomes of such positioning , it is perhaps not surprising that , as another American election swings into the beginning of the end game , that oil suppliers , perhaps sensing this , are indicating the chance of a greater flexibility in supply .
One wonders , sometimes , why folk would want to get into political office these days , given the pervasive problems starting to arise from the end of cheap and easy to produce oil and natural gas .
The rising costs of providing fuel for everything from school buses to emergency responders eats away at one end of a budget .
The demands for wage increases to help employees cope with rising fuel and food prices nibbles away both at another part of the budget , but also at public and labor relations .
And then there is the cost to repair and maintain the existing infrastructure , let alone make provision for future alternate choices for power and transportation .
Sectors of the population , such as truckers , are becoming less shy in complaining about their problems , as unemployment bites into their numbers .
Asian refiners want increased supplies of the lighter grades of crude to produce more expensive cleaner - burning fuels while Saudi Arabia is offering more of the heavy , high - sulphur grades .
. . . .
Saudi Aramco is understood to have only more of the heavier grades at its disposal .
Categorizing the response of Saudi Arabia and OPEC to market pressures is not an easy undertaking , and has been the subject of considerable debate here and elsewhere .
To begin there are the different grades of crude that are available .
And while the initial impression of the latest Saudi offer is that this will be sweet , light crude ( i.e. easy to refine ) that has been the historic quality Saudi product , this is not necessarily the case .
Bear in mind that the Kingdom also produces a heavier crude , that is frequently sour ( i.e. having a high sulfur content ) and this has not been easy to market .
Iran ’s state - owned National Iranian Oil Co has been unable to offload about 25 mn barrels of crude stored in tankers in the Arabian Gulf , mostly of heavy sour Soroosh and Norooz , despite steep OSP cuts .
The question therefore that needs to be resolved is as to whether the Saudi ’s are going to make more of the lighter oil available ( which is suggested by the reference to the new production from Khursaniyah which is Arabian light . )
The problem is compounded by reducing levels of production from existing fields , which , in large measure , have been also the lighter crudes , and which decline must be made up either by increased production from within those fields , or by adding new production from fields such as Khursaniyah , if the overall mix that is offered for sale is not to start to swing heavily towards the heavier and sourer crudes that are less popular in the marketplace .
We have been fortunate here at TOD to have had quite detailed analyses from folks such as Euan Mearns , Stuart Staniford , Khebab , Ace and JoulesBurn , to name but a few .
Much of the recent discussion has been focused on the state of Saudi reserves , rather than the amount that can be produced at one time ( the size of the tap ) .
Yet it is in the short term size of that tap that allows the potential increase in Saudi production , and a possible consequent drop in the price of oil ( Not that such a drop is a certainty ) .
Back when Matt Simmons debated Mahmoud Baqi and Nansen Saleri of Aramco at CSIS in 2004 , one of the solutions that Aramco put forward was the increasing use that they were making of horizontal wells , particularly in new fields , and also of the introduction of the Maximum Reservoir Contact ( MRC ) wells where the initial horizontal well is supplemented by secondary laterals that are offshoots from the main initial drive .
Further , with the introduction of down - hole valves that allowed segments of the well to be closed down , while segments on either side continued to produce , as a way of overcoming localized water breakthrough , smart wells were developed that would allow production to continue from wells that historically would have closed .
In 2004 , however , this was a technique that was being widely used in new fields , but not yet used exclusively in older ones .
The difference is fairly significant , since a horizontal well can produce thousands of barrels a day , over the hundreds that can come from a vertical well in the same place .
( The reason is that the length of the well in the productive rock that holds the oil controls how much oil can flow into a well at a given time , and the horizontal wells can run kilometers through oil - bearing rock , while vertical wells rarely run even a hundred meters . )
The consequence of change from one to the other is therefore the equivalent of opening a larger tap into the field , and one of the issues that we have debated at this site has been the limitation on tap size that goes along with the other debate we have on the absolute size of the resources .
Leaving aside that latter debate at the moment , I would suggest that , in the short term the increasing use of horizontal and MRC wells in the older fields will give some little leeway to Aramco to potentially reduce the drop in production by changing to the MRC wells ( Saleri quoted a gain from 3,000 bd to 10,000 bd with the change from horizontal to Maximum Reservoir Contact , since in the latter case the use of a number of side horizontals or laterals running out from the main horizontal well , can increase the exposure of the well to the rock to more than 12 kilometers ) .
The first horizontal wells were drilled in 1991 in the KSA , and .
by 1993 there had been a total of 21 completed .
It was then anticipated that horizontal drilling would take half the Aramco drilling budget for the next ten years .
( But it should also be noted , as was commented in the post on shales , that such wells can cost ten times the price of a conventional vertical well – and Aramco were not drilling that many new wells a year ( only around a couple of hundred – almost sounds like a puzzle from Car Talk ! )
When the debate over Saudi production began , probably with the CSIS presentations , there may have been a tendency to over estimate the relative number of these wells .
Horizontal wells installed in new field developments , such as Shaybah , Harradh III and Kursiniyah and integrated into sophisticated water flooding programs , were needed to obtain the high individual well production numbers that the program called for in these new areas .
At the same time these wells minimized the problems of water cut in the oil produced .
There was , however , perhaps too much of an assumption that this also applied to the existing production from existing fields and that they too had switched to the same technology .
This is not likely to have been true however .
As demand rose , and existing well production declined , Saudi Arabia realized that it could no longer get by with the 30 – 40 rigs that it had , historically , been using .
It was willing to competitively invest so as to get the number of rigs , for both exploration and development , up to about 120 .
Now initially not all of these would drill horizontal wells , in fact for some purposes such wells are both unnecessary and not desired ( water injection for example ) .
And in the historic plan for in - field development the initial means for holding production declines to target levels had called for vertical wells .
What I would like to suggest is that as production demands have continued to rise , so what we are now seeing is a greater switch from vertical wells in the old fields to the use of horizontal ones .
As the switch is made one can anticipate not only that individual well production rates will , at least initially , substantially increase over vertical , particularly as Aramco learn to drill longer wells .
One should also expect that the water cut in the older fields should also decline somewhat as the overall percentage of vertical wells declined , and horizontal becomes paramount in all fields .
Changing from vertical dominant to horizontal well dominance in older fields has short term benefits – a gain in the amount of oil that can be recovered from a given number of wells in a shorter time interval , and a longer term down - side in that declines ( as we have seen in the North Sea , Oman and other places where horizontal wells now have become common ) which come earlier and at faster rates .
My concern therefore , as Saudi now has made a sufficient number of well changes to give the greater percentage of horizontal wells in the their historic fields , that it will meet the short - term need for higher production , but that this will , concurrently mean that when their production does peak , that the decline will be much faster than the 4 - 5 % that folk now talk of , and instead will exceed 10 % .
It has been some time , for example , since Aramco admitted that their decline rate from existing wells was at a level of around 800,000 bd / year , and increasing the size of the tap will have an impact on that value also – making the target production increase each year increasingly higher ( and thereby more difficult to attain ) .
Thus I worry a little that should there now be an acceleration in the production from the older fields that this will in turn shorten their productive lives and steepen the decline curve later - but then that gets me into a discussion on reserves and resources and that is the other debate we have .
I fear the day when someone would sit me down in a comfortable armchair at the air - conditioned auditorium in Tel Aviv , serve me coffee and cream cake and put me through a series of tortures :
First he would make me watch a selection of movies documenting the events in the territories over the past 40 years .
Next , he would force me to read out loud a series of articles published every day in the newspapers depicting the way the principles of justice and Jewish morals are implemented throughout Judea and Samaria .
Finally , he would present in sound and video a selection of highly confidential files containing facts that had been concealed from my knowledge .
There are many people in this country who viewed the occupation in horror while serving in the territories during their standing or reserve army duties .
For some , the occupation scraped their conscience .
From those troops emerged the voice calling for refusal to serve in the Territories .
Thanks to them , the majority of the population has internalized the idea that ruling over another people until the end of time does not garner respect and security for Israel .
Their experiences led to the recognition that the occupation is a strategic burden .
Ostensibly , military service in the Territories is expensive and wasteful .
It 's harmful for an army to perform policing duties .
The reserve units should be training for the next war and not chasing stone - throwers in the Shuafat village .
Indeed , recently the committee headed by David Brodet recommended reforms in the defense budget whereby the call - up of reserve units for assignments in the Territories would be stopped completely .
The committee calculated and found that a single standing army regiment can do the work of 17 reserve regiments .
The committee proposed that the regiment be comprised of soldiers with a " lower " military profile .
Namely , it would suffice to have second - grade troops in the Occupation Corps and there 's no point in wasting the brilliant minds of the IDF 's elite combat units .
The Brodet committee is just another committee replete with economists trying to determine our way of life through the narrow prism of an introductory economics course .
If the committee 's recommendations are implemented , the pristine occupation would distance itself even further from our hearts than it is at the moment .
Once again economists are blind
The Brodet Committee 's financial rationale should in fact lead to a situation whereby the occupation will be policed by a professional army comprising veterans of the battles of Chechnya and the refugees of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA . )
The vision of economic efficiency would be realized , the state budget would be cut , our state of mind would improve - and our consciences would be even cleaner .
Once again the economists are blind to the pivotal point .
Reserve soldiers must continue to serve in the Territories so that they can serve as the crack through which we can see the little we see now .
Despite it not being " economically viable , " every citizen should be enlisted for one day every year to fulfill the functions of the occupation , each in accordance with his or her ability .
Let one stand at a checkpoint and let another be a clerk at the Interior Ministry in East Jerusalem .
Those who can should assist in arresting wanted persons in the middle of the night in a village near Nablus .
Those who are creative should build the separation fence .
Anyone could fire at those wretched people searching for metal in the rubble of evacuated Dugit in the Gaza Strip .
The youngsters from the Saturday - night brawls at the nightclubs should conduct stone - throwing battles with Palestinian children close to the roads .
The soft - hearted should guard detainees during Shin Bet interrogations .
All occupation assignments should be visible to us all and we should experience them from up close .
Let no one say he never saw the TV expos ? on the Territories because he was glued to A Star is Born ( the local version of American Idol . )
Let no one use the excuse he had not read the newspaper articles because he was transfixed on AB Yehoshua 's books .
Let no one say he did n't see the repression in Jerusalem because he has n't frequented East Jerusalem since laying tefillin at the Western Wall during his bar mitzvah .
When the day comes let no Israeli tell the Master of the Universe or his conscience : " I did n't know . "

Last week 's news about Apple 's use of SproutCore triggered a lot of discussion about the future of rich Internet applications , run-time environments , and JavaScript frameworks .
While SproutCore has been referred to as " Cocoa for the web , " its developer Charles Jolley says that the framework was " inspired by Cocoa , " not really a port of Cocoa .
But what if someone ported not just Cocoa , but also an Objective - C runtime that runs entirely in JavaScript via a browser ?
Well , the developers at 280 North did just that .
280 North formed earlier this year when three friends from USC got together to realize their dream of working together to develop software .
Francisco Tolmasky and Ross Boucher graduated from USC in 2006 and 2007 respectively , and both spent some time working at Apple ; Tolmasky on iPhone development and Boucher on back - end server technology for iTunes .
When Tom Robinson graduated in January of this year , the three formed 280 North to develop their first application , called 280 Slides .
280 Slides is a very impressive presentation app that looks and works very similar to Apple 's critically - acclaimed Keynote .
Anyone familiar with Keynote or the ubiquitous PowerPoint can easily create a well - designed presentation with nothing but a web browser .
Though Slides lacks some of the features of other web - based presentation apps , it tends to favor simplicity and elegance and is still highly serviceable for most needs .
The app also runs smoothly and seamlessly .
On Mac OS X , it 's easy to forget that it 's running in a browser and not directly on the desktop .
280 Slides is heavily inspired by Keynote , with a clean and simple interface .
" We actually started some of the technology behind 280 Slides while we were still students [ at USC ] , " said Boucher , who talked to Ars about the pair 's work in creating the 280 Slides .
" Actually , Francisco wrote Objective - J right before graduation , and then we sort of set the project aside until right about the time we left Apple . "
Objective - J is an implementation of message passing in JavaScript , complete with Smalltalk - style , square bracket syntax .
It 's a superset of JavaScript , in much the same way Objective - C is a superset of C , so developers can easily switch between Objective - J and Javascript syntax as needed .
Objective - J runs entirely on the client - side without the need of any server - side run-time or browser plug-ins .
" We built a client side preprocessor that takes in Objective - J and translates it into native JavaScript .
And we also built the Objective - J runtime to go along with it , so you get objj_msgSend ( ) , " Boucher said .
The JavaScript is then executed directly via the browser .
With this technology in place , the team then created a port of Cocoa , the frameworks included in Mac OS X that allow for relatively easy and rapid development of GUI applications .
They call their port Cappuccino .
" Cappuccino is a re-implementation of Cocoa in Objective - J , which means we reimplemented AppKit , Foundation , CoreGraphics , and parts of CoreAnimation , " Boucher told us .
With it , developers familiar with desktop GUI applications can create a rich , desktop - like web app with the same relative ease Cocoa programmers can create a rich desktop app .
" Coming from a background of desktop programming , and Cocoa in particular , we realized how much harder building a web application was .
So we wanted to try to make things just a little bit easier . "
Whereas SproutCore seeks to " embrace the platform " by giving a Cocoa - like development model for developers already using HTML , CSS , and JavaScript to make a web app , Cappuccino and Objective - J take an entirely different approach .
" Since Cappuccino runs entirely on the client , at run time , we 're never actually generating HTML or CSS , " says Boucher .
" When you build an application in Cappuccino , you do n't need to ever deal with HTML or CSS .
All of your interface is designed in Objective - J and Cappuccino .
Cappuccino focuses on application architecture more than anything else , like building applications that know how to save and open documents , or copy and paste .
We also built a powerful graphics engine into Cappuccino , so you can make rich applications like 280 Slides . "
The framework is designed from the ground up to essentially hide the implementation details from the developer .
" AppKit does generate DOM elements , but , in many ways , the DOM is just an implementation detail for us .
If tomorrow every browser implemented SVG , and we thought Cappuccino should really run on SVG , we could rip out the guts and replace some of the code in AppKit and suddenly every app on top of Cappuccino would be running on top of SVG , " Boucher said .
Cappuccino - based apps run in Safari , Internet Explorer , Opera , and Mozilla - based browsers like Firefox .
And by nature of running in the browser , the apps are compatible with Mac , Windows , or Linux .
" There are some issues with IE6 — the lack of transparent PNG support , for example .
But we 've worked through as much of that as possible on our end in Cappuccino .
So , as a programmer , this means you 're never worrying about browser specific details . "
Here is example code for a class that rotates an image : on top is Objective -C ,
on bottom is Objective - J. Click each image for a larger version .
The approach has its downsides , though .
Developers unfamiliar with Cocoa will have a steeper learning curve to pick up the framework and get accustomed to the message passing syntax .
Also , Objective - J has to be parsed and converted to pure JavaScript before it can be run , which can slow initial page load .
For instance , " SproutCore is in JavaScript , and it leverages the built - in classes of JavaScript , so SproutCore ends up using a lot less code and it does n't need to be parsed twice in the browser , " SproutCore 's Jolley told us .
Boucher added , however , that the company has a tool " to preprocess Objective - J code ahead of time , so you save client side execution and load time . "
But there are advantages to the client - side preprocessor .
Web app developers are used to rapid development cycles — " They make a change , hit refresh , and see it on the screen , " Boucher said .
" There 's been a lot of push away from compiled languages and towards interpreted ones lately , because it can often make the development process a lot faster — especially with heavily UI based code .
We did n't want to lose that when you 're programming in Objective - J. "
And it does n't require installing anything extra to work .
" Just point your browser at your index.html file and your app will load . "
As performance improvements to JavaScript are made , like WebKit 's use of the Squirrel Fish interpreter , the extra time required to preprocess before the app starts running becomes less and less of an issue .
Boucher tells us that 280 North " want[s ] to see the next generation of apps take off on the web .
We think Cappuccino is the best way to build these kinds of applications , and obviously we want as many people to use it as possible . "
So , like SproutCore , Cappuccino and Objective - J will be open source .
" We 've been working really hard on 280 Slides over the last few months .
Now that Slides is out in the public , we need to take a little bit of time to polish up Cappuccino before we release it publicly .
I do n't know the exact timeframe , but we 're just as excited as everyone else to get this in other people 's hands . "
With the increased interest in web - based software these days , having at least two complete application frameworks to build applications is a nice luxury .
Both are open source , both are based on JavaScript , and neither rely on external plug-ins .
While SproutCore adds a MVC model to a HTML +CSS +JS development workflow for experienced web developers , Cappuccino gives desktop app developers a way to directly apply their knowledge without having to learn all the ins and outs of the box model and browser - specific tweaks .
Jolley told us , " I think in the long run the frameworks that work best embrace their platform instead of trying to hide it .
But the 280 North guys and I debate that a lot . "
No doubt the debate will rage further with Adobe AIR and Flash and Microsoft 's Silverlight and .NET in the mix , all mingling with Django , Rails , Java , and other development environments .
But from what I have experienced using 280 Slides , a future with Cappuccino based - apps is a bright one .

The original Spiral Island was the talk of the world : a man-made floating island constructed from 250,000 plastic bottles that could drift and relocate as needed until it was destroyed by disaster .
Now the new Spiral Island is slated to open to the public within the next few months in Laguna Makax near Isla Mujeres .
The new island has drawn in donations , volunteers and visitors from all parts of the world and walks of life – people inspired by what may be one of the most impressive do - it - yourself projects of modern times .
( Above : the old Spiral Island , Below : The new one under construction )
The infamous island has been at the center of controversies with each step forward as any endeavor this industrious and unusual is likely to be .
Some claim it is a brilliant environmental design – using almost exclusively recycled materials in its construction .
Others note that when the last island was destroyed it resulted in the littering of its materials and is in many ways the work of a single insane architectural genius .
Still , were it not for that catastrophe those materials would still be providing a home for some and destination for others with a minimal use of non-recycled parts and clearly its creators never intended for it to be demolished in such a fashion .
There is a variety of media available to people who want to learn more about spiral island .
The Spiral Islanders site has forums , a blog , photo collections and videos related to the construction and history of the island as well as the stories and experiences of those who have worked on it and the areas in which they have done so .
It is easy to see how , as people learn more and more about the project , they become increasingly intrigued and many ultimately end up visiting and helping with the island itself .
The Ripley ’s Believe - It - Or - Not video below and photo collection are also a great place to get a feel for the island .

BBC News , Ethiopia
More than 126,000 Ethiopian children could be affected by malnutrition A woman walks slowly down a track between eucalyptus trees .
On her back is a boy , his head emaciated and swollen .
She is just one of several hundred mothers who have walked for hours to find help .
But her son , whose name is Tareknge , is starving .
His is the face of hunger and the face of a crisis that is developing in Ethiopia 's south - west .
Later , we wanted to find out what had happened to Tareknge , and what it could tell us about the growing food crisis .
We returned to the village of Garogoto and showed people a picture of the boy and his mother .
Very soon someone told us the name of their hamlet .
We drove for half an hour along narrow , mud-packed roads past traditional thatched - roofed houses .
Here the children run towards a car - particularly one with foreigners inside .
They hoped we would give them some food .
Many of the children were ragged .
They had flies around their mouths and eyes .
Some had distended stomachs .
The grain has never been so expensive - it has never reached this level before
Idris Mohammed , trader
Desperation as hunger grows Agencies fear prices and drought We arrived at the hamlet of Dache Goffara .
We were surprised to find Tareknge had returned home .
His father invited us inside .
Tareknge was sitting beside the coals of a small fire .
He was weak and listless .
His father said that they did not have the money to take him to hospital , so his mother brought him home .
At the feeding centre , they gave the mother a few high - nutrition biscuits .
I could not tell the age of Lekmo , the father .
He sat between the grey smoke of the fire and the shaft of sunlight through the door .
Lekmo had no answers - he was resigned to what he feared .
" We used to give Tareknge some corn bread and sweet potato , " he told us , " but we no longer have any of these things .
We have nothing at the home at the moment .
Nothing . "
Lifeline Outside his house was the rest of the village .
Most of the children were malnourished .
It was a strange sight .
The houses were surrounded by green stalks of corn , but the harvest was still three to four months away .
A drought and a failed crop had left them with almost nothing .
There were the tall fronds of what they call " false banana " - a drought - resistant plant , for many a lifeline .
There are two ways of eating false banana .
One is cooking the roots , while the other is taking parts of the trunk and burying it , allowing it to decompose before eating it - but it has to stay buried for three months , and even then it is of low nutritional value .
Late rains and the high cost of food mean millions will need food aid The villagers watched us , curious as to what our visit would mean for them .
Through an interpreter I asked them who was eating less than one meal a day .
Every hand went up .
And then one hand became two , out - stretched , pleading for help .
They knew they had to scrape by for two to three months .
If there is no emergency food aid , tens of thousands of children will die .
The under - fives are the most vulnerable .
A few have died already .
Their immune systems are so undermined that a small setback can be fatal .
About an hour by car is the larger town of Boddetti .
The market bustled .
There was food here .
Small piles of maize , barley , teff , lentils and beans .
The prices had doubled in just five months .
The traders struggled to make a sale .
The people could not afford the price .
At the grain market in Addis Ababa , the capital , some said the price of teff , their most important grain , had trebled .
" The grain has never been so expensive , " said Idris Mohammed , one of the traders .
" It has never reached this level before . "
And that is Ethiopia 's problem .
As many as 4.5 million people are judged to need critical , emergency assistance .
Not only are food prices soaring but there is not enough food in the country .
The choice is stark .
Without help , thousands of children will not survive the next few months , but as we travelled through the villages there was no sign , as yet , of the kind of operation that would save lives .
The children may be poor but , with help , most of them can survive .

What are these ?
CBC Radio's Search Engine just posted / aired its interview with Canadian Industry Minister Jim Prentice about his Canadian version of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
They 've been trying to get him on the air for months now and he finally consented to ten minutes , but he delivered nothing but spin and outright lies about his legislation and ended up hanging up on Jesse Brown , the interviewer .
You have to listen to this — in it , the Minister lies , dodges , weaves and ducks around plain , simple questions like , " If the guy at my corner shop unlocks my phone , is he breaking the law ? " and " If my grandfather breaks the DRM on his jazz CDs to put them on his iPod , does that break the law ? " and the biggie , " All the ' freedoms ' your law guarantees us can be overriden by DRM , right ? "
( Prentice 's answer to this last one , " The market will take care of it , " is absolutely priceless . )
Ten minutes ' worth Prentice 's only interview with the national radio network 's most tech - savvy program about his new , sweeping tech bill leaves us with the inescapable picture of a Minister who either does n't know what 's in his own legislation ( he repeatedly says , " Well , that 's a very technical question , " as an excuse for why he can't answer it ) or does n't care if he presents it honestly , so long as it passes .
I can't wait for Charlie Angus to play this back in Parliament during the next Question Period : Ministers who lie on national radio about their legislation do n't fare well in Parliamentary democracies .

Proselytizing to Ethiopian Jews is an historically sensitive issue Messianic Jews in Israel say they want an inquiry into the burning of hundreds of copies of the New Testament by Orthodox Jews in Or Yehuda last week .
The books were given to the town 's Ethiopian Jews by the Messianic Jews , who believe in Jesus as a saviour .
Or Yehuda 's deputy mayor says he received complaints about the books , and arranged for them to be burnt .
He has now apologised after his actions have been compared to those of Nazis who burnt Jewish holy scriptures .
Proselytizing to Ethiopian Jews is sensitive because historically they were the target of missionaries who converted many to Christianity in Ethiopia - though they later argued the conversion was forced and they had never really abandoned their Jewish faith , the BBC 's Frances Harrison says .
The dispute is revealing growing tension between Messianic Jews and their Orthodox opponents who do not recognise them as Jews , our correspondent adds .
' Dumped and burned '
Many of the details of exactly what happened in Or Yehuda are now disputed .
But the deputy mayor says Messianic Jewish missionaries had targeted an area of the town where many Ethiopian Jews live , distributing packages containing New Testaments and pamphlets .
He says he received complaints and then drove around the area with a loudspeaker urging people to hand over the material to Orthodox religious students who went door - to - door collecting it .
The books were then dumped in a pile and burned .
Messianic Jews complain of institutionalised discrimination and are demanding all those involved be put on trial .
Meanwhile , Orthodox Jews are applauding the destruction of texts they say urge Jews to convert .

We think all women should feel confident with their figure .
Many women do not like the look and feel of breast implants , but rather they just want to enhance the shape and size of their breasts in a natural way .
The cost , risk , and pain of undergoing breast augmentation surgery are the other obvious reasons many women refuse to go under the knife .
The majority of women who want larger breasts do n't want their breast enlargement to look fake .
In this day and age , let 's face it , most people can easily spot when a woman has breast implants .
Especially when the woman wears anything revealing such as a bathing suit , tight - fitting , or low - cut clothing .
Usually breast implants make breasts look too big , high , and round to be real .
This is especially noticable when the woman is thin .
The reason is because fat creates much of the breast tissue , so it 's rare that a woman would only have fat deposited in the breasts , but nowhere else on the body .
It 's just not natural for the majority of the female population .
Breast implants can also look unnatural if a woman has had children and breast - fed , yet her breasts are high , round , firm , and big .
We all know by now that breast - feeding usually results in breasts that are smaller , flatter , and saggier then before breast - feeding .
That 's natural and no woman should not breast - feed to maintain the appearance of her breasts when there are so many ways to attain the breast shape and size they desire .
Even if you 've lost fullness due to breast - feeding , losing weight , going through menopause , illness , etc .
We 're here to help you find the right product to get the naturally feminine shape you desire .
Activities of Iraq ' PR group ' beyond scope of committee 's investigation Nick Juliano
Published : Monday June 9 , 2008

Print This Email This Veteran intelligence reporter Walter Pincus asked Monday why a Senate Committee that just released a report assessing the Bush administrations pre-war claims did n't examine the set of White House insiders tasked with selling the Iraq invasion to the public .
The Senate Intelligence Committee released a nearly 200 - page report last week examining the pre-war speeches and public statements of President Bush , Vice President Cheney and other administration officials .
It found that the first two speeches presenting the case for war were not vetted by intelligence analysts , and generally concluded that administration officials overstated the case for war .
Unexamined by the committee were the behind - the - scenes machinations of the White House Iraq Group , a collection of Bush loyalists and political experts tasked with presenting the case for war .
A spokeswoman for the committee 's chairman tells RAW STORY that examination of the group 's activities fell outside its jurisdiction .
" That 's essentially a public relations group , " Wendy Morigi , a spokesman for Sen.
John Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , said , referring to WHIG .
Pincus , was among the first to reveal WHIG 's operations , and he provided some concise background on the group Monday :
The group met weekly in the Situation Room .
Among the regular participants ( many have since left or changed jobs ) were Karl Rove , the president 's senior political adviser ; communications strategists Karen Hughes , Mary Matalin and James R. Wilkinson ; legislative liaison Nicholas E. Calio ; and policy aides led by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and her deputy , Stephen J. Hadley , as well as I . Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Cheney 's chief of staff .
As former White House press secretary Scott McClellan wrote in his recently released book , " What Happened , " the Iraq Group " had been set up in the summer of 2002 to coordinate the marketing of the war to the public . "
" The script had been finalized with great care over the summer , " McClellan wrote , for a " campaign to convince Americans that war with Iraq was inevitable and necessary . "
The committee also did not attempt to personally interview administration officials , such as Bush and Cheney , Pincus noted .
Again , Morigi said this was outside their purview .
" It 's up to the public to determine what the intent of " administration officials ' statements were , Morigi said .
For his part , Rockefeller personally believed the intelligence was misused to present a slanted case for war .
The committee 's full reports are available as two large .pdf files here and here .
" It has often been said that truth is the first casualty of war .
... This was the case in the Bush administration 's march to war in Iraq , " Rockefeller said at a news conference last week .
The reports released last Thursday were the culmination of a five year effort to examine the collection , analysis , production , dissemination and use of intelligence in the run-up to the war in Iraq .
Pincus laid out some ways in which the WHIG members influenced the public case for war .
[ On Sept. 8 , 2002 , ] WHIG 's product placement was on display .
It began with a front - page story in the Times describing Iraq 's clandestine purchase of aluminum tubes that , the story said , could be used to produce weapons - grade uranium .
The story said that information came from " senior administration officials . "
The story also spoke of " hardliners " in the Bush administration being " alarmed that American intelligence underestimated the pace and scale of Iraq 's nuclear program before Baghdad 's defeat in the gulf war . "
They " argue that Washington dare not wait until analysts have found hard evidence that Mr. Hussein has acquired a nuclear weapon .
The first sign of a ' smoking gun , ' they argue , may be a mushroom cloud , " the Times story said .
That same morning , the message was carried on three network news shows .
Cheney appeared on NBC's " Meet the Press " and , referring to the Times story , said that intelligence showed that Hussein " has reconstituted his nuclear program to develop a nuclear weapon . "
The Iraqi leader was " trying , through his illicit procurement network , to acquire the equipment he needs to be able to enrich uranium to make the bombs , " Cheney said .

WHIG 's records would shed much light on whether , as Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , chairman of the intelligence panel , put it : " In making the case for war , the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when it was unsubstantiated , contradicted or even nonexistent . "
The committee seems unlikely to begin delving into WHIG 's files any time soon , though .
Intelligence committee members do not believe they have the jurisdiction to " speak to a public relations group about how they did their job , " Morigi said .
" The committee feels like it has completed its job , " she added .
SHIMONOSEKI , Japan  Poison has been as integral to fugu , the funny - looking , potentially deadly puffer fish prized by Japanese gourmands , as the savor of its pricey meat .
So consider fugu , but poison - free .
Thanks to advances in fugu research and farming , Japanese fish farmers are now mass - producing fugu as harmless as goldfish .
Most important , they have taken the poison out of fugu ’s liver , considered both its most delicious and potentially most lethal part , one whose consumption has left countless Japanese dead over the centuries and whose sale remains illegal in the country .
But what could be seen as potential good news for gourmands has instead been grounds for controversy : powerful interests in the fugu industry , playing on lingering safety fears , are fighting to keep the ban on fugu livers even from poison - free fish .
“ We wo n’t approve it , ” Hisashi Matsumura , the president of the Shimonoseki Fugu Association and vice president of the National Fugu Association , said of the legalization of fugu liver .
He added , “ We ’re not engaging in this irrelevant discussion . ”
なぜ人は 「フレーム問題」に陥らないのか
人が世界と関わる二つの方法、認知と行為とはどのようなものだろうか。そのわかりやすい例が人工知能の「フレーム問題」だろう。人工知能にチェスのような「閉じた」ゲームを遂行させれば、計算によって最適解を求めながら遂行するだろう。しかしたとえば有名なダニエル・デネットの「フレーム問題の寓話」のような「開放系」の状況では、その過程で起こる場面（フレーム）が無限に考えられるために計算を収束させることができず、フリーズしてしまう。これを「フレーム問題」という。
「 フレーム問題の寓話 」
http://www.johf.com/logs/20070422b.html
昔、R1という名のロボットがいた。ある日、R1の開発者たちは予備バッテリーを別の部屋に隠して、その部屋に時限爆弾を仕掛け、まもなく爆発するようにセットした。R1は部屋をつきとめ、バッテリー回収作戦を立案した。部屋の中にはワゴンがあり、バッテリーはワゴンに載っている。R1は「引き出す」というアクションを実行すればよいと判断し、ワゴンを部屋の外に引き出すことに成功したが、そこで最初の悲劇が起こった。時限爆弾もワゴンの上に載っていたため、部屋の外に出たところで
R1は爆破されてしまったのである。 開発者らは第2のロボットの開発にとりかかった。自分の動作が引き起こす結果 （副次的作用） を判断できるロボットを作ればいい。新しいロボットはR1D1と名付けられた。 さっそくR1の場合と同じシチュエーションが設定され、R1D1はバッテリーの回収に取りかかった。「引き出す」というアクションの実行に先立って、R1D1は副作用のチェックを開始する。ワゴンを引き出しても部屋の壁の色は変わらないだろう、ワゴンを引き出せば車輪が回転するだろう…、膨大な副次的作用の可能性を検討しているうちに時限爆弾が爆発した。
問題は、関係のあることと関係のないことをロボットが見分けられなかった点にある。そこで開発者たちは、目的に関係のないことを見分けられるロボットR2D1を開発した。だが今度も悲劇は起こった。R2D1が無関係なことを見分けて、それらを一つずつ「無視」し続けているあいだに爆弾が爆発した。
では、なぜ人は 「フレーム問題」に陥らないのか。これに対する一つの答えは、人は認知によって解を求めてから行為をするわけではなく、認知とともに行為している、ということだ。
認知とは世界全体を俯瞰するの位置にたち、現在→最適解への最適コースを求めようとする客観主義、目的論的なものである。それに対して行為は認知とは異なった世界との関係性をもつ。行為は自立的に絶えず進行している。行為することで場面（フレーム）は変化しまたそれにあわせてまた行為するというオートポエティックなものである。
人はの位置に立ち世界を認知（観察、予期）しつつ、平行して行為を継続している。認知によって最適解が収束する、しないに関わらず、すでに行為してフレームは変化しつづけている。だから「フレーム問題」に陥る事がない。
恋は人を 「 人工知能化」する
しかし人は多くにおいて、「フレーム問題」のような状況に陥っている。たとえば恋愛の場面である。誰かを好きになると人はちょっとしたパニックになる。「彼女は僕のことをどのように思っているのだろう。」「あっ、いまちらっとこっちをみたけどどういう意味だ。僕のことが好きで合図を送っている？」などなど、彼女の動作、会話の隠された意味を解読しようと妄想する。思い切って、「好きです。つき合ってください」と告白すればすっきりするだろうが、怖くてできない。
あるいは思春期に 「 僕はなんのために生きているんだろう 」
「このことになんの意味があるんだろう」となにかと悩んでしまう。大人になり社会の様々な情報を理解できるようになるが、社会での経験が少なくというアンバランスな状況がこのような悩める時期を生み出すのだろう。
これらは、行為の前で考えすぎてしまうという「フレーム問題」に近い状況である。このような認知過多の状態を「人工知能化」と呼びたい。
「 認知」を言語論的に図式化すると以下のようになる。はによって解釈しが理解する。「人工知能化」とは、（彼女の動作、会話）を様々に解釈してしまい、そのが収束せずに「躓き」、混乱、妄想に陥ってしまう。
このような認知過多な状態に対して「行為」は、解釈の決定不可能を断ち切って、「思い切って告白する」、「思い切って毎日を楽しむ」など、場面（フレーム）を進展させる力となる。

古い組織は人を 「 機械化」する
たとえば仕事において担当やバイトが権限以上の事態に直面すると、上司にお伺いを立てるだろうが、すぐには連絡が取れない場合、どのように処理をしてよいか、パニックになってしまう。
この場合には彼らは頭が悪く処理できないのではなく、仕事に忠実であるほど権限を飛び越えて行為することを躊躇し、権限内で対応しようとする。しかしいくら考えてもそこには解はなく、パニックになる。これも「フレーム問題」のような状況といえる。
図式的に表せば、Ａ）通常は、対して状況にあわせて意味を理解し適切に遂行する。しかしＢ）のように、が権限外、マニュアル外の場合には解釈が収束せずに「躓き」、パニックになってしまう。

Ａ）通常 −−
Ｂ）人工知能化 −−×躓 き
Ｃ）機械化 −（×思考停止） −
Ｄ）野蛮化 −（×思考停止）暴 走
このような人工知能化してしまうのは、なんとかしようと努力しているからと起こることだ。たとえば公共機関や古い組織が往々に形式ばった対応になるのは、担当が人工知能化する前に思考停止してしまうからだ。そしてただマニュアルに従った機械的な対応しかない。機械は入力（input）に対して出力（output）が決定され悩むことはない。だからこれは「機械化」といえるだろう。が社会的な権威や宗教的な信念などに強く依存する場合にも思考停止しマニュアルや規則や教えに従ってしか対処しない。
さらに 「どうしよう？」と悩む前に、行為してしまう場合がある。思考停止して行為することは「暴走」である。これは「野蛮化」とでも言えるだろう。しかし俗に言う「仕事ができる人」というのは、権限外に対して「責任」をもつことで、多少野蛮化しつつ柔軟に行為する人であると言えるだろう。
これら 「 人工知能化 」 、「 機械化 」 、「野蛮化」の例は極端に図式化しすぎているが、これらからわかることは、「認知」には社会的な基盤としてが働いている必要がある。そして多くにおいて毎回毎回解釈するのでは疲れるために社会的なに従い、無意識に「機械化」して対処しているだろう。そして社会的なでは対処できない場合には、「人工知能化」する前にある程度強引にでも「野蛮化」して行為する必要があるということだ。
「 フレーム問題」は人をコミュニケーションへ向かわせる契機
たとえば彼女とじゃれ合っているときに「バカ！」言われる。「バカ」のコンスタティブな意味は「頭が悪い」であるが、この場合の「バカ」の意味は「親しみ」を表しているだろう。ここでは「バカ」というはレトリカルに使用されている。だから解釈する場合には「え？なに？」という小さな「フレーム問題」が起こっている。そしてその返答として「なんだよ！」とじゃれかえし、彼女が笑うことでが正しく共有されていることが確認される。
すべての認知ではレトリカルに現れて、において「え？なに？」という「小さな躓き」が起こっている。このような傾向が特に顕著なのが他者とのコミュニケーションである。もしコミュニケーションがすべてコンスタティブな意味によって機械のように行われたらいかに殺伐とするだろうか。それはどんなにまじめな場であってもだ。たとえば「お笑い」のボケも理解不能なを示すことで、「フレーム問題」を引き起こし、一瞬の間のあとに「笑う」という行為を引き出す。
−−
彼女：−−×小さな躓き
ボク：−−×小さな躓き
−− −−×小さな躓 き
すなわち多くにおいて 「フレーム問題」は人をコミュニケーションへ向かわせる契機となっている。コミュニケーションは「え？なに？」という「小さな躓き」が次の行為（発話）を生み出すことで繋がっていく。そしてこの終わりのない連鎖が新たなを変化させていく。それがつむがれて社会的な基盤としての文化活動となる。
しかしポストモダン論で言う「大きな物語の凋落」という現代の状況は、を社会基盤として共有することがむずかしくなっていることを示している。「え？なに？」という「小さな躓き」以上に理解不能な「大きな躓き」によって行為で容易にとび越えることができなくなっている。このような「人工知能化」する社会の中で、躓きの不安から反動的な「機械化」や「野蛮化」が生まれている。（つづく）

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
After a tough six - week stretch of campaign gaffes , roaring controversies and heightened scrutiny , Barack Obama ’s presidential bid appears as strong as ever -- and rival Hillary Clinton is running out of time to change the script .

Obama has expanded his lead on Clinton in many national polls and gained ground on her in the next battleground of Pennsylvania ahead of Tuesday ’s vote , despite furors over his remarks on small - town residents and inflammatory comments by his former pastor .
Clinton ’s image appeared to take a heavier hit after wrongly claiming she faced sniper fire in Bosnia in 1996 .
A Washington Post poll this week found more Americans have an unfavorable impression of her than at any time since she entered the national limelight in 1992 .
“ It has n’t been a bed of roses for Obama .
He ’s had some problems .
But she is the one whose negatives are going up , ” said Phil Noble , head of the South Carolina New Democrats group and an Obama supporter .
Obama has a nearly unassailable lead on the New York senator in delegates to the August nominating convention and in popular votes won in the first three months of the primary battle .
Clinton hopes a big Pennsylvania win ignites a strong run through the final nine contests , fundamentally reordering the race and giving her fresh evidence to argue she is the strongest candidate to face Republican John McCain in November ’s presidential election .
But polls show Obama has whittled her once substantial double - digit lead in Pennsylvania to single digits .
A Zogby poll on Friday put her lead at 4 points , a Rasmussen poll showed it at 3 points and a Los Angeles Times poll earlier this week had it at 5 points .
A narrow Clinton win probably would be enough to keep her in the race , but would not stem another round of calls among Democrats for her to step aside and let Obama concentrate on the race with McCain .
OBAMA LEAD GROWS
Obama has expanded his national lead in several polls .
A Reuters / Zogby poll released earlier this week put it at 13 points , and a daily Gallup tracking poll had it at 7 points , down from his high of 11 earlier in the week .
Obama continues to steadily win endorsements from superdelegates , the nearly 800 Democratic Party insiders who are free to back any candidate and who hold the key to winning the nomination .
“ It does n’t seem like she has the power to alter the dynamic of the race anymore , ” said Simon Rosenberg , head of the Democratic advocacy group NDN .
Rosenberg said Clinton ’s scenario for winning the Democratic nomination was no longer believable .

“ In every way you can measure it , he ’s won more delegates , he ’s won more states , he ’s raised more money , he has a better organization -- all the metrics one has of how to evaluate the race indicate he is winning and she is losing , ” he said .
Obama , an Illinois senator who would be the first black U.S. president , weathered a flap in March about the controversial comments of his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , by giving a widely praised speech on race .
He ignited another firestorm last weekend when his comments about small - town residents at a private San Francisco fundraiser became public .
He said small - town residents were clinging to religion and guns out of bitterness about their economic struggles .
In the six - week lull between the last contest in Mississippi , which Obama won , and Tuesday ’s vote in Pennsylvania , those flaps and Clinton ’s Bosnia controversy dominated the campaign debate .
But so far , none of the controversies appears to have the strength to derail Obama .
“ Voters in the end may not be that agitated about these kinds of things , ” said Linda Fowler , a political analyst at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire .
“ They really are more concerned about the war and the economy and which candidate is more effective . ”
Chicago ( TGW ) – Foundation work has begun on the Chicago Spire , a rotating residential building that is likely to achieve an LEED Gold Rating .
Upon completion , the spire will be the world ’s second tallest building .
The building will have many green elements , including a fluid facade shrouded in high performance glass , a rainwater recycling system , high energy efficiency , a intelligent building and management systems , waste storage and recycling management , monitored outdoor air delivery , and a geothermal power system .
The building ’s design is based on nature , the architect of the building said .

The Court has held that broad immunity for both the Government and military and civilian officials who injure military personnel or violate their constitutional rights is necessary to preserve military discipline and to prevent Federal courts from second - guessing command decisions .
Justice Scalia said that the allegations by former Sgt. James B. Stanley that the Army 's LSD experiments had caused him to '' awake from sleep at night and , without reason , violently beat his wife and children , '' would entitle him to no compensation even if proved , because his injuries '' arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service . ''
In his dissent , Justice Brennan said : '' The Government of the United States treated thousands of its citizens as though they were laboratory animals , dosing them with this dangerous drug without their consent . ''
He added that '' the Court disregards the commands of our Constitution , and bows instead to the purported requirements of a different master , ' Military Discipline . ' ''
If this were a correct reading of the Constitution , he concluded , '' soldiers ought not to be asked to defend a Constitution indifferent to their essential human dignity . ''
His dissent was joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall and in part by Justice John Paul Stevens .
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , in a separate dissent , said that the Government and its officials should be protected from lawsuits by military personnel , but said that '' conduct of the type alleged in this case is so far beyond the bounds of human decency ' ' that ''it simply cannot be considered a part of military discipline . ''
Mr. Stanley 's suit grew out of secret Army experiments at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland , using enlisted men who had volunteered for what they had been told would be chemical warfare tests with gas masks and protective clothing .
The Army 's human experimentation with LSD , or lysergic acid diethylamide , was part of a broader Government program in which the Central Intelligence Agency also participated .
A security weakness in Barack Obama 's website has been exploited to redirect visitors to Hillary Clinton 's website .
Visitors who viewed the Community Blogs section of the site were instead presented with Clinton 's website as a result of a cross - site scripting vulnerability .
Barack Obama 's visitors were redirected to this site .
A user named Mox , from Liverpool , IL , posted an apparent confession in the Community Blogs section on the Barack Obama website yesterday .
The subject of the post was , " I am the one who " hacked " Obamas site . "
Mox plays down the matter by saying that all he did was exploit some poorly written HTML code before suggesting that it was a cross - site scripting vulnerability that had been exploited .
By allowing users to enter characters such as > and " into their blog URLs , JavaScript could be injected into pages in the Community Blogs section and would be executed by subsequent visitors .
A YouTube clip from zennie62 demonstrates the attack .
The clip shows a user clicking on the Community Blogs section of the Barack Obama site , which subsequently causes the browser to redirect to hillaryclinton.com .
The author speculates that " Senator Clinton 's staffers possibly hired someone to hack into the Barack Obama website system . "
No evidence is offered to back up this statement .
Another vulnerability found on the Barack Obama site .
While Mox states that the original issue has now been fixed , a number of similar vulnerabilities have since been identified and remain unfixed , and are documented on xssed.com , which notes that such vulnerabilities open up opportunities to infect Obama 's supporters and site visitors with malware , adware and spyware .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Thousands of people heeded a call from anti-American cleric Moqtada al - Sadr to protest talks between Washington and Baghdad on keeping U.S. troops in Iraq beyond 2008 , but turnout on Friday was lower than past marches .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Explaining the relatively low numbers , spokesmen for Sadr ’s movement said the protests were widely spread through the country but security forces prevented marches in some areas .
In one of the largest demonstrations , several thousand people took to the streets in the Baghdad district of Sadr City , a bastion of Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia .
They held up pictures of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki dressed as Saddam Hussein .
In the Kadhimiya district in northwest Baghdad , hundreds of demonstrators with raised fists marched behind a banner asking the United Nations to “ stand with the Iraqi people against this security deal between the government and the occupation ” .
The United States , which invaded in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein , now has 155,000 troops in Iraq .
It is negotiating with Iraq on an agreement aimed at giving a legal basis to U.S. troops after December 31 , when their United Nations ’ mandate expires .
Sadr ’s followers see it as a surrender of Iraq ’s sovereignty to an occupying force .
Sadr , backed by a militia estimated to number tens of thousands and popular among Iraq ’s Shi’ite poor , has called for protests to continue until the government agrees to hold a referendum on the U.S. presence .
Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , head of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , the biggest Shi’ite group in Maliki ’s government , also criticized the planned agreement on a troop extension .
In a statement on his website , he said there was a “ national consensus to reject many points raised by the American side as they infringe national sovereignty . ”
Sadr pulled his bloc out of Maliki ’s government last year in protest at his refusal to negotiate a timetable for a U.S. troop withdrawal .
He called for a million - strong march against the U.S. presence in April but later called it off for security reasons .
On Friday , about 1,200 people marched from the Grand Mosque in Kut , 150 km ( 95 miles ) southeast of the capital , to the Sadr office .
Saad al - Maliki , head of the Sadr office in Kut , said : “ As long as there is life , these demonstrations will continue until this agreement is cancelled . ”
In the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf , 160 km ( 100 miles ) south of Baghdad , several hundred demonstrators marched , chanting : “ Out , out occupier ” and “ Iraq wo n’t be an American colony ” .
Protests were also held in Basra and Nassiriya .
Khalid al - Isawi , head of the Sadr office in Nassiriya , said a similar demonstration would be held every Friday .

No single commercial product in the history of capitalism has had a greater effect on the economy and politics than the automobile .
No other product has been such a lever to increase consumption and increase markets in the developed world .
It could be argued that the car , more than any other product , was at the very heart of the 20th century ’s economic expansion .
In US society , for over a century , the car has been raised on a cultural pedestal worshipping individuality and defining big business ’ vision of freedom .
The car hastened the massive sprawl of suburbia and in itself shaped US urban planning like no other product .
Today , in the United States , public transport plays a distant second fiddle to the car with nine out of ten workers using their cars to travel to work .
In people ’s everyday life , the car is now their second biggest household expense , next to housing .
The car has reached its zenith .
This brief socialist history of the automobile will attempt to give some background and context to today ’s car - dominated world .
It will attempt to explain how the automobile and the mad chase for profits has shaped the world , and helped in turn lead humanity to its current fork , where one road indisputably will lead to global destruction .
This history is founded on Marxist materialism , which sets off from the idea that all social and cultural phenomena under capitalism are shaped by the continuous tug between the bosses and the working class .
While this is not a history of autoworkers , it does attempt to show the role of working people ’s struggles that have continuously been in the background to the birth and rise of the automobile .
One side of the auto industry that does not pervade its own advertising is the bloody road that brought it here .
The industry itself has killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of workers as it arose and found its feet .
This suffering was in turn surpassed by a century - long battle over resources to feed the car its oil ; its rubber ; its steel and glass .
Many millions have been killed in many hundreds of wars and invasions by imperialism , some more directly connected to the automobile than others .
The place of petroleum in the current war in Iraq is self - evident .
But it is not the first or last war for resources for the automobile .
Over a hundred years ago US imperialism invaded Central America to establish its own rubber plantations for its booming auto industry ; its brutality gave rise to Augusto Sandino , the grandfather of Nicaragua ’s anti-imperialist resistance .
This article is dedicated to the thousands of workers who died fighting for auto unions and those millions who resisted the auto - industrial complex and were crushed in its wake .
A brief socialist history of the automobile
In 1799 Philippe Lebon registered his invention of a ``gas powered engine with internal combustion ’’ with the new revolutionary government of France .
The new engine would be light , independent and powerful .
It would be a hundred years before the steam engine had exhausted itself and the gas engine replace it .
Together with the discovery of new sources of oil and the explosion of industry , particularly in the US , all the parts were in place for the invention of the horseless carriage .
During the 1890s the motorised bicycle and the electric car were eventually sidelined for the more utilitarian and more profitable motor car .
The car began its life as a toy for the wealthy and an object that polarised the classes .
It was widely known that Cornelius Vanderbilt , the railroad baron , had a 100 - car garage .
In 1906 Woodrow Wilson , then president of Princeton University , argued that ``nothing has spread socialistic feeling in this country more than the use of automobiles … they are a picture of the arrogance of wealth ’’ .
The Horseless Age magazine in 1904 documented widespread stone throwing at autos in working - class neighbourhoods of New York City .
The first cars were unaffordable to working people .
The average annual income of a worker in 1900 was $ 450 and the average price of a car was $ 2000 .
Along with the price , the common notion was that horseless carriages were less pleasant and less reliable than the horse .
Only 4192 cars were sold in 1900 .
But within 27 years the number of cars registered in the US ballooned to over 20 million .
More than half of all US families either owned a new or used automobile .
Rise of the working class and the USA ’s industrial impasse
By the end of the 19th century US capitalism was fighting off a mass movement for unionisation and socialism .
American capitalism had won the civil war defeating the slave - owning class , which , along with wiping out the Native American peoples , enabled capitalism to complete its rule from coast to coast .
The bosses had encouraged millions of immigrants to its shores in part to attempt to undermine rising wages , however this had not prevented the working class rising up and establishing skilled craft unions throughout many of the United States ’ industries .
US manufacturers had begun to see a serious decline in its rate of profits .
Employers had tried to lower wages and speed up production , but that had only provoked more strikes and more workers joining the new unions .
Employers began to conclude that they needed to change the organisation of production to break the power of the craft unions .
At the turn of the century a massive wave of mergers had given more control of larger companies to the banks and financiers .
The dominance of the banks enabled them to direct change in the productive process of manufacturing .
Frederick Taylor ’s ``scientific ’’ management methods were increasingly adopted throughout industry .
Centralised planning , detailed time study , division of labour and incentive pay were implemented in attempts to reverse the decline in capitalism ’s rate of profit and at the same time break the power of the skilled craft unions .
The automobile leapt from the sidelines into the centre of capitalist life in the first two decades of the 20th century .
Increased technological improvements were able to utilise the internal combustion engine into a producer of energy unlike any previous invention .
One gallon of gasoline , transformed through this engine could produce the equivalent energy of one month of human labour .
The oil industry , which had grown through the widespread use of the oil lamp , had already been developed and was constantly searching for new sources globally .
Unlike British , German and French imperialism , US Imperialism had the advantage of its own domestic oil industry .
Fordism : industrial saviour
The emerging automobile industry grew out of the large horse carriage manufacturers and small auto shops .
Henry Ford exploited the latest manufacturing technologies and with massive investment from the big banks , transformed the plaything of the rich into a mass consumer product .
Ford ’s massive investment in machinery created high - speed production aimed at de-skilling the labour involved in production and assembly .
Fordism aimed to destroy the clout of the craft unions : breaking down the productive process to its lowest denominator : to the simplest , most repetitive tasks .
Then , to increase line speed , the industry introduced production - based pay incentives .
Henry Ford and the Model T
The mass investment into auto produced incredible results .
In 1910 , while a car in Europe took 3000 employee - days to produce , a Ford car was being produced in the US in 70 employee - days .
In 1911 the Overland carriage company produced 20,000 cars .
Their paint division employed 200 craftspeople and took two weeks to paint each vehicle .
In 1915 with the introduction of spray painting and drying ovens this was reduced to three days per vehicle .
The Ford Motor Company additionally stepped up production and cut costs by streamlining down to a single model .
In 1914 it also discontinued all colours except black .
The 1913 introduction of the conveyer belt reduced assembly of the Model T from 12.5 hours per vehicle to 1.5 hours , and by 1915 , the number of skilled workers in the US automobile industry had fallen from 60 % of the workforce to 15 % .
One further advantage for US imperialism was that it had the world ’s largest undivided potential market for any new product .
In contrast , Europe was divided by dozens of national tariff walls .
More than 100 million people lived within the US at this time and Ford ’s River Rouge plant alone employed more than 100,000 workers .
Ford developed and grew the market for the car by a combination of raising autoworkers ’ wages and lowering automobile prices .
In 1913 Ford introduced the $ 5 - a - day wage , when average daily pay in the US was under $ 2 .
In this way the Ford workforce became a part of the first mass market for cars .
Ford also reduced the work - week to five days in his factories in 1926 , helping raise his workers ’ productivity .
By 1908 the Ford Model T was launched .
It sold for $ 825 , the cheapest car of its time .
Ford had reduced costs by reducing his line to one basic affordable model .
By 1925 regular price cuts had eventually brought the price of the Model T down to $ 260 per car , helping place an automobile outside the home of every second US family .
Over two decades the automobile had been transformed from an experimental plaything of the rich to a common , everyday product .
The car no longer bore the stigma of being elitist .
One of Ford ’s followers was the rising star of German capitalism , Adolf Hitler .
Hitler argued ``the motor car instead of being a class dividing element can be the instrument for uniting different classes , just as it has done in America , thanks to Mr. Ford ’s genius ’’ .
While the $ 5 - a - day wage was not copied in Hitler ’s Volkswagen factories , most of Ford ’s authoritarian management methods were .
Ford ’s US factories were well known for their severe discipline and instant firings .
No -one was allowed to talk on the production line : workers called it the ``Ford Silence ’’ .
Ford ’s fascist - style workplace regime was only broken by the victory of the United Auto Workers in organising Ford plants in 1941 .
The booming ‘ 20s and the struggle for raw materials
The economic boom of the 1920s was led by the two newest and biggest consumer objects of 20th century US capitalism : the single family home and the automobile .
The cinema , which replaced the saloon , became the lead advertising agent for the car .
Radio advertising too promoted the new freedom of the road .
The monotony and alienation of life in the workplace remained hidden in all but socialist literature .
Capitalism offered increasingly meaningless jobs and an illusion of meaning off the clock : with the individualised car and picket fence .
The car and the airplane shortened distances , as did the telephone and the radio .
The speed of life outside work increased , mirroring the increased speed at work .
Sales promotion and marketing was born and boomed as capitalism frantically pushed to increase markets and feed its addiction to profits .
In France , the Citroen Corporation had 5000 travelling salespeople to promote the need for its car in every village and hamlet .
Citroen paid for 150,000 road signs to be erected across France , where they previously had n’t existed .
The company also sold 400,000 toy cars to entice future buyers and beginning the long association of boys and cars .
By 1927 the French automaker was producing 1000 cars a day in its French plants .
With the rise of the automobile , new sources of raw materials needed to be discovered and created .
Capitalism can never stand still .
As Karl Marx wrote in Capital , ``Accumulate !
Accumulate !
Accumulate !
That is the Moses and the Prophets !
`` Capitalism , by its inherent nature , can never stop , but is forced to continuously create bigger and bigger markets , and more and more consumption .
This is all that stands between itself and an economic slump of overproduction .
Relatively sleepy Brazil was the exclusive producer of rubber at the end of the 19th century .
Rubber trees grew wild , but production was costly , because of the Amazon ’s isolation and scarcity of labour .
Waterproofed products , capitalism ’s initial use for rubber , was soon surpassed by rubber ’s value as car tyres .
Each car demanded 45 lbs [ 20.4 kgs ] of rubber , which sold on international markets for up to £ 900 per ton .
Brazil closely guarded its rubber monopoly until British imperialism broke into the industry by robbing a shipment of rubber tree seeds .
Britain then raised seedlings in its Ceylon [ Sri Lanka ] colony and eventually began mass production of rubber in Malaysia .
By the 1910s the Dutch and British colonies were producing hundreds of tons of rubber .
In 1913 Malaysian and Indonesian production first surpassed Brazilian production .
Two years later British Imperialism ’s plantations doubled Brazilian rubber production and by 1919 they produced 10 - fold more rubber than Brazil .
The US recognised the problem of depending on British colonies for its tyre industry and invaded Central America to develop its own rubber industry .
The US mirrored the brutal methods of the rubber plantations in Asia , where it was not uncommon for half of all workers to be dead by the end of the rubber season .
US rubber plantation methods , nearing slavery , provoked one of the first mass rebellions against US imperialism , as it began its role of stalking the planet for resources .
In the mid 1920s the introduction of the inflatable tyre increased average tyre mileage from 8000 miles to 15,000 miles .
The price of rubber then soon collapsed .
Rubber , which peaked at £ 900 per ton in 1910 , fell to £ 20 per ton by the 1930s .
In 1928 the owners of the world ’s three biggest oil companies , Anglo - Persian Oil ( later to become British Petroleum ) , Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil , sat down and worked out a deal to share out the world ’s oil wealth between them .
The Red Line Agreement signed a year later would help avert the suffering of a new world war to re-divide oil resources .
Nonetheless , the working classes and poor of the oil - producing countries continued to die in poverty , alongside billions of barrels of black gold .
` Our big job is to hasten obsolescence ’
The automobile helped lead the charge of the unprecedented boom of the 1920s .
During this period the car market became saturated , and along with the growing sales of used cars , profits for the industry were falling .
A shift in the industry was necessary and General Motors ( GM ) began to challenge Ford ’s single model production .
As early as 1923 GM began selling cars with a similar basic frame , but with different bodies .
In the boom of the 1920s GM designers argued that car sales had crossed a new threshold moving from the need for ``better quality to better looking ’’.
Here begins the divergence of the car from its simple utilitarian role into the realm of being an expression of social mobility and wealth .
Here begins the massive diversification of models and the road that eventually leads to annual model changes .
Capitalism loves all things new and seeks to see all things old thrown away .
This moment is the beginning of the massive diversity of models of US cars and all that went with it .
With every model change comes the need for auto plants to produce new dies and reset presses .
By the early 1940s GM alone was spending up to $ 35 million a year on model changes .
While costly , routine model changes were beneficial to the narrow interests of the biggest automakers .
GM , Ford and Chrysler drove out the remaining small producers who could not keep up with the massive investment required to change models frequently .
This emergence of style or appearance as a competitive factor may have been initially stumbled upon , but it soon became a fundamental requirement in the industry .
General Motors ’ top designer during this period , Harley Earl , argued that ``our big job is to hasten obsolescence ’’.
He further argued that given the average new car ownership span in 1935 was five years and in 1955 it was reduced to two years , that ``when it is one year we will have the perfect score ’’ .
The Great Depression saw all auto companies radically cut back on spending and production .
From a high of 5.6 million cars sold in 1929 auto sales collapsed by 75 % to 1.4 million vehicles in 1932 .
Luxury vehicle sales fared worse : peaking in 1929 at 150,000 sold , sales then continued to fall through the 1930s .
The rich understood the shift in consciousness of the period and that ostentatious displays of wealth could cost them their lives .
By 1937 annual sales of luxury cars had slumped to 10,000 .
In 1928 the Ford Motor Company had 128,000 workers on its payroll , by August 1931 only 37,000 workers still had jobs and most of them worked only three days per week .
Ford ’s $ 5 - a - day wage had risen in the 1920s to $ 8 and $ 9 a day .
The depression buried the high wage policy .
In 1931 wages were cut by 20 % .
Some male employees were reduced to 10c an - hour and some women labourers ’ wages were cut to 4 cents an hour in Ford plants .
In 1942 private auto production stopped altogether as the auto industry turned production into building war machines for US government contracts .
War has always been good for business and especially for the ``auto - industrial complex ’’ .
As far back as the outset of the US civil war oil was selling for 49 c per barrel , but by the end of the World War II a barrel of oil was fetching $ 8 .
At the start of the Iraq war oil was $ 30 a barrel and has now risen to $ 110 a barrel .
Similarly in World War I GM shares rocketed from 78 c to $ 7.50 .
After World War II , as victor on the Western Front and in the Pacific , the US emerged as the dominant force for global capitalism .
Its prestige and power was a crown shared with big auto , which set about building cars for the returning troops .
Post - war public spending for the car
The post - war revolutionary wave that swept the world was also seen in the US .
The war ’s hardships led to pent up anger and hope that exploded in the US workplace .
The strike wave of 1946 was the widest industrial conflict in US history .
More than 116 million person - days were lost in strike actions , more than four times the previous record of 1937 .
The strike issues were primarily for a shorter work - week , higher pay and to resist the loss of relative control over workplaces that were granted during wartime .
The bosses conceded on the first two demands , adding also concessions for private insurance to undermine the global movement for nationalised healthcare .
As for aspects of workplace control , once again , capitalism offered instead the myth of power and freedom of consumerism .
Americans were offered the open road and a full tank of gas .
The US government , together with its close partners at the top of all the major industries began to take steps in shaping post - war USA more tightly in the interests of profit .
Major support was given to promote private family home ownership in part through mortgage guarantees for returning troops .
The federal government also subsidised the massive development of the suburbs .
Between 1945 and 1960 some 30 million Americans moved to the suburbs , the growth of which was a huge boon to the auto industry .

Where the railroads were built through private investment , the automobile roads were built for free though federal , state and local governments .
Public and not auto industry money paid for the massive network of highways that were built and the roads were widened .
Further billions in public money came in 1956 with the Interstate Highway Act providing a mass of freeways for automobiles across all states .
The bill passed under the outrageous pretext that the US needed a freeway network in case of a possible invasion from the USSR .
No other industry in US history was so enormously subsidised as the auto industry .
US governments , federal and local , essentially built the superstructure for the expansion of the car .
The car became inseparable from almost every function of US life as a direct consequence of its partnership with the US political elite .
The `Auto - industrial complex ’ conspiracy to destroy public transport
The booming post - war period saw the massive rise and peak of what US Marxist economist Paul Sweezy called the ``automobile - industrial complex ’’ –- the car , oil , steel , glass , rubber , highway construction , trucking and real estate industries connected to urban sprawl .
One consequence of this vested interest in cars was the systematic smashing of public transport operations .
General Motors , Standard Oil of California ( Chevron ) , Phillips Petroleum and Firestone Tires formed National City Lines , as a part of an organised campaign to buy up and destroy electric rail systems operating in US towns and cities .
After buses replaced trams and trains , then the bus systems too were often wound down .
A National City Lines trolley bus
By the early 1950s the auto industry faced a crisis of falling unit demand , as most families now owned a car .
At the same time working people ’s discretionary spending was rising .
Given these factors , the Big Three ( GM , Ford and Crysler ) moved to increase each car ’s size and array of new gadgets , and at the same time increase the frequency of the introduction of new models .
Ford Edsel
Between 1946 and 1959 the cheapest Chevrolet sedan grew 13 inches [ 33 cms ] in length , 7 inches [ 17.8 cms ] in width and was over 400 lbs [ 181 kgs ] heavier .
The Ford Edsel , launched in 1957 , was an incredible 18 feet [ 5.5 metres ] long .
Horsepower for the average model in 1946 was around 110 , by 1956 it was grown to 180 .
Exhaust emissions , fuel efficiency and vehicle safety were placed a distant second to the need to continuously increase profits .
By 1950 the Big Three offered their customers 243 different new car models .
During this period new model changes were brought forward from three years per model to two years .
With a major body change costing upwards of $ 200 million , by 1955 the Big Three controlled 94 % of the entire US market .
They were no longer under any pressure to reduce prices and in the decade of the 1950s prices rose an unprecedented 36 % to an average car price of $ 1822 .
Patriotism has always been utilised by business for selling its products .
With the Cold War in full swing the US auto industry and its representatives in government increasingly identified consumer choice with capitalism ( so - called ``democracy ’ ’ ) and the lack of consumer choice with communism .
In 1955 Chevrolet advertised its cars as ``empowerment and escape ’’ feeding on previous associations of the car and a very narrow concept of freedom .
The Cold War , the retreat from militancy of the labour leaders and the monopoly of big business ’ two political parties , gave a green light to the bosses to gouge their customers , the working class .
While average manufacturing profits between 1946 and 1967 rose a dramatic 9 % per year , GM ’s return on its investments were a stunning average of 21 % per year over the same period .
The 1964 Senate hearings on auto safety marked the beginning of the end of the blank cheque for big auto .
A GM spokesperson admitted that the company only spent $ 1.25 million on safety research and safety changes for its cars in 1963 .
When GM executives were then asked about their profit levels , they admitted they had hit $ 1.7 billion in the same year .
There was also a small backlash within the trend to super - sized cars .
In 1955 only 60,000 European cars , which tended to be significantly smaller than their US counterparts , were sold in the US .
By 1960 imports rose to 700,000 cars , slightly more than 10 % of the market .
The arrogance of the auto bosses towards the compact car and towards public pressure was best expressed by Henry Ford III who opposed making smaller models with his position that ``mini- cars make mini- profits ’’ .
Comments such as these increasingly irritated working people , leading the Wall Street Journal in the early 1970s to comment on ``the growing rebellion against cars ’’ .
The rebellion was as much against the car business as the product itself .
As pressure on the wages of working people increased , more women were returning to the work place .
Given the deliberately weak public transportation sector , more families were forced to buy more than one car .
In 1950 only 7 % of households owned more than one car , by 1970 29 % of all US families owned more than one car .
Beginning of the decline of the car
The massive proliferation of models exploded in the sixties .
By 1970 the Big Three offered 370 different models each year a 55 % increase in the number of models over 1960 .
Their obsession with perpetuating the myth of choice was beginning to undermine their own profits .
In the early days of auto production , from 1919 through 1930 , worker productivity increased on average 8.6 % per year .
Productivity gains collapsed in the 1960s to an average of 3 % per year .
The fall in productivity was in large part because of the vast multitude of models each of the three big automakers were producing and the massive investment this demanded .
The profit and productivity impasse of the early 1970s increased class tensions within the auto plants .
As the corporations sought to further automate and increase line speed they faced the resistance of the rank and file .
The bosses responded with harsh disciplinary measures and penalties against individuals .
It was this offensive that created a rebellion among young UAW rank and file such as at Lordstown , Ohio .
At Lordstown autoworkers were producing one car every 36 seconds .
It was the fastest assembly line in the world .
In 1972 Lordstown GM workers walked out over the barrage of disciplinary actions by management .
After the 22 - day strike a vast majority of workers were reinstated and charges against most workers dropped .
However , the fear of the rank and file and increasingly aggressive bosses helped push the UAW bureaucracy in the direction of its current class collaborationist policy of team work .
Through the Team Concept the bosses were able to win increased cooperation from their workforce , which in turn increased job speed and alienation on the job .
The long lines outside gas stations during the 1973 oil crisis shifted working - class opinion further against the auto industry .
This in turn led to increased regulations on cars , particularly for fuel efficiency .
The phrase , ``gas guzzler`` was born .
As the auto corporations were increasingly perceived as socially irresponsible , they were forced to decrease the size of their monster cars .
Detroit was forced to make a large foray into the compact car market .
The industry then waited in the wings for the environmentalism and oil fears of the 1970s to die down .
The coming of the SUV
The economic boom of the 1980s , politically expressed through the election and re-election of US President Ronald Reagan , took the heat off corporations and the demand for government regulation .
The Vietnam era was to be buried and an escapism not seen since the 1920s ensued .
This was the background to the emergence of the world ’s all time most wasteful and unsafe version of the motor car : the sports utility vehicle ( SUV ) .
Once an obscure model , the SUV with its passenger car body and truck frame came into the mainstream , albeit the high end of the mainstream .
The SUV became the savior for the Big Three .
The vast majority of US auto profits in the 1990s were from their light truck and SUV models .
Sports utility vehicles have increasingly come to symbolise all that is wrong and wasteful about the current economy .
Like the boom of the 1950s the auto - industrial complex exploited the rise in disposable incomes that the housing equity boom created to sell more cars to each person .
An average sedan in the last 10 years would typically weigh about 3000lbs [ 1360 kg ] .
The average SUV often weighs over 6000lbs [ 2700 kg ] .
The ``green`` capitalists at Toyota sell hundreds of thousands of their Sequoia SUV , which weighs in at 6500 lbs [ 2948 kgs ] .
The home equity crash has essentially ended the heyday of SUV sales .
It is no coincidence that capitalism ’s two most important consumer commodities : the privately owned house and the private car are going into a crisis at the same time .
Both products represent a way of life that is individualised and wasteful and a social construct that cannot be sustained by the planet Earth .
When the Model T was launched 100 years ago , it could travel 20 - 22 miles per gallon [ approx 9.3 km / litre ] .
Over a century of automaking later , the most popular car models were less fuel efficient .
Hummers and Escalades of recent years have city gas mileage of around 10 miles per gallon [ 4.25 km / litre ] .
The waste of fuel energy and the pumping of polluting and global - warming emissions into the air would have been negligible at the turn of the last century when there were 8000 registered cars in the US .
Today there are 231 million registered cars in the US .
China has now surpassed Japan as the number two consumer of automobiles and there may be 100 million cars on China ’s roads before the decade is out .
Thirty - eight million cars were sold globally in 1995 .
Last year that increased to 49 million cars .
US automobiles are second only in carbon dioxide production to coal - burning power plants .
US cars currently account for 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year .
No carbon - offsetting can remove this level of pollution .
The US would have to plant 55 billion trees every year to undo this level of emissions .
And with China attempting to mirror the road of US capitalism , tomorrow ’s world resources will be stretched to unmanageable levels .
At the turn of the previous century the electric car was essentially abandoned because of its 50 - mile [ 80 - kilometre ] limit on one charge , today it is making a small comeback .
The rise in sales of electric cars and the more popular petrol - electric hybrids will certainly slow down the rate of damage to the planet .
These sales still represent a negligible percentage of the car market .
Any car , petrol or electric is still essentially about 3000lbs [ 1360 kgs ] of automobile being moved around for often only one human being .
The hoopla around hybrid cars is a part of a wider increase in products of green capitalism .
They are linked with the notion that individuals can opt out of a huge mass polluting system and that the huge consumption of the past can continue in an environmentally sustainable way .
In this world , big capitalism continues to makes its profits , markets continue to expand and people feel better about the environment .
Yet the pace of global warming is unimpeded .
In the last analysis , any mass - produced ``green ’’ car still stands in opposition to public transport and the fundamental social changes necessary to save the planet .
The car ’s nemesis : public transportation
Aside from the social and environmental factors , there have been few products that have in themselves been more lethal than the automobile .
While studies have proven that bus travel is 170 times safer than car travel , some 120 people a day in the US continue to die from traffic accidents involving private cars .
The auto industry has continued to try and sell more safety to wealthier car buyers , but human error with 231 million individual drivers is impossible to remove .
The rise of the automobile was accompanied by the collapse of public transport .
Public transport did not shrink because of its inability to economically compete with the car .
There was a campaign by the auto - industrial complex to defeat and bury public transportation .
With the growth of industry and jobs , public transport in the United States increased alongside the increase in cars .
Public transport peaked with an average of 166 passenger rides per year per head of population .
By 1956 , with compliant support of capitalist politicians , the number of riders was halved .
Neighbourhoods were developed that had no public transport access , forcing more people to buy cars .
By 1973 US public transport ridership hit its post - war low of 31 rides per year per person .
Today that figure has only slightly recovered to about 35 rides per person per year .
At the beginning of the 1920s , 90 % of travel was by rail , chiefly electric rail .
Only one in 10 Americans owned a car .
Virtually every city and town in the US with more than 2500 people had its own electric rail system .
General Motors used its massive profits over a 30 - year period to kill these light rail systems .
GM bought up rail companies and ran them into the ground .
They also introduced bus lines that would follow the same route as trains and trams , offering lower fares .
The extensive light rail systems of New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington DC , St Louis , Salt Lake City , Sacramento , San Diego and Oakland were all smashed by GM money .
A Los Angeles Railway streetcar
Los Angeles , as the youngest of the US mega cities , may have fared the worst of all .
The Los Angeles Railway operated the majority of the city ’s 1500 streetcars .
In May 1945 , GM ’s front organisation , American City Lines , bought 59 % of LA Railway ’s stock .
In the same month LA Railway announced its plan to scrap most of its streetcar lines .
The destruction of public transport , particularly electric rail systems , was not only a massive waste of resources , but perhaps the biggest single contribution to increasing pollution and climate change in global history .
General Motors , as the world ’s biggest corporation , made the decision for this process , privately , on its board of directors .
There was no popular vote for this policy .
It was capitalist ``democracy ’’ in action .
The reverberations from the destruction of public transport are many sided .
The shrinking of public transport also contributed to the racially segregated poverty of urban areas .
Professor Evelyn Blumenburg ’s UCLA study of jobs and public transit in Los Angeles in the last decade shows that residents of Watts who have access to a private car are 59 times more likely to get a job than those dependent on public transport .
The future
Capitalism and its blind gallop for profits has brought the planet to where it is today .
The private automobile was one of its greatest vehicles for profit .
The current and future inhabitants have to deal with the world as it has been inherited .
The past will continue on if it is not contested .
Democrat and Republican politicians pay lip service to the environment , but being bought and paid for by big business they only offer small measures that will not save the planet .
The world is currently run by the wolves in the coop .
The General Motors , the Chevrons , the Citibanks still continue to make the real decisions about world ’s future .
These companies will not put humanity or the planet ahead of the race for profits .
To remove this obstacle to a sustainable future a social and political revolution is necessary .
Working - class people need to take the wheel and re-organise society in the interests of the great majority .
A future of massive light rail expansion is one alternative .
Every city , every region and nationally , travel by light electric rail would dramatically curb auto emissions .
However , if this led to bigger and bigger coal - fired electricity power stations , then the gains for the environment could all be lost .
Some argue that nuclear power may need to be re-examined .
In France , 75 % of its electricity comes from nuclear power .
This raises two issues : operational safety and waste storage .
The Cherynobl nuclear disaster released an equivalent toxicity into the air of 200 Hiroshima bombs .
And there still appears to be no long - term solutions to storing nuclear waste .
The big auto - industrial corporations along with the big banks need to be brought under public ownership .
The industrial resources and productive capacity of big auto should be converted into socially useful production as a part of a democratic plan that working - class people should generate .
In the 13th century Roger Bacon , the social philosopher , predicted that ``Man will we able to build a carriage that moves at miraculous speed without horses or other draft animals ’’ .
Human society has moved past that stage now and should move forward toward its only possible future : a collective one , with a collective - oriented transport system .

Appendix
Labor ’s Militant Voice Environmental Platform
A planned socialist economy based on immediate human needs rather than the senseless drive for profits , would solve many of today ’s key environmental problems according to the following platform .
1. Mass integrated transit systems .
A mass integrated public transit system linking urban , suburban and rural areas together through energy efficient and affordable transportation .
[ With such ] an integrated transportation system , controlled by working people today , market pressures would be eliminated in order to provide safe and efficient travel for the inhabitants of the region .
In times of natural disaster and emergency , such a transit system would respond more effectively and responsively to human needs , as during a major earthquake or tsunami .
2. Energy .
A program to develop and further investigate renewable and alternative energy sources .
Research into technologies which promote hydrogen , solar , wind and hyrdo- electric power sources .
A rational plan of energy use and production would call for an overall decrease in the use of stored energy of any kind to meet the general needs of society .
The generation of energy for public consumption by industrial plants under private ownership , which today contribute greatly to carbon emissions , as well as airborne , water and soil toxicity , would be eliminated and replaced with power generation facilities under community control .
In order to further reduce public energy consumption and waste , a program of socialised domestic food production , and sanitation could be implemented through organisations of community control .
3. Agriculture and food production .
Growing food crops and cattle raising without the use of induced pesticides , artificial hormones or genetically modified organisms foreign to a particular environment .
The natural fertility of the soil and ground water could be sustained through methods of crop rotation and stepped irrigation , as practiced in agricultural societies for thousands of years .
Modern - day methods of geological survey and research , now largely in the service of private corporations , could be used to more efficiently and rationally plan usage of natural resources .
The necessity of chemical preservatives to keep food fresh for transport and storage , would be eliminated by having food produced locally and according to the immediate needs of the population .
4. Housing and urban development .
Population centres which are appropriate to the needs and resources of the human inhabitants could be democratically planned along with transportation , energy and food production .
Development of new housing would be according to the immediate circumstances of society , and not on market speculation .
The necessity of long - distance travel , and traffic between home and work , would be eliminated through the conversion of available materials and building construction into a program of affordable housing for all workers and their families .
John C.
Yoo likes the limelight , but it ’s causing him some grief .
Of the half a dozen lawyers who played important roles in a Bush administration decision to legalize the use of highly coercive interrogation techniques , only Yoo has emerged as the public face -- and target -- related to the policy .
In 2002 and 2003 , Yoo was second in command at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel and wrote two memos , one for Alberto R. Gonzales and one for the Pentagon , that provided broad legal authority for the use of extreme measures in the questioning of wartime detainees .
In one famous phrase , the memo to Gonzales concluded that only techniques “ equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death , ” could be considered torture .
The 81 - page Pentagon memo , declassified April 1 , contained similar language and added fuel to the fire over torture and the White House .
Through it all , Yoo has defended his position in the media .
Yoo is now a tenured professor at UC Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall .
Recently , the National Lawyers Guild launched a campaign to have him fired because of his role in the torture issue .
This move has touched off a controversy , especially among legal academics concerned about tenure and academic freedom .
Boalt Hall Dean Christopher Edley Jr. posted a response on the school ’s website in which he criticized the torture memos but defended Yoo :
He was merely a “ legal advisor ” ; real culpability rested with those who directed or implemented the administration ’s program , not with Yoo .
Edley saw no basis on which Yoo could be charged with a crime .
He quoted university guidelines under which the “ commission of a criminal act which has led to conviction in a court of law ” provides the basis for dismissal of a tenured professor .
It ’s easy to understand the concern that academics have .
If Yoo were fired on the strength of a public outcry about his ideas on torture , it could send a chill through academia .
America ’s strengths as a nation include the preservation of an atmosphere in higher education that encourages the free expression of ideas , even radical and highly unpopular ones .

But does academic freedom really sit at the heart of this controversy ?
It ’s not Yoo ’s ideas in an academic setting that give rise to his current problems but his conduct as a government lawyer .
Yoo says that he was asked his opinion about technical legal issues related to interrogation and detainee treatment during wartime , and he gave it his best shot .
He also argues that he strained to give policymakers and actors the greatest possible latitude in which to manage a difficult conflict .
But he only advised and theorized ; others took the decision to implement the program .
But Yoo ’s account of how and why the torture memos were crafted may not hold up .
Congress is preparing hearings into the subject , and they have invited Yoo to testify .
International law scholar Philippe Sands and other writers have punched holes in Yoo ’s claims about the facts .
It increasingly appears that the Bush interrogation program was already being used before
Yoo was asked to write an opinion .
He may therefore have provided after - the - fact legal cover .
That would help explain why Yoo strained to take so many implausible positions in the memos .
It also appears that government lawyers had told Bush administration officials that some of the techniques already in use were illegal , even criminal .
In fact , a senior Pentagon lawyer described to me exchanges he had with Yoo in which he stressed that those using the techniques could face prosecution .
Yoo notes in his Pentagon memo that he communicated with the Criminal Division of the Justice Department and got assurances that prosecutions would not be brought .
The question becomes , was Yoo giving his best effort at legal analysis , or was he attempting to protect the authors of the program from criminal investigation and prosecution ?
In any case , Yoo kept the program running .
Even the man who came in to run the Office of Legal Counsel after Yoo ’s departure , Jack Goldsmith , has written that he understood Yoo ’s project this way .
Goldsmith also rescinded Yoo ’s memos .
Advertisement
According to Human Rights First , more than 100 people have died in U.S. detention in the war on terrorism .
It documented 11 cases where the deaths resulted from coercive interrogation techniques , and others where there was at least some connection .
Yoo insists that there is no relationship between the deaths and his advice , because he did n’t set policy or carry it out , he merely offered a legal opinion .
But had he refused to give the opinion that was sought , the program might have been suspended and some of those detainees might be alive .
Much of the legal work surrounding the torture memos was done in the shadows .
It ’s possible that when all the facts about their preparation and use come out , Yoo will be exonerated .
But the criminal law and ethical issues surrounding his work on the memos are very serious .
Is it right to say that lawyers dispensing bad advice in memos face no liability for what happens when people act in reliance on them ?
At the end of World War II , the U.S. took a different view in one narrow area .
When the legal advice had to do with the treatment of detainees in wartime , the U.S. argued , lawyers had to adhere closely to the law or face prosecution .
In one case , two German Justice Ministry lawyers were charged and sentenced to 10 years in prison for giving advice that allowed the creation of a special internment system for suspected insurgents .
Their advice was close to that dispensed by Yoo .
The Bush administration came to Washington promising a culture of accountability .
In this area , as in so many others , it has delivered just the opposite .
Just a quick email to say I ’m having a great time here in Ghana .
The host family are just wonderful !
I did n’t actually think it was possible to PUT ON weight in Africa , but there you go , you learn something new every day .
The heat is still taking some getting used to and I seem to be taking regular naps after working in the orphanage .
I have met another Cosmic Volunteer there , young Anna from the States .
I ’ve made some really great friends and am ’ embracing ’ the Ghanaian way ( e.g I can now eat very well just using my hands ! ) .
My Coordinator Mr. Donkah has been an excellent guide , taking time off to show me the sights and the ways of Ghana .
Definitely eased me into this Ghanaian way of life !
Thank you !
Thanks for accepting me on this programme .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Too young to retire , too old to get a new job .
That 's how many older workers are feeling these days .
While it 's not easy to land a job in this weak economy , older workers are in a particularly tough spot .
Corporate downsizings are hitting this group hard , with many companies looking to shed the higher - paid positions these employees often occupy .
Even worse , older job seekers are discovering the search is even rougher as many employers shy away from hiring those closer to retirement than to the start of their careers .
The downsizings come at a bad time for older workers .
Not only can't they afford to retire , but many were counting on beefing up their 401 ( k ) accounts in the years before they exit the labor force .
Compounding the problem is the slumping stock market , which has left them with a deflated 401 ( k ) cushion to draw on while looking for a new post .
" There are tons of folks out there who cannot afford to live once they 've faced that involuntary layoff , " said Renee Ward , founder of Seniors4 Hire.org , an online community for older workers and companies looking to hire them .
" And it takes them a little longer to find a suitable position . "
Facing downsizing
To be sure , workers of all ages are suffering as companies trim their payrolls .
The national unemployment rate has jumped to 5 % , up from 4.5 % a year ago .
But older workers are increasingly getting the corporate ax these days .
Among the unemployed age 55 to 64 , nearly 42 % had been fired or laid off , up from 32.2 % a year ago , according to federal statistics for April .
The figures are even grimmer for those age 65 and older , with 23.5 % getting laid off , up from 10.4 % in 2007 .
These older workers saw the largest percentage point increases of any age group during that time period .
Overall , the unemployment rate for those age 55 to 64 stayed relatively stable at 2.7 % , largely because fewer workers opted to leave their jobs or re-enter the job search .
The rate for those age 65 - plus ticked up a bit to 3.5 % as more also chose to resign .
" When the market goes down , the more senior people are the first to go , " said Ellen Gottlich , president of Forty Plus of New York , which helps executives and professionals find new jobs .
After they get the pink slip , older workers spend more time on the unemployment line .
Many lack the skills to search for jobs in today 's online world and to craft resumes and cover letters , experts say .
And too often , they are told they are overqualified .
Take Dale Booth .
Since being laid off from a computer business systems analyst post at National City Corp. in October , the 54 - year - old resident of Medina , Ohio , has sent out hundreds of resumes .
He 's gone to recruiting agencies and even had his daughter forward his resume to the human resources manager at the hospital where she works .
So far , he 's had only one interview .
About 90 % of the time , he gets no response and the other 10 % he gets a form letter thanking him for applying .
His age , he thinks , is a factor because companies are concerned older workers wo n't stick around and have higher medical costs .
Also , though he has told recruiters his salary requirement is $ 50,000 - $ 35,000 less than he made at National City - Booth thinks employers view him as a costly hire .
" At my age and experience , there 's an expectation that they 'll have to pay me more , " said Booth , who is married with three grown daughters .
Hunting hard to find new job
It took those age 55 and older an average of 21.1 weeks to land a new job in 2007 , about five weeks longer than their younger counterparts , according to AARP .
" Clearly older workers will be more adversely affected because of the time it takes to transition into another job , " said Deborah Russell , AARP 's director of workforce issues .
During the recession of the early 1990s , older workers were hit hard by mass layoffs .
Concerned this is happening again , AARP is reaching out to companies conducting the large - scale downsizings and giving them tip sheets to distribute to older workers .
The handouts aim to help workers navigate today 's job market by explaining search methods such as online employment boards and the importance of networking .
Many older workers are taking jobs below their pay scale because it's all they can find , said Ward of Seniors4 Hire , which is experiencing a greater demand for its services .
She 's seen an experienced telecom worker making $ 65,000 a year accepting a customer service position in satellite companies making $ 11 an hour .
While Ward can find companies willing to hire older workers , many of her listings are for part - time jobs , sales positions , retail clerks or customer service reps .
Even then , it can be hard for these job seekers to get hired .
" A lot of people are told they are overqualified , " she said .
While some may think those older than age 55 can just retire , it 's not a viable option for many , said Steven Sass , co-author of " Working Longer , " a new book looking at delaying retirement .
Many Americans simply can't afford to stop working that young , he said .
" Most people do n't have enough money , " Sass said .
" If they are going to have a comfortable retirement , they are really going to have to stay in the labor force .
But it 's tough to get a job when you 're old ... especially in a recession . "
Chuck Dunn knows he can't afford to retire .
The 56 - year - old has had no choice but to liquidate his retirement account after losing his product development job with a high - end electronics manufacturer in October .
Now he 's considering selling his house before he becomes a foreclosure statistic .
But Dunn also can't find a job , despite sending out several hundred resumes .
He 's contacted those he knows in the industry , scoured online jobs sites and worked with his local employment commission with no success .
" This is very frustrating for me since I am in my middle 50s and was trying to save money for my retirement , not destroy my savings , " said Dunn , a bachelor who lives in Holly Springs , N.C .

It is being reported that retired military leaders is one of the categories being looked at by the Obama campaign ’s vetting team , so with this in mind , I have compiled a list of five retired military leaders that Obama might consider .
1 ) . Jim Webb – If Obama decides to pick a running mate with political and military experience , then Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) should be at the top of the list .
Webb is a decorated Vietnam veteran , who prior to being elected to the Senate , was a Republican who served in the Reagan administration in the 1980s first as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs then as Secretary of the Navy .
Webb ’s area of specialization is primarily military issues .
Webb also hails from a critical swing state , and has more than enough of a military resume to go up against John McCain .
2 ) . Wesley Clark – Should Obama desire a running mate with an outstanding military resume who was also a supporter of Hillary Clinton , then he could turn to Wesley Clark , who is a retired Army four star general who spent 34 years in the military .
Clark rose to national prominence as Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO from 1997 - 2000 .
Clark was the commander of Operation Allied Force during the Kosovo war .
Previously Clark was the Director , Strategic Plans and Policy on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1994 - 1996 .
Clark is from Arkansas , and could help Obama in the South .

3 ) . Gen. Tony McPeak – McPeak is currently an advisor to the Obama campaign .
McPeak served as Air Force Chief of Staff under President George H.W. Bush , and he assisted in the planning of Operation Desert Storm , and was the Chief of Staff for Operation Desert Shield .
He oversaw the major reshaping and reduction of the Air Force after the end of the Cold War.
McPeak served as the Oregon state chair of the Bob Dole campaign in 1996 , and supported George W. Bush in 2000 .
McPeak broke with Bush over the invasion of Iraq , and was an advisor to John Kerry in 2004 .
4 ) . Gen. Hugh Shelton – Shelton is another retired general who is best known as a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1997 - 2001 .
He is a Vietnam vet , who once commanded the 82nd Airborne , and also led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti .
Shelton was promoted to Commander in Chief of U.S. Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) .
On the political front , he was an advisor to John Edwards during his 2004 campaign , and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2008 .
5 ) . Gen. Colin Powell –
There is no evidence that Powell would like to return to politics after a tenure as George W. Bush ’s Secretary of State that must have left a bad taste in his mouth .
Powell served as Ronald Reagan ’s National Security Advisor from 1987 - 1989 , and was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from 1989 - 1993 .
Powell has long advocated that military action only be used as a last resort , after the failure of diplomacy and containment .
Powell is a pro-choice Republican , and he is the only Bush administration figure who has remained popular , but Powell is still a Republican , and it is extremely unlikely that he would cross over to be on Obama ’s ticket .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - About 20 percent of the U.S. population delayed or were unable to get access to medical care when they needed it in 2007 , up from 14 percent four years earlier , a study released on Thursday found .
About 9.5 million more people went without medical care in 2007 , compared with 2003 , the nationally representative survey released by the Center for Studying Health System Change , a nonpartisan policy group , found .
In a striking finding , the survey said although those without insurance were more likely to report going without care , those with insurance had a greater percentage increase in unmet medical needs .
“ It ’s not a pretty picture , especially for insured people , who are increasingly finding that the access to care once guaranteed by insurance is declining , ” said Peter Cunningham , co-author of the study , which was funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , which provides grants for projects aimed at improving U.S. health care .
The telephone survey of 18,000 people was based on a random national sample with 43 percent of those polled responding .
Cost was the biggest obstacle to care for both the insured and the uninsured , the study said .
For the insured , individuals said they were unable to get their health insurer to pay for treatment , or that a doctor or hospital would not accept their insurance .
About 47 million people in the United States do not have health insurance , a number that has been climbing since 2000 .
At the same time , medical costs - driven by drugs , hospital and doctor fees -- have risen at least twice the rate of inflation for several years , making it more expensive for those with insurance to afford care .
UnitedHealth Group , WellPoint Inc. and Aetna Inc. are the three biggest U.S. health insurers .
The British government appears to be running out of patience with ISPs as they struggle to come to an agreement with the music industry on P2P music piracy .
One ' top - level ' ISP executive says " The British government just put a gun to our head . "
Major ISPs are now in " serious " talks with the music industry .
Recently we reported on the agreement between UK ISP Virgin Media and the British Phonographic Industry to start sending out warnings to Virgin ’s subscribers who the BPI accuse of uploading copyright music .
Now , according to a Digital Music News report , the British government has started urgently applying pressure to prominent ISPs to find a solution to the ‘ problem ’ of file - sharing .
The pressure includes a threat to bring in new laws , should ISPs and the music industry not come to a solution of their own .
The government previously set a deadline of April 2009 for the parties to reach an agreement but according to sources , pressure is intensifying to deal with the issue sooner .
A “ top - level executive ” gave an indication of the level of pressure stating : “ The British government just put a gun to our head . ”
According to what DMN describe as “ top - level ” and other “ executive ” sources , the music industry and major ISPs including BT , Carphone Warehouse , Tiscali and Virgin Media are now involved in “ serious negotiations ” over how to deal with what they perceive to be a serious threat to their business model .
Andy Burnham , Culture Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament is said to be playing a prominent role after tough comments earlier in the year : “ Let me make it absolutely clear : this is a change of tone from the government , ” Burnham told the FT .
“ It ’s definitely serious legislative intent . ”
At the London Calling event last week – billed as ‘ the UK ’s premier international music business event ’ – sources confirmed meetings between the music industry and ISPs .
It ’s believed that ISPs are being negotiated with individually , rather than as a group .
“ All of the ISPs are at the table meeting with the rights holders , but it ’s not a roundtable , ” said a source .
Current CEO of British Music Rights and former pop star Feargal Sharkey said he was optimistic at the discussions between the music industry and ISPs : “ At this moment , I am completely optimistic .
Three months ago these guys would n’t even get into the same room . ”
It ’s unclear what could happen if the music industry and ISPs fail to reach an agreement , as Culture Secretary Andy Burnham has already stepped back from a government implemented ‘ 3 strikes and you ’re out ’ policy .
For their part , ISPs are only too aware of the profit they make from file - sharers .
If the latest reports are to be believed , around 6 million Brits use their internet connection for file - sharing .
Alienating them could be a huge strategic error .

Hillary Clinton Plays the Gender Card ….. Again
In typical Clinton fashion , Hillary is now blaming sexist America for her short - comings in this presidential race .
From this article comes the following Hillary Clinton Quote :
“ I think a lot of women project their own feelings and their lives onto me , and they see how hard this is .
It ’s hard .
It ’s hard being a woman out there .
It is obviously challenging with some of the things that are said that are not even personal to me so much as they are about women .
“ And I think women just sort of shake their head , ” Clinton continued .
“ My friends do .
They say , ‘ Oh , my gosh , this is so hard . ’
Well , it ’s supposed to be hard .
I ’m running for the hardest job in the world .
No one has ever done this .
No woman has ever won a presidential primary before I won New Hampshire .
This is hard .
And I do n’t expect any sympathy , I do n’t expect any kind of , you know , allowances or special privileges , because I knew what I was getting myself into .
“ Every so often I just wish that it were a little more of an even playing field , ” she said , “ but , you know , I play on whatever field is out there . ”
Nothing is ever the Clinton ’s fault , they are always victims .
This time Hillary is a victim of sexism , while her husband was the victim of the cast right wing conspiracy .
Just once it would be nice to see a Clinton stand up and accept responsibility for their shortcomings and wrongdoings .
JUST ONCE !
It should come as no surprise though that Hillary is claiming to be a victim , after all the left has promoted this whole nobody - is - to - blame - everybody - is - a - victim mentality that has crept into American society , so why should n’t she be able to lay claim to the same type of victimization that she and the like have fostered throughout American culture ?
It just really is sad to see a person who is running for president stoop to such lows .
Actually , it is n’t sad , it is remarkably enjoyable .
Does n’t it seem as though with Hillary ’s 35 years of fighting for the poor , the children , the minorities , and the women , that she would have managed to help level the playing field that she claims is so lopsided against her ?
But the prospect that the agreement might lower barriers to sending personal information to the United States government has alarmed some privacy rights advocates in Europe .
While some praised the principles laid out in the draft text , they warned that it was difficult to tell whether the agreement would allow broad exceptions to such limits .
For example , the two sides have agreed that information that reveals race , religion , political opinion , health or “ sexual life ” may not be used by a government “ unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards . ”
But the accord does not spell out what would be considered an appropriate safeguard , suggesting that each government may decide for itself whether it is complying with the rule .
“ I am very worried that once this will be adopted , it will serve as a pretext to freely share our personal data with anyone , so I want it to be very clear about exactly what it means and how it will work , ” said Sophia in ’t Veld , a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands who has been an outspoken advocate of privacy rights .
The Bush administration and the European Commission have not publicized their talks , but they referred to their progress in a little - noticed paragraph deep in a joint statement after a summit meeting between President Bush and European leaders in Slovenia this month .
Issued June 10 , the statement declared that “ the fight against transnational crime and terrorism requires the ability to share personal data for law enforcement , ” and called for the creation of a “ binding international agreement ” to aid such transfers while also ensuring that citizens ’ privacy is “ fully ” protected .
The negotiators are trying to agree on minimum standards to protect privacy rights , such as limiting access to the information to “ authorized individuals with an identified purpose ” for looking at it .
If a government ’s policies are “ effective ” in meeting all standards , any transfer of personal data to that government would be presumed lawful .
For example , European law sets up independent government agencies to police whether personal data is being used lawfully and to help citizens who are concerned about invasions of their privacy .
The United States has no such independent agency .
But in a concession , the Europeans have agreed that the American government ’s internal oversight system may be good enough to provide accountability for how Europeans ’ data is used .

As noted below , in response to this column by Paul Krugman on the failure of food safety regulation in recent years , questions have been raised about whether food borne disease outbreaks have been increasing or decreasing .
Here 's Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution :
Krugman gets a Rotten Tomato , by Alex Tabarrok : Paul Krugman is attacking Milton Friedman ( again ) for rotten tomatoes ... :
Lately , however , there always seems to be at least one food - safety crisis in the headlines — tainted spinach , poisonous peanut butter and , currently , the attack of the killer tomatoes .
How did America find itself back in The Jungle ?
I was curious so I collected data from the Center for Disease Control on Foodborne Disease Outbreaks from 1998 - 2006 .
The data only go back to 1998 because in that year the CDC changed its surveillance system creating a discontinuity but note that we are covering a chunk of the Clinton years and are well within the time frame over which Krugman says the safety system has degenerated .
Here 's the result :
What we see is a lot of variability from year to year but a net downward trend .
You can also look at cases per year which are more variable but also show a net downward trend .
No evidence whatsoever that we are back " in The Jungle . "
Mathew Yglesias says :
... isn't the pattern of spiking in even years and declining in odd years sort of strange ...
I am going to turn this over to a food economist the the U.S. Food Policy Blog :
Marginal Revolution covers food safety , by Parke Wilde : Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution gives Paul Krugman a hard rap on the knuckles for criticizing federal food safety regulators without noting the relevant data .
Krugman 's recent column describes a crisis of foodborne illness outbreaks , while Tabarrok points out CDC statistics showing that at least some kinds of outbreaks have n't increased .
Still , the CDC data are n't the whole story .
Here is my comment : ... I try to ignore the ideologues .
On the one hand , Grover Norquist and Milton Friedman have hopes for market incentives that are not only unrealistic , they are very far from the current state of good contemporary economic thought on food safety .
On the other hand , I give little weight to critics who hold out unrealistic expectations for government prevention of all food safety risks , not so much because they care about food safety , but because they just have large ambitions for government interventions in the economy .
Current economic thought draws on a fairly specific diagnosis of different kinds of imperfect information , each of which calls for a different policy response , which can range from laissez faire to labeling to testing to regulation .
A standard mainstream -- or even somewhat conservative -- text on the economics of food safety is John Antle 's book on food safety .
It acknowledges market failures in food safety , and particularly recognizes the need for strong government regulation of food - borne pathogens , because in many cases consumers cannot recognize the safety of the food even after purchase , and hence cannot defend their own interests in the marketplace .
In my reading , ... on foodborne disease [ Antle ] seems to me closer to Krugman than Friedman .
There are some exciting private market innovations in food safety recently .
For example , the buyers for major supermarket chains are getting more sophisticated in demanding safety from their suppliers , which allows the market to achieve good outcomes that individual consumers could not command on their own .
At the same time , it is fair to say USDA and FDA oversight of food safety have fallen far short of a balanced position .
The CDC stats on outbreaks have a number of shortcomings , and do n't suffice to make me think otherwise .
Take something like the USDA 's refusal to let Creekstone beef voluntarily test its own product for BSE .
...
The so - called " regulators " are way out of step with the public interest position of economists , even market economists who appreciate the market 's accomplishments on its good days .
Let me take this a step further .
Here are the actual data from the individual reports from the CDC ( the totals are shown in the graph from Alex 's post ) :
1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Bacterial 257 222 226 235 226 196 208 188 223 Chemical 48 32 37 52 46 54 47 40 53 Multiple 2 3 7 12 7 5 6 Parasitic 4 3 6 5 5 3 8 6 9 Viral 59 109 176 156 205 149 251 170 337 Confirmed 368 368 448 455 494 409 519 410 623 Suspected 275 Unknown 946 976 969 783 838 663 800 572 349 Total 1314 1344 1417 1238 1332 1072 1319 982 1247
When I look at these data , it 's hard to find any consistent trends .
The increase in confirmed cases appears , for the most part , to be due to an increase in confirmed viral outbreaks , but it 's hard to know whether the increase is more actual cases , which would be worrisome , or just better technology at identifying them .
For the rest of the confirmed cases , there is not that much of a pattern .
But no matter what the trends in confirmed cases say , with more than half the cases due to unknown causes and so much variation in the number of unknown etiologies , it 's hard to know how to interpret the overall figures shown in the graph above as a rebuttal to Krugman .
Stepping away from the data for a moment , and given their quality that may be wise , the larger issue is whether the government should intervene and regulate food markets to promote safety , or follow Friedman 's advice and let the private sector take care of the problem .
The market failure due to asymmetric information identified above , and the advice of experts in the area make a compelling case for regulation .
Update : Tyler Cowen , Alex Tabarrok , and others have asked in comments that I update the post to say that these data do not support Krugman .
Yes , that 's true , but it 's because these data are too noisy to support anything ( they suffer from a huge errors in variable problem that appears to be time - varying , and also appear to be heteroskedastic ) .
These data are of such poor quality that you can't conclude anything .
The trend could be rising , it could be flling , it could be constant , but these data can't tell us the answer .
So , the rebuttal argument seems to be as follows .
Someone ( Krugman ) makes a claim .
To check the claim , I go get really , really noisy data , run a regression , and say , " see - the hypothesis does n't stand up to the data ! "
That does n't seem very compelling to me .
Stupidity is as easy to find on the internet as shady home loans or male enhancement nostrums , as in this example , posted on the Paradise Post website by a guy who hides his identity behind the sobriquet of " Patriot . "
If I were this " patriot , " I 'd want to hide my identity , too .
" Who cares if the Earth gets warmer ? " he writes .
" I do n't .
If the polar bears go away like the dinosaurs , then that 's just the way it is .
If mankind goes away like the dinosaurs , then that 's just the way it is .
Something else will take our place as Mother Earth repairs herself , like it always has .
Just drive your SUV and enjoy it .
Burn your wood burning stoves ; mankind has burned wood since fire was discovered .
Eat your beef , even if cow flatulence is detrimental to our atmosphere .
If liberals had their way , we 'd all live in a bubble breathing filtered air .
You libbys should spend more of your energy worrying about people that take advantage of free government handouts , ripping off the working class , while they sit on their dead butts pissing their money away . "
Ol ' Patriot does n't have much use for the Christian idea that human beings should be good stewards of God 's creation , it seems .
He 'd rather we all just acted like swine , gobbling up all we can without regard for the mess we leave for our children .
In his view , WE are the children , heedlessly doing as we please without concern for the consequences .
But he does want us all to worry about " people that ( sic ) take advantage of free government handouts . "
On this we agree , though I get the distinct impression he is n't worried about the same people I 'm worried about .
Rather than worrying about those welfare recipients who might be fattening their bulging pocketbooks with taxpayer cash , I 'm a little more concerned about the two - fisted thievery of fat cats who are getting bailed out by the taxpayers , all those gazillionaire CEOs whose wise financial judgment has given us the subprime mortgage meltdown , all those beneficiaries of taxpayer largesse like the managers of Bear Stearns whose irresponsible and unregulated lending practices have put us all in a deep hole , but who will , thanks to the government , suffer no injury to their personal fortunes .
Instead of welfare queens trading food stamps for cigarettes , I 'm concerned about all those billions stolen by Halliburton , or all those big subsidies paid to corporate farms .
I 'm concerned about the billions in bribes handed out to various Iraqis in exchange for their promise not to shoot at our guys so much .
I 'm concerned about the no-bid contracts like the one paid to former Attorney General John Ashcroft , some $ 52 million to his consulting firm for who - knows - what essential government service .
I 'm concerned about the millions wasted to mail us all a note informing us that our benevolent government would soon be sending us all a little check as part of their " stimulus package " which our wise pols hope will revive an expiring economy .
But ol ' Patriot knows better .
Concerns about the future of the planet , like mine ( and maybe yours ) are just beside the point because Mother Earth will fix herself up after we 're extinct , though our species wo n't be here to see this new Garden of Eden Mother Earth will fashion out of old tires and aluminum cans .
The good news is that , though we 'll all be gone , that mass die - off will include the hated " libbys "
But " Patriot " is n't the only idiot who wants to share his thoughts .
Here 's another sub - par intelligence who signs in as " john , " sharing his insight :
" i.am happy dick cheney don.t care what you libs think .
you libs are bad for america .
do you know the meaning of bad .
b. stands for blacks a. stands for aliens and d. stands for democraps .
all you libs have is negativisam for the president of the u.s.a. " john
And , if that 's not dumb enough for you , here 's ol ' " Patriot " again , clarifying matters .
" If you do n't like capitolism , ( sic ) which by the way , this great country of ours was founded on , then move the hell out and find some socialist country where you 'll be happy , like the surrender **** of France .
Who are you to dictate what YOU think is too much profit on oil , or anything else for that matter ?
Remember , it 's a PRIVILAGE ( sic ) to drive a fossil fuel burning car , NOT a right , so quit complaining about oil , and move on .
Get a horse and sell your car , then you can bellyache all you want about the price of alfalfa and nobody will give a rat 's rearend .
God bless this country . "
It seems logical that guys like " Patriot " and " john " would be fans of our current president .
File them all under " like minds , " all showcasing complex and sophisticated thinking about the state of the world , three exemplars of a certain kind of stupidity that has been the hallmark of the 21st century thus far .
Maybe it 's time we tried intelligence for a change .
The stupidity option does n't seem to have worked too well thus far .
After nearly eight years of choosing stupidity as our guide , we 're utterly lost .
Our economy is in ruins , our foreign policy makes no sense to us , or to anyone else , our infrastructure and our institutions are breaking down , we 're deeply in debt , our currency is losing value , our news outlets tell us less and less of what we need to know , our commentators babble on about things that really do n't matter , our schools turn out students who know little about the world , either now or in the past .
Meanwhile , the crooks are robbing us blind and we are losing touch with what once made us the envy of the world .
Stupidity might have seemed like an easy and attractive choice , but it 's proving far too expensive .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Even Warren Buffett is wrong some of the time .
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is hoping this is one of them .
Buffett , the billionaire investor behind Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) , fingered " exploding " inflation Wednesday as the biggest risk to the economy .
" I think inflation is really picking up , " Buffett said on CNBC .
" It 's huge right now , whether it 's steel or oil , " he continued .
" We see it everywhere . "
Indeed , the prices of gasoline and milk have shot past $ 4 a gallon , and Dow Chemical ( DOW , Fortune 500 ) has announced twice in the past month that it 's raising prices to offset soaring commodity costs .
Yet Bernanke 's Fed signaled Wednesday that , after nine months of interest rate cuts and expansive lending to the financial sector , it is n't eager to reverse course and push rates higher to try to tamp down rising prices .
Why ?
Because the Fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy , leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases .
" The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year , " the Federal Open Market Committee said in holding the fed funds rate steady at 2 % , though it did note that " uncertainty " remains high and suggested inflation concerns could rise .
Depends on what you mean by ' inflation '
In part , the Fed 's decision turns on a distinction economists make between inflation and " relative - price changes . "
The former is a general loss of purchasing power that 's caused , or at least exacerbated by , overly lax monetary policy ( such as keeping interest rates too low for too long ) .
The latter are price hikes driven primarily by fundamental shifts in supply and demand .
If demand for commodities is spiking because of strong worldwide growth , the thinking goes , prices should rise accordingly , until consumers react by reducing consumption - a process that is n't apt to be influenced by interest rate changes .
The Fed is betting that rising prices wo n't feed through to higher general inflation expectations unless workers start demanding raises and companies start raising prices .
But wages have n't been rising sharply , and declining unionization means workers have less bargaining power than they did during the inflationary 1970s , economists say .
And while some processors of commodities , like Dow , are charging more , their customers in turn have generally been unable to pass along those costs to consumers .
So even as some members of the Fed 's policymaking body , such as Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher , warn of the need to take quick action against inflation - Fisher dissented for the third straight meeting in Wednesday 's vote , this time advocating a rate increase - committee members ' inflation forecast for 2010 has risen only slightly since October , despite surging oil prices .
" Oil prices have ratcheted up over the past nine years and the dollar has depreciated for more than six years .
Nevertheless , as long as a central bank is not creating an excessive amount of money , these relative price pressures ought to be transitory , " Sandra Pianalto , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee , explained in a speech last month .
" As consumers spend more money for higher - priced petroleum and agricultural goods , " she continued , " they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services .
Other relative prices must then fall . "
Wait and see
To be sure , there are other factors at work in the Fed 's move to the sidelines .
Bernanke & Co. wants to measure the stimulative effect of the rate cuts it 's already made .
The rate cuts of the past nine months - the Fed has slashed its overnight bank lending rate by 3.25 percentage points since September - will take time to impact the economy .
If possible , the Fed wants to wait before making another move on rates .
And while fears of a marketwide meltdown seem to have eased , a weak housing market , rising unemployment and increasing loan losses at banks mean the risk of a sharp economic pullback remains substantial .
" In an environment of dislocated funding markets , a rate cut would not produce a recovery but a rate hike could trigger a recession , " writes Tullett Prebon economist Lena Komileva .
Indeed , while inflation is the buzzword right now , the surge in fuel costs is hurting growth in some key industries .
Airlines such as United Airlines , a unit of UAL ( UAUA , Fortune 500 ) , and Continental ( CAL , Fortune 500 ) have set plans to eliminate thousands of jobs in response to soaring fuel costs .
Automakers Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) and General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) have slashed their production schedules as well , as consumers stopped buying the fuel - guzzling sport utility vehicles that were once a huge source of profits for Detroit .
The loss of high - paying pilot and autoworker jobs will only add to existing weak wage and job trends .
None of this makes the recent price shocks easier to bear , of course .
But for policymakers , if not for media darlings such as Buffett , the distinction is an important one .
" While sometimes devastating , " Pianalto said in her speech last month in Paris , " these global relative - price pressures are not the same thing as inflation . "
Tired of the same - old lame protests outside of abortion clinics ?
Looking to impose your religious beliefs in other people 's lives in a new and exciting way ?
The pro-life movement would like to expand your horizons .
On June 7th , the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that gave married people the right to use contraception , the American Life League , along with Pro-Life Wisconsin and Pharmacists for Life International Associate groups want you to join them in protesting in front of facilities that distribute birth control products .
The national day against contraception , Protest the Pill Day ' 08 : The Pill Kills Babies , was started to convince the American people of a simple and imaginative idea : attempting to prevent abortion is abortion too .
These arguments have been confounded by diabolical scientists and experts who insistently point out there 's no evidence to support that the birth control pill works the way these groups claim .
As we all know , however , if ideology waited for science to prove scientific points , our ancestors would have never have spent all those years wandering the then - flat earth .
The campaign website is chock full of important information and you do n't want to miss the informative " Talking Points " section .

Q : The Supreme Court has ruled that it's my right to privacy – who do you think you are to say otherwise ?

A : On June 7 , 1965 , the U.S. Supreme Court handed down the Griswold v. Connecticut decision .
The Supreme Court justices first presumed that previous Court decisions dealing with a citizen 's right to liberty and security that prohibited invasion of one 's home and acquisition of evidence that might later be used to convict him of a crime also addressed privacy within marriage .
In fact , the justices argued , " The concept of liberty is not so restricted … it embraces the right of marital privacy though that right is not mentioned explicitly [ emphasis added ] in the Constitution " and is based on " specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights [ which ] have penumbras , formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance . "
This confusing language , which has no relationship whatsoever to what the Founding Fathers intended , gave married women permission to use the birth control pill .
The Supreme Court literally created the " right to privacy " out of thin air .
We now know , beyond the shadow of a doubt , that not only did the Supreme Court literally make up the right that you claim gives you permission to use birth control , but the most popular form of birth control , the pill , can kill innocent preborn children .
If there is a chance that human beings are going to be murdered , I am going to do everything in my power to help prevent that from happening .
If you knew there was a chance that someone might poison your neighbor , do n't you think you would try to notify your neighbor and do as much as you could to help save a life ?
And before you despair that your right to privacy is being lost , take comfort in the knowledge that once we all finally live in a country where ideology is valued over evidence and our government is run by and for those who subscribe , or succumb , to the exciting agenda of these groups … privacy will no longer be needed .
Your point of view and way of life will , conveniently , be decided for you .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- President Robert Mugabe reiterated militant warnings on Saturday as the deputy leader of Zimbabwe 's main opposition party was brought to court on treason charges .
Appearing at a funeral for a war veteran in Harare , Mugabe issued a dire warning in an address broadcast over radio against the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
" We shall never , never accept anything that smells of ... the MDC , " Mugabe said .
" These pathetic puppets taking over this country ?
Let 's see .
That is not going to happen . "
A day earlier , Mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country 's liberation war will take up arms again to prevent the opposition party from taking power .
Mugabe told supporters that MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai would turn the country back over to white control if he won the runoff later this month .
The veterans he led in a successful effort against a government dominated by the white minority were not prepared to recognize a Tsvangirai victory , Mugabe said .
A presidential runoff election has been set for June 27 pitting long - time Mugabe against Tsvangirai .
There have been numerous reports from the opposition and church groups about kidnappings , torture and other violence , including the deaths of opposition party members .
They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party .
Tsvangirai has been detained several times in the weeks leading up to the runoff election -- most recently on Saturday with the 11 others .
National police arrested the dozen MDC members at a roadblock near Shurungwi , according to a party spokesman .
Meanwhile , Zimbabwean police brought opposition party secretary - general Tendai Biti to Zimbabwe 's High Court on Saturday after they received two court orders to do so , a journalist at the court said .
Biti briefly appeared before Justice Ben Hlatshwayo in the court , the journalist said .
The secretary - general wore leg irons and appeared " dejected and dull , " the reporter said .
His attorney , Lewis Uriri , described him as " unnaturally " reserved .
Still , it was a court appearance Biti 's lawyer had fought for and one that Zimbabwe 's national police appeared reluctant to comply with .
Police had initially questioned the validity of a court order for Biti to appear , but they finally complied with a second order to bring him to court two hours later , the reporter said .
Biti was scheduled to appear at the Magistrate 's court in Harare on Monday to formally face charges of treason and disseminating malicious falsehoods .
National police said the case against Biti is tied to a document published by his party , the Movement for Democratic Change , before the March 29 presidential election .
After the court proceeding , Biti was returned to police custody .
He was being held at Matapi Police Station , in Mbare , the oldest suburb of the capital city .
" Obviously , he was depressed because they are ( holding ) him for no reason , really , " said George Sibotshiwe , spokesman for Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
Sibotshiwe , who was detained for three hours himself on Saturday with Tsvangirai and 10 other people , called the charges against Biti , " ridiculous . "
However , he said , " We are happy with his appearance , " and alleged that he was not being fed .
Uriri said the government will allow him access to Biti , saying that his understanding from the state is " that we can have unconditional access to him . "
Biti said he did not have any complaints against police , the attorney said .
Police arrested Biti Thursday as he arrived in the Zimbabwean capital on a flight from South Africa .
A warrant had been issued for his arrest on June 6 , when he was abroad .
Though reports of violence have been common in Zimbabwe , there has been a significant uptick in attacks since the elections , which resulted in a bitter standoff .

News in Brief
The US government must do more to make radar systems and wind farms compatible , according to a group of independent scientific consultants .
The spinning blades of wind turbines are known to interfere with defence and weather radar systems .
As wind farms have proliferated , both the US and UK governments have sought to limit their growth ( see < i> Nature < / i > 428 , 111 ; 2004 ) .
But in the United States at least , the government would be better off working to develop regulations and new technologies that can ameliorate the problem , according to the JASONs , a group of academic researchers that advises US defence agencies on a range of issues .
For example , it may be possible to use telemetry data from the farms to lessen the effect , or to replace existing radar systems with more modern units that can handle the noise .
The government should invest in a research programme to find the best solution , the group concludes .
Bullied and miserable , Ewan Morrison developed a severe stutter at the age of 10 .
His father also stuttered for years following a secret childhood trauma .
So was there a link - and was the family history to blame ?
I pride myself on my strong voice .
I am loud and outspoken , and take pleasure in provoking people into speaking their minds .
My friends often catch me at it and ask me , quietly , to calm down .
What I have never told them is that when I was 10 I could barely say a single word for fear of stuttering .
I recall that horrific gasping for breath , my tongue tying itself in knots and my eyes searching the ceiling in shame as the jaw spasms started - all from trying to answer one simple question at the start of the school year : ' And your name is ... ?'
Ewan was hard to say , words starting with ah or oh sounds were easier , words starting with consonants - impossible .
There were techniques , of breathing and mental focus , that my father taught me , that sometimes helped or sometimes made it worse .
" Always take a breath before you start , do n't hold it in .
Think of the first sound , not the rest , and breathe it out . "
In the classroom , the humiliation was not mine alone .
There was a communal intake of breath before I tried to speak .
The whole room suffered with me .
Some covered their eyes , others started giggling , a kid in the back row often muttered " spastic " .
The teacher made it even worse , her eyes filled with pity , as I fought for breath .
I knew that she had been schooled in the philosophy that says you should never interrupt a stutterer - let him finish for himself .
As my father , David , had taught me .
A sufferer himself , he had been unable to speak from the age of 10 until 25 .
He is 66 now , and still stumbles on words .
I occasionally see his eyes flicker and avoid my gaze , as his fingers twitch and he reaches for breath .
I no longer stutter and find it traumatic to recall that time .
I have a son now , aged 10 , and am grateful that the condition has not passed again from father to son , as it can , virulently , through a family .
My father , having endured some of the most horrific experiments in the evolution of the science of speech impediments , confirms again and again that it is a psychological condition .
It starts from an initial trauma , then becomes its own trauma .
The one thing that my father has taught me , that I believe , is that stuttering always starts from " feared words " .
He has often told me the story of the first time he stuttered .
It was 1945 and a minister of the Church of Scotland , my grandfather Jacob Morrison , stood before his congregation in a church in Glasgow , and talked passionately against the war , of man 's inhumanity to man , and concluded that no real God could condone such suffering .
Before the congregation he had spent years building , he renounced his faith .
In the front row was his wife , Jessica , whose father had been a key figure in the Church of Scotland .
And beside her , her son ; my father .
He always cries when he recounts the story .
When my grandfather came home that night the door was barred to him .
Divorce was unheard of in that time among the church elite , but Jessica told her son that he was not , ever again , to mention his father 's name .
And so began my father 's 15 - year struggle to speak .
In the years that followed , his mother , embarrassed by his condition , took him to doctors and psychologists , quacks and faith healers .
Even to this day , the science of stuttering is caught up in the false idea that it is a biological condition , with DNA experiments and antipsychotic drugs .
Only one person , a speech therapist at my father 's school , sensed the truth , and quietly asked how things were at home .
My grandmother , on hearing about it , forbade her son from speaking to the therapist again .
I often think of my grandfather , alone at the lectern as his congregation abandoned him and his wife silently led her son away .
My father moved as far as he could from his past .
He was liberated by the 60s and became a hippy and , like his father , an atheist .
He went north , to the furthest extremity of Scotland , and worked hard to create a new life for his family .
I can only imagine his horror then , on discovering that his 10 - year - old son had developed a stutter .
The irony was that it was his desire to escape the past that brought it back .
It was the remote town we had gone to .
It was my middle - class hippy voice .
The kids at school called me " snob " , " Englisher " , " south mouther " .
They held me down and made me eat dirt .
They cornered me in the bike shed and hit me , making me repeat words in their local dialect so that they could laugh at my voice .
So began the twitching , nodding , blinking , the tensing of muscles or pinching of skin .
The fear of stuttering became the thing that made me stutter more .
I now know that stuttering is very much like a panic attack .
The one person who could have helped me was the one who made it worse .
I vividly recall the night , aged 12 and about to enter high school with a chronic stutter , when my father broke down and cried , told me about his father , and swore that history would not repeat itself : he would save me from it .
And in that moment , he implanted in me an even greater fear of words .
My father is still trapped in his father 's story .
He only found out later that his father had secretly followed his teenage years .
Whenever he 'd played rugby , Jacob had been there , silent at the sidelines .
The last time my father saw his father , Jacob was on his deathbed , dying of cancer - the only time his mother had let them meet after eight years apart .
Jacob 's last words were about rugby ; he told his son to fear no one , to get into the thick of it , scrum down , use your anger .
My father 's cure was multilayered : an increase in social responsibility and self - esteem , as well as singing lessons .
He never stuttered when he sang and so he developed the idea that he could " sing his words " .
He now has a loud booming voice and always begins his sentences as if starting an aria .
For me , the cure was an unexpected one .
My parents chose to play my condition down , to let time heal .
I was 10 when it started and 13 when it stopped .
The crucial turn - around years between primary school and high school , between childhood and adolescence .
In those years I was livid with rage and hatred .
I knew the answers to all the questions the teachers asked , but they always passed me over when asking the class .
Friends were few and played with me , I knew , only because of the things my parents had bought me to compensate , the fancy toys , the pool table .
I studied hard and was full of an almost apocalyptic vengeance .
I was a nobody , an embarrassment and dreamed often of destroying the entire town .
There was a nuclear power station 15 miles away and it was my recurring dream that I would laugh at them all as they were turned to dust in the mushroom cloud .
Then something amazing happened : puberty .
All of a sudden the bullies had voices breaking between falsetto and basso and the girls laughed at them , not me .
In that time when they fell , I learned a simple thing : just one word at a time .
How to win over the girls with a sly , wry observation .
The playing field was levelled and , being a late developer , I had the advantage .
I pointed at my enemies and said " dork " and the girls laughed .
Twenty - five years on , I have finally forgiven my grandfather and father for the legacy they passed on to me .
I see the positive in stuttering .
What psychologists are not allowed to say is that in stuttering there is a kind of rebellion .
My father 's stutter was the only weapon he had against his mother 's rule .
Mine in turn had been against the world my father had brought me into .
In many ways I still do what I did then with my little one - line snipes against the world .
I no longer stutter , but maybe still speak from the position of the angry outsider .
I no longer fear words .
If anything , I have overcompensated .
But if there is one thing I have learned from stuttering , it is that a single well - chosen word can expose hypocrisy .
The nuclear cloud has gone , but I am still wreaking my vengeance against those who think they know what they are talking about , those who believe everyone should think and talk as they do .
The silent suicidal boy is still by my side , urging me on .
In my years learning to cope I uncovered a fact that I find ironic and redemptive : in the 19th century , anthropologists and linguists scoured the world to find the origins of the stutter .
There was a tribe in Africa that was rumoured to suffer from it .
On discovering the tribe , the scientists found that the source of the condition had been a Christian missionary who had taught them English and the words of God .
I like to think that my grandfather , had he lived , would have smiled as he told me that story .
Cured as I am , the one thing I will never do is tell my son of our family history of stuttering , for fear that it will , in turn , put the fear of words into him .
He is of the age now that I was when I first stuttered , but I would rather spare him the rage I have lived with .
The rage that nearly destroyed me and then , ironically , saved me ; which has turned me into the man whom he calls , without question or fear , Dad .

Interrogators at Guantánamo
Bay were told to destroy their notes to stop them potentially being used to highlight the mistreatment of detainees , according to a US military lawyer .
William Kuebler , a lieutenant commander who is defending Omar Khadr , a Canadian national facing trial for alleged war crimes in Afghanistan , said the classified instructions were included in an operations manual that prosecutors allowed him to see last week .
The apparently wilful and officially sanctioned destruction of notes meant he would be unable to challenge supposed confessions given by Khadr , Kuebler said yesterday .
He told reporters the instruction was contained in a US military manual of standard operating procedures , or SOPs , for interrogators that was shown to him during a pre-trial review of possible evidence .
" The mission has legal and political issues that may lead to interrogators being called to testify …
Keeping the number of documents with interrogation information to a minimum can minimise certain legal issues , " the document was cited as saying in an affidavit signed by Kuebler .
The navy lawyer now plans to seek a dismissal of charges against 21 - year - old Khadr , who was detained in Afghanistan at the age of 15 .
Khadr , who faces a series of charges , including murder for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed a US special forces soldier in 2002 , is set to be one of the first Guantánamo detainees to face a war crimes trial .
Kuebler said the way the interrogations were carried out was central to Khadr 's case because prosecutors were relying largely on testimony obtained from him at Guantánamo , and earlier at Bagram air base , in Afghanistan .
" If handwritten notes were destroyed in accordance with the SOP , the government intentionally deprived Omar 's lawyers of key evidence with which to challenge the reliability of his statements , " Kuebler said .
Prisoners released from both Guantánamo and Bagram have alleged routine mistreatment during interrogation .
The Pentagon denies this .
Kuebler said the operations manual , from January 2003 , was attached to a 2005 report into alleged detainee abuse at Guantánamo , but that the section covering the manual was not made public at the time .
The 2005 report documented degrading treatment , but stopped short of saying torture occurred .
At the weekend , the Pentagon said the process of trying Guantánamo prisoners for alleged war crimes was a " number one priority " .
It said it was doubling the total of military lawyers assigned to prosecution and defence teams .
About 270 detainees remain at the former naval base , of which the US military hopes to prosecute up to 80 .
Critics of the hearings say the US is seeking to rush through trials before the presidential election in November .
However , claims that potential evidence was destroyed could be used by lawyers defending other detainees to challenge their alleged confessions .

1. Introduction :
We have all seen the amazing videos of people like Robert , Yuri and Loic flying their wingsuits .
It is natural to want to follow in their slipstreams but let us make sure we do so safely and with adequate preparation .
This document is intended as an initial information source for BASE jumpers interested in starting wingsuit BASE .
This document is not an instruction manual .
It does not contain rules , only advice .
Wingsuit BASE is more dangerous than normal BASE jumping if the jumper does not conduct adequate preparation .
If you choose to pursue wingsuit BASE you are strongly recommended to seek instruction from an experienced wingsuit BASE jumper .
There is no substitute for one to one coaching .
A wingsuit allows for incredible freefall delays and horizontal distances to be achieved , almost eliminating the chance of striking the object you jumped off , the number one cause of BASE jumping fatalities .
But jumping a wingsuit also has some serious drawbacks :
The wingsuit restricts your physical movement making exits harder to perform i.e. difficult to climb down to the exit point , easier to go unstable and then harder to recover .
The wingsuit complicates deployment and prevents you from controlling your canopy immediately after opening .
The wingsuit jumper must carefully assess the terrain he intends to fly over as the eventual opening point and landing area will be different than for a normal BASE jump and will also depend on flight performance .
Experienced BASE jumpers who use ground rush as an altitude indicator must exercise caution during their initial jumps .
The low fall rate and high horizontal speeds can fool the jumper that they are higher than they actually are .
The wingsuit ground rush for a minimal canopy ride is a lot less intense than for normal freefall .
who use ground rush as an altitude indicator must exercise caution during their initial jumps .
The wingsuit ground rush for a minimal canopy ride is a lot less intense than for normal freefall .
The wingsuit jumper must also pay attention to his altitude when flying down a talus or over sloping terrain .
The jumper often focuses on the airspace they are flying towards , giving the illusion they have lots of altitude available ( e.g. looking at the valley floor in front of them ) .
In this situation the jumper must remember that the critical altitude is the immediate vertical elevation they have over the talus or slope .
The wingsuit jumper must always ensure sufficient altitude for a safe deployment - bear in mind that as soon as the PC is released the wingsuit jumper will stop flying and drop vertically approx .
200 ’+ as the canopy deploys .

- bear in mind that as soon as the PC is released the wingsuit jumper will stop flying and drop vertically approx .
200 ’+ as the canopy deploys .
Experienced wingsuit BASE jumpers may attempt to make jumps that would be otherwise impossible without a wingsuit .
The jumper must be absolutely sure of his own capabilities and those of his equipment when undertaking jumps that allow little margin for error .
2 . Before even considering doing a wingsuit BASE jump you should be :
An intermediate BASE jumper :
With minimum 50 BASE jumps ( but more jumps are strongly recommended ! )
Cool under pressure , very comfortable in the BASE environment
Always performing solid exits , also when exiting with arms by your side
Have good sub & terminal tracking skills
Have excellent canopy flying skills and landing accuracy
Have consistent record of stable deployments and on - heading openings
An intermediate wingsuit skydiver :
With minimum 50 wingsuit skydives ( but more jumps are strongly recommended ! )
Who wears a wingsuit as if it were pyjamas , not feeling physically restricted by the fabric
Always able to find the PC quickly and cleanly , with good on heading openings
Well practiced at recovering from instability
Able to unzip arm wings instantly after deployment - like 2nd nature
Familiar using arm and leg cutaways in freefall and under canopy immediately after opening
Able to fly the suit comfortably without “ potato chipping ” achieving reasonable fall rate and forward speed
Ideally have performed some wingsuit balloon jumps to simulate the exit & sub terminal flight
See Appendix B for specific flight drills to practice whilst jumping the wingsuit from the plane .
A person who has read all the incident reports , analysed the contributing factors and accepted that wingsuit / BASE jumping is worth the risk of serious injury & death .
3 . So you still want to wingsuit BASE ?
Let ’s talk about specific preparation :
Equipment :
First thing , it is strongly recommended to start wingsuit BASE using a low performance wingsuit i.e. Birdman Classic , GTi or similar .
Once you have 10 + good wingsuit BASE jumps you could consider jumping with a higher performance suit .
The following items are strongly recommended :
A 1 or 2 pin BASE container for wingsuit BASE .
The high speed airflow over the container and high deployment angle excludes the use of a Velcro rig .
for wingsuit BASE .
The high speed airflow over the container and high deployment angle excludes the use of a Velcro rig .
A normal terminal pack job i.e. symmetrical , mesh slider packed “ up ” ( large or fine mesh depending on personal preference ) .
ZP pilot chutes , the size depends on your canopy , between 34 ” – 38 ” .
The PC should NOT have a hackey handle ( or heavy handle ) .
With a hackey PC handle there is the possibility of the bridle wrapping around the base of the handle .
A heavy PC handle could contribute to PC hesitation .
The following items are recommended :
A container with “ dynamic corners ” or open corners .
A suitable helmet , goggles and low profile protective pads .
Back to the dropzone :
Perform 20 hop - n - pops using your low performance wingsuit and a sensibly sized 7 cell main , or even better your BASE canopy in a skydiving rig .
( The 20 jumps can count towards the 50 )
Work your deployment altitude gradually down to USPA minimum of 2200 ’ , open by 2000 ’
( Discuss this with your CCI / DZO first , some dropzones may enforce a higher pull altitude )
( Discuss this with your CCI / DZO first , some dropzones may enforce a higher pull altitude )
If you have any instability , deployment or opening problems go back to full altitude jumps until they are rectified , use a BMI if necessary .
During these 20 hop - n - pops think about your emergency drills for the following situations , bearing in mind the reduced altitude and time under canopy :
Unstable exit
Handle inside of pouch / BOC
Hard pull
Floating handle
PC in tow
Premature deployment
Horseshoe malfunction
Line twists
Line over
Water landing
Jammed zip
Now to a far away land :
It is strongly recommended to go to one of the following well known “ high ” locations for your first wingsuit BASE jumps .
Become familiar with the object performing normal BASE jumps , getting to know landing areas and outs , obstacles , rock drop , winds , talus / ledges etc .
Site
Pro
Con
Carl ’s Huge wall in Northern Norway :
Good vertical rock drop
Huge LZ
Good access
Not many sheep and it rains a lot
Norwegian Fjord in Southern Norway :
Good vertical rock drop
Medium sized LZ
Good access
Very expensive beer
Italian Terminal wall :
OK vertical rock drop
Small LZ ( assume Heli LZ )
Good access
Wind / turbulence can be a problem
Swiss Fungus :
Good vertical rock drop
Large landing area
Access is difficult , requiring high fitness level and basic climbing skills
Once you are comfortable with the site , pick a day when you are feeling 100 % and the weather conditions are perfect to make your first wingsuit BASE jump .
Advice for your first wingsuit BASE jump .
What to focus on ?
Being current !
Make sure you get current at wingsuit skydiving and BASE jumping in the weeks running up to your first jump .
Pack yourself a nice terminal opening , attach the wingsuit correctly with the PC packed in the BOC with the correct tension ( not too loose or too tight ) .
Perform a full gear check before the hike , avoid “ exit gear fear ” syndrome , as you will already be under pressure .
Exit in a nice head high position , student style , with you arm wings open and your leg wing closed , your arm wings will help you balance and remain head high .
1 - 2 sec after exit slowly extend your leg wing and start to trim the suit as you feel the air speed picking up .
Premature exposure of the leg wing can cause you to go head low – be warned !
Better to be head high .
If you should go head low , stay calm !
Bring your head up and if the object allows it , try to stay parallel with the surface and build up some speed to allow you to pull up out of the dive more easily .
You may wish to consider this possibility when selecting the site of your first few wingsuit jumps .
After you have extended the leg wing focus on flying the suit efficiently away from the object pulling nice and high – do n’t rush , take time to reach , grip and throw the PC .
The PC throw should be vigorous to clear the burble the suit makes behind you .
Remember to keep your body symmetrical at all times during deployment to help maintain on heading performance .
It is recommended to learn to deploy from full flight as the BASE environment rarely allows enough altitude to collapse your wings and fall vertically prior to deploying .
This also has the advantage of keeping the airflow over your body fast & clean reducing the chance of pilot chute hesitation .
Deploying from full flight implies keeping your leg wing inflated and only collapsing your arm wings for the moment required to locate the PC .
As your canopy reaches line stretch it is better to close your leg wing as it can catch air causing your body to twist .
Your first 5 - 10 jumps should focus on a stable exit , flight and deployment , once you have these survival skills you can start to think about flight time and distance .
4 . You now have some wingsuit BASE experience , what ’s next ?
Once you have become a competent wingsuit BASE jumper you could consider :
Jumping a higher performance suit
Jumping from lower objects , for example the higher exit points in the legal Swiss valley .
Jumping camera
Performing 2 ways +
Opening up new objects
Aerials
Your imagination is the limit !
Make sure there is video !
Note :
Trying to land any of the current wingsuit designs is only recommended for the terminally ill .
You want to jump a higher performance wingsuit :
So you have done approx .
10 + good wingsuit BASE jumps with a low performance suit and you now intend to jump a higher performance suit .
Assuming you have trouble free experience flying the higher performance suit from the plane you can go ahead and use it for BASE .
Treat your first wingsuit BASE jump using the higher performance wingsuit the same as your first wingsuit BASE jump .
You want to jump a wingsuit that has a leg pouch PC :
If you intend to use the leg pouch PC ( e.g. S3 or Phoenix Fly wingsuit ) - it is strongly recommended to perform the following ground and skydiving preparation .
Prior to jumping the leg pouch PC perform a couple of thousand practice pulls on the ground .
Be able to find the handle , regardless of body position with your eyes closed .
Do 300 practice pulls a night for a week or so , simulating full flight then deployment .
When packing the PC into the leg pouch assure that the Birdman or Phoenix Fly guide lines are followed .
The PC should not be too loose or too tight .
It is strongly recommended to bar tack the Velcro sleeve to the bridle - check that you leave enough free bridle between the bar tack and pin to ensure the Velcro is completely peeled before any tension is applied to the pin .
Failure to do so can cause PC hesitation .
Do n’t mate the male - female Velcro over each other 100 % when the suit is brand new , let the them overlap 50 % to the side for the first few dozen jumps until the Velcro is slightly worn .
For more details on assembling and packing the leg pouch PC system please refer to http://www.interone.net/learn/basepc.html.
Perform at least 10 skydives with the system , using a wingsuit or BASE bridle , start with normal altitude jumps , performing dummy pulls in flight and then pulling high to give yourself extra time .
Assuming you have no opening problems or issues finding the PC handle quickly & easily you can work down to lower altitude deployments .
Treat your first wingsuit BASE jump using the leg pouch the same as your first wingsuit BASE jump .
5. Conclusion
Following these guidelines does not make wingsuit BASE jumping a safe activity .
Wingsuit BASE is still a relatively new discipline .
It requires jumpers to develop new skills , new muscle memory , new judgement and new understanding .
Respect it .
This document is by no means the final word on wingsuit BASE jumping , always seek advice and guidance from other experienced wingsuit jumpers and share what you discover .
By taking part in this activity you are in effect a “ test jumper ” , we all still have a lot to learn … .
Let ’s be careful out there

Appendix B – Wingsuit fatalities
# 67 Kirill Kiselev , September , 2002
Age : 27 , from Ekaterininburg , Russia .
Cliff Jump ( Wing Suit )
Vikesaxa ( Eiksdalen Valley ) Norway
Impact
I received this report from a close friend of Kirill who witnessed or heard most of the jump .
Kirill has 500 skydives with 20 being with a wing suit , and 30 BASE jumps , with 2 being with a wing suit .
This fatality began with an inadvertent low pull from a man who did n't do low pulls .
His friend believes Kirill encountered a stability problem late in the flight .
The friend , along with authorities , inspected Kirill 's body and gear at the hospital .
Kirill had opened his canopy , the slider is at the links .
Both toggles are still stowed .
The wing zippers are closed and the swoop cords are still over his fingers .
The wing fabric between his legs is torn .
His broken neck and one broken leg suggest opening and impact occurred at about the same time .
The report intimates failure of the wingsuit material between Kirill 's legs caused a stability problem at pull time .
By the time Kirill stopped trying to overcome the situation and deploy , it is too late .
Kirill is the first BASE jumper to die flying a wingsuit on a BASE jump .
# 68 Rob Tompkins , September 12 , 2002
Lysbotn , Norway
Cliff Jump ( Wing Suit )
Kjerag
Impact
This is the second wing suit BASE fatality .
Rob has 247 BASE jumps with 92 being with a wing suit on the day he died .
A report states : " For the last month , Rob had his eye on a particular jump between launch points 4 and 5 .
We looked at it , doing rock jumps and basically studying the jump .
There are two launch points next to this particular jump , one with a 7 - second drop and the other with an 8 - second drop .
Rob jumped the 7 - second launch point 10 times always doing a reverse gainer .
The place he 's looking at now , he dubbed the , " RT Hjørner , " and has a rock drop time of 5 - seconds .
We analyzed this site on video and with other wing suit pilots .
In my opinion , the jump is not achievable - and I repeated this to Rob .
Other wing suit pilots said the same thing .
Rob is convinced he can do it including a reverse gainer .
After 7 seconds of freefall Rob impacted the talus ledge .
He never tried to deploy his pilot chute , knowing that this would not save him .
Rob believed he could out fly the ledge right up until he died .
Rob is remembered as a good man , full of respect , and kind to everyone . "
# 69 Lukas Knutsson , October 11 , 2002
Cliff Jump ( Wing Suit )
Engelberg , Switzerland ( Cold Steel )
Impact
Lukas has a good launch and good flight with his wingsuit and pulled high over the landing area .
This is the third BASE wing suit fatality .
Despite a powerful pull the pilot chute ended up in the turbulence behind him .
In the burble the pilot chute spun around very fast .
Lukas notices the deployment is hesitating and collapsed his wings and rolled to one side to clear the pilot chute .
At this point the pilot chute achieved bridle stretch but the bridle had entangled with the pilot chute so badly the pilot chute is almost totally collapsed .
Lukas did rollover to the other side and struggled hard to get the canopy out of the container .
However , the container remained closed to impact .
Lukas is a very experienced long time BASE jumper ( this site is now called " Cold Steel " in his honour ) and he will be missed by the entire BASE community .
# 75 Gabi Dematte , August 13 , 2003
Cliff Jump ( Wing Suit )
Gasterntal , Switzerland
Cliff Strike & Impact
The following report is from one of Gabi 's many friends .
" Gabi went to jump alone , like she did very often .
Getting away from the crowds in Lauterbrunnen she went to another valley known by only a very few jumpers .
She could n't out fly a ledge with her wings .
Which is awkward , because she kicked ass with those wings .
She did not attempt to pull .
Gabi was a very good jumper , and a super nice person .
I was lucky to get to know her and I will treasure her contribution to my existence .
For me , it was nice to jump with another woman .
It was special and it did not last long enough .
Lauterbrunnen valley is empty and quiet now . "
Gabi is the fourth BASE wing suit fatality . "
# 80 Jeff Barker , July 5 , 2004
Age : 32
Cliff Jump
Mount Baker - Snoqualmie National Forest
Impact
Jeff is jumping with a wingsuit and he failed to clear a outcropping in freefall .
# 81 Duane Thomas , August 21 , 2004
Age : 35
Cliff Jump
Lauterbrunnen , Switzerland
Impact
Duane , a Kiwi with a quick smile , is a well known and experienced BASE jumper .
The following is from an eye witness .
" The jump is witnessed by two British jumpers and two Swiss jumpers .
One Brit watching , and videoing , from the exit point , the other three watching from the LZ .
This is Duane 's first wingsuit BASE jump , and his first jump ever with a leg mounted pilot chute pouch .
Prior to this jump Duane prepared by making 50 aircraft and 2 hot air balloon wingsuit skydives .
Duane had a good exit and a good flight .
Everybody saw him reach for and locate the pilot chute at what the witnesses said is a reasonable altitude .
He then kept his hand there and continued in freefall .
The speculation is the lack of normal ground rush ( like the type he is used to when not wearing a wingsuit ) might have fooled him .
The Swiss are yelling at him to pull and he finally did so , at what they said is about 30 - feet above the ground .
The canopy lifted out of the pack tray but is no where near line stretch when he impacted in a full flight position .
According to the Swiss there is no fumbling around , or looking for the pilot chute handle - all the witnesses agree on this .
He reached and located the pilot chute , but just took to long to deploy it .
A hard pull cannot be fully discounted at this time , but all the witnesses believe he just waited too long . "
This is the sixth BASE wingsuit fatality since the first one occurred in September of 2002 .

Appendix C – Wingsuit site selection
You want to open up a new object jumping a wingsuit :
So you have become a very competent wingsuit BASE jumper and you intend to open up an object that has never been jumped with wingsuit .
Here are some factors to bear in mind .
In South Carolina authorities have taken up the task of wiping out home poker by investigating games and then raiding them with force usually reserved for drug busts .
The law the police are using to nail these players has been on the books since 1802 and restricts the playing of any type of game in one ’s home that uses dice or cards .
The latest raid took place April 4 , when police concluded a 10 - month investigation of a poker game in Charleston County where four houses were watched .
On that day , the Sheriff ’s department busted into a home wherein high - stakes games took place , arrested 27 people , seized $ 62,000 , and took everyone to jail , where they were booked and were forced to post bond .
A total of 65 players who played at any of the homes were charged , and 19 have already pled guilty to the misdemeanor .
They were ordered to pay fines ranging from $ 154 -$ 257 and will have to head to civil court to fight for the return of the monies that were seized .
Bob Chimento was one of the players who was charged with gambling on April 4 , even though he was n’t at the game .
He said the stakes were too high for him there , but he did play at one of the other homes that was investigated .
He played on Oct. 15 , the same night an undercover cop happened to be at the game , and a warrant was put out for his arrest .
Chimento was one of 23 people who were at a $ 20 tournament in Mount Pleasant , South Carolina , that was raided in April 2006 .
All but five players pleaded guilty and paid small fines .
These same players were also charged in the most recent bust , the only players from the 2006 raid to face more charges .
Chimento is one of a group of five who has asked for a jury trial in both cases .
A poker hobbyist who says has only played three times since August , Chimento is now at the forefront of the fight for getting this antique South Carolina law changed .
“ The reason we ’re fighting the law is because we want to get our state representatives to change this law , ” Chimento said .
“ We ’re just a bunch of average Joes playing cards .
We want to be able to play cards in our homes .
They ’re trying to intimidate people to quit playing poker . ”
The tactics of the law enforcement , no matter how much publicity the raids are getting in South Carolina , do n’t seem to be working .
Games can be found every night of the week there , and public opinion , based on local newspaper and radio polls , is reporting that 85 percent of those polled think the players are getting a raw deal .
The way the police are conducting the raids may be the most disturbing thing about the situation .
At the game in 2006 , Chimento said there was a knock on the door and then “ … all of a sudden it was like a commandos SWAT team raiding a bunch of crack dealers .
It ’s was like the SWAT team that you see on TV , busting into your home , guns drawn , ski masks on , full protective gear , and demanding we put our hands on top of our heads , ” Chimento said .
“ At first we thought we were getting robbed , then we realized they had police written all over them , and we were like ‘ Oh my God , check this out . ’
Someone could have easily been killed that night . ”
A 78 - year - old grandmother was one of the players swept up that night .
Police issued citations on the spot and seized about $ 6,000 in total from all of the players .
A few days after the most recent bust , Chimento found himself at the county jail getting booked after he was notified that a warrant was out for his arrest for playing poker on Oct. 15 , 2007 .
He spent eight hours there getting fingerprinted and processed ( including a mug shot ) , and then had to appear in court a week later to enter his second not - guilty plea in two years .
He and the other four players who are fighting the charges are getting help from Bob Ciaffone and gambling law attorney Chuck Humphrey .
They are hoping for a jury trial , but Chimento feels that once it goes to trial ( there ’s no indication of when the 2006 case will take place ) , there ’s a good chance they will be convicted .
If and when that happens , they will appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court , who could take a closer look at the law than the lower courts are able to do .
This is how they ’re hoping to change the law .
The original case has already prompted state representative Wallace Scarborough to write a bill that would allow people to play poker in their homes , as long as a rake is n’t collected .
His bill was just returned back to committee , though , and wo n’t be voted on this year .
Almost two years ago , a meeting of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in Prague changed how scientists define a planet .
In doing so , the astronomers present kicked Pluto out of the brotherhood of planets , relegating it to dwarf planet status .
The simple change meant that the solar system now consisted of eight planets and four dwarf planets .
The demotion of Pluto seems to have been one of the most popular stories that Nobel Intent has covered .
Since " transneptunian dwarf planet " does not roll easily off the tongue , IAU members promised to come up with a more vernacular - friendly word .
In keeping their promise , at a recent meeting in Oslo , Norway , members of the IAU have approved a new name for such dwarf planets : plutoids .
Plutoids Pluto ( left ) and Eris ( right )
Officially , a plutoid is a celestial body that orbits the Sun at a distance greater than Neptune , is massive enough for its gravity to have achieved a hydrostatic equilibrium , but not so massive that it has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit .
Currently , there are two known plutoids , Pluto and Eris .
As it stands , Ceres remains only a dwarf planet ; it exists too close to the sun to be a plutoid .
It is also believed that Ceres is a unique object , and most likely will not be given its own classification .

In this interview Avi Bryant , creator of the Smalltalk Seaside web framework and Co-CEO of DabbleDB talks about GemStone 's MagLev project .
The interview , taped at QCon London 2008 earlier this year , was one of the first public mentions of GemStone 's Ruby implementation MagLev .
At the time of the interview , the project had only been going for a few weeks ( you 'll note the name MagLev is n't mentioned ) .
Avi explains the reason for his involvement in the project , the plans ( as they were then ) for making Ruby work on the GemStone VM , and how GemStone 's existing product features , such as transparent persistence and distribution , compare to existing manual approaches using systems like memcached Finally , a question from the audience brings up the topic of multiple Ruby implementations and whether they can be seen as a good or bad thing , in light of the fragmented Smalltalk market .
The interview mentions a few articles / blog posts which give further explanations of some of the discussed topics :
Watch the " Avi Bryant interview on MagLev and GemStone " Note :
This interview is one part of a longer interview with Avi - the second part will be published on InfoQ soon and include topics such as Seaside , more discussion of Gemstone and GLASS , DabbleDB 's design and persistence strategy with Squeak , and much more .
NOTE : With the exception of the blog , this site is an archive from Dec 2012 .
Obviously there was no global cataclysm in late 2012 …
2012 could end up being nothing … or it could truly be a SHTF Doomsday
A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions .
The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences .
Proverbs 22:3
The Long Count Calendar of the Ancient Mayans ends on Dec 21 2012 .
There is n’t much information regarding what the Mayans thought would occur in 2012 , but the consensus of opinion is that there will be great change .
To some people this means a positive , spiritual change .
Others , like myself , consider that a catastrophic event may have been predicted , and it might mean the end of the world , as we know it .

Give It Another 6 Months ( at least )
I know what many people are thinking – yet another doomsday prophet trying to milk it a little bit more …
Nothing could be further from the truth – I do n’t want a tragic result – and I ’ll be well pleased if this marvelous world continues along its relatively happy journey .
It ’s not a case of being proven right or wrong , be it for myself or the ancient Mayan civilization .
For me it is about tricking / fooling / convincing people into preparing for the worst , just in case .
Regardless of 2012 it is probably the best thing you will ever do for yourself and family .
Obviously the shock and awe of Dec 21 , 2012 has past .
So I wo n’t be putting as much effort into this mission from now – but hopefully enough people have become preppers to make my prior work worthwhile .

2012 – Solved
1. Many ancient cultures ( including the Maya ) were capable of watching the skies over long periods of time ( longer than we have ) , and recording their observations .
2. Auroras at low latitudes ( down towards the equator ) are very rare , less than once per lifetime .
Ancient cultures , unable to explain their presence , could have been very scared and concerned when auroras were observed .
3 . By noting auroral activity over centuries or even millennia , a repeating pattern might have been discovered .
4 . Of the various ways an ancient culture could have warned of the next bout of low latitude auroras , one is a calendar with a definitive end date , such as the Long Count calendar of the ancient Maya .
Because the calendar was in continuous use , the end date was not forgotten .
Auroras might have been just scary lights in the sky for ancient cultures , but they can kill us .
Low latitude auroras only appear during the most massive solar storms .
Those same storms can take out the power grids of modern society ( countries closest to the poles with the oldest grids are at the most risk – and that includes the USA ) , and take months or even years to repair .
That would equal millions of deaths .

Survive 2012 – The Book
Survive 2012 is a non-fiction book available now for purchase ( and preview ) at Amazon USA , Amazon UK , Kindle and as a PDF file .
The book describes the major threats we may face in 2012 , and how to ensure your own survival …
Is the World Going to End in 2012 ?
There is zero scientific evidence that anything will happen , but there are numerous things that could easily threaten the human species in the year 2012 , such as a geomagnetic reversal , solar storm or supernova .
Or something more intimate , like a flu pandemic , or a nuclear war .
Any predictions you hear about 2012 , even on this site , are pure speculation .
However …
1 ) Solar Storms .
NASA have acknowledged that the power grids of North America could go down if Earth is hit by a geomagnetic storm like the Carrington Event of 1859 .
The grids of Europe , Russia , China , Australasia and South Africa are also at risk .
The solar cycle is about to peak .
And governments have failed to prepare .
Imagine your world without electricity …
2 ) A Comet .
NASA has been making plenty of videos and articles debunking 2012 .
They ( correctly ) say we are safe from asteroids this year , but they are strangely quiet about comets .
That ’s because one could be headed for us right now and we would n’t see it yet .
And a dark comet , well , we would n’t see it coming until the last minute .
Ancient advanced cultures , like the Maya , had one advantage over modern science – the length of their existence .
The return of a long period comet could have been predicted by ancient astronomers .
And a pattern of solar storms could have been detected simply by noting the rare occurences of auroras at low latitudes .

When we first saw the Splinter wooden supercar back in February , it was one of those " oh yeah , right , a wooden supercar , whatever " situations .
We thought the Splinter was a flight of fancy — nothing more than crazy auto - loving NC State kids being crazy auto - loving NC State kids .
We were wrong .
Splinter 's just made the leap from pine - scented vaporware to real life parts and assemblies .
We 're just as shocked as you are .
It seems Joe Harmon and his associates have been hard at work actually building this crazy all - wood supercar .

NC State Students To Build Wood Supercar
We 've been tossing around the idea of wood cars for a while , but not until now has an ambitious …

The car is based around a central rigid tube section with the suspension and powertrain components mounted to it .
It 's built with a mix of parts scrounged from a C4 Corvette and hand fabricated wooden component .
The process of building the wood parts seems to be to create a mold of the part , and then laminate layers of veneer into a sort of structural three dimensional plywood .
Now , plywood , as you woodworkers know , is a spectacular natural building material .
Because it 's constructed with the wood grain at perpendicular angles , it is dimensionally stable , rigid , and if made as watertight as a beaver 's fecal - delivery hole , remains extremely strong while also retaining a great deal of flexibility .

After following the team 's progress on their blog and photos , we 're fairly impressed with not only the quality of the work , but the engineering prowess of the designs .
The only concern we have is the placement of the steering rack , the rack ends and the compression strength of the wooden tie rods .
From where we sit — behind our comfortable desk many miles away — the suspension seems like it will produce positively massive bumpsteer ( the rod ends seem like they will fall out of plane with the A - arm mounting points and cross the plane of the upper A - arm ) but maybe there 's a trick we 're not seeing .
The engine is fascination incarnate .
These madmen are starting with a Northstar V8 and running it backwards , turning the exhaust and intake sides around .
The intakes will be underneath the cylinder banks , fed by two roots superchargers through individual intercoolers and then up into the combustion chambers .
The exhaust continues out through the top of the engine through an all - custom exhaust manifold and then out the back .
Nobody is going to accuse these guys of thinking small .

When complete , we 're fairly certain it'll be an attractive Maple - and - Oak - machine , and it may even work — as long as they can keep those under - hood temperatures under control .
It would be terrible for them to put in all this work and then have it go all Audi R8 on them .
We look forward to seeing this baby finished — maybe we 'll even take a drive down and play in the sawdust .

IF THE millions of refrigerators , electric water - heaters and air conditioners attached to the average power grid were less selfish , and adjusted their energy consumption according to the state of that grid , there would be less need to run spare coal - fired generating capacity on the off - chance that it might be required — and intermittent power sources , such as the wind , could be accommodated more easily .
These things would save money and cut carbon - dioxide emissions .
More responsible fridges might even reduce the number of power cuts and brown - outs .
But how do you organise such collaboration ?
Several groups of researchers have been thinking about this , and their answers are now being tested .
The most advanced project is the brainchild of the American Department of Energy 's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) .
Last year it completed the first residential trial of its “ Grid Friendly Appliance ” controller — a small device that listens to the AC - frequency hum of the electricity supplied by the grid .
If the hum goes a little flat , that indicates too much demand on the grid , so whenever a controller notices the American standard 60 Hz grid frequency dipping to 59.95 Hz ( something that usually happens at least once a day ) it shuts off the heating element in the appliance it is regulating for two minutes .
If , at the end of that time , the grid is still unstable , the element stays off for another two minutes , and so on until a maximum of ten minutes have elapsed .
The PNNL conducted its trial in collaboration with Whirlpool , a maker of domestic appliances .
It recruited the inhabitants of 150 homes in the states of Oregon and Washington and fitted 150 dryers and 50 water heaters in those homes with the new controllers .
In the dryers , the motor stayed on when the heating element was being turned off to reduce demand , so the drum still turned and the clothes did not crease — an important criterion for Whirlpool .
Just turning off the heating element , but leaving the motor running , still reduces demand to a useful degree .
At the end of the trial , which lasted a year , most residents said they had not noticed their appliances switching off and said that they had not been inconvenienced at all .
Having shown in this pilot that its technology could act as a “ shock absorber ” for the grid when demand peaks , PNNL plans to conduct a larger study , involving more than 1,000 homes , in 2009 .
Whirlpool also wants to try the idea out more widely , and to experiment with other functions that could safely be interrupted , such as the automatic defrosting feature found in some refrigerators .
Whereas PNNL 's main interest is in shedding load at times of heavy demand , a small British firm called RLtec is exploring the idea that entire populations of fridges could be programmed to correct continuously for much smaller grid fluctuations , constantly adjusting their power demands rather like a car 's cruise control .
That , too , would improve efficiency and reduce the need for standby capacity .
RLtec is four months into a laboratory test in which 100 domestic fridge - freezers have been equipped with the firm 's “ Dynamic Demand ” technology .
This is a piece of software that operates within the electronic temperature - control loop of the fridge and makes subtle second - by - second adjustments to the amount of power drawn by the compressor unit , again in response to tiny variations in the frequency of the power grid .
So far , according to Andrew Howe , the company 's boss , there have been no adverse effects on the temperature inside the fridges or on the lifetimes of their compressors .
RLtec is now putting together a team that includes people from Britain 's national grid to test the system more rigorously .
In a separate , government - sponsored study , Imperial College plans to install fridges fitted with Dynamic Demand controllers in a number of homes to generate data on exactly how much power the system could save .
The first serious use of grid - responsive appliances , though , may be on grids of the smallest scale .
Econnect Ventures , a British firm , is helping to prevent power cuts on islands that rely heavily on hydroelectric , wind and solar power , by equipping residents ' houses with intelligent power plugs that switch off attached appliances when they detect that the grid is starting to become overloaded .
And , building on successful projects on the islands of Foula and Rum in Scotland , and Kythnos in Greece , Econnect is also looking at how its load controllers could enable wind power to be used more efficiently on a wider scale .

The US Oil Story

Comments : US oil production has been declining since 1970 , in spite of technology advances and new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
The recent dip and uptick reflects lower production in 2005 due to hurricane damage , followed by a bounce back in 2006 and 2007 , as the damage was repaired .
US Peak in 1970 • US had been world 's largest producer •
Peak came as a surprise to most
--- Had been predicted by Hubbert in 1956 • Precipitated a rush to find oil elsewhere
--- Ramp up Saudi and Mexico production
--- New production in Alaska and North Sea 5
Comments :
We were fortunate in 1970 to find other places in the world where oil was available , but had not yet been developed .
There are still a few such sites available ( for example , some US sites that have been placed off - limits for development ) , but they are much smaller in relationship to what was available in 1970 .
M. King Hubbert had predicted in 1956 that the US production of oil would peak in 1970 , but few believed him .
On page 22 of the same report , he predicts that world oil production will peak " about 2000 " .
His prediction was made in 1956 .
As such , it did not reflect significant changes in the 1970s , including the significant recession of the 1973- 1975 period , the switch to nuclear and natural gas instead of petroleum for electricity generation , and mileage improvements for cars .
If these had been reflected , the predicted peak would have been several years later .
Saudi increases were quickest • Saudi oil company was run by Americans
--- Able to ramp up quickly • OPEC embargo in 1973 , however
--- Oil shortages
--- Huge oil price run-ups
--- Lead to major recession 1973 - 75 6
Comments : According to Wikipedia , Arabian American Oil Company ( Aramco ) was jointly owned by four US oil companies in 1970 .
In 1973 , the Saudi Arabian government acquired 25 % of the company .
The percentage ownership was increased to 60 % in 1974 , and 100 % in 1980 .
OPEC began operation in 1965 , but did not have pricing leverage until the United States could no longer produce the vast majority of its own oil , because of its decline in production .
In October 1973 , OPEC initiated an oil embargo against countries that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War , particularly targeting the United States and Netherlands .
The embargo lasted only a few months , until March 1974 .
During this time , there was a sharp rise in oil prices , and a sharp drop in the stock market .
In the United States , gasoline was rationed with people able to buy on odd or even days , depending on the last digit in their license plate number .
According to Wikipedia , oil consumption in the United States dropped by 6.1 % during this period .
The 1973 - 75 recession was the most severe recession since World War II .
Merrill Lynch says it believes the current recession will be similar to that recession .

Comments :
Even when an oil company wants to start new production quickly , it is difficult to do so .
The ramp up in Alaska oil production had to wait until the Trans - Alaskan Pipeline System was completed in 1977 .
It was known that oil was available in the North Sea prior to the oil embargo .
It was not until the price run-up related to the embargo that it was economically feasible to drill there , however .
Production in all three of the areas shown is now declining .
Alaskan production reached its peak in 1988 ; the North Sea peaked in 1999 ; and Mexico peaked in 2004 .
The shapes of the production curves vary for the different locations , depending on where the oil was located , and how it was produced .
Now the US is a major importer of oil
and a tiny user of newer renewables

Comments :
This figure is from Page 166 of the 2008 Economic Report of the President .
The data shown are 2006 figures .
Percentages for the newer renewables would be slightly higher for 2007 .
The larger circle on the left represents consumption .
It totals 100 quadrillion Btus .
The smaller circle represents production .
It totals 71 quadrillion Btus .
Renewables are in the section pulled out .
In total , renewables amount to 10 % of production or 7 % of consumption .
The vast majority of renewables are hydroelectric and " other biomass " ( wood used to heat homes and fuel some electric generating plants ) .
Reading Slide 8 • About two thirds of oil is imported • Biofuels make up about 1.0 % of energy production - a little less of use • Wind comprises 0.4 % of energy production • Solar comprises 0.1 % of energy production 9
Comments :
We use a huge amount of oil and other fossil fuels .
Even with big ramp up in alternatives , they are still tiny .
If a cutback is made in fossil fuels , either because of shortages or because of a desire to reduce carbon dioxide , it seems clear that at least part of the response will have to be reduce total energy usage .
The World Oil Story 10
World Oil : Discoveries follow same pattern as US production
11
Comments :
The discovery information is based on backdated information - what we now think old discoveries were worth .
Some of the big oil fields in the Middle East were discovered about 1960 .
We are still discovering new fields , but they tend to be smaller and more difficult to extract .
The discovery information includes only liquid oil , not oil in the form of tar or other solids .
The combination of discoveries which peaked many years ago , and oil extraction which tends to peak in individual areas , leads one to believe the eventually world oil production will peak .
There will still be oil in the ground , but it will be difficult to extract .
Eventually , we simply wo n't be able to keep extracting as much as we would like :
• As oil fields get older , the percentage of water extracted with the oil tends to increase .
In some cases the water percentage exceeds 99 % .
Once an oil field 's water production exceeds the installed water handling capability , production will need to be reduced .
When the cost of additional water handling capability exceeds the cost of oil extracted , it stops making economic sense to extract the oil .
• Some of the oil will be mixed with toxic chemicals like poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas .
Special techniques will be required to safely extract this oil .
This process will be expensive and time consuming .
A giant oil field discovered in Kazakhstan in 2000 has this problem and is n't expected to come on line until at least 2011 .
• Some of the oil is found extremely deep beneath the sea .
Special techniques need to be developed to deal with the high pressures and the temperature differentials encountered when drilling in these locations .
Developing these new techniques takes time and is expensive .
At some point , we will reach our limit on deep sea drilling .
• Some of the oil is very viscous , akin to tar .
It can only be extracted by digging .
Production requires inputs of fresh water and natural gas .
Once limits on either of these are reached , production must stop .
In some cases nuclear may be substituted for the natural gas , but this takes time , money , and agreement of the local population .
World oil production has stalled
12
Comments : Oil production on an " all liquids " basis was flat for the years 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 .
On an energy available basis , production actually declined .
There are several reasons for this :
• The " All Liquids " summary includes lower energy products like ethanol and natural gas liquids .
These have been growing , while crude oil production has tended to slightly decline since 2005 .
• The oil produced requires more and more energy in extraction , because it is mixed with more and more water , and is found in deeper and deeper locations .
More energy is required for extraction , leaving less for end users .
• If we look at oil available for imports , this has been declining since 2005 .
Part of the reason is the greater amount of oil used in extraction ; part of the reason is that the standard of living in oil exporting nations is rising , so these nations are using more of the oil themselves , leaving less to export .
And prices are spiking
13
Comment :
The fact that oil prices have been spiking since 2005 should come as no surprise .
I show an estimated 2008 price on this graph , based on May 2008 prices , since we know the price spike has continued into 2008 .
Given the shrinking supply and rising demand , the rise in prices was close to inevitable .
Some of the poorer countries are being priced out of the market , and the use of coal is rising , particularly in China .
The higher prices have stimulated work on fields that were known , but not fully developed .
Recent data compiled on oil megaprojects indicates that oil companies are now making a concerted effort to develop sites that may be available but have not yet been developed .
Many of these projects are expected to begin production in 2008 and 2009 , but delays are common because of shortages of manpower and drilling rigs , and because of cost over - runs .
It might be noted that in the 2000 to 2002 period , production stalled and even dropped a bit .
Prices did not rise during this time period .
They actually fell a bit .
The reason for the decline during this period was lack of demand , due to recession .
Now , many potential buyers are asking for more , but production does not seem to rise accordingly .
World has little spare oil production capacity
Saudi claims spare capacity , but current discussions relate to only
0.2 million BPD – would leave production below 1980 - 81 levels .
14
Comment : Saudi Arabia claims between 1.5 million and 2.0 million barrels per day of spare oil production capacity .
There has been no outside agency auditing its statements for accuracy , so we do not know if its spare production estimate is accurate .
Also , we do n't know what type of oil is represented by this spare capacity .
If the only crude available is very heavy , sour crude for which there is little refining capacity , the extra capacity may not be very helpful .
Saudi Arabia called a producer - consumer summit meeting on Sunday , June 22 to discuss how to stabilize prices .
Saudi Arabia announced at that meeting that it will raise production by 200,000 barrels a day , apparently to 9.7 million barrels a day .
At this level , crude oil production will be slightly over 2005 production of 9.55 barrels a day , but still below its 1980 - 81 level of production .
An increase of 200,000 barrels a day is quite small - - about 0.2 % of world production , so it is not clear it will make much of a difference .
If the oil is very difficult to refine , this could limit the benefit further .
OPEC 's true reserves are unknown • Published reserves are unaudited • Last Saudi reserve while US involved was 110 Gb in 1979 ( perhaps 168 at " expected "  )
--- Production to date 81 Gb , implying 29 to 87 Gb remaining ; Saudi claims 264 Gb remaining • Kuwait published 96.5 Gb - Audit 24 Gb • GW
Bush says regarding asking Saudi Arabia for more oil
---" It is hard to ask them to do something they may not be able to do . " 

Comment :
If one analyzes the reserves for OPEC countries , one very quickly comes to the conclusion that the published numbers are unreasonably high .
This is the story :
In the early 1980s , OPEC oil countries were all vying for high quotas .
To get those high quotas , they believed that publishing high reserves would be helpful .
One by one , OPEC oil countries raised their reserve estimates , in an attempt to make it look like they had more oil , so deserved higher quotas .
To further this illusion , they kept the reserve numbers at the new high level , even when oil had been pumped out , and no new oil had been found .
The practice has continued for years .
OPEC leaders found that by overstating their reserves , they gained new respect , both within their own countries and abroad .
They also found that the practice was very easy to do , since no one is auditing the reserve numbers they provide .
A graph of OPEC oil reserves over time is as follows :
( Not in Presentation )
There are many other ways this problem can be seen .
For example , OPEC 's oil production is unreasonably low in relationship to its reserves , unless the countries are inept at production or are misstating their reserve amounts .
( See The Disconnect Between Oil Reserves and Production . )
Another insight can be gained by looking at Saudi oil reserves , when Americans were involved in setting reserves .
According to Matt Simmons ' " Twilight in the Desert " , Saudi oil reserves were 110 Gigabarrels ( Gb or billion barrels in US terminology ) in 1979 , back when Americans were still partial owners of Aramco .
If we subtract the 81 Gb pumped out since then , this suggests remaining reserves of 29 Gb .
If is likely that the 1979 American estimate was low .
If , instead , we use the Saudi published estimate of 168 Gb in 1980 , and subtract from it production of 81 Gb to date , we get an estimate of 87 Gb .
This is less than a third of the 264.3
Gb that Saudi Arabia is currently reporting as reserves !
Kuwait is another country where we have an alternate estimate of the proven reserves available .
An analysis by the Kuwait Oil Company as of December 31 , 2001 , showed proven reserves for the country of 24 Gb .
Their published reserves were 96.5 as of December 31 , 2001 , moving up to 101.5 as of December 31 , 2006 !
President George W. Bush seems to be aware of Saudi Arabia 's production / reserve problems .
In an interview on ABC's Nightline , when asked why he did n't pressure the king for more oil , George Bush said
If they do n't have a lot of additional oil to put on the market , it is hard to ask somebody to do something they may not be able to do .
US textbooks and newspapers seem to be unaware of the problem with OPEC reserves .
They continue to quote huge " proven reserves " for most of the OPEC countries .
The word proven adds credibility to the numbers , suggesting that somehow , the reserves have been proven to some authority , when nothing could be further from the truth .
The United States Geological Service ( USGS ) has added further to the confusion .
It has taken the absurd reserves published by OPEC and made calculations based on US development patterns suggesting that OPEC reserves may , in fact , be low .
USGS publishes its even higher estimates , confusing the situation further .
FSU production has increased recently ( but may decline in ‘ 08 )
16
Comment : The Former Soviet Union ( FSU ) saw a sharp decline in oil production in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
With the adoption of modern extraction methods , they have been able to increase production again .
There have also been some recent discoveries brought on line .
Russia represents over three quarters of FSU oil production .
Toward the end of 2007 , Russia 's oil production began to decline .
This decline has extended into the early months of 2008 .
Russia is now approximately tied with Saudi Arabia as the largest producer of crude oil in the world , so the possibility that Russian production may continue to decline is a serious concern .
Production going forward is uncertain • OPEC refuses to increase quotas
--- Possible small increase by Saudi Arabia • Russian production has begun decreasing • Little hope for US , North Sea , Mexico • Canadian oil sands contribution is very small • Recent discoveries have been small , relative to what is needed •
New production techniques can lead to sudden drop - offs
--- Followed by small dribble for years from EOR 17
Comments : Production going forward is uncertain .
OPEC does n't seem to willing / able to increase production by more than a token amount ; Russia , which is the biggest part of the Former Soviet Union , seems to have begun to decline ; and there are a huge number of countries already post - peak , like the United States , Mexico , and the countries that make up North Sea production .
Even Canada , apart from the oil sands , is post peak .
Canada depends on imports -- heavily from Saudi Arabia - - for its oil .
While Canada has been exporting oil from the oil sands to the US , there are really two issues involved :
(1) The amount of oil from the oil sands is not likely to ramp up quickly .
(2) Canada is likely to need the oil itself , as its other production declines .
There have been many announcements of new discoveries , like Tupi by Brazil , but these tend to be small relative to the world 's needs .
They will also take a long time to develop .
As noted on the slide , newer technologies can lead to sudden drop - offs .
One reason is that fancier and fancier extraction tools ( such as horizontal wells and maximum reservoir contact wells ) have been developed .
These are able to suck out a greater percentage of the available oil before production suddenly " hits a wall " when the layer of oil has been extracted , and the remaining oil is mixed with a huge amount of water and under little pressure .
If this should happen on an enormous field like Ghawar in Saudi Arabia , we could very quickly see production drop by 2 million barrels a day , or more .
In recent years , quite a few " enhanced oil recovery " ( EOR ) methods have been developed .
While these will have some impact , much of the impact of these methods is already reflected in the production data graphed .
In some cases , like Mexico , it has permitted production to continue longer before the inevitable drop in oil production came .
In others , it helps wells to continue to produce at a very low level after the vast majority of production is completed .
The role of EOR seems likely to be one of making the post peak downslope less steep , rather than preventing decline altogether .
Projections of Future Production Vary Widely
18
Comment :
The highest estimate in slide 18 is from the US Energy Information Administration .
It is based primarily on demand , under the assumption that OPEC will always have additional oil available , if needed .
The next highest forecast is from the June 2008 newsletter of the Association for the Study Peak Oil and Gas -Ireland , prepared by Colin Campbell .
This is a very well - known forecast .
A link to it can be found here .
It forecasts a peak in 2008 , with a fairly slow decline after 2008 .
The next highest forecast is that of Tony Eriksen ( " Ace " ) of The Oil Drum staff .
A link to his forecast can be found here .
In this forecast , Ace considers the various Megaprojects , and when they are expected to go on line .
He also considers expected decline rates on existing fields .
He believes that we are on a plateau now that may last a few years .
After that production will decline .
The remaining estimate is by Matt Simmons .
In this interview , he mentions that he expects crude oil ( not " total liquids " ) to drop to 65 million barrels a day by 2013 .
I have attempted to translate this comment into an equivalent projection , on a total liquids basis .
It ends up being just a bit below Ace 's projection .
World " All Liquids " Forecasts • " All Liquids "  - Includes biofuels and " coal to liquid "  fuels • US EIA forecast - Based solely on demand • ASPO Newsletter - Assoc. for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas Ireland , June '08 • " Ace " - Tony Eriksen , on The Oil Drum • Simmons - Matt Simmons , recent interview on evworld.com 19
EIA expects biofuels , CTL ,
and oil sands to remain small
20
Comment : The US Energy Information Administration 's current projections suggest that it does not expect any of these fuels to grow to be significant between now and 2030 .
Five Myths 21
Myth #1 : OPEC could produce more if it used current techniques •
National oil companies use same service companies US companies do •
Most are using up - to - date techniques • Expenditures often are high • Problem is very old fields • Overstated reserves raise expectations 22
Comment :
It is easy to see how this myth might arise , if people believe published reserves .
The International Energy Association ( IEA ) has indicated that it plans to sharply reduce its world oil supply forecasts , in its next set of forecasts to be published in November 2008 .
Myth # 2 : Drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will save us 23
Comment :
This slide is from a presentation of Dr. Sam Shelton of Georgia Tech .
The oil from ANWR is expected to provide only a small upward " bump " to US production .
It is not likely to make a significant difference in world oil supply problem , if / when it actually does come on line , many years from now .
Quite a few of the other much - hyped solutions are expected to provide equivalently little benefit .
We will likely need to reduce consumption to better match supply .
Myth # 3 : A small downturn can easily be made up with energy efficiency •
The quickest impacts are financial
--- Recession or depression
--- Serious recession in 1973 - 75 • Use of biofuels raises food prices
--- Further increases recession risk •
Do n't need peak for recession
--- Only need supply / demand shortfall
--- Likely what we are experiencing now 24
Comment :
The connection between oil supply and the economy is not well understood by most .
A shortage of oil very quickly leads to an increase in prices and a cutback in the demand for other goods and services .
The combination of these events tends to cause a recession .
( See The Expected Economic Impact of an Energy Downturn .
Cutting back on usage tends not to be sufficient to prevent the problem , because there are so many other users around the world , including in China and the developing world .
They are likely to cause an increasing demand for oil , even if we try to cut back .
Myth # 4 : Canadian oil sands will save us •
Hard to see this with current technology
--- Technology known since 1920s
--- Production slow and expensive • Natural gas is in limited supply
--- Alternatives require more capital •
Most optimistic forecasts equal 5 % of current world oil by 2030
--- Even this exceeds available natural gas
25
Comment :
There has been commercial development of the Canadian Oil Sands since 1967 .
Huge amounts have been spent , and there has been great damage to the environment .
Even with this , production has remained small - - only a little over 1 % of world supply .
Natural gas limitations suggest that we will never be able to greatly ramp up production .
There are also issues with water ( pollution , amount required ) and carbon dioxide emissions .
It might be noted that a similar argument can be made as to why oil shale will not save us from peak oil .
At this point , we do n't even have an economic method of extracting oil shale .
From what we know , extraction will require a large amount of water and considerable electricity .
Finding adequate water for extraction is likely to be a problem .
It is not clear that we will have extra electricity to spare either , for this large a project .
Extraction is likely to be slow and expensive , since it will require moving large amounts of dirt around , plus heating and perhaps chilling the dirt .
If we are able to extract oil shale , it will likely be in small quantities .
Myth # 5 : Biofuels will save us • Corn - based ethanol has many problems
--- Raises food prices , not scalable , CO2 issues , depletes water supply • Cellulosic ethanol theoretically is better
--- Still does not scale to more than 20 % of need
--- Competes with biomass for electric , home heat • Biofuel from algae might work
--- Not perfected yet
26
Comment : Every study that has been done recently with respect to corn ethanol seems to produce worse indications .
Corn ethanol has virtually no benefits over petroleum .
It uses huge amounts of fossil fuels as inputs , so it has most of the drawbacks of fossil fuels .
It also has its own drawbacks , including raising prices , damage to the environment , high water usage , and possible CO2 and other global warming gas increases because of land use changes and nitrogen fertilizer use .
At this point , there are n't good alternatives to gasoline commercially available , however .
Since there is great political appeal to growing our own fuel , corn ethanol is supported by most politicians , even if any reasonable analysis would say its benefit is very limited .
Longer term , cellulosic ethanol may be a better solution , but at this time it is not commercially available .
Even if we use wood and switchgrass as inputs , cellulosic ethanol will be difficult to scale up to provide more than a small share of the needed fuel .
Biofuel from algae looks to some like it might work .
At this point , methods have not yet been perfected .
When a refinery purchases crude oil , the key piece of information they need to know about that crude , besides price , is what the crude oil assay looks like .
There has been a lot of discussion here at various times about “ light sweet ” , or “ heavy sour ” , and how these qualifiers affect the ability of a refiner to turn these crudes into products .
So , I thought it would be good to devote an essay to this subject , and discuss how different types of crude can affect a refiner ’s bottom line .
Note that for this essay we are only concerned with a portion of the assay .
The full assay would have information on metals concentration , salt concentration , vapor pressure , etc .
What the two assays above tell us is that one is light ( the higher the API gravity – a measure of density – the lighter the crude ) and one is heavy .
It also tells us that one is sweet ( low sulfur % ) and one is sour .
Now , to be clear , a heavy crude can be sweet and a light crude can be sour .
But refiners that are equipped to handle heavy crudes are generally also equipped to handle sour crudes , so that ’s what they buy .
Heavy sour is cheaper than light sweet , and there is more money to be made with heavy sour crudes as long as a refinery is configured to handle them .
Gasoline does n’t care whether it came from cheap heavy sour or more expensive light sweet ; the product price will be the same in either case .
Now , back to the assay , and what the various categories mean .
The way the assay is done is that the crude oil is boiled , and the amount boiled off at various temperatures is measured .
This defines the various products , or cuts .
When 99 °F has been reached , the gases have been boiled off .
This is the dissolved methane , ethane , propane , some butane , and some trace higher gases .
This cut can end up being purified for sales , or it can end up as fuel gas to help satisfy a refinery ’s need for steam .
The next cut is straight run , or natural gasoline .
Gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons that are characterized by the boiling point , and the gasoline you purchase at the gas station will contain many different blending components .
One of these will usually be light straight run gasoline .
This cut will contain things like butane , octane , and every manner of branched and cyclic hydrocarbon that boils in a specific range .
Most gasoline has been subject to additional processing ( more on that later ) .
The straight run gasoline is what can be expected to be distilled from the crude oil with no additional processing .
Typically , straight run gasoline has pretty low octane , so refiners are limited in how much can be added to the gasoline pool .
However , lower octane blends will probably contain some portion of straight run gasoline .
The next cut is naphtha .
You can do a couple of things with naphtha .
You can blend it into gasoline , but the octane is even worse than for light straight run .
Therefore , you are seriously limited on how much can be blended .
More commonly , naphtha is fed to a catalytic reformer , which processes the naphtha into reformate and boosts the octane from less than 40 in the naphtha to greater than 90 in the reformate .
Reformate is then a very desirable gasoline blending component .
We then come to kerosene ( also called “ jet ” ) , which starts to get into the range of diesel components .
This cut also has more energy content per gallon than the earlier cuts , but is too heavy ( less volatile ) to be blended into gasoline .
The sulfur components start to become more concentrated in these heavier cuts , so kerosene is typically subject to hydrotreating .
In this step , hydrogen is added to the kerosene in a reactor to convert sulfur components into hydrogen sulfide , which is then removed .
Kerosene has a number of uses .
It is used as fuel for jet engines , and it is also blended into diesel .
It is also used in some portable heating and lighting applications .
The next cut is distillate ( specifically , No. 2 Distillate ; kerosene is sometimes called No. 1 Distillate ) .
Like kerosene , this cut contains sulfur and must be treated ( as do all the heavier cuts ) .
Distillate has two major end uses : as diesel fuel and as home heating oil .
In fact , as seen in the assays above , a substantial portion of a barrel of oil ends up as heavy distillate .
For the light sweet crude assay above , 32.4 % ended up as distillate , and for the heavy sour crude 19.3 % ended up as distillate .
We then come to gas oil , which is also known as fuel oil or heavy gas oil ( distillate also being known as light gas oil ) .
This cut is typically processed in a catalytic cracker to make cracked gasoline .
By the name , you might guess that cracking involves breaking these heavy , long - chain hydrocarbons down into shorter hydrocarbons that boil in the gasoline range .
The cracked gas is then blended into the gasoline pool .
The final cut , residuals , or just plain “ resid ” , is the cut of greatest interest when we talk about the economics of heavy crudes versus light crudes .
Note in the assay above , that less than 5 % of the barrel of light crude ends up as resid .
However , the heavy crude yields over 28 % resid .
Resid is sold as asphalt and roofing tar , and was historically not a very profitable end product .
Therefore , more and more refiners are installing cokers to further process the resid .
A coker can take that resid and turn it into additional gasoline , diesel , and gas oils .
The economics of doing this are typically very attractive , given the historical price spread between light oil and heavy oil .
A coker can turn over 80 % of the resid from low - value asphalt into valuable products like diesel and gasoline .
( The resid can also be processed by hydrocrackers , but this entails different economics because they require hydrogen . )
Examples ( For Illustrative Purposes Only )
Light Crude Economics
Let ’s compare two hypothetical refineries .
Refinery A has no coker , and thus is restricted to either buying light crude , or buying heavy crude and selling a lot of low - value asphalt and roofing tar .
So let ’s say that Refinery A pays $ 125 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate .
They will turn that barrel into 0.909 barrels of liquid fuel product ( per the light assay above , 4.4 % ends up as gas , 4.7 % ends up as resid , and 90.9 % ends up as liquid products ) , which let ’s say has a value of $ 140 / bbl .
They therefore grossed $ 140* 0.909 - $ 125 ( the purchase price of the barrel ) , or $ 2.26 a barrel before we consider the value of the asphalt and the gases .
Historically , the value of asphalt has been very low – less than $ 0.10 / lb .
However , prices have risen along with the price of crude , and are now around $ 0.23 / lb .
Given that a barrel of crude weighs around 300 lbs , and we got a 4.7 % asphalt yield , the barrel yielded 300* 0.047 = 14.1 lbs of asphalt worth $ 3.24 .
Let ’s value our gases at the current value of propane ( about $ 0.40 / lb on the spot market ) , and we get a value of 300*.044*$ 0.40 = $ 5.28 for the propane .
Our gross profit ( before operating costs , taxes , etc. are considered ) is then $ 2.26 + $ 3.24 + $ 5.28 , or $ 10.78 per barrel for the light crude .
Heavy Crude Economics
Now consider Refinery B. Instead of buying WTI at $ 125 / bbl , they buy a heavy Canadian crude for $ 110 / bbl ( this is an actual recent price ) .
Again , their barrel of oil weighs some 300 lbs , and as we can see from the assay above their resid yield may be in the range of 28 % .
So , of the 300 lbs , 84 lbs ends up as resid .
But with their coker , they can turn 80 % of that into high - value products , and only 20 % ( 16.8 lbs ) ends up as low - value coke ( a coal substitute ) .
Therefore , the overall yield from the heavy crude amounts to the sum of the cuts up to resid ( 71.6 % ) , plus the resid that was turned into products ( 80 % of 28 % , or 22.4 % ) minus the gas cut ( 3.4 % ) for a total of 90.6 % .
The overall liquid yield is almost the same as for the light crude , but much less was paid for the heavy crude .
So , the economics look like this :
For the liquid fuels , they grossed $ 140* 0.906 - $ 110 = $ 16.84 a barrel on the heavy crude – much greater than the profit of the light crude .
The propane yield is slightly less than in the previous example .
The value of propane is $ 4.08 .
Finally , we end up with 16.8 lbs of coke , which is worth only $ 0.03 / lb ( about $ 0.50 total ) .
The total gross profit then is $ 16.84 + $ 4.08 + $ 0.50 = $ 21.42 per barrel of heavy crude .
( If you compare these numbers to the initial essay written in January 2007 , you will see that margins have significantly worsened ) .
This explains why so many refiners are rushing to install cokers .
This is also why I do n’t get too excited when someone comments that the build in crude inventories could be a build in “ undesirable ” heavy sour .
Refiners do n’t buy what they do n’t need , so if heavy sour inventories are increasing then this is primarily coming from refiners that can process heavy sour .
As light sweet supplies continue to deplete , refiners will increasingly turn to heavy sour crude .
But not enough refiners yet have a demand for heavy sour , so it trades at a significant discount to light sweet .
This will of course change as more cokers are installed .
There will be a higher demand for heavy crudes , and the asphalt market will become more lucrative as the asphalt supply gets rerouted to cokers .
Of course the caveat is that a coker is a major capital expense ( hundreds of millions of dollars ) , and it is only part of the equation .
I have focused here on processing heavy crudes , but not at all on sour crudes .
The story is similar to that for the heavy crudes .
Sour crudes trade at a significant discount to sweet crudes , and the refiners need additional processing equipment to handle them .
But the economics currently favor installing the cokers and hydrotreaters to handle the heavy sour crudes , and will continue to do so as long as they trade at a substantial discount to light sweet crudes .
As always , comments , corrections , and questions are encouraged .
Do note that while the examples above are approximate , they are not exact .
There is more to the economics than what I have presented , but for the purposes of understanding some basic refining economics , this should suffice .

A woman who killed her quadriplegic husband after setting fire to his house has been sentenced to more than five years in jail , with the judge describing the crime as a " monstrous act " .
Grace Soon , 71 , had told police that she killed her husband because she had been frustrated that her husband had spent all his money on prostitutes , homosexuals and transvestites , had wanted her to engage in unnatural sexual acts and that he had given her syphilis .
She had pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of her estranged husband Stephen Chin , 63 , after she threw a fire bomb in the bedroom window of his Housing Department bungalow at Daceyville and doused the front fence in petrol , in September 2006 .
Justice Michael Grove said Soon knew Mr Chin , who required round - the - clock care , would not have been able to escape the blaze .
" On any view , killing by fire a person whom you knew had no capacity to self mobilise from bed was a monstrous act , " he said .

John Bolton , the former US ambassador to the United Nations , faces a citizen ’s arrest when he addresses an audience at the Hay Festival in Wales this evening .
George Monbiot , the journalist and activist , is planning the action because he believes Mr Bolton is a “ war criminal ” .
He said he was surprised that Mr Bolton would be allowed to “ swim through the politest of polite soirees – which is of course Hay . ”
Mr Bolton , who was the American ambassador to the UN from August 2005 to January 2006 , is due to talk at the Hay - on - Wye literary festival at 6.30 pm on international relations .
Mr Monbiot , a columnist for The Guardian newspaper , plans to detain him as he steps off stage at the end of his talk .
He said he was prepared to jump on stage and perform the citizen ’s arrest there if necessary .
He claimed Mr Bolton was “ instrumental in preparing and initiating the Iraq war by disseminating false claims through the State Department ” while he was under - secretary of state for arms control .
Mr Monbiot , who took part in a debate at Hay on Saturday entitled “ Defeat : Why They Lost Iraq ” , has been a fierce critic of the decision to launch the 2003 invasion .
He said he had formally notified police of his intention of performing a citizen ’s arrest .
Mr Monbiot said : “ This is the one opportunity we have , because he is mingling with the public , which does n’t happen very often . ”
He added : “ I ca n’t think of another case where someone who has been instrumental in planning the war has been exposed to the public , so I ’m taking the opportunity .
“ John Bolton was pushing for the Iraq war long before he became part of the administration . ”

An 82 - year - old former bomber pilot I met in the street the other day said : " Supermen .
Ha !
If Hitler had come over here we would have given him a proper kick up the jackside . "
As Michael White suggests , British people are fond of the myth that they wo n't tolerate dictatorships , despite the fact that there were many fascist sympathisers in Britain in the 1930s .
Yes , we do live in a relatively free and secular country - just ask any young Afghani woman studying at a college here for her opinion .
But there is also evidence around us that the British government is engaging in repression .
And not just in Iraq or Afghanistan , but here in Britain .
Perhaps those of us who have lived for a time under dictatorships can spot some of the warning signs :
 Inconvenient elections are avoided in the name of getting on with the job .
 Leaders of the opposition are character - assassinated by the state media .
 Institutions like the legislature begin to lose their independence and traditional role .
 Citizens are increasingly afraid to speak openly on certain issues .
 Citizens are observed and monitored on cameras and the government can tap into their conversations at will .
 Governments can snatch anyone from their homes or off the street and detain them without trial on charges of treason or terrorism .
 Ethnic and religious minorities are persecuted and are made into scapegoats .
 The state increasingly intervenes in family and community life in an attempt to control citizens ' behaviour .
 The focus of discussion moves away from the issues and into a narrative of political rivalries and gossip spreads .
 Governments use bread and circuses to shut people up and distract attention away from their increasing political impotence .
 Public spaces for demonstrations are closed down and restricted .
 Large and ridiculous monuments are built to impress the citizens .
 Individuals have to carry ID with them at all times and the government holds large amounts of information on every citizen .
How does the British government rate on the dictatorship scale ?
How close are we to Zimbabwe under Zanu ?
How far away are we from , say , Norway ?
I suppose we must trust the security services when they say there are dangerous Islamist extremists on the loose who want to do our society harm : we saw the proof on the July 7 , 2005 .
But the measures the British state is taking " to protect us " are beginning to give a tangibly different feel to our society .
Britain is slowly creeping up the pH scale from democracy to autocracy .
Aesthetically , at any rate , it does feel as if some of our science fiction dystopias are gradually coming true .
In an estate near me , George Orwell 's CCTV cameras are actually trained on the residents ' doors and driveways .
Ray Bradbury 's wall - sized TVs flicker in small living rooms .
Aldous Huxley 's Brave New Labour government pushes through a bill allowing experimentation on embryos and all British citizens will have to carry an expensive ID card with biometric information on it linked in to humming computer databases in anonymous buildings .
There was something extremely familiar to me about this week 's events .
The way they closed down the whole of Whitehall for George Bush 's visit reminded me of how , in Havana , they close the main highway every time Fidel Castro crosses from one side of town to the other .
There was also something unpleasant about the way many in the BBC turned the discussion away from the loss of civil liberties in Britain and instead began to present David Davis as an egotistical oddball , pulling a clever stunt simply to spite the leader of his party .
Soviet TV attacked dissidents in the same way .
This kind of media character assassination is even more reprehensible because once you destroy a politician 's reputation , you might as well put him down - like a racehorse with a broken leg .
And then , while Labour berates African nations for not adopting Tony Blair 's gold standard for liberal interventionism , Labour itself avoids holding the referendum on Europe it promised .
One gets the feeling that the current crop of neo-monetarist technocrats in power in Britain regard see the whole democratic processes as an irritating stunt , not just David Davis 's upcoming by - election .
Certainly Labour politicians show very little respect for the electorate .
Any appeal over their heads to the willful and ignorant population probably feels like insufferable interference to them .
So this is the thing .
If I , as a citizen , and people like me , do n't agree with the way we are being governed , where do we go to withdraw our consent to be governed ?
I do n't want to simply switch to the Tories or Liberal Democrats , I want a new contract with my state as a citizen , one that respects my civil liberties .

Senate Passes Renewable Energy Tax Credits .
Why Am I Not More Excited ?
April 11th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
[ social_buttons ]
By an impressive tally of 88 - 8 , the Senate approved The Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act ( S.2821 ) as an amendment to HR.3221 , which aims to mitigate the economic impact of the current housing crisis .
The renewable energy tax credits were slipped into a housing bill that that did not end up looking the way its lead author , Sen .
Chris Dodd really intended it to , remarking earlier in the week that it was “ a housing bill , not a Christmas tree . ”
However , will the production tax credit and investment tax credit ever make it to the President ’s desk to sign ?
Despite the optimism shown by some well respected voices in the green blogosphere , I would argue that we will see some sort of stripped - down version of the renewable energy tax credits , if any at all .
The House has hardened its opposition to this version of the tax - credit extensions , which are estimated to cost $ 6 billion over 10 years .
House leaders have strong objections to deficit - financed tax breaks , and with few exceptions , they have offset lost tax revenue with tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere .
But since the President rebuked Congress ’ previous attempts at funding the tax credits by rescinding tax breaks for big oil , there has n’t been much of a discussion as far as where the money for this program will come from .
“ I doubt that the House will accept these extensions without some corresponding offsets , ” said Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) on the Senate floor .
“ This leaves the administration with a key role to play in developing a compromise that will be acceptable to both chambers . ”
So we ’re leaving this up to the administration to figure out ?
Yikes .

Kids and Congress
Ebonya Washington , an economist at Yale , has a great paper that was just published in the American Economic Review called “ Female Socialization : How Daughters Affect Their Legislator Fathers ’ Voting on Women ’s Issues . ”
She looks at members in the House of Representatives and looks to see whether their voting patterns change .
She provides interesting evidence that , “ conditional on total number of children , each daughter increases a congress person ’s propensity to vote liberally on reproductive rights issues . ”
For example , looking at representatives with two children , she finds that N.O.W. ( National Organization for Women ) scores increase as the number of daughters increases :
Her regressions suggest that the effect runs primarily through the impact of daughters on fathers .
Representatives who are mothers apparently do n’t need any more “ female socialization . ”
This article got me to thinking about whether having kids impacts the electability of candidates .
Akhil Amar taught me that George Washington was father of our country in part because he was not a father .
The founders were worried that a president might try to install his son as a successor .
Because George and Martha had no children , this was not a risk .
Indeed , David McCullough says that Thomas Jefferson ‘s supporters made a similar argument in the run up to the 1796 election against John Adams .
Adams posed more of a dynastic risk because of the incredibly accomplished John Quincy — while Jefferson had no legitimate sons to illegitimately favor .
The question arises , however , whether having or not having kids impacts electability today .
I do n’t think that dynastic risk is a large concern — but there are other possibilities .
One of the wonderful things about the A.E.R. ’s new data sharing policy is that it ’s possible in just a few clicks to download Professor Washington ’s data and answer some basic questions .
To begin , who has more kids — Democrats or Republicans ?
By a fairly large margin ( 2.70 vs. 2.16 average kids per member ) , the answer is Republicans .
But here ’s a tougher question :
Who has more kids — male or female members of the House ?
There are lots of stories you could tell here .
Professional women tend to have fewer kids than professional men ( probably because a disproportionate burden of child rearing still falls upon them ) .
But a counter hypothesis is that voters demand that women politicians have more kids ( than they demand of male politicians ) .
Voters might demand that women politicians have more kids to prove that they are “ real women ” or that they will care about family issues .
( To suggest that this is a possible voter preference is not to suggest that it is normatively attractive ! )
If the latter hypothesis is true , Chelsea Clinton ‘s status as a single child may impose greater political costs on her mother than it did on her father .
In the house , it turns out that both hypotheses have some support .
Among Republican members , women have more kids than men have ( with mean number of kids at 2.82 vs. 2.69 ) .
But among Democrats who are members , women have fewer kids ( with means of 2.05 for female Democrats vs. 2.19 for male Democrats ) .
Let me emphasize that these are just cross tabs and I ’m not claiming anything close to causality here .
But Professor Washington ’s data at least begins a conversation about whether procreation impacts who is elected as well as how elected officials will vote .
" there is no evidence for a money trail between the companies and the virus writers "
Who benefits the most from computer viruses ?
Simple answer :
The antivirus software companies .
Yet , when I type in the words antivirus and conspiracy into google all I get is articles like : " Debunking the antivirus conspiracy theory " " Why there is no global antivirus conspiracy " and similar .
In fact , searching for 20 minutes , I did not find one single article on the subject of my interest .
Only Debunk and statements such as " There is no way that there is a conspiracy here " , " Its impossible " .
Having the first google - search page plastered with categorically stating " its nonsense " makes me suspicious though .
The idea that antivirus software companies and virus writers collaborate or that antivirus companies create viruses themselves for the purpose of high demand of their product and the ensuing huge sales is not as far - fetched and “ crazy ” as many claim .
Afterall , they benefit hugely from malware .
What do the writers of viruses benefit from creating problems ?
What is their motivation for doing so and continuing to do so ?
Apparently we are to believe that they continue to spread viruses “ just for fun ” .
Where does this constant onslaught of daily viruses come from ?
And for what reason ?
The main argument of debunkers is ... as if this money trail would be openly shown or easy to be tracked down .
Anybody know more and willing to share ?
Stephen Jeffrey
“ IN THE long run , ” as John Maynard Keynes observed , “ we are all dead . ”
True .
But can the short run be elongated in a way that makes the long run longer ?
And if so , how , and at what cost ?
People have dreamt of immortality since time immemorial .
They have sought it since the first alchemist put an elixir of life on the same shopping list as a way to turn lead into gold .
They have written about it in fiction , from Rider Haggard 's “ She ” to Frank Herbert 's “ Dune ” .
And now , with the growth of biological knowledge that has marked the past few decades , a few researchers believe it might be within reach .
To think about the question , it is important to understand why organisms — people included — age in the first place .
People are like machines : they wear out .
That much is obvious .
However a machine can always be repaired .
A good mechanic with a stock of spare parts can keep it going indefinitely .
Eventually , no part of the original may remain , but it still carries on , like Lincoln 's famous axe that had had three new handles and two new blades .
The question , of course , is whether the machine is worth repairing .
It is here that people and nature disagree .
Or , to put it slightly differently , two bits of nature disagree with each other .
From the individual 's point of view , survival is an imperative .
You can not reproduce unless you are alive .
A fear of death is a sensible evolved response and , since ageing is a sure way of dying , it is no surprise that people want to stop it in its tracks .
Moreover , even the appearance of ageing can be harmful .
It reduces the range of potential sexual partners who find you attractive — since it is a sign that you are not going to be around all that long to help bring up baby — and thus , again , curbs your reproduction .
The paradox is that the individual 's evolved desire not to age is opposed by another evolutionary force : the disposable soma .
The soma ( the ancient Greek word for body ) is all of a body 's cells apart from the sex cells .
The soma 's role is to get those sex cells , and thus the organism 's genes , into the next generation .
If the soma is a chicken , then it really is just an egg 's way of making another egg .
And if evolutionary logic requires the soma to age and die in order for this to happen , so be it .
Which is a pity , for evolutionary logic does , indeed , seem to require that .
The argument is this .
All organisms are going to die of something eventually .
That something may be an accident , a fight , a disease or an encounter with a hungry predator .
There is thus a premium on reproducing early rather than conserving resources for a future that may never come .
The reason why repairs are not perfect is that they are costly and resources invested in them might be used for reproduction instead .
Often , therefore , the body 's mechanics prefer lash - ups to complete rebuilds — or simply do not bother with the job at all .
And if that is so , the place to start looking for longer life is in the repair shop .
Seven deadly things
One man who has done just that is Aubrey de Grey .
Dr de Grey , who is an independent researcher working in Cambridge , England , is a man who provokes strong opinions .
He is undoubtedly a visionary , but many biologists think that his visions are not so much insights as mischievous mirages , for he believes that anti-ageing technology could come about in a future that many now alive might live to see .
Vision or mirage , Dr de Grey has defined the problem precisely .
Unlike most workers in the field , he has an engineering background , and is thus ideally placed to look into the biological repair shop .
As he sees things , ageing has seven components ; deal with all seven , and you stop the process in its tracks .
He refers to this approach as strategies for engineered negligible senescence ( SENS ) .
The seven sisters that Dr de Grey wishes to slaughter with SENS are cell loss , apoptosis - resistance ( the tendency of cells to refuse to die when they are supposed to ) , gene mutations in the cell nucleus , gene mutations in the mitochondria ( the cell 's power - packs ) , the accumulation of junk inside cells , the accumulation of junk outside cells and the accumulation of inappropriate chemical links in the material that supports cells .
It is quite a shopping list .
But it does , at least , break the problem into manageable parts .
It also suggests that multiple approaches to the question may be needed .
Broadly , these are of two sorts : to manage the process of wear and tear to slow it down and mask its consequences , or to accept its inevitability and bring the body in for servicing at regular intervals to replace the worn - out parts .
Eat up your greens
Managing wear and tear may not be as complicated as it looks , for the last five items on Dr de Grey 's list seem to be linked by a single word : oxidation .
Regular visitors to the “ health and beauty ” sections of high - street pharmacies will , no doubt , have come across creams , pills and potions bearing the word antioxidant on their labels and hinting — though never , of course , explicitly saying — that they might possibly have rejuvenating effects .
These products are the bastard children of a respectable idea about one of the chief causes of ageing : that one big source of bodily wear and tear , at least at the chemical level , is the activity of the mitochondria .
Mitochondria are the places where sugar is broken down and reacted with oxygen to release the energy needed to power a cell .
In a warm - blooded creature such as man , a lot of oxygen is involved in this process , and some of it goes absent without leave .
Instead of reacting with carbon from the sugar to form carbon dioxide , it forms highly reactive molecules called free radicals .
These go around oxidising — and thus damaging — other molecules , such as DNA and proteins , which causes all sorts of trouble .
Clear up free radicals and their kin , and you will slow down the process of ageing .
And the chemicals you use to do that are antioxidants .
This idea goes back to one of the founders of scientific gerontology , Bruce Ames of the University of California , Berkeley .
Dr Ames began his career studying cancer .
He found that damage to certain genes was a cause of cancer .
These genes evolved to keep tumours at bay by stopping cells dividing too readily , and the damage was often done by oxidation .
Gradually , his focus shifted to the more general damage that oxidation can do — and what might , in turn , be done about it .
Some vitamins , such as vitamin C , are antioxidants in their own right .
This is the basis of the high - street propaganda , though there is no evidence that consuming such antioxidants in large quantities brings any benefit .
A few years ago , however , Dr Ames found he could pep up the activity of the mitochondria of elderly rats — with positive effects on the animals ' memories and general vigour — by feeding them two other molecules : acetyl carnitine and lipoic acid .
These help a mitochondrial enzyme called carnitine acetyltransferase to do its job .
Boosting their levels seems to compensate for oxidative damage to this enzyme .
He also reviewed the work of other people and found about 50 genetic diseases caused by the failure of one enzyme or another to link up with an appropriate helper molecule .
Such helpers are often B vitamins , and the diseases were often treatable with large doses of the appropriate vitamin .
The enzyme damage in these diseases is similar to that induced by oxidation , so Dr Ames suspects that its effects , too , can be ameliorated by high doses of vitamins .
He has gathered evidence from mice to support this idea , but whether it is the case in people has yet to be tested .
Nor is it easy to believe it ever will be .
The necessary clinical trials would be long - winded .
They would also be expensive — and there is no reason for vitamin companies to pay for them since sales are already buoyant and the products could not be patented .
Nor is Dr Ames claiming vitamins will make you live longer than a natural human lifespan , even if he thinks they might prolong many individual lives .
For that , other technologies will need to be invoked .
Stemming time 's tide
One way that might let people outlive the limit imposed by disposable somas is to accept the machine analogy literally .
When you take your car to be serviced or repaired , you expect the mechanic to replace any worn or damaged parts with new ones .
That , roughly , is what those proposing an idea called partial immortalisation are suggesting .
And they will make the new parts with stem cells .
The world has heard much of stem cells recently .
They come in several varieties , from those found in embryos , which can turn into any sort of body cell , to those whose destiny is constrained to becoming just one or a few sorts of cell .
The thing about stem cells of all types , which makes them different from ordinary body cells , is that they have special permission to multiply indefinitely .
For a soma to work , most of its component cells have to accept they are the end of the line — which , given that that line in question stretches back unbroken to the first living organisms more than 3 billion years ago , is a hard thing to do .
There are , therefore , all sorts of genetic locks on such cells to stop them reproducing once they have arrived at their physiological destination .
If these locks are picked ( for example by oxidative damage to the genes that control them , as discovered by Dr Ames ) , the result is unconstrained growth — in other words , cancer .
One lock is called the Hayflick limit after its discoverer , Leonard Hayflick .
This mechanism counts the number of times a cell divides and when a particular value ( which differs from species to species ) is reached , it stops any further division .
Unless the cell is a stem cell .
Every time a stem cell divides , at least one daughter remains a stem cell , even though the other may set off on a Hayflick - limited path of specialisation .
Some partial immortalisers seek to abolish the Hayflick limit altogether in the hope that tissue that has become senescent will start to renew itself once more .
( The clock that controls it is understood , so this is possible in principle . )
Most , though , fear that this would simply open the door to cancer .
Instead , they propose what is known as regenerative medicine — using stem cells to grow replacements for tissues and organs that have worn out .
The most visionary of them contemplate the routine renewal of the body 's organs in a Lincoln 's axish sort of way .
In theory , only the brain could not plausibly be replaced this way ( any replacement would have to replicate the pattern of its nerve cells precisely in order to preserve an individual 's memory and personality ) .
Even here , though , stem - cell therapists talk openly of treating brain diseases such as Parkinson 's with specially grown nerve cells , so some form of partial immortalisation might be on the cards .
But it is a long way away — further , certainly , than Dr Ames 's vitamin therapy , if that is shown to work .
Neither prevention , nor repair , is truly ready to roll out .
But there is one other approach , and this is based on the one way of living longer that has been shown , again and again , in animal experiments , to be effective .
That is to eat less .
From threadworms to mice , putting an animal on a diet that is near , but not quite at , starvation point prolongs life — sometimes dramatically .
No one has done the experiment on people , and no one knows for sure why it works .
But it does provide a way of studying the problem with the reasonable hope of finding an answer .
Gluttons for punishment
You would , of course , have to wish a lot for a long life to choose to starve yourself to achieve it .
Extrapolating from the mouse data , you would need to keep your calorie intake to three - quarters of the amount recommended by dieticians .
That means about 1,800 for sedentary men and 1,500 for sedentary women .
But several people are trying to understand the underlying biology , in order to develop short cuts .
One such is David Sinclair of Harvard University .
Unlike those trying to fight the causes of ageing or to repair the damage done , Dr Sinclair thinks he has found , in caloric restriction as the technique is known , a specifically evolved natural anti-ageing mechanism that is quite compatible with disposable - soma theory .
The reason for believing that prolonged life is an evolutionary response to starvation rather than just a weird accident is that when an animal is starving the evolutionary calculus changes .
An individual that has starved to death is not one that can reproduce .
Even if it does not die , the chance of it giving birth to healthy offspring is low .
In this case , prolongation of life should trump reproduction .
And that is what happens , even among people .
Women who are starving stop ovulating .
The billion - dollar trick would be to persuade the body it is starving when it is not .
That way people could live longer while eating normally .
They might even , if the mechanism can truly be understood , be able to reproduce , as well .
In Dr Sinclair 's view , the way caloric restriction prolongs life revolves around genes for proteins called sirtuins .
Certainly , these genes are involved in life extension in simple species such as threadworms and yeast .
Add extra copies of them to these organisms ' chromosomes , or force the existing copies to produce more protein than normal , and life is prolonged .
This seems to be because sirtuins control the abundance of a regulatory molecule called nicotinamide adenine diphosphate which , in turn , controls the release of energy in the mitochondria .
The most intriguing connection in this story is with the French paradox .
This is the fact that the French tend to eat fatty diets rich in red meat but to have the survival characteristics of those whose diets are lean and vegetarian .
Some researchers link this with their consumption of red wine — and , in particular , of a molecule called resveratrol that is found in such wine .
Resveratrol activates sirtuins , and some similar molecules activate them much more .
It is these sirtuin super - stimulators that interest Dr Sinclair .
Not everyone is convinced , but Dr Sinclair has done experiments on mice that look promising , and has started a company called Sirtris Pharmaceuticals to follow it up .
The fact that he is ( at least in his own eyes ) working with nature rather than against it argues that this is the most promising approach of all .
That said , the logic of the disposable - soma theory is profound .
Even working with its grain may do no more than buy a few extra years of healthy living .
Dr de Grey 's reason for thinking that some people now alive may see their lives extended indefinitely is based on the hope that those few extra years will see further discoveries and improved life - extension technologies based on them — a process he describes as achieving “ longevity escape velocity ” .
The chances are that it will not work .
But hope springs eternal .
To end with another quote , this time from Woody Allen , “ I do n't want to achieve immortality through my work .
I want to achieve immortality through not dying . ”
If any researcher manages to beat evolutionary history and achieve his goal , he might get to do both .

Historical and Revision Notes
Based on title 18 , U.S.C. , 1940 ed. , §§ 88 , 294 ( Mar. 4 , 1909 , ch. 321 , § 37 , 35 Stat .
1096 ; Mar. 4 , 1909 , ch. 321 , § 178a , as added Sept. 27 , 1944 , ch. 425 , 58 Stat. 752 ) .
This section consolidates said sections 88 and 294 of title 18 , U.S.C. , 1940 ed .
To reflect the construction placed upon said section 88 by the courts the words “ or any agency thereof ” were inserted .
( See Haas v. Henkel , 1909 , 30 S. Ct. 249 , 216 U. S. 462 , 54 L. Ed. 569 , 17 Ann. Cas. 1112 , where court said : “ The statute is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing , obstructing , or defeating the lawful functions of any department of government . ”
Also , see United States v. Walter , 1923 , 44 S. Ct. 10 , 263 U. S. 15 , 68 L. Ed. 137 , and definitions of department and agency in section 6 of this title . )
The punishment provision is completely rewritten to increase the penalty from 2 years to 5 years except where the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor .
If the object is a misdemeanor , the maximum imprisonment for a conspiracy to commit that offense , under the revised section , cannot exceed 1 year .
The injustice of permitting a felony punishment on conviction for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is described by the late Hon. Grover M. Moscowitz , United States district judge for the eastern district of New York , in an address delivered , before the section on Federal Practice of the New York Bar Association , reported in 3 Federal Rules Decisions , pages 380–392 .
Hon .
John Paul , United States district judge for the western district of Virginia , in a letter addressed to Congressman Eugene J. Keogh dated , stresses the inadequacy of the 2 - year sentence prescribed by existing law in cases where the object of the conspiracy is the commission of a very serious offense .
The punishment provision of said section 294 of title 18 was considered for inclusion in this revised section .
It provided the same penalties for conspiracy to violate the provisions of certain counterfeiting laws , as are applicable in the case of conviction for the specific violations .
Such a punishment would seem as desirable for all conspiracies as for such offenses as counterfeiting and transporting stolen property in interstate commerce .
A multiplicity of unnecessary enactments inevitably leads to confusion and disregard of law .
( See reviser ’s note under section 493 of this title . )
Since consolidation was highly desirable and because of the strong objections of prosecutors to the general application of the punishment provision of said section 294 , the revised section represents the best compromise that could be devised between sharply conflicting views .
A number of special conspiracy provisions , relating to specific offenses , which were contained in various sections incorporated in this title , were omitted because adequately covered by this section .
A few exceptions were made , ( 1 ) where the conspiracy would constitute the only offense , or ( 2 ) where the punishment provided in this section would not be commensurate with the gravity of the offense .
Special conspiracy provisions were retained in sections 241 , 286 , 372 , 757 , 794 , 956 , 1201 , 2271 , 2384 and 2388 of this title .
Special conspiracy provisions were added to sections 2153 and 2154 of this title .
Japan - based Brother Industries has created a wearable , portable version of its retinal imaging display ( RID ) technology , which gives people the chance to see things Terminator - style .
How is this different than other HUD glasses we 've seen ?
The new RID prototype attaches to a basic set of spectacles and works by focusing light onto the retina , moving it at high speeds to generate images that look like they exist right in front of the user .
Too bad the source box is freaking enormous .
Advertisement
The RID is composed of three parts : the light source , the light scanner and the eyepiece module .
The new prototype of the light scanner is roughly the size of a bulky bluetooth headset , about 1000 times smaller than a version Brother showed at EXPO 2005 in Aichi , Japan .
Again , the only thing stopping regular users from calling up stats and checking documents only they can see while strolling around town is the size of the light box :

Brother said it 's planning on a public launch of the device in 2010 .
By that point in time , it 's hoping to have gotten the light box down to the size of a portable hard drive .

Carl Hayden High School 's Falcon Robotics team won the top prize in the international robotics championship over the weekend in Atlanta .
The 42 - member high school team includes students from some of the lowest income neighborhoods in Phoenix .
Twenty - two students went to Atlanta and members of the community will be at Sky Harbor International Airport tonight to honor them when they return .
The teens have competed this school year with a robot they built and named " Virginia 's Dream . "
It was named for a girl that team members knew before she was deported after it was discovered her family was in Arizona illegally .
" I think this is a great thing for Arizona to be recognized as leaders in science and technology at the high school level , " said Fredi Lajvardi , Falcon Robotics team coach .
" There were 26 countries present and Carl Hayden High School from Phoenix , Arizona was No. 1 . "
The Carl Hayden team bested 550 teams from around the world .
The west Phoenix team won the Robotics International Chairman 's Award .
Carl Hayden
High twice was runner - up for the international honor .
The Chairman 's Award goes beyond the team 's winning races at competitions .
It is focused on the team 's effort to change the culture of science from that of stodgy science to one that is fun and exciting .
To reach that point , Carl Hayden 's team reached into the community .
They created an underwater competition in Chandler , created the FIRST Lego middle school tournament , appeared in film clips and mentored elementary - age students interested in joining high school teams .
The trip to Atlanta also involved the team showing judges its robot .
Fourteen - year - old Eduardo Fernandez , a member of the Falcon Robotics team , got teary - eyed when they won .
" It 's like winning the World Series in a science competition , " he said .
" It 's exciting and the feeling is incredible . "
Fernandez started working robotics as a middle school student at Isaac Middle School .
" I love to build , " Fernandez said .
Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne on Monday said the importance of this honor goes beyond the championship .
Science and technology jobs will be abundant in the future , Horne said and competitions like this can draw students to scientific careers .
" The future of the country depends on developing well trained scientists , " Horne said .
" This is a tremendous achievement on the part of the Carl Hayden High School and the students and teachers directly involved . "
The Chairman 's Award brings with it a $ 10,000 scholarship .
Previous winners have gone to the White House and met the President .
FIRST stands for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology .

Not a Shred of Sense 2008 Darwin Award Winner
Unconfirmed by Darwin
To save time ( those fateful words ) the neighbor had placed the shredder at the base of a great oak tree , where he could drop branches directly into the hopper .
He intended to cut off the top third of the oak , since it had been killed by lightning .
With the shredder running wide open , the neighbor climbed his ladder to the first tree branch , stepped off the ladder , slipped , and fell .
The paramedics found him very dead , half in and half out of the shredder 's hopper , one leg shredded to the hip .

Who Could Have Foreseen
It ?!... Apparently not Senators Feinstein and Bennett Who Have Announced New Federal Legislation Which Will Allow the Use of These Very Machines for Years ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/23/2008 , 2:47 pm PT
As God is my witness , there will be blood ... okay , hopefully not blood ... but massive Election Disasters this November .
Disasters which might have , should have , could have , otherwise been averted had Election Officials bothered to actually read this blog every couple of days over the last four years , and done a damned thing about it other than make excuses for their horrible decisions and continuing state of denial .
Keep in mind , we are going to save the most troubling aspect of this report for the very end , so those of you who can take no more of this garbage , will be able to bail out before hand .
If you can take it , prepare to be amazed by the end , as we wend through the massive failures in Arkansas last Tuesday , through mind - blowing new ( disastrous ) federal " Electronic Voting Reform " legislation just announced by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) with Sen. Bill Bennett ( R - UT ) , before landing in West Virginia , where a candidate on last week 's ballot assures us everything is just fine because the guy spotted by voters opening up the voting machines and going inside of them to make adjustments at the polls during Election Day was him .
It 's as bad as it sounds .
Read on , if you feel strong enough , otherwise , abandon hope all ye who enter here ...
ES&S MELTDOWN IN WHITE COUNTY , ARKANSAS ...
Yesterday , we explained some of the details of what went horribly wrong on the ES&S iVotronic touch - screen and op - scan system across White County , Arkansas during their local primary elections on Tuesday .
Today , Warren Watkins of The Daily Citizen goes into much further detail on the massive " fiasco " .
First , congrats and thank you where it 's due : Watkins , in his detailed article on the major " malfunctions , " " failures , " and " errors " in the " fiasco " , does n't once use the words " glitch " " hiccup " " snafu " or " snag " .
For that lack of minimization of these election failures alone , Watkins deserves a Pulitzer prize in this pathetic day and age .
His explanation of all that went wrong in what should have been a small , simple , set of local elections , is simply breathtaking in it 's scope , and serves ( yet again ) as an object lesson for what this country 's Election Officials " could never have foreseen " after it will surely happen this November and beyond .
Among the remarkable failures in WHite County , as reported by Watkins :
An " error of 5,360 votes , or 86 percent above the number of votes cast " in a circuit judge race , discovered only after huge vote count disparities were noted by one of the candidates .
The result of the circuit judge race was overturned after the disparities --- due to thousands of votes double - counted --- were noted , and the race was recounted .
Ballots were programmed prior to daylight savings time , so the machines would not allow for shut down at the close of polls as the machines were not set to handle the election , which took place during daylight savings time , properly .
Absentee ballots , also read by an ES&S product , could not be read when " on primary election night the county ’s only unit capable of doing so malfunctioned .
Provided by ES&S , the vote - counting machine ’s failure resulted in a hand count of the absentee ballots both on election night and during the recount later Wednesday . "
Names were left off the ballot , and in at least one race ( Justice of the Peace , District 2 , Union Township ) " voters were not allowed to vote at first , " forcing the use of paper ballots .
" Further investigation ... is underway to see if enough votes were lost due to the mistake to make a difference .
Only 14 votes separated the two candidates . "
ES&S , of course , is the same company who made the iVotronic touch - screen machines used in Sarasota County 's infamous 13th Congressional District election in 2006 , where 18,000 votes were lost completely , in a race ultimately decided by just 369 votes .
The problem led the state of Florida to finally ban such systems entirely .
Arkansas , however , and thousands of jurisdictions around the country , still use the same machines anyway .
In no small part , because the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) is simply unwilling to do their job and decertify these failed machines all together --- much less even warn about their dangers --- as they should , and as they are mandated by federal law to do .
TOUCH -SCREEN VOTING FOREVER !
FEINSTEIN / BENNETT'S NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION ...
Yeah , we 're as sick of these stories as you are .
So if you can stomach no more , do not click here to read the announcement of Sen.
Diane Feinstein's ( D - CA ) agreement with Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - UT ) for a " Bipartisan Electronic Voting Reform " bill that will institutionalize the very type of wholly unverifiable touch - screen voting systems which already have a years - long record of dismal failure .
Though their press release says the legislation " would help ensure the accuracy , security and accessibility of voting systems , " it will , of course , do nothing of the sort .
It will only continue our long national election nightmare for years to come .
" Under the Act , " the press release reads , " voters casting their ballots using direct recording electronic ( touch screen ) voting systems would be able to simultaneously verify their choices by means of an independent paper , electronic , audio , video , or pictorial record .
Such records would be auditable and would also be available for review in the event of a recount . "
In other words , unverifiable touch - screen systems , the kind Bennet , her partner 's state of Utah , already uses , and the kind that California 's Sec. of State Debra Bowen has already de-certified since they can be easily manipulated such that even a 100 % post - election audit would not reveal the hack , will receive the federal thumbs up from Feinstein 's legislation .
After all of these months ( years ? ) , and despite our repeated attempts to educate her office , Feinstein seems to have apparently learned absolutely nothing about our nation 's voting systems .
It 's astounding .
And if you still can stomach no more , then definitely do not read on about what happened in West Virginia 's Wayne County on the very same , failed , shitty , completely worthless ES&S iVotronic touch - screen voting systems during that state 's primary election last week ...
ES&S FAILS AGAIN IN WAYNE COUNTY , WEST VIRGINIA ...
Congratulations on your strong stomach .
This from the Herald - Dispatch in West Virginia :
Wayne County Commissioner Rick Wellman has filed a complaint with the Secretary of State 's Office claiming that the county 's touch - screen voting machines malfunctioned during the primary election .
Several residents have come forward to complain they had difficulty selecting the candidate they wanted to vote for on the touch screen , Wellman said Thursday .
He also said in his complaint that he believes unauthorized people accessed some of the voting machines at the polls on election day , which was May 13 .
...
J D Prince , who voted at Prichard Elementary School , was one of the five residents who have signed an affidavit .
He said he wanted to vote for Tom Jarrell for magistrate , but when he touched Jarrell 's name on the screen , candidate Jason Stephens ' name popped up .
Prince canceled his vote , and the machine worked correctly the second time .
" Had I not noticed the problem , I would have lost my vote , " Prince said .
" I 've got family that vote at Crum Middle School and Dunlow Elementary and they say the same kind of thing happened there , too . "
Stephens , who lost his bid to become a Wayne magistrate , filed a complaint with the Secretary of State 's Office .
He said when he voted on election day , he had to cancel his vote four times in the Board of Education race .
" It was n't until the fifth time that the machine recorded my vote correctly , " he said .
During canvassing this week , the county commission has found several instances in which voters had to cast their ballot multiple times in a race because the voting machines recorded their vote for the wrong candidate , Wellman said .
Though only a small number of paper receipts have been checked thus far , the errors appear to be widespread and affect several races , including president , sheriff , magistrate , board of education , commissioner of agriculture , secretary of state and county commission , Wellman said .
There 's much more in the original article about voting machines across the county which failed , and had to be " re-calibrated " at the polls on election day .
But the most disturbing part is likely found in the last three grafs of the article .
But Wellman 's daughter , Marcie Eseli , signed an affidavit claiming she saw a man open a voting machine at the Bison Center while she was voting on election day .
The man was accompanied by [ Wayne County Clerk Bob ]
Pasley , Eseli said in her statement .
Pasley said that man was Greg Potter , a former county official who has volunteered in elections for the past 15 years .
However , he said it was not Potter who opened the voting machine .
" It was me .
I had to recalibrate one of the machines .
Greg was standing by me holding tools , " Pasley said .
" The only thing he does is travel around with me on election day .
He 'll check to see if paper rolls are low , but that 's about it . "
Did you get that ?
The man who admits opening the machine at the polls , on Election Day was Pasley .
That 's Wayne County Clerk , Bob Pasley .
A close read of the full story reveals earlier that " Pasley defeated longtime County Commissioner Jim Booton 5,476 to 4,504 in the Democratic primary , according to unofficial results . "
That 's right .
Pasley was opening voting machines , at the polls , during the election , on Election Day , in the very same election in which he was on the ballot !
And , incredibly enough , he uses the fact that it was him , not some other guy who was with him , as the reason that nobody should be worried about what happened during that election on Election Day !
Pasley is the same guy who , in an earlier story this week , on the similar ES&S iVotronic problems in both Wayne and Cabell Counties , WV , " said several of the printers jammed , causing certain votes to be counted and digitally saved , but not displayed on the paper receipt ...
Having a real - time printer attached to the machines just causes more problems than it solves , he said . "
" When the paper jams , the votes might not show up on the paper but the votes will still be counted , " he told the Herald - Dispatch without presenting any evidence for that claim , before adding with a presumably straight face : " You can not vote for the wrong person in this voting system . "

Intel has busted into Cray , securing a deal with the high performance computing specialist to slot Xeon processors in future systems .
Cray 's latest line of hardware remains centered around AMD's Opteron processors .
But now Intel will join the fold , starting in the 2010ish time frame when Cray releases a new line of hardware dubbed the Cascade computers .
This win marks a move by Intel to reach the highest - end of supercomputing systems .
Representatives from the two companies stressed that this deal will include substantial co-engineering work in the years to come .
However , they declined to provide any specifics at all at this time around what such work might entail .
With Cascade , Cray is looking to combine general purpose processors such as Xeon with a host of co-processors dedicated to handling specific software tasks .
Cray said this deal was not a reaction to AMD 's struggles getting out four - core versions of the Opteron chip .
Although , the supercomputer maker was forced to delay the release of recent systems due to AMD 's woes .
So , it must be comforting to bring Intel on as an option .
Cray declined to say whether or not Opterons will also sit in the Cascade units , as has been the plan .
Intel dominates the market for HPC systems with Xeons powering most of the Top500 supercomputers .
That said , it has been the likes of Sun , IBM and Cray that have had the largest supercomputer deals of late with those units centered around Opteron , Power and Cell chips .
So , getting into the Cray account should help Intel grab some of the very largest units . ®
Whoa .
This is heavy Doc .
It appears that an inspired - by version of the Official Shoes of Wired 's Gadget Lab , the Nike McFly 2015 's , will be made available by the end of July and will be renamed as the Nike Hyperdunks .
I know what you 're thinking ( Chicken , McFly ! ) , but get a hold of yourself .
They wo n't include the awesome air - pressurized auto - lacing mechanism from Back to the Future II .
Instead , the shoes will include so - called ' Flywire technology , ' which is really PR - speak for the latest and greatest of ultra light materials .
They sport the same high - ankle boot style of the original movie , and will be available in late July .
But while it 's cool to know that a version of the shoes will become available , there 's one thing about this development that 's a bit bothersome : Kobe Bryant is the main spokesman for the sneaks .
Kobe is not only one the most hated players in basketball , but someone who has been described by various people as ' shady , ' ' unprofessional , ' and ' selfish . '
Why would they want to weigh down the possible awesomeness of these shoes with bad karma ?
Bryant already wore a few pairs of the shoes in a game during the NBA Finals , and big surprise , lost the championship .
Admittedly , we 're a bit possessive of the McFly shoe and only want to see it in its ideal future form .
And yes , Kobe has actually redeemed himself as a person and a player in recent years .
Perhaps , having the similar design of the shoe available now might inspire a gifted DIY 'er to create the self - lacing mechanism to finally create the shoes as they were meant to be .

Bittervoters and the Independent Sector are partnering to bring you a new blogging series .
This blog series will explore all the different ways a variety of nonprofits are starting to embed voter engagement into their work .
We believe that even a limited voter engagement will help you enhance your mission to drive positive changes .
But do n’t take our word for it , check out the following examples .
Each month ,
We will feature one organisation and a unique way they can mobile their communities .
It should come as no surprise that California , America ’s most energy - efficient state , also possesses its strongest economy .
The United States has far greater domestic energy resources than Iceland or Sweden does .
We sit atop the second - largest geothermal resources in the world .
The American Midwest is the Saudi Arabia of wind ; indeed , North Dakota , Kansas , and Texas alone produce enough harnessable wind to meet all of the nation ’s electricity demand .
As for solar , according to a study in Scientific American , photovoltaic and solar - thermal installations across just 19 percent of the most barren desert land in the Southwest could supply nearly all of our nation ’s electricity needs without any rooftop installation , even assuming every American owned a plug - in hybrid .
In America , several obstacles impede the kind of entrepreneurial revolution we need .
To begin with , that trillion dollars in annual coal - and - oil subsidies gives the carbon industry a decisive market advantage .
Meanwhile , an overstressed and inefficient national electrical grid ca n’t accommodate new kinds of power .
At the same time , a byzantine array of local rules impede access by innovators to national markets .
There are a number of things the new president should immediately do to hasten the approaching boom in energy innovation .
A carbon cap - and - trade system designed to put downward pressure on carbon emissions is quite simply a no - brainer .
Already endorsed by Senators McCain , Clinton , and Obama , such a system would measure national carbon emissions and create a market to auction emissions credits .
The supply of credits is then reduced each year to meet pre-determined carbon - reduction targets .
As supply tightens , credit value increases , providing rich monetary rewards for innovators who reduce carbon .
Since it is precisely targeted , cap - and - trade is more effective than a carbon tax .
It is also more palatable to politicians , who despise taxes and love markets .
Industry likes the system ’s clear goals .
This market - based approach has a proven track record .
There ’s a second thing the next president should do , and it would be a strategic masterstroke : push to revamp the nation ’s antiquated high - voltage power - transmission system so that it can deliver solar , wind , geothermal , and other renewable energy across the country .
Right now , a Texas wind - farm manager who wants to get his electrons to market faces two huge impediments .
First , our regional power grids are overstressed and misaligned .
The biggest renewable - energy opportunities — for instance , Southwest solar and Midwest wind — are outside the grids ’ reach .
Furthermore , traveling via alternating - current ( A.C. ) lines , too much of that wind farmer ’s energy would dissipate before it crossed the country .
The nation urgently needs more investment in its backbone transmission grid , including new direct - current ( D.C. ) power lines for efficient long - haul transmission .
Even more important , we need to build in “ smart ” features , including storage points and computerized management overlays , allowing the new grid to intelligently deploy the energy along the way .
Construction of this new grid will create a marketplace where utilities , established businesses , and entrepreneurs can sell energy and efficiency .
The other obstacle is the web of arcane and conflicting state rules that currently restrict access to the grid .
The federal government needs to work with state authorities to open up the grids , allowing clean - energy innovators to fairly compete for investment , space , and customers .
We need open markets where hundreds of local and national power producers can scramble to deliver economic and environmental solutions at the lowest possible price .
The energy sector , in other words , needs an initiative analogous to the 1996 Telecommunications
Act , which required open access to all the nation ’s telephone lines .
Marketplace competition among national and local phone companies instantly precipitated the historic explosion in telecom activity .
Construction of efficient and open - transmission marketplaces and green - power - plant infrastructure would require about a trillion dollars over the next 15 years .
For roughly a third of the projected cost of the Iraq war we could wean the country from carbon .
And the good news is that the government does n’t actually have to pay for all of this .
If the president works with governors to lift constraints and encourage investment , utilities and private entrepreneurs will quickly step in to revitalize the grid and recover their investment through royalties collected for transporting green electrons .
Businesses and homes will become power plants as individuals cash in by installing solar panels and wind turbines on their buildings , and by selling the stored energy in their plug - in hybrids back to the grid at peak hours .
And now to a man who 's an expert at picking up other people 's stories .
Meet David Richards , a journalist who 's done great work in the past .

Smarthouse continuously takes our stories and either reprints them verbatim or does a very slight re-write to give the story an Australian angle .
What Smarthouse does not do is give TWICE any credit for the original reporting .

And so on , and so on .
We 've identified ten articles on other websites , going back two years , which have been reprinted almost verbatim under Richards 's sole by - line on a Smarthouse website .
David Richards first told Media
Watch that in most cases he has licensing agreements that allow him to use other people 's material .
Well , maybe he has .
He even faxed us three of them .
But of those , two do n't seem to cover the websites he 's copied from .
And the other one does n't stack up .
That relates to the website CE Pro .
It 's owned by EH Publishing , of Framingham , Massachusetts .
David Richards faxed us a two page , undated Business Agreement between EH Publishing and 4Square Media 's Smarthome Magazine .
But EH Publishing 's President , Kenneth Moyes , has told Media Watch that David Richards did n't pay consistently ...
so we terminated that agreement ...
Bottom line - he has no current authorization from us to use any of our materials and has not had any for several years .
— Email from Kenneth Moyes ( President , EH Publishing ) to Media Watch
Ah , David Richards explained to Media Watch , but there 's another explanation .
Someone 's been hacking into his websites .
He says he was alerted to the problem by his web techs on February the 14th this year :
We believe that a former employee who had access to our content engine has changed bylines , dates on stories and posted stories without our knowledge in an effort to discredit us .

Read David Richards 's response to Media Watch 's questions .
Well , I guess the mystery hacker might have planted the most recent articles - but how long has he or she been at it ?
Since at least March the tenth , 2006 , apparently , when this article was posted on the PC World website - and appeared , substantially unaltered , on SmartHouse the following day .

The Russians undermined Opec 's attempts to talk down the oil market today by warning that crude prices could almost double to $ 250 per barrel within 18 months .
The prediction from Alexei Miller , chairman of Gazprom , came as the price of oil leaped $ 2.75 to $ 137.10 per barrel even though Opec insisted everyone was already " panicking " unnecessarily and stressed there were no physical energy shortages .
The soaring value of crude today pushed British wholesale gas prices to new record highs of 100.75 p per therm for next winter deliveries .
This will put pressure on domestic heating bills while the current price of motor diesel has already reached £ 1.30 per litre in some parts of the country .
Gazprom said the higher crude prices it expected would drag gas values up too .
" We think it ( oil ) will reach $ 250 a barrel in the foreseeable future , " said Miller insisting that high demand rather than financial speculation was the primary factor for high hydrocarbon prices , an argument that runs counter to that put forward by Opec .
The comments came 24 hours after Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , said supply constraints were partly responsible for the very high crude prices so far .
A spokesman for Gazprom , which is also one of Russia 's largest crude producers , expected the price to hit the $ 250 level sometime in 2009 .
The company exports gas to Europe at prices linked to oil products for historic reasons and Miller said the current gas price was $ 410 per 1,000 cubic metres .
Analysts said the latest Russian energy estimates were hard to support and noted they were not backed up with specified research data .
" It 's crazy ... maybe they know something we do n't , " said one .
Abdullah al - Badri , the secretary general of Opec had earlier appealed for calm , saying the record - high oil price was unbearable and did not reflect any shortage of supply in the market .
" Really we need some calm .
We are panicking too much , " Badri told a global energy summit .
" The situation is unbearable as far as we are concerned .
I want to say , there is no shortage now and in the future . "
Saudi Arabia , the world 's top exporter and Opec 's most influential member , said yesterday it would soon call for a meeting to discuss what it called unjustified rises in prices .
Badri supported holding such a meeting , which he said might happen before the next scheduled Opec gathering on September 9 .
He hoped that measures could be taken to curb speculation in the oil market , a factor Opec believes is inflating prices to levels not justified by supply and demand .
" We are not happy with the current level of price for one reason .
It has nothing to do with the fundamentals , " he said .
" Speculators are playing a big role in high oil prices .
Also there are other considerations , the value of the dollar and the geopolitical situation . "
Opec , which pumps about two in every five barrels of oil , was willing to raise production if needed , although there was no demand for extra barrels .
" Nobody is asking for oil at this time .
We are checking with our member countries .
There is no queue for oil , " he said .
But there could be queues at British service stations this weekend as tanker drivers who deliver supplies to the one in ten forecourts controlled by Shell are threatening to go on a four - day strike starting this Friday as part of a pay dispute .
Gordon Brown told the public not to panic buy fuel but the department of business admits that there is likely to be " stock - outs " at some facilities .
" If the strike were to affect other retailers , it would have a more signficant impact .
The government is working with the wider fuel industry on what could be done to reduce any disruption to the public and business , " said the department which is hoping an Acas arbitration meeting between the Unite union and the haulage firms will break the deadlock .

The Mars Phoenix just issued a highly official twitter update saying that some white , shiny stuff it was staring at has sublimated .
In other words , it 's definitely ice .
The previous discovery of probable ice sent thousands of scientists and NASA fans into violent discovery - gasms , but until the Phoenix team was to observe sublimation , which is when ice skips the liquid state and just evaporates , they could n't be sure .

Digging earlier today , the Phoenix ( which apparently has just 128 MB of RAM ) knocked loose a few white particles that have since disappeared .
So basically , the possibilities are as follows : Sublimation has occurred , there is Martian ice , and our children 's children 's children will enjoy iced lattes and Sno - Cones just like we do , or an alien just realized that we 'd totally uncovered his stash .
Either way , this is pretty exciting .

KDE 4.0 was released to mixed reviews ; more or less everyone recognised the enormous potential of the still young platform , but some doubted whether or not the KDE project had made the right choice by releasing KDE 4.0 as , well , 4.0 .
The KDE developers were clear : just you wait for KDE 4.1 .
They released the first beta of KDE 4.1 today .
The goal of this first beta is to find any bugs and regressions , so that KDE 4.1 can be the version of KDE4 which replaces KDE3 for end users .
The release announcement states the following three highlights of KDE 4.1 :
Greatly expanded desktop shell functionality and configurability
KDE Personal Information Management suite ported to KDE 4
Many new and newly ported applications
A lot of time and energy has been put into Plasma , as anyone following Aaron Seigo ’s blog ( now with punctuation ! ) will know .
Panels can now be multiplied and resized , so users are no longer stuck with just one immobile , inconfigurable panel at the bottom of their display .
The Kickoff menu , my personal pet hate about KDE4 , has been overhauled too , as well as the Run command which allows power users to textually launch just about anything .
The compositing features have also been improved .
Since the release of KDE 4.0 , a number of new applications have been written for or ported to KDE4 , including Kontact , a CD player and Dragon Player ( lightweight multimedia player ) .
The printer applet has been overhauled , and Konquerer got a set of new features such as web browsing sessions , undo mode , improved smooth scrolling , and a full screen picture browsing mode courtesy of Gwenview .
The KDE4 file manager , Dolphin , now supports tabs , and improved folder tree , and the ‘ Copy to …’ makes it return .
There have been a lot of changes under the hood as well :
KHTML gets a speed boost from anticipatory resource loading , while WebKit , its offspring , is added to Plasma to allow OSX Dashboard widgets to be used in KDE .
The use of the Widgets on Canvas feature of Qt 4.4 makes Plasma more stable and lightweight .
KDE ’s characteristic single - click based interface gets a new selection mechanism that promises speed and accessibility .
Phonon , the crossplatform media framework , gains subtitle support and GStreamer , DirectShow 9 and QuickTime backends .
The network management layer is extended to support several versions of NetworkManager .
The final release of KDE 4.1 is scheduled for a July 29th release .
The beta release will find its way to your distribution of choice quickly enough .
They got the scale right .
Vader 's a big guy .
And they got the cloak right .
And ... the lightsaber .

But really , all this does is confirm that while for a percentage of people their fanboy dreams are about to come true , it confirms for the rest of us that this is the stupidest Vader - related idea since someone thought screaming NNNOOOOOO would be touching .

In 2004 , Richard Thomas , Britain 's privacy watchdog , warned that we were " sleepwalking into a surveillance society " .
Four years on , it has been left to Sir Simon Milton , the excellent chairman of the Local Government Association , to take action , calling on local councils to scale back the overzealous use of local surveillance powers .
Everyone wants the police and local authorities to clamp down on crime and antisocial behaviour .
But neighbourhood snoops increasingly peer into every aspect of our daily lives .
Public bodies have amassed 266 separate powers to forcibly enter the home .
There are now 1,000 bugging operations ( and other forms of interception of email and post ) in Britain every day .
Bugging is no longer the preserve of MI5 – hundreds of councils are entitled to exercise these powers .
And it is not just bugging .
Local councils increasingly hire neighbourhood spies to investigate petty misdemeanours , including dog- fouling , rubbish regulation and parking entitlements .
In one case , snoopers spied for weeks on parents taking their children to school to check they really did live in the catchment area – leaving one young girl with sleepless nights .
CCTV provides another illustration .
The current approach is the worst of all worlds – intrusive , ineffective and expensive .
This government spent half a billion pounds on CCTV – one camera for every 14 citizens .
Yet police say 80 % of CCTV footage is unusable in court .
Of course , there are cases where CCTV has helped , but many where it has failed .
After the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in July 2005 , there was no usable footage from any of the CCTV cameras – on the bus , tube or at Stockwell station .
And CCTV is prone to abuse .
In one case , a camera was pointed at a young woman undressing and displayed by operators on a plasma screen at the control centre .
We need a more intelligent deployment of CCTV , one which is both more effective and provides better checks on abuse .
That way we can catch more criminals and preserve the privacy of the innocent .
The abuse of local powers has followed the example of central government .
The government 's fixation with ever - longer periods of pre-charge detention , its obsession with intrusive ID cards and its accumulation of the largest DNA database in the world , has undermined our liberty and privacy , but failed to make us any safer .
Gordon Brown has gagged his ministers from participating in any public debate on these issues during the byelection , which I am fighting against the relentless assault on British liberty .
Today I issued a challenge to every cabinet minister , inviting each one to come and debate with me these vital national issues .
I wo n't hold my breath .
This is not a government with the courage of its convictions .

Russell T Davies oversaw the 21st Century relaunch of Doctor Who Russell T Davies is to step down as executive producer of Doctor Who , the BBC has announced .
Davies is credited with breathing new life into the show he brought back to television screens in 2005 .
Bafta - winning writer Steven Moffat will succeed Davies as lead writer and executive producer of the fifth series of Doctor Who .
Moffat , who was behind Coupling and Jekyll , said the whole of his career was " a secret plan to get this job " .
DAVIES ' CAREER HIGHLIGHTS Children 's Ward ( 1993 - 1995 ) Touching Evil ( 1997 ) Queer As Folk ( 1999 ) Casanova ( 2005 ) Doctor Who ( 2005 - 2008 ) Torchwood ( 2006 - 2008 ) BBC
Fiction controller Jane Tranter said the past four series of Doctor Who had been " brilliantly helmed " by the " spectacularly talented " Davies .
" As lead writer and executive producer , he has overseen the creative direction and detail of the 21st century relaunch of Doctor Who and we are delighted to have his continued presence on the specials over the next 18 months , " she added .
Davies will remain in charge of four specials to be shown in 2009 .
The fifth series , with Moffat at the helm , is scheduled to be broadcast on BBC One in spring 2010 .
Moffat has already written some of the most memorable Doctor Who episodes of recent times , including The Girl in the Fireplace and The Empty Child .
MOFFAT'S CAREER HIGHLIGHTS Press Gang ( 1989 ) Coupling ( 2000 ) Jekyll ( 2007 ) Doctor Who ( 2005 onwards ) Tintin ( 2008 onwards )
Earlier this month , he picked up the best writer Bafta for the Blink episode of series three , which featured terrifying weeping angels .
Moffat said : " I applied before but I got knocked back ' cos the BBC wanted someone else .
Also I was seven .
" Anyway , I 'm glad the BBC has finally seen the light and it's a huge honour to be following Russell into the best - and the toughest - job in television .
" I say toughest ' cos Russell 's at my window right now , pointing and laughing . "
Doctor
Who 's return after a 16 - year break from the screen received praise from critics and fans alike .
Speaking after the first series of the revamped show in 2005 - which starred Christopher Eccleston as the Time Lord - Davies said Doctor Who had been in desperate need of regeneration .

He added : " It 's been everything we planned and more , and it 's very rarely in life you get the chance to have that happen . "
The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989 .
In that time , the lead role was played by seven different actors including William Hartnell , Jon Pertwee , Tom Baker and Peter Davison .

What are these ?
Korea North Korean threats are back in the news lately - this time following the attack on a South Korean naval vessel that cost 46 lives .
Many have noted that this is significantly more aggressive than their usual verbal threats , but even if they are willing to risk war it is not the thing that they really want .
Context - all about the weather
The geography and climate of the peninsula is important to understanding the way Korea originally evolved prior to the arbitrary seperation along the 38th parallel :
So while the two states are close in proximity , their environments are worlds apart .
The south has fertile flood plains , rolling hills , and lots of good fishing - the north has desert , mountains , and very little agricultural land .
Historically , it made sense for these regions to be united .
Due to the long border with 8 million people there are currently at risk from a lack of nutrition .
Meanwhile , the nuclear testing conducted over the last few years has backfired in a spectacular way : instead of drawing in tribute from fearful neighbors , it has reduced the amount of food that rich western states are willing to donate to an increasingly unstable regime .
In fact , the food aid is dwindling in real time and supplies will run out within the month of June unless something changes .
Stuck between starvation and war
Kim Jong
Il is n't a very mentally well - balanced or physically healthy leader .
Or he might be dead and impersonated by a puppet for the benefit of some shadowy cabal that needs an icon the people recognize and fear .
Whatever the truth might be , the son he 's chosen to succeed him is n't exactly going to inspire confidence in anyone .
The bottom line is that there is n't a whole lot holding this society together at the moment , and if the outside sources of food dry up there would be multiple humanitarian disasters breaking out all at once : the deaths by starvation , and the inevitable military crackdown on a population with nothing left to lose from revolt .
The alternative doomsday scenario , of course , is war .
And at some point , war does become the best choice for North Korea if they are forced to choose between an offense against the south and famine & internal implosion .
War might be a 99 % chance of loss , but there is a 100 % chance that they wo n't produce enough food to sustain their population .
If the tone regarding talk of North Korea is different this time , it is because there are a few extra factors adding stress to an already desperate situation .
While it is impossible to return to the pre-nuclear status quo of food aid in response to aggressive language , a failure to support the nutritional needs of the North will soon lead to mass death one way or the other .
IT BEGINSA disturbing but little - known fact about humor is that , in our modern age of instant communication , the time it takes for a joke to go from humorous to intolerable is roughly 5 minutes -- but it was n't always like this .
There was once a time when a joke could be made , laughed at , and occasionally referenced in the future when necessary ; unfortunately , this lifestyle has fallen behind in favor of turning every possible online and offline space into an echo chamber where the Internet 's shared sense of humor runs everything right into the fucking ground .
As I write this , some kid who may or may not be severely autistic claimed to like turtles , which in turn caused CafePress to take over the entire power grid of the West Coast in order to keep up with the demand of " I like tuhtles " merchandise .
So when you wander onto campus this week with your newest Internet meme printed on the rugged cheesecloth that is a CafePress t- shirt , you 'll know it 's safe to drag anyone behind a truck who sports apparel featuring animals that have buckets and can't conjugate verbs correctly .
Of course , the utter destruction of humor had its roots planted long before impact font was placed onto pictures of animals with hilarious results .
Throughout the 80s and 90s , television shows like Saturday Night Live emitted catchphrases on a weekly basis so bored office workers could have something to talk about during the day in between all of the passive - aggression and daydreaming about rape fantasies .
But if you ran into anyone doing their impression of Dana Carvey doing his impression of George Bush , or perhaps trying to emulate Rob Schneider 's annoying Richmeister character without realizing the irony of the situation , it was always possible to physically move away from them or poison their coffee a little each day until total paralysis set in .
And , even when catchphrases encroached upon our daily lives , it was sometimes adorable to hear a mother or confused relative playfully mutter something like " No soup for you ! " if only to prove that they did n't take NBC lightly when the network told them Thursdays were " Must See TV . "
DRAMATIZATIONBut if Seinfeld episodes like " The Soup Nazi " had aired ten years later , think of how much more grating the reaction would have been .
Millions of images of Jason Alexander emblazoned with the caption " I LIEK SOUPS . "
Millions more pictures of the Soup Nazi , posted in retaliation : " NO MOAR SOUPS . "
Naruto music videos based on the joke .
Soup references in every webcomic .
Soup Nazi cosplay .
Peak Oil reached .
Ron Paul elected President .
The world 's volcanoes erupt in unison .
All because the Internet ruins everything .
And because you 're on the Internet , it 's very likely that you 're ruining something right now .
Before you scoff , please humor me .
Look down at your shirt .
Does it have a sassy quote on it , possibly originating from the Internet ?
Is it tucked into your cargo shorts ?
I want to help you .
But first , I must detail how a joke gets ruined in the foolish hopes that you will never do this again .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed a set of sweeping changes on Monday aimed at modernizing the nation 's financial system in what could herald the biggest regulatory overhaul of Wall Street since the Great Depression .
The plan , which would broadly expand the Federal Reserve 's powers , comes as concerns about the housing crisis and its fallout in the financial system continues to fuel calls for change in Washington .
The Paulson changes , if enacted , would be largely invisible to consumers but would drastically alter how the financial services industry is regulated .
" Government has a responsibility to make sure our financial system is regulated effectively , " Paulson said .
" And in this area , we can do a better job . "
But the Treasury chief was cautious to warn that changes could take " many years to complete . "
Democrats , on the whole , slammed the Bush administration proposal .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd of Connecticut called it a " failure of leadership " and argued that regulators are not taking advantage of the powers already at their disposal .
Among the plan 's proposals is one that would grant additional powers to the Federal Reserve , essentially transforming it into a regulator that would stabilize financial markets .
The Fed , along with the Treasury Department , has attempted to shepherd the nation through the housing crisis and the recent turmoil in financial markets .
Earlier this month , the Fed orchestrated a marriage between JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) , which was on the verge of a collapse that threatened to send shockwaves through the broader financial system .
Under the Paulson plan , the Fed would essentially serve as a financial markets moderator , stepping in if the nation 's markets were again threatened by an episode like the near collapse of Bear Stearns .
The plan would also give the central bank greater oversight of investment banks and previously unregulated entities like hedge funds and private equity firms that have wielded growing influence in financial markets in recent years .
Up to now , the Fed has played a important but much smaller role in the nation 's financial system - setting the country 's monetary policy and acting as one of the handful of regulators responsible for overseeing banks .
Streamlining agencies
The Treasury began examining the American financial system 's ability to compete with maturing foreign markets about a year ago .
Since the last major overhaul in the 1930s , much of the change in the nation 's financial system has been reactionary , with new regulatory agencies created in response to previous market crises .
Paulson , the former CEO and chairman of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs , said that as a result , regulators now find themselves duplicating each other 's efforts , while other key regulatory issues slip through the cracks - a glitch the Treasury plan would hope to correct .
One suggestion involves combining the Securities and Exchange Commission , which ensures the functioning of financial markets and is responsible for protecting investors , with the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission , which regulates the trading of futures contracts of such key commodities as oil , gold and wheat .
The Treasury plan would also fold the Office of Thrift Supervision - the overseer of federally - chartered institutions that function much like banks - into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
The comptroller is responsible for overseeing national banks .
On the housing front , the plan would allow for the creation of a federal regulator for the mortgage industry , dubbed the Mortgage Origination Commission .
The commission would aim to rein in the questionable practices of both lenders and brokers , who are now required to abide by a patchwork of state regulations .
In addition , the insurance industry could experience dramatic changes , under the plan .
Insurance companies would now have the option to be regulated at the federal level , instead of the current state - run model , which has been in effect for more than 130 years .
" I am not suggesting that more regulation is the answer , " Paulson said Monday .
" I am suggesting that we should and can have a structure that is designed for the world we live in , one that is more flexible , one that can better adapt to change . "
Act cautiously
Putting any part of the plan into effect , however , would require legislation , which could face a headwind with the nation in an election year and some congressional Democrats already showing hesitancy over the plan .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . said the proposal was " a step in the right direction " but urged more action .
Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank , who chairs the House Financial Services Committee and recently proposed his own set of regulatory changes , said Paulson 's proposal provided " an important service " but said he disagreed with some of its specifics .
" The plan goes too far in diminishing the role of the states , and not far enough in conferring needed new powers on the Federal Reserve over non-bank financial institutions for which they now have greater responsibility , " Frank said .
Industry groups , which spoke in favor and against the plan over the weekend as its details became widespread , are likely to weigh in as well as the debate moves forward .
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , which represents more than 650 financial services firms , called Paulson 's plan " thoughtful " and " sweeping . "
The Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America , which represents more than 300,000 independent insurance agents , brokers and their employees questioned the insurance component of the proposal , arguing that there are better ways to overhaul of the insurance industry without creating a " new federal bureaucracy . "
In his speech , however , Paulson urged restraint , saying that enacting major changes could burden a market already under strain .
" These long - term ideas require thoughtful discussion and will not be resolved this month or even this year , " he said .
Sixty years ago , room sized computers for extremely specific applications were an impressive technology demonstration .
We all know how that evolved .
At a comparable stage in the advance of biotechnology , today we see that bioartificial implants - cells combined with microscale and chemical engineering - can perform one of the tasks of a pancreas :
Encapsulating a large collection of islets has been difficult , he says , because the material to make that capsule has never been designed for that purpose .
" This device differs because its polymer membrane has been designed to have the optimal properties for encapsulating islets , " Rosenthal tells C&EN .
" It allows for free movement of insulin and glucose but restricts access of immune molecules that might attack the encapsulated islets . "
Likewise , any viruses that might be piggybacking on the islets are trapped behind the membrane .
" Because of that , we can use pig cells , and the only thing that communicates between them and the patient are the small molecules and small proteins , " Rosenthal notes .
The polymer can also sequester oxygen from the environment , thanks to its silicone - based components .
This oxygen nourishes the encapsulated islets cells .
" These membranes are biocompatible , flexible , transparent , autoclavable , and they 're easily synthesized and relatively inexpensive , " Rosenthal says .
Those room sized computers were pretty clunky and dedicated ; the real challenge was in integrating such a beast with the processes and organization it was intended to help .
The same is true of medical implants and helper devices , as we 're just not very good at putting things in the body yet , measured on the grand scale of what is possible .
It 's tough , expensive and often damaging to the patient .
But take a look at the computer you 're using to read this post .
Sixty years ago , you 'd have had to build a city of rooms to match its power .
Integration of that power for use in specific tasks is easy now , and an entire infrastructure exists to handle the tasks that are beyond one person 's time and energy .
So to the future of bioartificial organs .
A computer does n't look much like a brain , a slide - rule , or a typewriter .
The bioartificial pancreas of the future wo n't look a whole lot like the pancreas you 're carrying around with you at the moment .
In parallel to work on regenerative medicine and repair of aging - aiming to maintain the body we have - we will see a great breadth of development in semi-organic prostheses and other functional replacements , and the growth of support infrastructure for that technology .
There is a certain logic here that suggests bioartificial bodies as an end - point : consider that researchers can build a bioartificial pancreas , but it 's still that case that long - term use of implants is a burden in the best cases , and simply impossible in most others .
The problem is the integration between systems we have built and evolved systems in the body : everything from matching blood vessels to dealing with the immune system response is a challenge .
So instead of hooking your new bioartificial organ up to a body , would n't it be easier to hook it up to another collection of bioartificial organs , where it is perfectly feasible to control all the interactions ?
The end of that line of thinking is a comprehensive support machinery for the human brain , an entirely different form of body and technology base in beneficial competition with regenerative medicine .
Choice is good ; mix and match .
It 's a challenge to say what will be hard and will be easy 20 years from now , never mind further out .
Maybe controlling the body to accept long - term implant use is trivial in 2030 , and everyone queues up for the latest blood filter device from a Japanese fashion house , as it's substantially better than the one you were born with .
But if you 're interested in living for a long time , it 's a benefit to keep up with what is happening today , and think about what is plausible in the years ahead .
Some of the items in your pantry ( like baking soda and vinegar ) work as effective all - purpose cleaners and , even better , cost next to nothing .
So the next time you 're staring down a big mess but you 're out of your favorite cleaning product , do n't run to the store — try one mixing up one of these DIY homemade cleaners instead .
These natural products will kick grime to the curb and keep your wallet happy .
Important Safety Tip : Never combine ammonia - based cleaners with chlorine bleach or products containing bleach , such as powdered dishwasher detergent .
The fumes they 'll create are extremely dangerous .
Before doing any mixing , read the product labels first .
Always label any bottles of DIY cleaners with all the ingredients inside .
In case a child or animal gets into it , it ’s important to know what the mixture contains .

How the Party of Lincoln was Left Behind on Civil Rights
Abraham Lincoln would be amazed by this race - but not for the reason you might think .
In an under - remarked historic irony , the political party that long defended slavery and racial segregation has become the first to nominate an African - American for president .
And the GOP , the Party of Lincoln , which fought for union and advanced civil rights from Reconstruction to Little Rock , has been left with a troubling lack of diversity on its political bench .
The legacy of Lincoln and the Civil War formed the basic fault lines of American politics .
From 1860 to 1960 , the current " red " and " blue " states were reversed , with the south voting solidly Democratic for 100 years while Republicans generally dominated the north .
But Democrats engineered a political role - reversal when Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights
Act over southern conservative objections , infamously remarking to his press secretary Bill Moyers , " I just gave the south to the Republicans for your lifetime and mine . "
The realignment accelerated as some conservative Republicans smelled electoral opportunity in the Democrats ' shift .
Icons Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
Like Reagan and Bush , Goldwater was no segregationist - he had desegregated his family 's department store and the Arizona Air National Guard .
But on advice from Phoenix lawyer and future Supreme Court chief justice William Rehnquist , Goldwater decided with a somewhat heavy heart that the Civil Rights Act was an unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of individual states .
Mississippi returned the favor by casting 87 % of its votes for Goldwater - the first time the state had voted Republican in its history .
This southern strategy may have sold the Party of Lincoln 's soul , but the Faustian bargain contributed to four - decades of political gain .
Since 1968 , Republicans have won 7 of 10 presidential elections .
Before 1968 , the opposite was true - Democrats won 7 of 10 .
But now the bill may be coming due .
Demographics are destiny and America is becoming less white , male and rural - more diverse and urban .
There are 43 African - Americans currently serving in Congress - all are Democrats .
There are 30 Hispanics - 24 are Democrats .
And of the 89 women serving in Congress 64 are Democrats .
It is difficult to remember that the first African - American senator and the first female senator freely elected to the Senate were both Republicans : Ed Brooke of Massachusetts and Margaret Chase Smith of Maine .
And of the 23 African - Americans who served in Congress before 1900 , every single one was a member of the original progressive party - the Republicans .
To some this may seem like a dusty fact and even an impolite point , but as Reagan used to say , " facts are stubborn things . "
The Republican Party has some catching up to do .
Now is the time - and McCain may be the candidate - for Republicans to begin restoring their reputation as the Party of Lincoln .
McCain has been challenging his party to grow since gaining the nomination , refusing to just play to the base , campaigning in places like Selma , Youngstown and the 9th Ward in New Orleans .
As a western conservative , McCain has the pioneer libertarian perspective : strong on national security and individual freedom , skeptical of the social coercions that come with collectivism .
He has never been intimidated by threats from social conservative special interests .
This is a Republican brand that can broaden its appeal to independents who reject hyper - partisanship , while building a broad new generation of Republicans .
Of course , the contrast with Obama makes McCain 's job of reviving the Republican Party even tougher - he looks every inch the older white man by comparison .
But his principled independence and personal heroism may make up some of the gap .
McCain almost lost the nomination because he stuck to his guns and supported the immigration plan that the Tom Tancredos ( and Mitt Romneys ) of the party opposed .
It 's one powerful proof point that may keep Latinos from abandoning the GOP this fall .
As part of this larger effort , McCain should specifically reject the race - based electability argument floated by some in the Hillary Clinton - camp after her blow - out wins in West Virginia and Kentucky .
He should say to the American people : " if you 're inclined to vote for me because my opponent is black , then I do n't want your vote . "
The real game - changer would be to convince Colin Powell or Condi Rice to serve as his Vice - President .
Tapping former Maryland Lt. Governor Michael Steele head of the RNC would also be a step in the right direction .
But such Hail Mary passes can't be depended on to undo decades of damage overnight .
The GOP can reclaim the better angels of their nature by consistently recruiting minority candidates and reaching out in their own version of the 50 - state strategy .
The idea of an Urban Republican should no longer sound like an oxymoron or an entry on the endangered species list .
Advancing policies like school choice and political reform alongside fiscal responsibility and public safety could help - especially if the national party embraces the reasonable edge of emerging ideas like environmentalism , and stops being seen as demonizing groups like gays and other minorities .
The Republican Party was right on civil rights for the first one - hundred years of its existence .
It was right when the Democratic Party was wrong .
Its future strength and survival will depend on rediscovering that legacy of individual freedom amid America 's essential diversity .
To win in the 21st century , the Party of Lincoln needs to start looking like the Party of Lincoln again .

Ahead of Israel 's 60th Anniversary celebrations , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is expected authorized the release of some 30 Israelis from the state 's prisons , thus allowing them to serve the remainder of their sentences in Israel , Yedioth Ahronoth reported Friday .
Hanukkah Party Chabad parties it up with Schwarzenegger Israel Bardugo
Ynet correspondent Israel Bardugo heads to California for a Chabad - hosted Hanukkah party at Governor Schwarzenegger 's residence .
Take a look at the festivities that millions in America saw broadcasted live Chabad parties it up with Schwarzenegger
California 's overcrowded prison system was cited as the official reason for the release of the prisoners .
The state 's prisons currently house 170,000 inmates , about 77,000 more than they can actually hold .
The gesture marks a shift in the policy of the state 's parole board , which has rejected numerous pleas by Israeli prisoners for an early release .
Mordehai Tzivlin , a defense attorney for the Israeli prisoners abroad and their families , said leaders of California 's Jewish community were behind Schwarzenegger 's decision .
According to Israeli Foreign Ministry data , 40 Israelis are currently being held in Los Angeles prisons , while 15 more are serving time in San Francisco for various offenses , including murder , money laundering , drug - trafficking and fraud .
It is estimated that the list of prisoners slated for release will not include Israelis who were indicted for murder or those who hold American citizenship .
Israelis imprisoned in California 's federal prisons will also be excluded .
The transfer of the prisoners to Israel is scheduled to begin in the beginning of June and will be concluded within a few months .
The International Division at the State Prosecutor 's Office has already drafted a list of 31 prisoners Israel is requesting that Californian authorities release as part of the gesture .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Nearly seven years after their defeat by U.S. forces , the Taliban have regrouped and have formed a " resilient insurgency , " according to a new Pentagon report on security in Afghanistan .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates says Pakistan recognizes that the attackers are a problem .
On the same day the number of U.S. and allied troops killed in Afghanistan in June has reached 40 , the highest monthly toll of the 7 - year - old war .
" The Report Toward Security and Stability in Afghanistan , " the first progress report to Congress , says that although there has been some progress in battling the Taliban , setbacks are expected .
Although NATO and Afghan force operations kept the insurgency down in 2007 by killing or capturing key leaders and clearing out Taliban safe havens , the report predicted that the Taliban would be back in 2008 .
" The Taliban is likely to maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks and bombings in 2008 , " the report said .
The report looks at the progress through April , before the rise in violence seen over recent weeks .
On June 14 , a suicide bomb at an Afghan prison in Kandahar freed hundreds of Taliban prisoners .
There also have been numerous attacks on the restive Afghanistan - Pakistan border in recent weeks .
There are 32,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
About 14,000 serve as part of the larger NATO force , and 18,000 are separate , involved in training and on counterterrorism operations .
The report 's authors highlight the eastern border town of Khost as an example of success by coalition forces .
Once considered to be an ungovernable insurgent stronghold , the city has been turned around by security and reconstruction efforts , they say .
But the report seems a bit outdated .
" It actually was not bad until a few months ago , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this week .
" This is a fairly recent phenomenon of seeing the numbers come across the border .
After all , Khost was an example of a successful counterinsurgency . "
The report 's predictions for 2008 seem to be holding true .
It describes a two - front insurgency , with the Taliban ruling in the south and a partnership of insurgent groups -- including al Qaeda -- in the east .
The confederation is made up of both Afghan and Pakistani - based groups with the shared goals of expelling outside military forces and the " imposition of a religiously conservative Pashtun - led government , " it said .
The Pentagon report also says the progress of the Afghan army and national police is slow because of a lack of trainers and corruption .
Counter - narcotics also suffered a setback : Opium production increased " substantially " in 2007 , the report says .
" Counter - narcotics efforts have resulted in gains over the past six years [ but ] the battle against drug traffickers is ongoing , and will be for some time , " it says .
According to a 2007 U.N. survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers .
The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade .
Taliban militants have increased their attacks this year .
The top U.S. commander in southeastern Afghanistan , Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Schloesser , said Tuesday that attacks on his troops were up 40 percent in the first five months of 2008 .
The latest casualty came when a coalition service member on a reconnaissance patrol in western Afghanistan was killed Thursday , the U.S. - led coalition said Friday .
The incident took place in the Gulistan District of Farah province .
Five coalition and two Afghan soldiers were wounded .
Three U.S. - led troops southwest of Kabul in Wardak province were also killed Thursday .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday that one of the reasons for the increase was that more people are " coming across the border from the frontier area [ of Pakistan ] . "
Gates said he hoped a newly announced Pakistani effort to clamp down on Islamic militants in the country 's northwestern tribal districts would improve the situation in Afghanistan .
" The ability of the Taliban and other insurgents to cross that border and not being under any pressure from the Pakistani side of the border is clearly a concern , " Gates said .
One of the weapons of choice for militants in Afghanistan is the roadside bomb .
Pentagon figures detailing the number of roadside bombs detonated and found in Afghanistan illustrate the level of insurgent activity .
In 2007 , 876 roadside bombs blew up , and 439 were found .
This year , 431 have blown up , with 354 found .
The war in Afghanistan began after the al Qaeda terror network , harbored by the country 's ruling Taliban regime , attacked New York and Washington on September 11 .
A U.S. - led invasion quickly toppled the Taliban regime .
Since then , the coalition and NATO - led troops have been battling a Taliban insurgency .

As if the divisions between race and gender in the Democratic Party had n’t been further exposed through Tuesday night ’s exit polls — and by a very heated exchange on CNN between Donna Brazile and Paul Begala — Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s interview with USA Today on Wednesday is further mining those tense depths .
“ I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on , ” she said in the interview , citing an article by The Associated Press .
It “ found how Senator Obama ’s support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again , and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me . ”
“ There ’s a pattern emerging here , ” she said .
While she said her remarks were n’t meant to be divisive , they ’re already whipping around the Internet .
“ These are the people you have to win if you ’re a Democrat in sufficient numbers to actually win the election .
Everybody knows that , ” she said in the interview .
( Hint , hint , message to the superdelegates still undeclared . )
In Indiana alone , six in 10 white voters went for Mrs. Clinton , where she narrowly won the primary .
Bill Burton , a spokesman for the Obama campaign , told the newspaper that Mr. Obama had made inroads in Tuesday ’s contests .
And he added that her comments “ are not true and frankly disappointing . ”
On Tuesday night , we mentioned the dustup between two Democratic pundits , Ms. Brazile and Mr. Begala , who engaged in a prime - time debate about the coalitions being built by Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton .
Mr. Begala , a Clinton supporter , said the party could not win in November with just “ eggheads and African - Americans , ” that the party could not ignore white middle - class voters .
Ms. Brazile , who said she was not “ undecided but undeclared ” when it came to her choice for a candidate , shot back that Mr. Begala ’s notions were dividing the party .
( And that she ’d chugged down many a beer with Joe and Jane “ six - pack ” in an effort to woo white voters . )
We ’re revisiting their spirited exchange to demonstrate how divided party loyalists are right now .

The Queen was greeted by a man who made faces at her as she met the world gurning champion on a visit to Cumbria .
She was in Whitehaven to mark the town 's 300th anniversary when she was treated to a special performance by Tommy Mattinson .
Mr Mattinson , a master of the art of pulling faces while sticking his head through a horse collar , won the title at the Egremont crab apple fair .
The Queen was also greeted by 10,000 people on her visit to Whitehaven .
She arrived in the harbour town , along with Prince Phillip , by Royal Train on Thursday morning .
They officially opened the refurbished Beacon museum and were special guests at a re-enactment of the freedom of the harbour granted to the US Navy in 1999 .

Gerard Richardson , of the Maritime Festival Committee , said : " It was n't just the flag waving , it was the people wanting to reach out and touch hands , and the flowers .
It was absolutely outstanding .
" And to receive genuinely warm comments from Her Majesty about the area was really a bonus . "
Thursday marks 300 years since the Whitehaven Town and Harbour Act , which established a Board of Trustees to govern the area .
The Liverpool - based tall ship Zebu has also arrived for the anniversary celebrations .
After visiting the town , the Royal Couple headed for the Cumberland Pencil Company in Workington and lunch in Keswick before the final visit of the day to the Food Technology Centre in Penrith .
For 5,000 years or so , the only way to shape metal has been to " heat and beat . "
Even in modern nanotechnology , working with metals involves carving with electron beams or etching with acid .
Now , Cornell researchers have developed a method to self - assemble metals into complex nanostructures .
Applications include making more efficient and cheaper catalysts for fuel cells and industrial processes and creating microstructured surfaces to make new types of conductors that would carry more information across microchips than conventional wires do .
The method involves coating metal nanoparticles -- about 2 nanometers ( nm ) in diameter -- with an organic material known as a ligand that allows the particles to be dissolved in a liquid , then mixed with a block co-polymer ( a material made up of two different chemicals whose molecules link together to solidify in a predictable pattern ) .
When the polymer and ligand are removed , the metal particles fuse into a solid metal structure .
" The polymer community has tried to do this for 20 years , " said Ulrich Wiesner , Cornell professor of materials science and engineering , who , with colleagues , reports on the new method in the June 27 issue of the journal Science .
" But metals have a tendency to cluster into uncontrolled structures .
The new thing we have added is the ligand , which creates high solubility in an organic solvent and allows the particles to flow even at high density . "
Another key factor , he added , is to make the layer of ligand surrounding each particle relatively thin , so that the volume of metal in the final structure is large enough to hold its shape when the organic materials are removed .
" This is exciting , " Wiesner said .
" It opens a completely novel playground because no one has been able to structure metals in bulk ways .
In principle , if you can do it with one metal you can do it with mixtures of metals . "
Wiesner and two Cornell colleagues , Francis DiSalvo , the J.A. Newman Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology , and Sol Gruner , the John L. Wetherill Professor of Physics , as well as other researchers , report in Science how they used the new method to create a platinum structure with uniform hexagonal pores on the order of 10 nm across ( a nanometer is the width of three silicon atoms ) .
Platinum is , so far , the best available catalyst for fuel cells , and a porous structure allows fuel to flow through and react over a larger surface area .
The researchers began by mixing a solution of ligand - coated platinum nanoparticles with a block co-polymer .
The solution of nanoparticles combines with just one of the two polymers .
The two polymers assemble into a structure that alternates between small regions of one and the other , in this case producing clusters of metal nanoparticles suspended in one polymer and arranged around the outside of hexagonal shapes of the other polymer .
Many other patterns are possible , depending on the choice of polymers .
The material is then annealed in the absence of air , turning the polymers into a carbon scaffold that continues to support the shape into which the metal particles have been formed .
Wiesner and colleagues have previously used the carbon scaffold approach to create porous nanostructures of metal oxides .
The final step is to heat the material to a higher temperature in air to oxidize the ligands and burn away the carbon .
Metal nanoparticles have a very low melting point at their surface , so the particles sinter together into a solid metal structure .
The researchers have made fairly large chunks of porous platinum this way , up to at least a half - centimeter across .
In addition to making porous materials , the researchers said , the technique could be used to create finely structured surfaces , the key to the new field of plasmonics , in which waves of electrons move across the surface of a conductor with the information - carrying capacity of fiber optics , but in spaces small enough to fit on a chip .

If you 're looking for some bank - breaking works of less - than - staggering genius , look no further .
Not only were these five leaders plagued by terrible ideas , they never bothered to get their money 's worth .
1. Caligula's Bridge ( Over Very Troubled Waters )
As he was going mad , the Roman emperor Caligula began spending money on increasingly bizarre and extravagant projects to satisfy his megalomaniacal whims .
Among Caligula 's best efforts : constructing a three - mile pontoon bridge across the Bay of Naples by confiscating merchant ships , having their bulwarks sawed off ( making them useless afterward ) , spreading soil over the planks , and then planting trees , shrubs , and flowers to make the bridge more pleasant .
When it was done , Caligula supposedly rode his horse across the bridge at the head of 20,000 troops to prove wrong an earlier prophecy that claimed he could no more become emperor than ride across the bay .
After a night of partying , Caligula left and never came back .
The bridge itself was destroyed by a storm a short while later .
2. Nero's Extreme Home Makeover
As the noted gossip Suetonius tells it , the emperor Nero decided to go Caligula one better by building an extravagant mansion for himself in burned down neighborhoods of Rome following the great fire of 64 CE .
Called the Domus Aurea , or " Golden House , "  because its exterior was overlaid with gold leaf and mother of pearl embedded with gems and beautiful seashells , the building was far and away the largest private residence ever seen in Rome , covering a large part of three of Rome 's seven hills .
So , just how extravagant was Nero 's crib ?
In the entrance hall stood a 120 - foot statue ( of Nero ) ; a columned arcade ran for a mile ; a pool the size of a small lake was surrounded by buildings shaped like cities and fake farms ; exotic animals roamed everywhere ; and the ceilings were carved ivory panels that could retract to allow a rain of perfume and flowers to fall on partiers .
The Roman poet Martial said of it , " One house took up the whole city of Rome . " 
When it was finished Nero famously said , " Good , now I can at last begin to live like a human being . " 

3. Prince of Thieves ( Mainly the White - Collar Variety )
Prince Jefri Bolkiah , the brother of the sultan of Brunei , spent his small country into bankruptcy during the 1990s with a multibillion puts all the other royal contenders to shame .
Clearly , Prince Jefri knew how to treat himself right , as the 300,000 citizens of Brunei found out when his purchases were put up for auction as part of bankruptcy proceedings ( pictured , courtesy of the BBC ) .
Included for sale were a golden toilet roll holder , rows of gold plated Jacuzzis and showerheads , porcelain flamingos , gold plated wastepaper baskets , a multi-million dollar marquee complex , Comanche helicopter simulators , an Airbus jet , a Formula 1 racing car , and a bronze plated eight - foot - high Trojan horse .
Luxury hotels in Great Britain , France , and Singapore were also favorite purchases of Jefri .
That 's not to say he has n't been caught with his fingers in more than a few ( illegal ) pies .
Previously , a lawsuit had been brought against Jefri for the theft of approximately $ 16 billion from Brunei 's state run economic development agency .
Needless to say , he did n't develop anything profitable with the funds .
4. Versailles and Everything After
Louis XIV was one of the most extravagant kings in French history .
A lot of the stuff Louis spent money on was quite respectable — as a famous patron of arts he supported literary and cultural figures like MoliÃ¨re , Le Brun , and Lully , and he spent a great deal of money to improve the Louvre .
Of course , Louis ' most famous boondoggle was his palace at Versailles , a sprawling 700 room rococo residence on an 800 - hectare estate with carefully tended gardens and woodlands about 15 miles to the southwest of Paris .
In fact , Louis used so many luxurious materials — including gold leaf , crystal chandeliers and doorknobs , silk and satin window dressings , exotic hardwood furniture , ivory , mother of pearl , and precious stones — and his house contained so many famous works of art , that it 's actually impossible to calculate a modern cost equivalent .
If the spending was n't bad enough , Louis also foolishly kicked out the Huguenots , or French Protestants , even though they provided many of the country 's leading merchants and much of its tax income .
Last but not least , Louis launched an endless series of unwinnable wars that were to put the last nail in the coffin of French finances .
Who knew the nickname the Sun King referred to one that was setting ?

5. Empress Dowager 's Ship That Never Sailed
In 1888 , China had been on the ropes for a good three decades .
Once an international powerhouse , the nation 's world rep had suffered greatly since its humiliating loss to Great Britain in the Opium War .
Foreign technical advisors told the mandarins who set policy that China needed a modern navy along Western lines if it was going to defend itself from further European and Japanese aggression , and the mandarins duly set aside 30 million taels of silver for new , modern ships .
However , the dowager empress Cixi , who had the final say , decided that the money would be better spent on reconstructing the elaborate Summer Palace , which had served as a vacation spot for the Chinese imperial family for millennia .
When advisors complained that the only ship she had purchased was a marble pleasure yacht , she noted that while it was indeed immobile , " it 's still a very nice place for a picnic . " 
Ed. Note :
This list was pulled from Forbidden Knowledge .
Ever since they burned the White House , the Secret Service has been a little edgy about British veterans carrying gas cans .
Maurice Kirk , 63 , who is nicknamed the “ Flying Vet ” , learned this lesson when he tried to pin a thank you note on the gate of Bush ’s ranch .
He flew to Texas to thank Bush for his rescue by the Coast Guard in February .
He ended up in a psychiatric hospital , charged with a criminal acts and facing deportation .
It appears that , with President Bush now the most unpopular president in history , it is considered manifest insanity for anyone to be thankful to Bush for any aspect of his service .
Kirk previously had a pretty good feeling about Americans after he was rescued from sharks when his Piper Cub plane went down on the Caribbean during an around - the - world flight .
There is no question that Kirk is eccentric with a controversial background .
Click here .
However , it was not until he tried to thank Bush that the instability of Kirk became obvious .
I can only imagine how implausible his reason for landing must have appeared to the Secret Service .
“ Right , you want to thank the President .
Nobody wants to the thank the President .
Even the First Lady merely tolerates him but never ever thanks him .
How stupid do you think we are ? ”
When he landed , he was faced with drawn guns and told to walk a white line .
He is arthritic and had a hard time .
They first therefore tried to charge him with being drunk but tests showed that he was inconveniently sober .
He tried to pin a thank - you note to the gate and was immediately put in handcuffs and sent to a psychiatric hospital in Austin .
( We appear to be picking up a lesson from China and Russia on the use of psychiatric hospitals ) .
After being found strangely sane , he was then arrested for “ walking around town aimlessly ” with a gas can .
He would like to have the charges removed from his record before he leaves .
He should feel fortunate .
The President has claimed the right to declare people enemy combatants and bar them from access to the courts , lawyers , media or family .
Besides , he was given a unique tourist insight into life in the United States .
I just hope that the Secret Service agreed to a picture for back home .

When I was in high school , I got into a discussion with a couple of my classmates over the role institutions played in our lives .
I had made some comment critical of government , or organized religion , or corporations — I do n’t recall which — and was asked if I was opposed to all such systems .
I replied that I was " distrustful of all organizations , from two - handed poker on up . "
This intuitive insight has stayed with me all of my life .
Many years later , I would discover a man whose life - work consisted of using humor to express these sentiments .
It is difficult to find words that convey the sadness I felt upon being awakened , this morning , to the news that George Carlin had died the night before .
He was the successor to the man I continue to regard as the most significant dismantler of authority in my lifetime , Lenny Bruce .
To most people , Bruce and Carlin were nothing more than dealers in four - letter words ; men who loved to shock the sensibilities of others .
But there was a deeper meaning in their humor , and modern libertarian thinking would not have been possible without their important groundwork .
Each man understood , at least implicitly , that the authority some men presume to exercise over the lives of others depends upon the subjugated regarding their managers with an unquestioning reverence and awe .
One ought never to be so bold as to offer an opinion contrary to that provided by the authority figure .
More than that , one must always look upon himself or herself as fundamentally inferior to this authority .
One does not dare to gaze upon the king , to whom groveling is the expected position .
Bruce and Carlin understood that there is nothing that can more quickly undermine this aura of obeisance than for those who command others to be referred to in vulgar terms .
External authority is dependent upon a veneration that is quickly lost when men and women begin to think of their masters in the same four - letter vocabulary more commonly directed against other motorists or an annoying relative .
The institutional order has long understood this fact , which is why Lenny Bruce was driven to an early grave by criminal prosecutions for his daring to speak , publicly , of politicians , judges , government officials , and other authority figures as practitioners — if not the personification — of four - lettered activity .
George Carlin was subjected to a more subdued — albeit equally insistent — coercive treatment for even using four - letter words .
Such words can become habit - forming , as easily applied to the president as to an offending neighbor .
That Bill Clinton and George W. Bush do not enjoy the kind of respect accorded George Washington and Thomas Jefferson is , to a great extent , the erosion of homage brought about by the likes of Bruce and Carlin .
The mainstream media will doubtless refer to Carlin as an " entertainer , " a word that fails to account for what he truly was .
I prefer to think of him in words that the late Alan Watts used to describe himself : a " standup philosopher . "
The media will focus almost entirely upon his " seven words you ca n’t say on television , " as though his work consisted of little more than the outbursts of teenagers intent on shocking their parents .
I do wish the man had not over - worked the use of four - letter words , but I was willing to overlook some of his language for the content that lay within it .
Like the punch - line of the joke about a young boy who kept digging through a pile of manure out of a sense that " there ’s got to be a pony in here someplace , " there was deep substance to his routines .
There are many so - called comedians whose works consist of little more than four - letter words , but whose language is not a prelude to the kind of understanding offered by Carlin .
Perhaps these younger people believe that , if they can utter a string of expletives , audiences will regard them with the love and respect earned by Carlin .
But without the intellectual and spiritual depth of a George Carlin , their " humor " becomes as impotent as an unexploded July 4th firework : some initial sizzle , followed by . . . nothing .
Political systems , advertising , organized religions , corporate practices , school systems , ideologies , political and social fashions of all sorts , came in for well - deserved skewering .
Prior to 9/11 , he did a routine on airport security which , if performed more recently , would doubtless have earned him a visit from Michael Chertoff and his thugs .
And what devotee of the new religion of environmentalism — and its global - warming sect — could withstand Carlin ’s treatment of this latest racket for subjecting humanity to the control of those who fashioned themselves fit to run a planet ?
Before the day is over , I will get out and play part of my collection of George Carlin DVDs as a reminder of the state of mind he helped all of us to develop as an antidote for the insanities perpetrated by institutionalized thinking .
The last comment I heard George Carlin make was in a video of a book - signing , in which a young man asked him if he believed that 9/11 was an " inside job . "
Carlin did not offer an opinion on the matter , but only replied — in words I do not recall precisely — that it was a mistake to ever accept consensus - based definitions of reality .
What better words to inscribe upon a tombstone or other memorial to this remarkable man !

The International Monetary Fund has approved the sale of 403.3 tonnes of IMF gold reserves , in a financial overhaul which is hoped to boost its coffers .
Governors from 176 of the Fund ’s 185 member countries cast votes to sell the gold , in order to create an endowment to helps provide a steadier source of income to the international organisation .
The new income and expenditure framework is expected to cover a 400 million - dollar shortfall projected in the medium term .
An IMF austerity program , announced April 7th , also calls for a 13.5 percent cutback in IMF spending over the next three years .
The IMF was created over 60 years ago with a mission to foster global financial stability .

This is a story that starts in triumph , takes a detour through farce , and inadvertently ends raising some profound questions .
The triumph is one of scientific progress in the study of evolution ; the farce comes courtesy of those who run Conservapedia , who apparently can't believe that any scientific evidence can possibly support evolution .
The questions , however , focus on what access the US public should have to the research that their tax dollars support .
E. coli have evolved the ability to
metabolize citrate in the lab .
Ars covered the research earlier this month , when a paper reporting it was first published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science .
Richard Lenski and his colleagues have been conducting a long - term experiment in bacterial evolution , one that has encompassed over 30,000 generations of bacteria going back over 20 years .
Many of the bacteria have evolved the ability to better utilize the sugar available in their cultures , but one strain underwent at least three distinct changes ( at generation 27,000 , 31,000 and 33,000 ) that enabled them to access citrate present in the medium — something their parents were incapable of .
Lenski saved samples of every culture at intervals of 500 generations , and his paper suggested his lab was going back and sequencing the genomes of the intermediaries to try to find out the genetic basis for the evolution of this new trait .
Conservapedia meets cognitive dissonance
The denizens of Conservapedia were not amused .
They apparently subscribe to the belief that acceptance of some scientific data goes against conservative values .
The site tends to present the views of mainstream science and " creation science " as equally valid scientific perspectives , as evidenced by their discussion of kangaroo origins ( which is actually much improved since we first checked ) .
The site 's relevant sympathies with creationism can be seen in its discussion of information , which uncritically repeats William Dembski's claim that " information cannot be created by natural ( nonintelligent ) causes . "
Despite never defining how to measure biological information , Dembski has used this claim to rule out evolutionary origins for new biological capacities .
Clearly , Lenski's bacteria appear to have evolved a significant new capacity .
Fortunately , the residents of Conservapedia found a way out of this logical conundrum : Lenski was either misinterpreting his data , or he faked it .
In an open letter to Lenski , Conservapedia 's Andy Schlafly ( an attorney with an engineering background ) wrote , " skepticism has been expressed on Conservapedia about your claims , and the significance of your claims , that E. Coli [ sic ] bacteria had an evolutionary beneficial mutation in your study . "
Their solution ?
Show them the data : " Please post the data supporting your remarkable claims so that we can review it , and note where in the data you find justification for your conclusions . "
Lenski replied , noting that the whole purpose of scientific paper is to discuss and display data and to use them to justify conclusions ; the data were in the paper itself .
He also pointed out he 'd placed a copy of the paper on his website for those without subscriptions to PNAS .
Lenski also spent some time reexplaining some of his conclusions , and pointing out errors and misconceptions in the letter he had received .
This response prompted a second letter from Schlafly , suggesting he wanted to review the data underlying the data presented in the paper , and noting that the work is taxpayer funded , giving him a right to it as a taxpayer .
Backstage drama
From here on out , standard Internet drama ensued .
By the time of his next reply , Lenski had apparently read the discussion pages attached to the letters , and discovered that Schlafly had n't actually bothered to read the paper he was demanding the data for .
He has also discovered that some Conservapedia members were simply calling the whole thing a hoax , and accusing him of having engaged in research fraud .
As a result , Lenski was apparently very annoyed , and his second letter is far more assertive .
Lenski again notes that the paper actually contained the relevant data , and that Schlafly 's complaints suggested he would n't know what to do with any further data were Lenski to provide it to him .
In this , he was backed up by a number of Conservapedia members , who said more or less the same thing in the attached discussion .
Several of those individuals are apparently now ex-Conservapedia members , having had their accounts blocked for insubordination .
In fact , anyone who questioned Schlafly 's demands seem to have been branded an opponent of public access to scientific data ; the statement , " I 'll add your name to the list above of people who oppose the public release of data " peppers Schlafly 's responses throughout the discussion .
Problems with group think and incendiary discussions are common complaints about what happens behind the scenes at Wikipedia .
The irony here is that Conservapedia was ostensibly founded as a response to precisely that behavior .
It appears that the victims may now be trying the role of oppressors on for size .
Ted Kennedy Admits Rising Food Prices Due to Increase in Ethanol Production
Cross posted on Grizzly Groundswell
Two liberals finally have stated publicly one of the dirty little secrets behind the rising price of food .
Ethanol .
We are taking our food and trying to turn it into gas .
But it is more than just our food that we are literally letting go up in smoke .
It is also the feed used to raise the cattle and poultry that becomes our food that is causing beef and chicken prices to rise .
It simply costs more to raise cattle and chickens .
There is a limited supply of corn but with the increased demand because of mandated alternative energy the price rises .
Supply and demand economics , it is taught , or at least it used to be , in early economics classes .
This was a consequence that was talked about on talk radio but was largely ignored by the mainstream media and the politicians who mandated this policy .
However , it is finally beginning to get the attention it deserves , and now Ted Kennedy and Joe Lieberman have admitted it is true .
Senators Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) told Cybercast News Service on Wednesday that they believe there is a connection between federally mandated consumption of ethanol , a gasoline additive made from corn , and world food shortages .
“ I think very definitely there is a clear connection between our ethanol use and world hunger , ” Kennedy told Cybercast News Service .
“ The connection is becoming more evident and understood more every day by the American people .
And they understand that there is very little that ’s being done to address the problem . ”
Politicians created this grain shortage by mandating we turn it into fuel in the first place , now not enough is being done , according to Ted Kennedy , to address the problem that they created in the first place .
When this problem is addressed it will lead to another unintended consequence .
It always does .
You remember Larry “ wide stance ” Craig ?
The disgraced Republican who was looking for love in a glory hole at an airport restroom only to put the moves on an undercover officer had this to say :
“ Ethanol today has brought the price of gas down by 20 cents , ” Craig said .
“ American consumers may be paying a little more for food but they are also paying a little less for gas because of ethanol in the market .
It ’s a worthwhile trade .
He says , sure food may cost more but gas is a little less so it is a fair trade off .
How is that ?
Because it feels better that gas is a little lower we should n’t mind that food is higher .
Now that sounds more like a Democrat to me .
But look who it is coming from .
( Pardon the pun ) .
In a way this is the mentality that defines the Democrat party .
It is a redistribution of wealth of sorts .
Take from oil and give to farmers .
Either way we are paying more .
Both gas and food are necessities so we will buy both , what difference does it make if gas is lower but food is higher ?
How much are we saving .
If gas was .20 higher as wide stance said it would be but food prices had not risen who is to say that we would n’t be better off ?
This is what happens when politicians get involved in the free market .
Unintended consequences happen .
This is a consequence that may have been unintended , but it was n’t unpredicted by economists who know how the free market works .
The prices of food are only going to increase as ethanol production increases .
Perhaps it is time for us all to get on food stamps , that may be the only answer .
Let the government provide our food .
They have done so well providing for us in every other way .
NOT !
The same will apply to health insurance .
If you think health care is expensive now , just wait until it is provided by the government .
Free has never been so expensive .
Another unintended consequence .
Why attack Iran 's nuclear facilities when striking their oil infrastructure would be much more effective in the scope of a US - led preventive war ?
Sure , oil prices might skyrocket and the world economy might collapse .
But , hey , that 's the price you pay for security .
Such a scenario is not a nightmare or an outtake from a remake of Stanley Kubrick 's " Dr. Strangelove , " but part of a serious recommendation made by two neoconservatives in case sanctions fail to persuade Iran to abandon its enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used to make nuclear weapons or fuel for peaceful energy production .
In a July report titled " The Last Resort : Consequences of Preventive Military Action Against Iran , " and published by the neoconservative Washington Institute for Near East Studies , scholars Patrick Clawson and Michael Eisenstadt advocate military strategies that would ultimately discourage Tehran from pursuing any future non-civilian nuclear activities :
Because the ultimate goal of prevention is to influence Tehran to change course , effective strikes against Iran 's nuclear infrastructure may play an important role in affecting Iran 's decision calculus .
Strikes that flatten its nuclear infrastructure could have a demoralizing effect , and could influence Tehran 's assessment of the cost of rebuilding .
But the most effective strikes may not necessarily be against nuclear facilities .
Iran is extraordinarily vulnerable to attacks on its oil export infrastructure ....
The political shock of losing the oil income could cause Iran to rethink its nuclear stance — in ways that attacks on its nuclear infrastructure might not .
And if an attack on the oil facilities of a country with some of the world 's largest reserves leads to a huge spike in oil prices , sends gas prices up to 10 bucks a gallon and brings economic ruin in the rest of the world , the report continues , well , so be it :
The US navy is pinning its hopes of winning support for the forthcoming deployment in Japan of the nuclear - powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington on the fictional Japanese - American hero of a new comic about life as a US serviceman .
The navy will distribute 26,000 copies of Manga CVN73 , named after the George Washington 's hull number , to children and young residents of Yokosuka , a US naval base south of Tokyo where the ship will be based from August .
Other copies will be available in Akihabara , a district of Tokyo popular with comic enthusiasts , and a downloadable version will appear on the US navy 's website .
The navy hopes the 200 - page book , with its wholly positive take on life in the services , will dampen opposition to the George Washington 's deployment amid protests by Yokosuka residents .
Though nuclear - powered US ships have made hundreds of visits to Japan over the past 25 years , the ship will be the first piece of nuclear military hardware to be permanently stationed there .
Local residents have twice failed to persuade the Yokosuka assembly to hold a referendum on the George Washington 's deployment , despite collecting 48,000 signatures in support .
The ship will arrive in August as a replacement for the USS Kitty Hawk , the US navy 's only conventionally powered carrier , which left Japan last month at the end of a 10 - year mission .
The 47 - year - old vessel will be decommissioned next year .
Opponents say the 102,000 - tonne George Washington , the centerpiece of the US navy 's 7th fleet , poses a threat to safety and the local fishing industry .
Safety concerns grew after a fire broke out on the ship late last month , leaving two crew members with minor burns and another 23 needing treatment for heat stress .
The commander of the US navy in Japan , Rear Admiral James Kelly , said the fire may delay the ship 's deployment but dismissed concerns about its safety .
" This is not something for the citizens of Yokosuka to worry about , " he told reporters after the fire , adding that there was " nothing wrong with the nuclear power plant or major engineering systems " .
The comic , produced by two Japanese cartoonists commissioned by the navy , follows Jack Ohara , a third - class petty officer , as he overcomes seasickness and prepares for his first overseas mission - to Japan .
In one scene he quickly puts out a fire that has broken out on board the ship .
The comic praises the navy 's professionalism and commitment to safety , and depicts US servicemen as ideal neighbours .
In a foreword , Kelly describes the crew of the George Washington as " goodwill ambassadors " .
The description , however , may struggle to resonate in Japan , where US troops have been linked to a string of crimes in recent months , including the sexual abuse of a 14 - year - old Japanese girl by a US marine in Okinawa and the alleged murder of a Yokosuka taxi driver by a deserter from the Kitty Hawk .
Mayor Willie Brown ... got a call from what he described as his airport security -- a full eight hours before yesterday 's string of terrorist attacks -- advising him that Americans should be cautious about their air travel .
Wednesday , September 12 , 2001 , Page A - 17 Willie Brown got low - key early warning about air travel Phillip Matier , Andrew Ross FOR Mayor Willie Brown , the first signs that something was amiss came late Monday when he got a call from what he described as his airport security -- a full eight hours before yesterday 's string of terrorist attacks -- advising him that Americans should be cautious about their air travel .
David Irving comments : ACCORDING to a report today Friday , May 17 , 2002 , on Pacifica Radio , the warning to San Francisco 's mayor came from squeaky - clean Condoleezza Rice .
I recall that attorney general John Ashcroft received a similar warning in July .
I watched Ms. Huxtable , uh , Rice , on C - Span a day or two ago , and she seemed genuinely rattled by the disclosure of these facts ; not by the facts themselves , just by the disclosure .
We hear a lot about her intellect , and sometimes even see her playing the classical piano ( in staged photo opportunities ) ; but she still always seems to me more like an asylum - seeker , newly escaped from the terrors of the Bill Cosby Show , than a Cabinet minister .
Radical 's Diary on Sept.11 , 2001
The mayor , who was booked to fly to New York yesterday morning from San Francisco International Airport , said the call " did n't come in any alarming fashion , which is why I 'm hesitant to make an alarming statement . "
In fact , at the time , he did n't pay it much mind .
" It was not an abnormal call .
I 'm always concerned if my flight is going to be on time , and they always alert me when I ought to be careful . "
Exactly where the call came from is a bit of a mystery .
The mayor would say only that it came from " my security people at the airport . "
Mike McCarron , assistant deputy director at SFO [ airport ] , said the Federal Aviation Administration " routinely " issues security notices about possible threats .
He said two or three such notices have been received in the past couple of months , but none in recent days .
Whatever the case , Brown did n't think about it again until he was up , dressed and waiting for his ride to the airport for an 8 a.m. flight to New York , where he was to attend a state retirement board meeting .
That was when he turned on the TV , and like millions of other Americans , saw the twin towers of the World Trade Center crumble and the Pentagon go up in smoke .
Before the mayor was even out the door , District Attorney Terence Hallinan -- the man Brown said just last week should be recalled -- was checking in and offering help .
What followed was a conversation made up of equal parts gravity and formality .
" You know , you 're the first call I 've gotten on this , " Brown said to Hallinan , as they were signing off .
With that , the mayor hung up and headed for City Hall .
Along the way , he made the call to close all city buildings for the day and city schools as well .
He also talked with representatives of the Bank of America building and the Transamerica Pyramid , who agreed that because the structures were such high - profile symbols they too should be closed for the day .
Once Brown arrived at City Hall , calls were made in quick order to Municipal Railway director Michael Burns : " I want a complete backup in case anything happens to the subway tunnels , " Brown said .
The Coast Guard : " To make sure the bridges were being protected . "
And to the health , police and fire departments to make sure they were staffed for the emergency .
The last call went to Tom Ammiano , the mayor 's longtime political nemesis and president of the Board of Supervisors .
" We may have to declare a state of emergency , although it 's not something I want to do at this point because it kicks in all sorts of things -- but we may have to be ready , " the mayor said .
Ammiano apparently agreed , because an hour or so later -- when the two sat next to each other at a city department heads meeting at the command center the call was made for only a " limited " state of emergency .
One that would allow the courts , city offices and schools to close , but still keep the city pretty much in working order .
" What I want , " the mayor said , " is for things to be to run as normally as possible , but sagely . "
And for the most part they did .
As for what comes next ?
" With any luck , we 'll be back to normal by tomorrow -- but with a heightened sense of awareness , " Brown said as he sipped coffee with reporters at Citizen Cake on Grove Street .
But as for long - term safety ?
" We can only do what we can , " the mayor said , adding , " Hell , if they can't protect the Pentagon from attack , what can they protect ? "
BART BLOCKS : Do n't go looking for a rest room on BART -- they 're all locked .
According to BART information officer Ron Rodriguez , a memorandum went out yesterday ordering all station rest rooms to be locked until further notice .
They 've also put out the word to watch for suspicious packages .
THE OTHER BROWN : Over in Oakland , Mayor Jerry Brown was trying his best to keep things normal as well .
" We 're carrying on , " Brown said .
" I think the most important thing is for people to stay calm and understand that the power of terrorism is psychological .
" The goal is to sow disunity and to undermine our faith in the leadership of the country . "
A few blocks away , Democratic pollster Paul Maslin sat in his office high - rise and wondered about the long - term effect of the attacks .
" It 's like one part Pearl Harbor , one part Northern Ireland and one part I do n't know what , " was how Maslin summed it up .
Maslin -- who does polling for Gov. Gray Davis , among others -- said the strangest call he got yesterday was from one of the biggest Democratic consultants in Washington , D.C. , who had just bolted his apartment .
" This was a grown man in his 50s , and he was scared out of his wits because he'd heard that a second plane was headed for the Pentagon , " Maslin said .
" We can't even begin to gauge the long - term effects of this yet , but I will say , I do n't think we 'll ever be the same . "

Women who use mobile phones when pregnant are more likely to give birth to children with behavioral problems , according to a study of more than 13,000 children .
Pregnant women using the handsets just two or three times a day was enough to raise the risk of their babies developing hyperactivity and difficulties with conduct , emotions and relationships by the time they reached school age .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The likelihood is even greater if the children themselves used the phones before the age of 7 .
Specifically , mothers who used mobile phones were 54 percent more likely to have children with behavioral problems .
When the children also later used the phones themselves , they were :
80 percent more likely to suffer from difficulties with behavior
25 percent more at risk from emotional problems
34 percent more likely to suffer from difficulties relating to their peers
35 percent more likely to be hyperactive
49 percent more prone to problems with conduct
The results of the study took the top scientists who conducted it by surprise .
The research will carry particular weight because one of its authors , UCLA 's Professor Leeka Kheifets , had previously been skeptical that mobile phones could pose a risk to health .

Hewlett - Packard plans to make its Tru64 Unix Advanced File System available to the open source community .
The tech giant said today that Linux can adopt AdvFS source code under version two of the open source General Public License ( GPL ) .
The file system was first developed in 1991 for business customers using Digital Equipment Corp.
Alpha Unix machines .
HP said it had chosen version two of the GPL because of its compatibility with the Linux kernel .
It also claimed the code will boost the uptime and performance of Linux file systems .
AdvFS is used in file and storage management , enables online system backups and increases data availability , said the company .
Linux Foundation exec director Jim Zemlin said : “ The technology and engineering resources being made available for next - generation file system projects are proof that HP is a true open source community leader . ”
HP is n't quite so cuddly with its rivals in the increasingly mudslinging tough PC hardware environment , however .
Earlier this month it settled a patent row with Acer in a secret deal .
It had sued the Taiwan - based computer maker for allegedly infringing five US patents related to processor tweaks , power - consumption technology and DVD editing tools .
In related news , the Linux Foundation also chucked out a statement today in which it urged tech vendors to " adopt a policy of supporting their customers on Linux with open - source kernel code " and banged the familiar cost - saving benefits drum . ®
THE SUBPRIME TRUMP CARD :
STANDING UP TO THE BANKS
� If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properly belongs .�
� Thomas Jefferson , Letter to Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin ( 1802 )
Jefferson had it right .
More than 1.5 million homeowners are expected to enter foreclosure this year , and about half of them are expected to have their homes repossessed .
If the dire consequences Jefferson warned of 200 years ago have been slow in coming , it is because they have been concealed by what Jerome a Paris calls the Anglo Disease � � the highly unequal economy whereby the rich and the financial sector . . . capture most of the income but hide it by providing cheap debt to the middle classes so that they can continue to spend . �
He calls �finance � the �cannibalistic� sector in today�s economy .
Writing in The European Tribune this month , he states :
� [ O ]ne of the more attractive features of the financial world , for its promoters , is its ability to concentrate huge fortunes in a small number of hands , and promote this as a good thing ( these people are said to be creating wealth , rather than capturing it ) .
. . . [ O ] f course , the reality is that such wealth concentration is created by squeezing the rest , as is obvious in the stagnation of incomes for most in the middle and lower rungs of society .
This is not so much wealth creation as wealth redistribution , from the many to the few .
But what has made this unequality . . . tolerable is that the financial world itself was able to provide a convenient smokescreen , in the form of cheap debt , provided in abundance to all .
The wealthy used it to grab real assets in funny money , and the rest were kindly allowed to keep on spending by tapping their future income rather than their insufficient current one ; in a nutshell , the debt bubble hid the class warfare waged by the rich against everybody else .�
1
Now the debt bubble is bursting , with the anticipated real estate crash , banking crisis , foreclosures , and inevitable recession .
� The income capture mechanisms set up during the bubble have not been reversed , so the pain is falling disproportionately on the poorest , � writes Jerome a Paris .
Meanwhile , finance is being bailed out .
What �s to be done ?
�[ T ]he financiers . . . will say that more �reform� and �deregulation � and tax cuts are needed , � he says , but �maybe it�s time to stop listening to what is highly self - interested drivel , and take back what they grabbed : it �s not theirs . �
Good idea , but how ?
The financiers own the media , and their massively funded lobbies control Congress .
How can we the people get enough clout to take on the giant financial and corporate giants ?
What can we do that will make politicians sit up and take notice ?
How about swarming the courts ?
New case law indicates that a majority of the 750,000 homeowners expected to lose their homes this year could have a valid defense to foreclosure .
As much as $ 2 trillion in real estate may be vulnerable to this defense , providing a very big stick for a lobby of motivated debtors .
Mobilizing that group , in turn , could light a fire under the investors in mortgage - backed securities -- the pension funds , money market funds and insurance companies holding these �orphan� mortgages .
These investors also wield a very big stick , in the form of major law firms on retainer .
When the embattled banks demand a bailout because they are �too big to fail , � the taxpayers can respond , � You have already failed .
It is time to try something new . �
The Legal Trump Card : Make Them Produce the Note
A basic principle of contract law is that a plaintiff suing on a written contract must produce the signed contract proving he is entitled to relief .
If there is no signed mortgage note or recorded assignment , foreclosure is barred .
The defendant must normally raise this defense , and most defaulting homeowners , unaware of legal procedure and concerned about the expense of hiring an attorney , just let their homes go uncontested .
But when the plaintiffs bringing subprime foreclosure actions have been challenged , in most cases they haven�t been able to produce the notes .
Why not ?
It appears to be more than just sloppy paperwork .
The banks that originally entered into these risky subprime arrangements generally did so because they had no intention of holding the loans on their books .
The mortgages were immediately sliced and diced , bundled up as mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , and sold off to investors .
Loan originators sold the mortgages to financial institutions or other banks , which then sold the rights to the monthly mortgage payment income to investors , while transferring the responsibility to collect these payments to specialized mortgage servicing companies .
The result has been to slice up the mortgage contract , with no party really having ownership of the original paperwork .
When foreclosure has been initiated , the servicer or trustee acting as plaintiff now has trouble proving that it originated the mortgage or owned the loan .
In order for a second bank or financial institution to have standing to bring a foreclosure lawsuit in court , it must have been assigned the mortgage ; and with the collapse of the housing market , many of the subprime lenders have gone out of business , making it impossible to contact the originating mortgage company .
Other paperwork has just been lost in the shuffle .
2
Why weren�t the mortgage notes assigned to the MBS holders when they were first sold ?
Apparently because the investors aren�t even matched up with specific properties until after default .
Here is how the MBS scheme works : when the mortgages are first bundled by the banks , all of the subprime mortgages go into the same pool .
The bundled mortgages are chopped into �securities � that are sold to many investors -- banks , hedge funds , money market funds , pension funds -- with different �tranches � or levels of risk .
The first mortgages to default are then assigned to the high - risk � BBB -� tranche of investors .
As defaults increase , later defaulting mortgages are assigned down the chain of risk to the supposedly more secure tranches .
3
That means the investors get the mortgages only after the defendants breached the agreement to pay .
It also means the investors weren�t a party to the agreement when it was breached , making it hard to prove they were injured by the breach .
The investors have another problem : the delay in assigning particular mortgages to particular investors means there was no �true sale� of the security ( the home ) at the time of securitization .
A true sale of the collateral is a legal requirement for forming a valid security ( a secured interest in the property as opposed to simply a debt obligation backed by collateral ) .
As a result , the investors may have trouble proving they have any interest in the property , secured or unsecured .
4
The Dog - Ate - My - Note Defense
When the securitizing banks acting as trustees for the investors are unable to present written proof of ownership at a time that would entitle them to foreclose , they typically file what�s called a lost - note affidavit .
April Charney is a Florida legal aid attorney well versed in these issues , having gotten foreclosure proceedings dismissed or postponed for 300 clients in the past year .
In a February 2008 Bloomberg article , she was quoted as saying that about 80 percent of these cases involved lost - note affidavits .
� Lost - note affidavits are pattern and practice in the industry , � she said .
� They are not exceptions .
They are the rule .�

In the past , judges have let these foreclosures proceed ; but in October 2007 , an intrepid federal judge in Cleveland put a halt to the practice .
U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Boyko ruled that Deutsche Bank had not filed the proper paperwork to establish its right to foreclose on fourteen homes it was suing to repossess .
6
That started the ball rolling , and by February 2008 , judges in at least five states had followed suit .
In Los Angeles in January , U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel L. Bufford issued a notice warning plaintiffs in foreclosure cases to bring the mortgage notes to court and not submit copies .
In Ohio , where foreclosures were up by a reported 88 percent in 2007 , Attorney General Marc Dann was reported to be challenging ownership of mortgage notes in forty foreclosure cases .
7
Few defendants , however , are lucky enough to have advocates like Charney and Dann in their corner , and most defaulting debtors just let their homes go .
A simple challenge can be filed to the complaint even without an attorney , and some subprime borrowers have successfully defended their own foreclosure actions ; but retaining an attorney is strongly recommended .
People representing themselves are often not taken seriously , and they are likely to miss local rule requirements .
With that warning , here is some general information on challenging standing to foreclose :
Some states are judicial foreclosure states and some are non-judicial foreclosure states .
In a judicial foreclosure state ( meaning the matter is heard before a judge ) , if a promissory note or recorded assignment naming the plaintiff is not attached to the complaint , the defendant can file a response stating the plaintiff has failed to state a claim .
This can be followed with a motion called a demurrer to the complaint .
Different forms of demurrers can be found in legal form books in most law libraries .
In essence the demurrer states that even if everything in the complaint were true , the complaint would lack substance because it fails to set out a copy of the note , and it should therefore be dismissed .
Ordinarily there is no need to cite much in the way of statutes or case law other than the authority reciting the necessity of showing the note proving the plaintiff is entitled to relief .
In a non-judicial foreclosure state such as California , foreclosure is done by a trustee without a court hearing , so the procedure is a bit trickier ; but standing to foreclose can still be challenged .
If the homeowner has filed for bankruptcy , the proceedings are automatically stayed , requiring the lender to bring a motion for relief from stay before going forward .
The debtor can then challenge the lender�s right to the security ( the house ) by demanding proof of a legal or equitable interest in it .
8
A homeowner facing foreclosure can also get the matter before a court without filing for bankruptcy by filing a complaint and preliminary injunction staying the proceedings pending proof of standing to foreclose .
A judge would then have to rule on the merits .
A complaint for declaratory relief might also be brought against the trustee , seeking to have its rights declared invalid .
9
An Equitable Settlement for Everyone
These defenses can help people who are about to lose their homes , but there is another class of victims in the sub - prime mortgage crisis : investors in MBS , including the pension funds and 401Ks on which many people depend for their retirement .
If the trustees representing the investors cannot foreclose , the lucky debtors may be able to stay in their homes without paying .
However , the hapless investors will be left holding the bag .
If the investors manage to shift liability back to the banks , on the other hand , the banks could go down and take the economy with them .
How can these tricky issues be resolved in a way that is equitable for all ?
That question will be addressed in a followup article .
Stay tuned .

The nature of the gut tribes is heavily influenced by diet , according to a research team led by Ruth E. Ley and Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
With the help of colleagues at the San Diego and St. Louis Zoos , Dr. Ley and Dr. Gordon scanned the gut microbes in the feces of people and 59 other species of mammal , including meat eaters , plant eaters and omnivores .
Each of the three groups has a distinctive set of bacteria , they report Friday in Science , with the gut flora of people grouping with other omnivores .
Despite the vast changes that people have made to their diet through cooking and agriculture , their gut bacteria “ do n’t dramatically depart in composition from those of other omnivorous primates , ” Dr. Gordon said .
This new view of people as superorganisms has emerged from the cheap methods of decoding DNA that are now available .
Previously it was hard to study bacteria without growing them up into large colonies .
But most bacteria are difficult to culture , so microbiologists could see only a small fraction of those present .
Analyzing the total DNA in a microbial community sidesteps this problem and samples the genes of all bacterial species that are present .
The goals of the human microbiome project include analyzing the normal makeup of bacterial species in each niche on the human body .
“ The focus in microbiology has been on pathogenic bacteria , but we are trying to identify the commensal bacteria so that we can begin to understand what proteins they make and how they contribute to our health , ” Dr. Segre said .
Another goal is to understand how pathogenic bacteria manage to usurp power from the tribes of beneficial commensals in the skin or gut , causing disease .
The lifetime of an individual bacterium in the human superorganism may be short , since millions are shed each day from the skin or gut .
But the colonies may survive for a long time , cloning themselves briskly to replace members that are sacrificed .
Just where these colonies come from and how long they last is not yet known .
Dr. David A. Relman of Stanford University has tracked the gut flora of infants and finds their first colonists come from their mother .
But after a few weeks , the babies acquired distinctive individual sets of bacteria , all except a pair of twins who had the same set .
Dr. Relman said he was now trying to ascertain if the first colonists remain with an individual for many years .
Taking a broad spectrum antibiotic presumably wreaks devastation on one ’s companion microbiome .
If the microbiome is essential to survival , it is perhaps surprising that the drugs do not make more people ill .
Dr. Relman said that perhaps there were subtle long - term consequences that had not yet been identified .
Much the same set of bacteria recolonize the gut after a course of antibiotics , he said , suggesting that the makeup of the colony is important and that the body has ways of reconstituting it as before .
Powell : New president must continue Iraq draw - down David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday April 10 , 2008

Print This Email This Colin Powell still has n't decided who he 's going to vote for in this November 's presidential elections , but he says it is imperative that whoever resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next year continue to reduce the US troop presence in Iraq .
Powell , who was President Bush 's secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush 's father , said the military is unsustainably stretched thin because of its continuing commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Powell spoke Thursday morning on ABC's Good Morning America where he stressed the need to redeploy troops from Iraq and warned against a military incursion into Iran .
The next president will inherit a military " that cannot sustain , continue to sustain , 140,000 people deployed in Iraq , and the 20 ( to ) 25,000 people we have deployed in Afghanistan , and our other deployments , " Powell told ABC 's Diane Sawyer .
" They will have to continue to draw down at some pace . "
Powell also observed that the expected number of forces in Iraq would remain about 10,000 troops higher than before President Bush announced his surge last year , and he predicted the Bush administration would " maintain a significant presence " until the end of his term .
Regarding the on- again , off - again saber rattling toward Iran , Powell said the possibility of a military strike should never be completely ruled out , but he said that option should be far from the front of officials minds .
" Frankly , as a soldier , and if I was in the chairmanship once again at the Joint Chiefs of Staff , I would find it a very , very difficult target to work against , " he said .
" So , I do n't think the military option is anywhere near the top of the list of things to think about . "
Powell said he " truly " had not decided which presidential candidate to support in the upcoming elections , saying he was close friends with Republican nominee John McCain as well as both remaining Democratic contenders , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
He did have some kind words for Obama , crediting the Illinois senator 's ability to deflect controversy over his former pastor 's controversial statements .
Powell also said Obama 's relative lack of experience might not be as significant a problem as some people think , citing his deft first - time presidential campaign as evidence he can quickly learn and adapt to the demands of the presidency .
" I 've seen other individuals who have come along that did n't have that breadth of experience , and what they do is surround themselves with people who do bring that experience , " Powell said .
" With Sen . Obama , he did n't have a lot of experience in running a presidential campaign , did he ?
But he seems to know how to organize the task . "

Dynamic languages are emerging as the Next Big Thing .
They are known for making development faster , being more powerful and more flexible .
Today , more and more people are using them in production environments .
However , one problem stands in the way of mass adoption : SPEED .
There is an urban legend that dynamic programs are way slower than their static counterparts .
Here 's my take on it .
Why are dynamic languages slow TODAY ?
The purpose of a dynamic language is to have as few static elements as possible .
The idea is that this offers more flexibility .
For example , in Python method calls are never static .
This means that the actual code that will be executed is known only at run time .
This is what makes monkey patching possible .
This is what allows you to have great unit testing frameworks .
# globals.py
A = 2
# main.py
from globals import A
A = [ ]
A
Dynamic languages leave as many decisions as possible to run time .
What is the type of ?
You can only know for sure when the code runs because it can be changed at any point in the program .
The result is that it is hard to analyse dynamic languages in order to make optimizations .
Compared to static languages - which offer plenty of opportunities for optimization - dynamic languages are hard to optimize .
Thus their implementations are usually slow .
The problem with dynamic languages is that it is n't trivial to optimize an addition .
You can hardly know what '+ ' will be binded to at runtime .
You probably can't even infer the types of the operands .
This is the result of mutation .
In Python , almost everything is mutable .
This leaves few information the compiler can rely on .
Does mutability hurt performance and why ?
It can , depending on the case .
Let me illustrate how by comparing the factorial function in C and Python .
Do n't think of this as a benchmark .
This is just an example .
Compiling the factorial function in C with LLVM - GCC will generate efficient machine code .
// Factorial in C
int fac( int n ) {
if ( n == 0 ) return 1 ;
return n*fac( n - 1 ) ;
}
int main ( ) {
return fac ( 30 ) ;
}
; Assembly generated by LLVM - GCC
_main :
movl $ 1 , %eax
xorl %ecx , %ecx
movl $ 30 , %edx
.align 4,0x90
LBB1_1 : ## bb4.i
imull %edx , %eax
decl %edx
incl %ecx
cmpl $ 30 , %ecx
jne LBB1_1 # # bb4.i
LBB1_2 : ## fac.exit
ret
The compiler was able to infer many properties from the source code .
For example , it concluded that the fac function referenced in main was the fac defined at compile time .
This allowed the compiler to replace the assembly call instruction with fac 's code .
The function was then specialized for the call site and thanks to static typing , the compiler was able to transform each arithmetic operations into direct machine instructions .
Can you notice the other optimizations ?
Let 's look at how CPython executes the factorial .
# fac.py
def fac(n ) :
return 1 if n == 0 else n * fac( n - 1 )
fac( 30 )
# CPython Bytecode for fac.py
# Think of this as an interpreted language which Python is translated into .
# See http://docs.python.org/lib/bytecodes.html
# fac
11 0 LOAD_FAST 0 ( n )
3 LOAD_CONST 1 ( 0 )
6 COMPARE_OP 2 ( == )
9 JUMP_IF_FALSE 7 ( to 19 )
12 POP_TOP
13 LOAD_CONST 2 ( 1 )
16 JUMP_FORWARD 18 ( to 37 )
>> 19 POP_TOP
20 LOAD_FAST 0 ( n )
23 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 ( fac )
26 LOAD_FAST 0 ( n )
29 LOAD_CONST 2 ( 1 )
32 BINARY_SUBTRACT
33 CALL_FUNCTION 1
36 BINARY_MULTIPLY
>> 37 RETURN_VALUE
# main
14 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 ( fac )
3 LOAD_CONST 1 ( 30 )
6 CALL_FUNCTION 1
9 RETURN_VALUE
First , is parsed and translated to bytecode instructions .
Then the bytecode instructions are interpreted by the CPython Virtual Machine
CPython could not inline the call to fac because this would violate the language 's semantics .
In Python , fac.py could be imported at run time by another module .
It can not inline fac into main because a sub- module could change the binding of fac and thus invalidate main .
And because main does n't have it's own copy of fac , the code cannot be specialized for this particular call .
This hurts because it would be very beneficial to specialize the function for an integer argument .
Notice that there are no references to machine addresses .
CPython adds a layer of indirection to access every object in order to implement the dynamism of Python .
For example , main is found by a look - up in a table .
Even constant numbers are found through look - ups .
This adds a significant amount of slow memory read / writes and indirect jumps .
Python does n't even contain any explicit hints you can give to help the compiler .
This makes the problem of optimizing Python non-trivial .
What about type inference ?
The problem of type inference in dynamic languages remains unsolved .
Type inference is a form of static analysis .
Static analysis is the analysis of source code at compile time to derive some " truths " about it .
You can imagine how this falls short for dynamic languages .
Michael Salib attempted to solve this problem with StarKiller .
The compiler manages type inference by collecting more information than usual and using the CTA algorithm .
Instead of compiling each module separatly , like most compilers , the whole program is analyzed and compiled in one pass .
The knowledge of the complete program opens the door to more optimizations .
The fac function of the previous example can be specialized by Starkiller because it knows how it will be used .
Though the work seems very promising , it has three major flaws .
First , the compiler accepts only a subset of the Python language .
Advanced functions like eval and exec are n't supported .
Second , whole - program analysis does n't scale with bigger projects .
Compiling 100,000 LOC would take a prohibitive amount of time .
Third , the compiler violates Python 's semantics by doing whole - program analysis .
Like most dynamic languages , the import mechanism of Python is done at runtime .
The language does n't guarantee that the module available at compile time is the same as the module available at run time .
Read this for more .
What about VMs ?
Virtual Machines are a natural fit for dynamic languages .
VM with JIT compilers are able to optimize a dynamic program without having to guess it 's behavior in advance .
This saves a lot of heavy lifting .
Programs are optimized simply by observing their behavior while they run .
This is known as dynamic analysis .
For instance , noticing that fac is often called with an integer argument , the VM could create a new version of that function specialized for integers and use it instead .
In my opinion Virtual Machines are not a long - term solution .
Self - hosting a VM is prohibitive .
A VM sets a limit on the kinds of programs you can make .
No Operating Systems , no drivers , no real - time systems , etc .
Optimizing a program run through a VM is hard because you cannot know exactly what is going on behind the hood .
There are many layers and many corners where performance can slip out .
For most projects , these problems are n't an issue .
But I believe their existence would restrain dynamic languages .
They are enough to prevent a dynamic language from being a general purpose tool .
And that is what people want : no restrictions , no surprises , pure freedom .
How would I make them faster ?
from types import ModuleType
import re
declare ( re , type =ModuleType , constant = True , inline=True )
A compiler helped by Static Annotations is the way to go .
Please do n't put all static annotations in the same bag .
Static annotations like type declarations do n't have to be as painful as JAVA's .
Annotations are painful in Java because they are pervasive and often useless .
They restrict the programmer .
Programmers have to fight them .
Annotations can be just the opposite .
They can give the programmer more freedom !
With them , programmers can set constraints to their code where it matters .
Because they have the choice , static annotations become a tool that offers MORE flexibility .
A savvy programmer could reduce the dynamism of his code at a few key points .
Just enough to allow type inference and the likes to do their job well .
Optimizing some code would usually just become a matter of expressing explicitly the natural constraints that apply to it .
# Just an example .
def fac(n ) :
assert type(n ) in [ float , int ]
return 1 if n == 0 else n * fac( n - 1 )
There are a many ways to implement static annotations in dynamic languages .
I believe the flexibility of dynamic languages can allow static annotations to be very convenient .
How would you do it ?
It was meant to be a gently embarrassing centrepiece for her son's 21st birthday .
But when Gail Jordan asked bakery staff at Asda to print a photograph of him as a baby on to a cake they did n't see the funny side .
After one look at the photograph – which featured her son David at about five months and lying on his front – they declared that putting it on the cake would constitute pornography because his bare bottom could be seen .
Cheek : Gail Jordan holds a censored cake after Asda refused to show her son's bottom
And when the supermarket censors finally agreed to use the picture they insisted it had to have a strategically - placed star .
Yesterday Miss Jordan said she was staggered that such a bit of innocent fun could be misconstrued as something illegal .
' They said it could be anyone 's child so it could be deemed pornographic , ' the 41 - year - old care worker said .
' But I was asking to have it printed on a 21st birthday cake , so surely it was pretty obvious that it was my son .
' It 's ridiculous – I understand they have rules , but there ought to be a place for common sense as well .
' In the end they would only do it with a star over his bottom , which to be honest made the whole thing even more hilarious . '
Miss Jordan had gone to a branch of Asda in Liscard , Wirral , with the snap from the family album to take advantage of a £ 9.97 offer to ice a birthday cake with a photo printed on the top .
Row : Asda would only print the picture on the cake if a star was placed on David 's bottom
But when the picture was deemed to fall foul of the store 's ' no nudity ' policy , Miss Jordan was left with no time to return to her Rock Ferry home and get a different one .
The compromise – to place a white star over the photo when it was scanned to obscure the offending bottom – at least allowed the 21st birthday celebrations to pass off without a hitch , but Miss Jordan said she still believed Asda 's policy was too strict .
' You see adverts all the time for things like nappies and baby wipes which feature babies ' bottoms , so what 's the difference ? ' she said .
' I just think it 's ridiculous that my son's cake had to be censored .
' It 's sad that because of the world we live in such an innocent photograph could be misinterpreted as something perverted .
It 's crazy how politically correct the world has become . '
Her son , who works at a bookmakers , added : ' It 's just my bare bum , it 's obviously totally harmless .
It 's stupid that they could suggest something so innocent could be pornographic . '
A spokesman for Asda confirmed its blanket ban on bare flesh .
' We have a policy , as do many other retailers , of no nudity , whatever the age of the subject , ' he said .
' In this case we offered a number of alternatives including enlarging and cropping the photo , increasing the border size or applying a strategically placed star to save his blushes
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. power companies could get free carbon credits worth billions of dollars under global warming legislation being considered by the U.S. Congress , according to report released on Thursday .
“ Billions of dollars in allowances are at stake under the proposals to cap and reduce global warming pollution , ” Dan Lashof , the science director of the Natural Resources Defense Council , which released the report , said in a statement .
Congress is mulling several bills that aim to regulate emissions of gases that scientists blame for global warming .
Power utilities that burn large amounts of carbon dioxide - emitting coal and natural gas have lobbied Congress to ensure that they would receive allocations of carbon credits under such regulation to help them deal with the compliance costs .
The report , on the other hand , supported auctioning such credits to prevent their overallocation to power generators .
It said an overly generous allocation of credits to power companies in the early days of the European Union ’s carbon market , the Emissions Trading Scheme , knocked down carbon prices , led to excessive company profits and created few incentives for funding energy efficiency programs that would have cut emissions .
The report , also released by Ceres , a Boston - based coalition of environmentalists and investors , assumed carbon allowance prices to be around $ 10 a ton .
It estimated that under the Climate Security Act sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , a Connecticut Democrat turned independent , and John Warner , a Virginia Republican , the 100 largest electric power generators would receive nearly $ 10.4 billion in annual free carbon credits by 2012 .
Under the Carbon Economy Act , sponsored by Sens. Jeff Bingaman , a New Mexico Democrat , and Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican , the 100 largest power producers would receive nearly $ 18.3 billion annually , with $ 6.2 billion going to the country ’s 10 largest investor - owned utilities .
Ever since California voters became the first in the nation to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 , the state has faced unyielding opposition from the federal government , which insists it has the power to prohibit a drug it considers useless and dangerous .
That could all change with the next presidential election .
As the candidates prepare for a May 20 primary in Oregon , one of 12 states with a California - style law , Sen .
Barack Obama of Illinois has become an increasingly firm advocate of ending federal intervention and letting states make their own rules when it comes to medical marijuana .
His Democratic rival , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , is less explicit , recently softening a pledge she made early in the campaign to halt federal raids in states with medical marijuana laws .
But she has expressed none of the hostility that marked the response of her husband 's administration to California 's initiative , Proposition 215 .
Sen . John McCain of Arizona , the Republican nominee - in - waiting , has gone back and forth on the issue - promising a medical marijuana patient at one campaign stop that seriously ill patients would never face arrest under a McCain administration , but ultimately endorsing the Bush administration 's policy of federal raids and prosecutions .
Political battles over exempting medical patients from marijuana laws have been fought mostly in statehouses and at ballot boxes since 1996 , when California voters repealed state criminal penalties for those who used the drug with their doctor 's approval .
But the federal government has played an important role in limiting the scope of those state laws , and their effectiveness over the next four years may be determined by the next president .
Bill Clinton 's position
President Bill Clinton 's administration opposed the California law from the start and won a court case allowing it to shut nonprofit organizations that supplied medical marijuana to members .
Clinton 's Justice Department also tried to punish California doctors who recommended marijuana to their patients by revoking their authority to prescribe any drugs , but federal courts backed the doctors .
The Bush administration has gone further , raiding medical marijuana growers and clinics , prosecuting suppliers under federal drug laws after winning a U.S. Supreme Court case , and pressuring commercial property owners to evict marijuana dispensaries by threatening legal action .
The administration has also blocked a University of Massachusetts researcher 's attempt to grow marijuana for studies of its medical properties .
Since 2001 , federal prosecutors have won convictions in at least 28 California drug cases where defendants claimed they were supplying or using medical marijuana , according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
Prosecutors have filed charges in 22 more cases , and authorities have raided 10 growers or dispensaries without filing charges , the group says .
The presidential candidates have n't discussed the issue in speeches or debates , but medical marijuana advocates regularly questioned them in Iowa and New Hampshire .
The most sweeping changes were proposed by second - tier candidates - Democrats Mike Gravel , Dennis Kucinich and Chris Dodd and Republican Ron Paul called for repealing federal criminal penalties for marijuana - but of the remaining contenders , Obama has been the friendliest to advocates of medical marijuana .
At a November appearance in Audubon , Iowa , Obama recalled that his mother had died of cancer and said he saw no difference between doctor - prescribed morphine and marijuana as pain relievers .
He said he would be open to allowing medical use of marijuana , if scientists and doctors concluded it was effective , but only under " strict guidelines , " because he was " concerned about folks just kind of growing their own and saying it 's for medicinal purposes . "
Obama went a step further in an interview in March with the Mail Tribune newspaper in Medford , Ore .
While still expressing qualms about patients growing their own supply or getting it from " mom - and - pop stores , " he said it is " entirely appropriate " for a state to legalize the medical use of marijuana , " with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors . "
In response to recent questions from The Chronicle about medical marijuana , Obama 's campaign - the only one of the three contenders to reply - endorsed a hands - off federal policy .
" Voters and legislators in the states - from California to Nevada to Maine - have decided to provide their residents suffering from chronic diseases and serious illnesses like AIDS and cancer with medical marijuana to relieve their pain and suffering , " said campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt .
" Obama supports the rights of states and local governments to make this choice - though he believes medical marijuana should be subject to ( U.S. Food and Drug Administration ) regulation like other drugs , " LaBolt said .
He said the FDA should consider how marijuana is regulated under federal law , while leaving states free to chart their own course .
Obama would end DEA raids
LaBolt also said Obama would end U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raids on medical marijuana suppliers in states with their own laws .
Those raids have been the focus of Hillary Clinton 's comments on the issue .
At a July campaign event in Manchester , N.H. , she told a medical marijuana advocate that she would end the federal raids , according to Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana , which recorded the exchange .
But the candidate was less absolute in a more recent interview with the Willamette Week newspaper in Hillsboro , Ore .
" I do n't think it 's a good use of federal law enforcement resources to be going after people who are supplying marijuana for medicinal purposes , " Clinton said in the April 5 interview .
But when asked whether she would stop the raids , she replied , " What we should do is prioritize what the DEA should be doing , and that would not be a high priority .
There 's a lot of other , more important work that needs to be done . "
Clinton has also said she opposes repealing criminal penalties for marijuana , but told advocates in October that the government should conduct more research " into what , if any , medical benefits it has . "
McCain has taken a variety of positions , according to comments recorded by medical marijuana advocates .
At an April 2007 campaign kickoff event , when asked if he would end federal raids , he said , " I would let states decide that issue . "
But less than two months later , he said he would not end the raids .
Then , in November , he promised a man who described himself as a seriously ill marijuana patient that he would " do everything in my power " to make sure the man was never arrested for using the drug .
No policy paper
While maintaining that medical experts considered marijuana ineffectual and potentially dangerous , McCain promised at the same November event in New Hampshire to consult with experts and issue an " in - depth policy paper " on the topic within a few days .
McCain 's campaign has not responded to media inquiries , and marijuana advocates say the policy paper was never issued .
He was also asked during a November conference call whether the federal government should override the will of the people in states with medical marijuana laws .
" Medical marijuana is not something that the , quote , people want , " McCain replied .
Bruce Mirken , a spokesman for the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project , said he remains hopeful that the federal climate will improve , no matter who becomes president .
" All it takes , " he said , " is for the Justice Department to say , ' Leave these states alone . ' "
Green views : Environmentalists find John McCain inconsistent .

A nice comment on a slashdot story reporting on made advances in opening up Java taught me a few nice trivias on the history between Richard Stallman and James Gosling in the early days :
“ In the early years ( 1984 to 1988 ) , the GNU Project did not have a single license to cover all its software .
What led Stallman to the creation of this copyleft license was his experience with James Gosling , creator of NeWs and the Java programming language , and UniPress , over Emacs .
While Stallman created the first Emacs in 1975 , Gosling wrote the first C - based Emacs ( Gosling Emacs ) running on Unix in 1982 .
Gosling initally allowed free distribution of the Gosling Emacs source code , which Stallman used in early 1985 in the first version ( 15.34 ) of GNU Emacs .
Gosling later sold rights to Gosling Emacs to UniPress , and Gosling Emacs became UniPress Emacs .
UniPress threatened Stallman to stop distributing the Gosling source code , and Stallman was forced to comply .
He later replace these parts with his own code .
( Emacs version 16.56 ) .
( See the Emacs Timeline )
To prevent free code from being proprietarized in this manner in the future , Stallman invented the GPL . ”
Nice to see how ( as the comment author puts it ) ‘ Richard was right . ’
The rest of the comment ( & story ) is equally worth a read .
Long live the GPL & Java ! & so many others

First , Peter Cooper was kind enough to submit a patch that allows acts_as_taggable_on to work with Rails 2.1 ’s named_scope when using find_options_for_tag_counts .
Secondly , the much requested support for Single Table Inheritance is finally in !
It was just a matter of using a class inheritable attribute instead of a class instance variable , and big thanks to slainer68 for hunting that down and taking the time to submit a patch .
If there ’s anything you ’ve hacked on to Acts As Taggable On , I urge you to submit a patch to the Lighthouse Project .
I try to get new patches integrated into the codebase as quickly as possible , so please do submit anything !
During the Community Code Drive at RailsConf two great features were added : taggers and related objects .
Taggers
Tags can now have ownership , allowing for such things as User - tracked tags and more .
This was a requested feature and something that I ’d been looking forward to myself .
Here ’s the usage :
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_tagger end class Photo < ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_taggable_on :locations end @some_user.tag(@some_photo , : with => " paris , normandy " , : on => : locations ) @some_user.owned_taggings @some_user.owned_tags @some_photo.locations_from(@some_user ) 1 class User & lt ; ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_tagger end class Photo & lt ; ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_taggable_on : locations end @ some_user .
tag ( @ some_photo , : with =& gt ; " paris , normandy " , : on =& gt ; : locations ) @ some_user .
owned _ taggings @ some_user .
owned _ tags @ some_photo .
locations_from ( @ some_user )
Find Related
Another request ( and another great idea ) is the ability to find related objects by similar tags .
This is now available through the @object .
find_related_on_tags syntax :
@bobby = User.find_by_name ( " Bobby " ) @bobby.skill_list # => [ " jogging " , " diving " ] @frankie = User.find_by_name ( " Frankie " ) @frankie.skill_list # => [ " hacking " ] @tom = User.find_by_name ( " Tom " ) @tom.skill_list # => [ " hacking " , " jogging " , " diving " ] @tom.find_related_on_skills # => [ < User name = " Bobby " > , < User name = " Frankie " > ] @bobby.find_related_on_skills # => [ < User name = " Tom " > ] @frankie.find_related_on_skills # => [ < User name = " Tom " > ]
1 @ bobby = User .
find_by_name ( " Bobby " ) @ bobby .
skill_list # => [ " jogging " , " diving " ] @frankie = User.find_by_name ( " Frankie " ) @frankie.skill_list # => [ " hacking " ] @tom = User.find_by_name ( " Tom " ) @tom.skill_list # => [ " hacking " , " jogging " , " diving " ] @tom.find_related_on_skills # => [ < User name = " Bobby " > , < User name = " Frankie " > ] @bobby.find_related_on_skills # => [ < User name = " Tom " > ] @frankie.find_related_on_skills # => [ < User name = " Tom " > ]
Gemified !
Acts As Taggable
On now works as a GemPlugin in Rails .
This is a new way ( as of Rails 2.1 ) of distributing plugins as gems and having them still automatically link up and do their magic .
To use it as a gem , add it to your config / environment.rb like so :
config.gem " mbleigh-acts-as- taggable-on " , : source => " http://gems.github.com " , :lib => " acts- as - taggable - on " 1 config .
gem " mbleigh-acts-as- taggable - on " , : source =& gt ; " http://gems.github.com " , : lib =& gt ; " acts-as-taggable-on "
Now you should be able to get the latest version of the plugin just by running rake gems : install .
However , this has n’t been working for me so the alternative is just to install the gem directly :
gem install mbleigh - acts - as - taggable - on -- source http://gems.github.com/
1 gem install mbleigh - acts - as - taggable - on -- source http : //gems.github.com/
Now when you run your Rails app , even though it ’s not in vendor / plugins it should be running !
To make sure , look for this line on startup :
** acts_as_taggable_on : initialized properly 1 * * acts_as_taggable_on : initialized properly
There are still a couple of issues outstanding in Rails regarding GemPlugins ( if you unpack it , it will not run the initialization properly for some reason ) , but I wanted to give everyone the latest and greatest way to install the plugin possible .
It will still work fine using the conventional methods as well .
Community and Future
I ’ve been really happy with the response and support of the community , and I would like to do everything possible to cultivate future participation .
To that end , I have created an Acts As Community Project for acts_as_taggable_on that will hopefully provide some casual communication about the project .
Feel free to post on the wall or in the forums , and look out for additions soon .
Finally , the area of the plugin that still needs some work is tag caching .
This is not a particular area of my expertise , so I ’m hoping that someone from the community will write up some specs that flesh out the caching functionality in new and interesting ways .
Thanks for all of the patches , and I hope you continue to enjoy using Acts As Taggable On !
UPDATE ( 6/10/08 ) : The improvements keep on rolling !
After writing the post , I went off on a tangent and decided to make the plugin work both traditionally and as a gem .
See more details above in the “ Gemified ” section .
I have n't contributed a single thing to the platypus genome project , but since my desk sits one floor above where people and robots broke the platypus DNA into chunks , cloned those chunks into bacteria , sequenced the pieces of DNA , and used massive amounts of computing power to assemble the stretches of sequence into a complete genomic whole , I 'm going to consider myself somewhat of an authority on the subject and tell you what 's wrong with other people 's ideas about the platypus .
The genome sequence of the platypus was published Thursday in Nature , and from the press headlines , you could be excused for thinking that genomics has in fact confirmed that the platypus is a freak of nature : part bird , part reptile , and part mammal .
The animal certainly looks like it - the platypus has the webbed feet and bill of a duck , and venomous spines and rubbery eggs that remind us of reptiles , but it has fur and feeds its young with milk , so it must be a mammal .
The confusing press headlines might even lead you to believe that we sequenced the platypus genome just to figure out what this thing is , when the truth is , as we 'll see below , that the genome sequence has essentially confirmed what evolutionary biologists have already deduced about the position of the platypus on the tree of life .
Is the platypus part bird , part reptile part mammal , an amalgam of very different groups of animals ?
Is it a primitive mammal that resembles the early ancestors of all mammals ?
Can we figure out just what this creature is by gazing at its genome ?

The Platypus is a Genuine Mammal , not an Amalgam
The platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus is part of a group of mammals known as Monotremes , who last shared a common ancestor with us between 160 and 200 million years ago .
At that point , one mammalian line split off to give rise to today 's monotremes , while another eventually led to the marsupial and placental mammals .
What this means , of course , is that the platypus is as distant from that ancient ancestor as we are - humans , kangaroos , and platypuses are all modern mammals .
However some traits of the platypus can be considered primitive , if you take primitive to mean ' resembles the ancestral form ' ( instead of the more colloquial meaning ' less advanced ' ) .
The most obvious example is that the platypus lays eggs , something which ancient mammals also did , but which most modern mammals no longer do .
Egg - laying is an ancestral trait that has persisted in this particular evolutionary line , a trait which the platypus inherited from the egg - laying , reptile - like ancestors of all mammals - in that sense , it 's primitive .
Other features of the platypus are n't primitive , and have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that all mammals shared a common ancestor with today 's birds and reptiles .
The venomous spines possessed by the male platypus are not there because of some reptile ancestor that had venomous spines ; early mammals probably had no venom , and evolutionary biologists have long insisted that this interesting platypus feature is likely an independent evolutionary invention .
Venomous spurs are no more reptilian than the human lack of fur : we do n't have fur , and our reptile ancestors did n't have fur , but our bare skin is not a trait inherited from fur - less reptile - like ancestors , it 's a trait we lost recently in our evolutionary history .
The same is true of the ' duck bill ' , which has nothing at all to do with any ancestors the platypus ( and all mammals ) share with birds : it 's a separate invention , a highly developed electrical sensor that the platypus uses to search for food , much like the bill of a paddlefish ( which is also an independent invention ) .
Despite the bill and the webbed feet , the platypus is not " part bird " ( as USA Today proclaimed ) , and its flat tail does not make it part beaver either ( beavers are placental mammals , more closely related to us than to a platypus ) .
The platypus is not part anything : it 's 100 % mammal , with some primitive traits of ancient mammals , like egg laying , and a few newly invented traits like the bill , the webbed feet , and the venomous spines .
The big story hidden in the platypus genome is that evolutionary biologists were right about what the platypus is : by looking at its genome , we can see which platypus traits are ancestral , and which are new inventions ( derived is the proper term ) , only now in much more detail because we can see how the genes involved changed .
Gazing Into The Platypus Genome
So what can we learn about this critter by gazing at its genome ?
By making the right comparisons , we can figure out which genes were in the shared ancestors of birds , reptiles , and mammals , but which have been lost in the line leading to marsupial and placental mammals .
Below you can see the evolutionary relationships between major groups of mammals , as well as birds and reptiles .
For each of these major branches , except reptiles , we have at least one good genome sequence , which I 've indicated in the figure .
( The Anole lizard genome sequence is in progress , so right now we have to make many of the key evolutionary comparisons with the chicken genome . )
The comparison works like this :
If a particular gene is present in the platypus and the chicken genomes , but not in other mammal groups , then we conclude that this gene was present in the shared ancestor of all these groups , but was at some point lost in the line leading to marsupial or placental mammals .
Or , if a gene is present in the platypus , but not in other mammals or birds , then we conclude that this particular gene was not present in that shared ancestor of all these groups ; it was newly derived at some point in the evolutionary line leading to monotremes .
Of course , there is an alternate explanation : that same gene could have been present in the last common ancestor , but lost in birds , marsupials , and placental mammals , which is less likely but still possible .
You get the picture - with the right set of genomes in hand , one can make all sorts of comparisons like this .
( And , just to clarify , when I say gene here , I also mean variants of a gene , or any other genetic feature we can look at in the genome . )
By doing this , we can find genes for ancestral mammalian traits that are preserved in the platypus , but which have been lost in marsupials and placental mammals .
Genes contributing to egg - laying are the obvious candidates , and in the platypus genome we find several genes involved in egg development that have previously only been found in fish , birds , and reptiles .
What this means is that these particular genes , present in the early ancestors of all mammals , were lost in marsupials and placentals , but preserved in the monotreme line .
Before the genome sequence came out , the story evolutionary biologists would tell you was this : egg - laying is a trait that 's been preserved in monotremes in an unbroken line from early egg - laying ancestors , while the rest of the mammals lost that egg - laying ability .
And now the genome sequence bears this story out .
We can find another example of an ancestral trait in the platypus genome : the sex chromosomes .
While humans have one X chromosome ( although you may have two non-identical copies of this particular X chromosome ) , the platypus has 5 - that 's right , 5 X chromosomes .
These X chromosomes look nothing like the human one ; instead , they resemble the sex chromosomes of birds ( and probably some reptiles , but we have less sequence data for reptiles ) .
Again , this is probably another example of the ancestral state being largely preserved in the platypus .
The last common ancestor of birds , reptiles , and mammals probably had a similar sex chromosome setup , but in the evolutionary line leading to marsupial and placental mammals , that setup has changed significantly .
The Independent Invention of Venom
What about venom ?
Few other mammals have venom , and the most plausible evolutionary scenario is that early mammals did not have venom - it arose independently in the platypus , and not by inheritance from a venomous reptile ancestor .
Again , what we find in the genome supports this scenario : the platypus does not have the exact same venom genes found in reptiles , meaning that the platypus did not inherit its venom - producing ability from an ancient venomous ancestor .
Platypus venom is a great example of what biologists call convergent evolution , the independent evolutionary invention of similar traits in different groups of animals .
The platypus genome confirms this independent invention story , but with a very fascinating twist : there is a set of non-venom genes which have been recruited at least twice in evolutionary history to make venom genes : at least once in reptiles , such as poisonous snakes , and once in the platypus .
To understand what 's going on here , you need to know what venom is made of .
Venom is largely a mixture of various proteins that do nasty things to the prey or competitors of venomous creatures .
The genes coding for these venom proteins are very similar to , and actually derived from hormone gene families , such as one family called ' beta - defensin ' .
We have beta - defensin genes , which make up part of our immune system .
Reptiles and the platypus also have these genes .
In venomous reptiles , some of the beta - defensin genes have been modified to make venom .
What the platypus genome shows is that at some point in the non-venomous evolutionary history of the platypus , beta - defensin genes were again recruited to make venom , just as they were in reptiles , but in a completely independent event .
In other words , platypus venom is not primitive ; it 's not a reptilian trait that the platypus inherited from the last common ancestor shared by mammals and reptiles .
Contrary to what you may have read in the press , venom genes are not signs of a link between the platypus and reptiles .
Here is the evolutionary tree researchers produced from the sequences of beta - defensin genes ( you can read Ryan Gregory 's great primer on how to read these trees ) :
Figure 4 , Nature 453:180 , published under the Creative Commons License
This tree shows , based on the sequence data of the genes themselves , that the platypus beta - defensin genes descend from the ancestor of all mammals , and not from a venomous reptile .
So the genome sequence tells us what biologists have been saying all along : the platypus is not evolution 's Frankenstein , not an amalgam of spare parts from different species .
The platypus is a marvelous example of how evolution works , preserving useful traits through long stretches of evolutionary time , while also inventing new traits , sometimes over and over again from the same raw materials in very different lineages .
That 's as true of our history as it is of platypus history .
But is this why we sequenced the platypus genome , just to learn about its evolutionary story ?
I 'm a big advocate of answering basic research questions like this , yet this is not the only valuable aspect of the platypus genome .
One of the best ways to learn about the functions of the various parts of the human genome is through triangulation , by comparing our genome with other genomes that are spaced at various evolutionary distances from ours .
One case that stands out right now is that of the immune system genes in the platypus , which promise to teach about the evolution of the immune system in mammals , which in turn can shed light on how our own immune system functions and goes awry .
The platypus may look odd , but its genome fits nicely into an already well - established evolutionary picture , and in spite of this mammal 's strangeness , it has much to teach us about ourselves .
For more on platypus evolution , and the misleading language found in both the press and the scientific papers themselves , read Ryan Gregory 's take .
A little penguin has been causing big traffic problems on the north island of New Zealand .
In the city of Porirua , just north of Wellington , the penguin was quite literally stopping traffic this morning .
Local woman Tolugafale Gaualofa was driving along when she spotted the bird waddling along Falcon street .
She says the street is about three kilometres from the water .
" It 's amazing , a penguin , right in the middle of New Zealand , " she said .
Porirua Police took the penguin back to their station , where it was granted its freedom and released into the city 's harbour .
We are all atheists about most of the gods … some just go one god further ?
This is one that I started writing over a month ago when my PC locked up …
I did n’t even realize that it saved it as a draft … here goes .
I thought I would share this video from Richard Dawkins at the 2002 TED conference .
Richard ’s presentation titled “ An atheist ’s call to arms ” discusses his view that there needs to be a militant uprising of atheists .
With roughly 30 million citizens ( Americans – added for clarity ) who claim to be “ non-religious / secular , ” why is this voice so dormant in our society ?
I personally liked his suggestion that we are all atheists of some sort … we do n’t believe in the god of the golden calf , we do n’t believe in the god of tooth fairies , or we do n’t believe in God / Allah … and some of us just go one god further .

BrightSource Energy , a Google.org backed startup we covered a few weeks back , opened their Solar Energy Development Center in Israel this week , and it features an enormous test plant that looks as improbably perfect as a rendering .
The tower in the distance of this picture stands 180 feet tall and is surrounded by 1,600 mirrors that focus the sun 's rays onto the commercial boiler that sits atop the tower .
In a real plant that boiler 's steam output would be used to generate electricity with a turbine , but the company did n't put a turbine in the test facility .
BrightSource estimates that a plant this scale could generate 1,500 kilowatts of power .
PG&E , the northern California utility , has agreed to buy 900 megawatt of electricity from the company , and they recently announced a $ 115 million round of funding .

Warren Buffett says inflation in the U.S. is " exploding " and he urged the Federal Reserve not to signal in any way that controlling prices takes a back seat to encouraging economic growth .
" I think inflation is really picking up ...
Whether it 's steel or oil ...
We see it everyplace .
It 's exploding , " Buffett told Becky Quick in a live interview on CNBC's Power Lunch .
He spoke ahead of a charity lunch he is hosting in New York City .
While Buffett stressed that the Fed needs to control inflation , he also said the central bank should also be concerned about slowing economic growth , and said he 's glad he does n't have Chairman Ben Bernanke 's job .
Pressed by Becky about what he would do if he were Fed chairman , Buffett joked that he'd " resign . "
The Federal Reserve announces its latest decision on interest rates around 2:15 p ET today ( Wednesday . )
Buffett told Becky that from a consumer 's perspective , the economy 's weakening is getting worse .
He 's been saying for several months that the U.S. is effectively in a recession .

When the Eliot Spitzer scandal broke in March , I had only sympathy for him : another middle - aged married guy tormented by his sexual needs .
I ’m 52 and have always struggled with the desire for sexual variety .
Everyone gets an issue , and that ’s mine ; it ’s given me pleasure and pain , and jolted my marriage .
I ’d only talked about my issue with any honesty over the years with about six or seven people , and when you leave out my wife and a therapist , they are all men .
So the conversation had a conspiratorial male character .
When people at dinner parties cried out , “ What was Spitzer thinking ? ” I whispered to a friend that I knew damn well what he was thinking :
He wanted some “ strange , ” to quote the old Kris Kristofferson line .
Or we passed around JPEGS of Spitzer ’s date , Ashley Dupre , and commented on her luscious body .
The governor ’s plight had the effect of outing me .
When I told one married friend about my torment , he cut me off .
“ Everyone in our situation has had one or two episodes .
Straying , wandering eye , a blowup .
If you have a pulse . ”
When I decided to write about it , the novelist Frederic Tuten offered a warning about the sanctity in which Americans hold monogamy in marriage .
“ You can go against it in life , but do n’t speak against it .
It makes you a monster .
Who speaks against it ?
And this creates a dichotomy , between what we live and what we profess . ”
The challenge for me was to explore the dichotomy , of which Spitzer , with his hot wife and public moralizing and complicated secret life as Client 9 , was the most flagrant recent example .
Then there was his successor , David Paterson , and his affair , or two affairs , or — we lost count .
And then Congressman Vito Fossella and his two families .
What did it mean about men — and marriage — that this kind of duality was possible ?
Even sexologists are n’t clear about issues of sex in a long - term relationship .
“ There is all this political and social commitment to marriage , yet this is what our news is made up of , these infidelities , ” said the first person I called , Jennifer Bass , communications director for the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University .
“ This is something we do n’t understand .
There ’s research on relationships and research on sex , but putting them together is not so easy . ”
The result is that our understanding of married sexuality tends to be a rich mix of gossip , statistics , and cliché .
“ One week it ’s ‘ everyone ’s having sex , ’ and the next week it ’s ‘ the sexless marriage , ’ ” Bass said .
Having visited many of those clichés myself , I could look back and say that baby - boomers had changed a great number of sexual mores and traditions , from premarital sex to naming the G - spot .
In his book on the history of sodomy laws , Dishonorable Passions , the law professor William Eskridge Jr. has shown how non-procreative sex had slowly but surely gained a place in American life , a cultural tide pushed by nonconformists and artists — not to mention enlightened affluent boomers .
But monogamy has so far withstood the revolutionary impulse .
Consider that Fossella is being pilloried for having an affair , while his sister Victoria Fossella , according to published reports , is openly gay , lives with a partner , and has adopted children that her partner has borne .
No , these are not the same thing , and Victoria ’s choice does n’t yet have a place of honor — but it ’s taken for granted , as it would n’t have been 50 years ago .
An article of faith among the men with whom I discussed these issues ( and an idea ignored , if not contested , by most of the women I know ) was that the hunger for sexual variety was a basic and natural and more or less irresistible impulse .
“ I have n’t ever seen anyone who does n’t deliver on every single demand their sexuality makes on them .
We make the mistake of thinking some people have a stronger will , they do n’t , ” says a forward - thinking friend .
“ There is no more unnatural principle of social organization than sexual exclusivity . ”
But like other of my male sources , he did n’t want me to use his name .
“ Do n’t get me divorced ! ” was the refrain .
All of these guys nursed a fantasy , as quaintly surreal as an old tinted postcard , of a perfectible world in which we might have sex outside our primary relationships and say that it does n’t mean anything .
Housed in a handsome townhouse on the Upper East Side that might contain a huge and happy Tolstoyan family , the Ackerman Institute for the Family is a leading center for couples therapy , and when I met its president , Lois Braverman , I brought up the point that Alan Dershowitz and many others have made re Spitzer : Are n’t Europeans more evolved about marriage ?
Photo : Matthew Pillsbury
Braverman pointed out that American habits , even on the Upper East Side , have a moralistic component .
That affects men too .
“ I ’m not a sociologist , ” she cautioned .
“ But we have a history of puritanism as a very dominant sensibility in the United States .
That ’s not the dominant sensibility in France or Italy .
My observation is that often when people are having an affair , they get very involved and they start questioning their attachment to the marriage , which becomes very threatening to the marriage ’s survival .
The husbands here do n’t treat the affairs in the way we imagine Europeans treat their affairs . ”
I told Braverman that I ’d sent an e-mail to 50 married guys and put an ad on Craigslist ; one of my respondents was a guy in his sixties who said that his wife was no longer interested in sex , so he just went and had lap dances and maybe a little more , and no one was hurt .
“ I do n’t find it ’s morally wrong .
What ’s morality — the sex taboo .
This is totally private , ” he ’d told me .
“ I ca n’t change my wife ’s point of view . ” I ’d asked him if he felt shame .
“ I do , but a need is a need .
For a woman too .
A woman has needs .
Women are much more mysterious than men . ”
Braverman was impatient with the idea that the marriage could n’t fulfill this man ’s needs .
“ What does it mean that she ’s not interested ?
How long has she not been interested ?
We know that age does not end sexual arousal or interest , we know that ’s a myth .
Was there some argument about something else , feelings hurt ?
What happened ?
Did one person feel abandoned ? ”
I felt that Braverman was missing the point , and making me feel guilty to boot .
It was the old male - female morality play .
I would insist that the man ’s behavior did n’t mean anything to the relationship , but she saw it as a betrayal of trust .
She also said that some people have strong relationships without “ physical intimacy . ”
Recent science has tended to support my side of the argument .
In the last fifteen years , the evidence has grown that our sexuality is hardwired , and the science is changing the culture .
My sister Alice , a respectable suburban woman happily married for eons , says that she ’s come to respect the fact that sexuality runs the gamut :
Some people seem happy with a sexless marriage , while others are n’t built for monogamy .
The only morality she hangs on to is how honest one person is with the other about their stuff going into a marriage .
My sister has been influenced by evolutionary psychology , the widely publicized theory that the sex drive is genetically programmed .
One of the leaders in the field , David Buss , author of The Evolution of Desire and a professor at the University of Texas , says that men ’s genes program them to seek many mates and try to monopolize the reproductive lives of those mates ; think of the manners of the Fundamentalist Latter - Day Saints sect ’s sprawling compound in Texas , in which the older men ran the younger men off and had as many of the girls — as young as 14 — as they wanted .
But women are also programmed for infidelity , Buss says .
They have a drive to monopolize the economic resources of their mate , according to the theory , but also to keep a man or two in reserve , because men die earlier than women , or men go off , and women need protection .
Recent analyses of genetic databases reveal that fully 10 percent of people have different biological fathers from the men they name as their fathers , Buss notes ; that ’s evidence of women cheating .
But Buss says the difference between the genders in the desire for variety is not minor ( as , say , the gender difference in height is , about 10 percent on average ) ; it is staggering , “ like the difference between how far the average man and woman can throw a rock . ”
Consider the Website meet2cheat , in which married people find one another for recreational sex ; it charges $ 59 for a man ’s three - month entry fee , $ 9 for a woman .
Cheating wives are harder to come by .
“ Women are going to get bored , just like men , but I do n’t think they have this driving constant need , ” says Nancy Heneson , a science writer who ’s covered evolutionary psychology since its early days .
The point was driven home to me by a transgender man who responded to my ad .
Jay was a woman for nearly 50 years till he made the transformation a couple years ago .
The testosterone regime he underwent produced great changes in behavior — as well as tolerance of infidelity .
“ There is a significant uptick in casual sex , a lowering of inhibitions , and far more interest in sexual variety , including bisexuality and fetishes , BDSM , etc. , ” Jay said .
“ Personally , I have noticed I have a newfound ability to completely divorce sexuality from emotional commitments . ”
Photo : Matthew Pillsbury
As even the evolutionary psychologists will tell you , though , life is n’t just chemicals .
“ Cultural and social attitudes come in and sweep everything off the table , ” Heneson says .
Society is far more judgmental about women who cheat than men ; just read Anna Karenina .
Anna Hammond , an arts executive who has written on feminist subjects , points out that infidelity is more costly to a woman than a man :
It tends to end a marriage when a woman is discovered , while a marriage “ absorbs ” it in the man ’s case .
“ Men have more freedom to act .
It ’s not because men have more desire or are genetically programmed .
It ’s because the social and economic ramifications of it are so much more severe for women . ”
Hammond told me of women friends who have had long affairs and only told one or two close women friends about them lest word get out .
The women got a lot from the affairs , she said , passion and a sense of themselves as sexual .
“ Women do these things , too , but they do them completely in secret . ”
Marital passion — and its absence — was a major theme in the responses to my e-mail .
“ I think that marriages in which both parties are members of the meritocracy seem to be especially vulnerable , ” said one friend in Los Angeles .
“ I see in the [ Spitzers ] something of what I see in other well - educated power couples — a career trajectory that excludes passion and lust .
I know a lot of guys who seem trapped in sexless marriages . ”
A New York friend expanded the point .
“ My wife tells me that none of her friends are interested in sex …
Do middle - aged , married women who are no longer interested in having sex with their husbands expect them to remain faithful ?
They do n’t want it thrown in their faces , but if they think about it for a bit , they have to realize that that intense need is being met somehow . ”
There is today an extensive literature on revitalizing sexuality in marriage .
Lois Braverman at Ackerman had recommended Passionate Marriage , by David Schnarch , which counsels couples to try to have orgasms with their eyes open , along with techniques of “ differentiation ” to cut boredom .
My wife has a copy of the book , but when she saw me on the couch reading it , she mocked me .
“ That ’s chick lit , ” she said .
“ How much of it really works ? ”
Certainly , I recognize in Schnarch ’s work and another Braverman suggestion , Mating in Captivity , by therapist Esther Perel , some of my own techniques to keep my marriage sexual — an important aim , even if I fall a little short of the national average for frequency of intercourse in marriage ( about 66 times a year ) .
Sexlessness in a marriage is defined as intercourse fewer than ten times a year .
The common answer married men come up with for the deficit seems to be something everyone ’s now wired for .
“ [ P]orn is the norm , ” Mark Penn , CEO of Burson - Marsteller — and Hillary Clinton ’s former chief strategist — said in his book Microtrends .
Penn reported that the marketplace for porn is gigantic , dwarfing the national pastime of baseball .
“ And when women realize it , will it change the way they view their colleagues , bosses , husbands , and boyfriends ? ”
It ’s not just men .
Erick Janssen of the Kinsey Institute has written , “ Relatively large numbers of married men and women indicate using the Internet for sexual purposes … but the impact of this on marriages has , as yet , not received much research attention . ”
One friend had lamented the Internet ’s effect on his life .
“ There has got to be an outlet outside of marriage .
I think that ’s pathetic what I do , a healthy , successful , upbeat kind of guy .
Am I consigned to that lonely pleasure ? ”
His wife has some idea of his sexual needs , and does n’t really want to know more .
One man told me that when his wife was n’t available , he snuck out to massage parlors in a “ primal state ” or watched porn .
He felt no compunction about this ; it was part of the never - ending battle of the sexes .
“ Porn captures these women [ its performers ] before they get smart , ” he said in a hot whisper as we sat in Schiller ’s Liquor Bar on the Lower East Side .
Porn exploited the sexual desires , and naïveté , of women in their early twenties , he went on , but older women had come to terms with that .
“ The most one can expect is that women will cede that area , in porn , a period when you can observe us before we have power , because it ai n’t going to happen again . ”
He spoke of acts he observed online that his wife would n’t do .
“ It ’s painful to say , but that ’s your boys ’ night out , and it takes an enlightened woman to say that . ”
Our conversation had a male - conspiratorial tone that was faintly ridiculous — we were like the two straight guys in a French farce .
I wondered what the tattooed waitress heard — she was probably having more sex than either of us .
Studies provided to me by Kinsey researchers suggest that over the last 50 years , sex and marriage have become increasingly , well , decoupled .
One factor is that young people are putting off marriage longer and longer , causing women to have 8.2 years of premarital sex on average , 10.7 for men .
“ The link between sexual activity and marriage is breaking down , ” the researchers wrote .
Susan Squire , the author of a forthcoming history of marriage called I Don’t , told me that marriage was n’t made to handle all the sexual pressure we ’re putting on it .
For one thing , the average life span is far greater than it was 100 years ago ; what is marriage to do with all that time ?
And in days gone by , marriage was a more formal institution whose purposes were breeding and family .
Squire says that cultural standards of morality have changed dramatically .
In ancient aristocracies , rich men had courtesans for pleasure and concubines for quick sex .
In the Victorian age , prostitution was far more open than it is today .
America is a special case .
By the early - twentieth century , she says , the combined impact of egalitarian ideals and the movies had burdened American marriage with a new responsibility : providing romantic love forever .
Squire says that the first couples therapy began cropping up in the thirties , when people found their marriages were n’t measuring up to cultural expectations .
One man I spoke to said his wife was no longer interested in sex , so he went and had lap dances and maybe a little more .
“ I ca n’t change my wife ’s point of view . ” I asked him if he felt shame .
“ I do , but a need is a need . ”
“ Marriage is n’t the problem ; it ’s the best answer anyone ’s come up with , ” Squire says .
“ Men and women are equally oppressed by expectations .
Expectations are ridiculously high now .
Nobody expected you to find personal fulfillment and happiness in marriage .
Marriage can be very satisfying , but it ’s not going to be this heady romance for 40 years . ”
Marriage involves routine , and routine kills passion .
“ What does Bataille say ? ” Squire continues .
“ There is nothing erotic that is not transgressive .
Marriage has many benefits and values , but eroticism is not one of them . ”
A long and supportive marriage may be more valuable than a sexually faithful one , Squire says .
“ Why does society consider it more moral for you to break up a marriage , go through a divorce , disrupt your children ’s lives maybe forever , just to be able to fuck someone with whom the fucking is going to get just as boring as it was with the first person before long ? ”
Sitting in Schiller ’s , I explained Squire ’s history to my friend and suggested that we could change sexual norms to , say , encourage New York waitresses to look on being mistresses as a cool option .
“ That ’s fringe , ” my friend said dismissively .
Wives were n’t going to allow it , and we men grant them a lot of power ; they ’re all as dominant as Yoko Ono .
“ Look , we ’re the weaker animal , ” he said .
“ They commandeer the situation . ”
He and I love our wives and depend on them .
In each of our cases , they make our homes , manage our social calendar , bind up our wounds and finish our thoughts , and are stitched into our extended families more intimately than we are .
They seem emotionally better equipped than we are .
If my marriage broke up , my wife could easily move in with a sister .
I ’d be as lost as plankton .
Later , I related my friend ’s Yoko analogy to my wife .
She pointed out that Ono and Lennon had a marriage based on what they both cared most passionately about , art — not money or sex , to judge from the fact that Lennon went off for a year with a mistress and the marriage survived .
But how many of us can afford that ?
Tuten says that even the New York art world is short on mistresses .
“ Victor Hugo had a mistress even when he was in exile in Jersey .
He lived in a house with his family and the mistress lived down the road , and he went to and fro .
I do n’t know anyone in the art world who has that .
I do n’t know too many men who have enough money to set up an apartment for a woman . ”
Indiana University in Bloomington is known for its forested campus with a creek running through it and its attraction to great scientists , the most famous of whom was an insect man , raised in a repressive Methodist family , who broke away from the study of gall wasps in the forties to photograph human beings having group sex in his attic , thereby rehearsing what he would soon give all Americans permission to do in their own homes .
Today the institute named after him has a more holistic mission than the strict focus on the genital .
It ’s called the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction and occupies a cavelike set of rooms with only one doorway to get in to it in one of IU ’s stately buildings .
I sat down in Jennifer Bass ’s office and saw a funny magnet on her file case , a photo of highway interchange signs on a downtown cloverleaf : NO SEX FOR A WEEK on one exit , NO SEX FOR A MONTH , FOR A YEAR .
We talked about a concept Bass had introduced me to , polyamory .
She said , “ The old open marriage has given way to this . ”
Polyamory is something of that fantasy I and other men I know harbor , of a community of free - loving people in multiple relationships .
Not just dyads , or couples , but triads , or a woman with two “ primaries , ” a whole community of friends with benefits .
“ With practice , we can develop an intimacy based on warmth and mutual respect , much freer than desperation , neediness , or the blind insanity of falling in love , ” Dossie Easton and Catherine A. Liszt , two former hippies , write in The Ethical Slut .
My most liberated male friend has expressed a similar view .
He finds my confession of sexual torment backward .
“ It breaks my fucking heart to hear you talk that way .
That any person has to talk about where their sexuality has led them in a shameful manner , in relation to other people .
That a person ’s sexuality has led them to hurt , and I do n’t mean physically , another person — that breaks my heart . ”
If we simply got rid of a vow of sexual exclusivity and the piety around “ faithfulness , ” which is a religiously inscribed misnomer for sexual exclusivity anyway , we have no idea what the family would look like in 100 years , he says .
Okay , most people would be sexually exclusive and married .
But there would be a party going on at the other end of town , in a community of people of high sexual desire who understood that about one another and did n’t feel jealousy or possessiveness .
I like the idea of going to that end of town , but I also wonder how much time it would take .
Would my new relationships get complicated ?
Bass said , “ One of the tenets of polyamory is that it is honest and consensual :
This is something that ’s out with your primary partner .
How many people are willing to do that ?
It takes a lot of work .
Because it ’s about relationships , not about sex . ”
Then she brought me downstairs to a seminar on images of prostitution .
The institute takes a very nonjudgmental view of prostitution officially , but the visiting researcher on hand was negative about it .
Sven -Axel Mansson had spent many years studying prostitutes in Sweden and argued that the desire of men for prostitutes had nothing to do with sexual “ needs . ”
Rather , the drive is socially ordained : because men need to project their own sexual feelings onto a “ dirty whore , ” or because powerful men like Spitzer want to give up power for an hour or two .
The talk made me feel ashamed of my own fantasies .
I had brought with me a printout of bloggings by Debauchette , a high - priced courtesan .
Said to look something like a young but more bookish Demi Moore , Debauchette has obviously made a lucrative career of serving and tantalizing rich men , sometimes flying to Paris for threesomes in a sex club , thereby making Eliot Spitzer with his Amtrak - to - Washington fiddle seem unambitious .
Debauchette described herself as a “ highly sexual woman with a highly compartmentalized life , ” and that fit right into my fantasy of the sort of demimonde that modern men and women might establish in respectable society .
“ He put it out there that he wanted a real relationship , something emotionally monogamous but sexually open , the sort of relationship I love best , ” she wrote , and I only wondered if it was real .
A commenter said he had gone into the Parisian sex club where Debauchette had been having a threesome , on a different night , and found the strobe room mostly devoid of women .
Erick Janssen is Kinsey ’s lead researcher , and after the lecture , he took Mansson on .
Prostitution , he said , “ has to do with differences in sexual desire between men and women in general .
I hate to stereotype anyone by gender .
Unfortunately , there ’s so much data to support the fact that , overall , men have a higher level of desire .
Say if you look at masturbation frequency .
If there ’s a desire and no outlet , you ’re going to find ways . ”
Mansson seemed unconvinced .
Later in his office he told me about what a dismal life prostitutes lead .
“ What I saw was actually misery .
I saw the effect of this life specifically on women .
The dark side of the forest .
The negativity of being exploited , of being under the reign of the pimp .
So as a result of that , I decided to launch a social - outreach program for people to exit prostitution . ”
I asked Mansson about the implicit argument in Debauchette ’s writings that prostitution can be legalized , dignified .
“ I have a hard time from the research I ’ve been doing to valorize this as a social institution … [ But ] I have met women who said that .
Women who really think that they enjoy being prostitutes , being ‘ sex workers , ’ as they say .
They would say , ‘ I feel in command , I have determination over my life situation in a way I ’ve never had it before .
I ’m loved by my customers . ’
But these are the exceptions .
They are not the main . ”
Had these women been given a choice , they would have chosen other things .
“ Because even among these women , you would find there it has a high cost .
Problems with intimacy and sexuality after they quit their career .
They dissociate their feelings in order to survive …
The problem has been to make it whole again . ”
I went on to Janssen ’s office .
There were pictures of erections on his wall and erotica .
Janssen has tried to come up with a model for predicting who will cheat , based on two curves : one for sensitivity to sexual stimuli , the other a curve of risk - taking .
These traits he calls rather prosaically “ gas pedal ” and “ brake pedal , ” though the questionnaire he offers touches on the tremulous drama of being a sexual person in an everyday world .
Here are statements designed to measure sensitivity .
“ When a sexually attractive stranger looks me straight in the eye , I become aroused … [ Agree/ disagree ? ] ”
“ When a sexually attractive stranger accidentally touches me , I easily become aroused . ”
Even among people who would strongly agree with those statements , some are more capable of overriding those feelings .
These are people with a strong awareness of risk , which Janssen measures with statements such as these : “ If I can be heard by others while having sex , I am unlikely to stay sexually aroused . ”
“ If I feel that I am being rushed , I am unlikely to get very aroused . ”
I told Janssen about my friend ’s comment : “ There is no more unnatural principle of social organization than sexual exclusivity . ”
When I told my wife some of the ideas about about male sexuality , she got agitated .
“ Okay .
Let ’s have an open marriage , ” she said , adding that she ’d be spending the evening away on Wednesday .
I said , No thanks .
Janssen made a face .
“ Infidelity is not just a social issue .
It is a problem of trust and intimacy in a relationship .
You have responsibility toward your partner .
Why do n’t men make sure they have open relationships ?
Let them be gutsy to stand up and tell their wives . ”
He shrugged .
“ If you can handle that — ” I spoke of sexual passion and the way it makes social attitudes seem like so much debris on the ocean of real experience .
A friend of mine was married for fifteen years to a woman with whom he came to understand he was incompatible , values - wise .
Women had always flirted with him ; finally , he made a date .
“ I thought the world was going to collapse when I did it , ” he said .
“ When I was growing up , people would say they were such sinners they thought the church would collapse if they just walked inside .
Well , it did n’t collapse . ”
He had complete pleasure ; he could not accept that something that felt so good was wrong .
His marriage broke up a year later , and then he met a nurse who also worked as an escort and who loved sex and loved the fact that he loved it .
“ Everybody ’s different …
She taught me I could have sex without a relationship .
I did n’t want to talk to her , I did n’t want to go to the movies .
I would knock on her door , and that was it .
This went on for years . ”
Janssen heard me out and nodded .
“ Underneath it all is this issue , if there is some divide between the sexes overall in how important sex is , how often you have it and with whom , and whether biological or not , how do we deal with that ?
We institutionalize things .
We create institutions like marriage .
For most people , it seems to work .
That seems to be the issue we ’re dealing with .
Should that change ? ”
“ Well , New York was just deprived of a really smart governor because he had a need for an illicit but consensual relationship , ” I said .
“ Consensual relationship , yes .
But not to the person you ’re cheating on , ” Janssen said .
“ If indeed this is an essential part of you — ”
“ A friend calls it core . ”
“ Well , core could still be learned behavior .
Essential means ‘ part of my biology . ’ ”
The distinction is crucial .
Our core has many components , and even the evolutionary psychologists say that there is an evolved desire for pair bonding , for love .
The obvious question is whether we can import a European understanding .
The stereotype is that in Europe , they have got this figured out , and every time they snigger over our scandals , they seem more superior .
A gay friend tells me that gay European friends laugh at him because even gay relationships here tend to follow a bourgeois , monogamous model .
David Buss points out that in the U.S. , it is very difficult for a candidate to be elected who has no professed religious belief , while this is not the case in Europe .
In Germany , prostitution is legal .
“ It ’s cleaned up and taxed , and the prostitutes get health insurance and benefits that they could n’t get if it was illegal . ”
And German husbands and wives take separate vacations with the understanding that romance might ensue .
“ You could argue that European sensibility is more civilized and natural . ”
I asked Glyn Vincent , a New York writer on social and cultural matters who is half - French , about norms .
“ Marriage is more of a formality ; sex is not the most important thing , ” he said .
“ From the time I was small , I was led to understand that people have affairs .
C’est la vie .
This is just going to happen .
You ’re not going to make a big deal out of it when it does happen .
You should n’t be hurtful about it .
You ’re going to be discreet .
Do n’t shove it in people ’s faces . ”
While Vincent sees young Americans experimenting with new norms — “ fuck buddies , ” friends with benefits , etc. — those innovations do n’t seem to have rubbed off on their elders .
New York divorces continue to involve sexual infidelity as a breaking point .
“ When I make a comment about infidelity in social situations , there ’s always a little element of mistrust in people ’s eyes , ” he said .
European norms may contravene some basic American ideals .
In Mating in Captivity , Esther Perel , a New York therapist , says that “ egalitarianism , directness , and pragmatism ” are entrenched in American sex lives .
Her point is seconded by two recently divorced women I know who describe their husbands ’ promiscuity as “ sociopathic . ”
In both cases , the men were closeted about their behavior , and the revelation of the secret was bone - crushing .
But Vincent says that French women have to “ put up with a lot ” and so too do those instinctual Italians .
“ I ’ve heard this mythology so many times , that Italian women , they ’re more mature , more understanding of men ’s needs , they expect infidelity .
They do n’t complain , ” says Tuten , who was married to an Italian woman .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s true .
A lot of Italian women expect their husbands to turn into philanderers , and how do they live with it ?
Some live by suffering . ”
Why ca n’t we shift American norms ?
We ’ve transformed attitudes about premarital sex and homosexuality in the last 40 years .
Why not actively change the rules here and let men and , yes , women too do what they want ?
Vincent ’s answer echoed the sympathy I ’d seen for Mansson ’s point of view at the Kinsey Institute .
“ I think we ’re getting into a question of social stability .
The male libido is considered a very dangerous and a potentially disruptive force in society .
I think that ’s why there are so many religious dictums and taboos around that .
The idea that one is allowed multiple partners — this is something that has to be rigidly controlled . ”
David Buss also spoke of the libido ’s lash .
“ We understand that infidelity is a great source of stress and conflict and causes a lot of marriages to break up when discovered .
It causes a great deal of anguish .
The Jimmy Carter model might be better .
Lust in their hearts . ”
This is obviously an American norm .
“ There ’s a lot more fidelity than infidelity , ” Bass says .
Even if adultery is underreported , as seems likely , studies show that about 25 percent of married men commit adultery , 15 percent of married women .
Nonetheless , the one strong impression I took away from interviewing peers is that American mores are evolving , especially among the affluent .
An affair or two is handleable for the rich , says a friend , Jo Mango .
“ They ’re more well read , better informed , and more tolerant .
They say , ‘ Get over it . ’
It ’s way costlier to break up .
Because look what happens :
You lose your living situation and your community in a divorce . ”
A sophisticated New Yorker made a similar point : “ I do n’t believe that straying diminishes your love or commitment to your partner .
It ’s not a zero - sum game .
However , it does get complicated and hurtful when you start developing an emotional relationship with another woman .
“ But it ’s between the partners .
Look at all the accommodations you make in a marriage .
It ’s individualistic .
I actually think that we have made a lot of progress publicly about this . ”
He was referring to the Clintons , and maybe the Spitzers too .
They ’d been humiliated in the public square , but they ’d survived it , so far .
Their marriages were formal and more broadly based than their sex lives .
Bill Clinton has himself pointed to the Roosevelts ’ highly layered marriage as a model .
So does my oldest sister .
She ’s true blue in her marriage , and I had expected her to be moralistic about cheating .
But she says that documentaries she ’s seen on the Roosevelts and all the science about homosexuality has made her shrug — about others , that is .
Ever since the sexual revolution began , dreamers have made prodigious efforts to normalize infidelity , to bring that paradisiacal planet in their minds into the ordinary world .
In Thy Neighbor ’s Wife , published in 1981 , the prominent journalist Gay Talese got his mind blown at Sandstone Retreat , a communal retreat in the Santa Monica Mountains , outside Los Angeles , led by a charismatic man named John Williamson .
It reminded Talese of Oneida and earlier American experiments in communal eroticized living , and he tried to sell it as the latest twist in a road that had begun with Hugh Hefner .
But Talese ’s version was n’t convincing .
The experience strained his own marriage , and life in the commune was pretty stressful .
One of the husbands , still holding a day job at New York Life , said that Williamson had set it all up to give himself access to other men ’s wives .
The same sordid air hovers over The Blood Oranges , by the late John Hawkes , another American novelist ’s fantasy of liberated sexuality , set in a utopian Mediterranean setting called Illyria .
Led by the “ sex - singer ” Cyril and his panty - dropping wife Fiona , two couples try to make openness work , but both end up smashed , one forever , by a suicide .
Lately , the novelist Scott Spencer , who first gained notice in the seventies with the adolescent fantasy of burning desire , Endless Love , published a novel , Willing , about the ultimate male fantasy : men running away from sexless , high - pressure , Ambien - pacified life in the U.S. for sexual tourism with “ body workers ” in Scandinavia .
It turns out to be a big downer .
“ Prostitutes are like psychiatrists , ambulance drivers , tutors and personal trainers ; they ’ve got to be used to human wreckage , ” Spencer writes .
When I got back from the Kinsey Institute , I told my wife all about the evolutionary data and Erick Janssen ’s questionnaire , and she got agitated .
“ Okay .
Let ’s have an open marriage .
And I have to be out Wednesday night . ”
I said , No thanks .
I talked about my failure to grasp the nettle with a couple of other men .
“ When we were kids , we thought we were going to grow up and be mature ; we ’re not going to be crazy kids , ” Tuten says .
“ But these questions , they never have an answer or a terminal point in age .
We ’re crazy all the time , we ’re burning all the time …
When you ’re in love , you ’re jealous .
I ’m in love with a woman , she has an affair , my heart is broken .
I become ill .
I ca n’t bear it .
When you ’re not in love , everything is permitted . ”
A gay friend who has “ brooded ” over his infidelity for a long time , sometimes feeling that he ought to confess , told me it ’s a very 17 - year - old American view of the world to think that you should tell someone you love everything and somehow the world will be a better place .
Instead , he reminds himself , he ’s a grown - up , he has secrets .
He ’s keeping those secrets to protect himself as much as his mate .
“ A relationship is a myth you create with each other .
It is n’t necessarily true , but it ’s meaningful .
The key to that myth is that the other person is enough for you .
You know in your head that another person is n’t enough for you .
But if you do n’t honor the myth , then it crumbles . ”
How ’s that for a happy ending ?

There ’s been a lot of interest in yesterday ’s release of Google Doctype .
The primary focus of the release is on documentation ( specifically “ documenting the Open Web ” ) however there ’s also two extra , hidden , additions : A Google - released JavaScript library and an Open Web test suite .
Let ’s break down the parts of this release .
Documentation
On the main Google Doctype site they provide a link to Browse Google Doctype which takes you to a JavaScript - laden site through which you can read the various articles that they provide .
If , instead , you ’d prefer to read something a little more static ( and sanely linkable , bookmarkable ) you can just go straight for the Google Doctype Wiki instead .
The documentation falls into 2 realms :
DOM and CSS
These are sort of API references to all the DOM and CSS properties .
However , browsing through , they do n’t seem to be terribly useful .
At best , these references are programmatically generated ( seeded with initial values ) .
It ’s not completely clear what its setting out to achieve but my guess is something like “ if we put all the information in a wiki , maybe people will come and fill it out , ” which seems a little awkward ( especially since it ’s already been done before ) .
The primary original content provided by this reference is related to the ‘ browser compatibility ’ section of each item .
For example , examine the background - postition CSS property page .
There ’s a whole bunch of information being tested for – and a whole lot of ‘ N ’s in the columns – in fact there ’s even a couple rows that contain nothing but ‘ N’s .
This says to me a couple things :
When every browser fails a test then you ’re probably testing the wrong thing .
The fact that the actual return values are n’t shown makes this extra frustrating ( every browser fails background - position : left – but what do they fail with ?
what are they returning , instead ? ) .
There does n’t seem to be any attempt to test for compliance .
Overwhelmingly the test values appear to be “ the value that goes in should be the value that comes out ” – which is rarely the case .
Granted , it ’s much easier to write tests of this nature ( just generate them programmatically ) but the end result does n’t really help anyone .
How - To Guides
The final portion of the documentation centers around a number of articles relating to JavaScript / DOM programming .
A number of these articles are quite good ( such as the Web Security section and a couple of the other articles ) .
However , the rest of the articles are quite … confusing .
They appear to be documentation for methods of a Google JavaScript library , however they ’re presented as Copy - and - Paste examples that developers can use .
I think most developers will be quite disappointed when they find out that it ’s not possible .
On the article pages the Google JavaScript library is never mentioned , nor linked to .
You can eventually find it if you go to source , browse the SVN ( to the right directory ) , and download the individual files of the library .
I think I can safely say that this is the first time that documentation for a JavaScript library has been released before the library itself .
Google JavaScript Library
The second portion of the Google Doctype release was the public unveiling of the ( for lack of a better name ) “ Google JavaScript Library . ”
It , currently , only existing in Google SVN .
There does n’t appear to be an API reference , either – beyond the various articles provided in the above How - Tos .
Digging through the code there appears to be a huge depth of coverage for some … rather obscure JavaScript topics .
If anything has been shown during the last couple years of JavaScript library development ( in that the functionality that users have been asking for , and using ) is that DOM traversing , DOM manipulation , Events , Ajax , and Animations are fundamental .
While the Google JavaScript library does provide some DOM manipulation and Events they completely ignore all other aspects of JavaScript development .
Instead they delve off into the land of object traversal , string manipulation , math helpers , and data structures .
If I had to pick a library that this one was closest to I ’d have to say MochiKit .
I was n’t very surprised then to find out that the Google JavaScript library ’s DOM helpers were heavily inspired by MochiKit .
No offense to MochiKit or the Google JavaScript library but if past history is any indicator – developers are not clamoring for another MochiKit .
Open Web Tests
The final portion of this release is related to the programmatically - generated Open Web API reference .
This is a full suite of tests that cover HTML elements , JavaScript / DOM methods , and CSS properties .
Thankfully raw dumps of the results are provided for each browser so we can use this as an opportunity to see what tests are being performed ( and how the results compare ) .
Taking a look at the JavaScript / DOM results for Firefox 3 we see a lot of ‘ existence ’ tests .
The vast majority of the tests appear to be checking to see if particular methods , or properties , exist .
Scroll through we see some puzzling error messages :
3. document/ document-attachEvent-typeof-test.html:testTypeOf failed
" [ DocumentAttacheventMethod ] typeOf(document.attachEvent ) != ' undefined ' "
Expected not to be < undefined > ( String )
Firefox 3 is failing this test because it does n’t have Internet Explorer ’s proprietary attachEvent method ?
If you continue through the results you ’ll see similar indicators all throughout .
If you were to open Internet Explorer ’s results you would see a number of fails for Netscape - specific methods / properties .
Opening up the HTML Firefox 3 results we see a similar situation .
In this case the HTML tests appear to focus on the availability of attribute expandos on DOM elements .
For example , here ’s one failing test from Firefox 3 :
293 . attributes/ilayer-above-reflection-test.html:testReflection failed
" [ IlayerAboveAttribute ] ilayer .
above reflects < ilayer above = " foo " > "
Expected < foo > ( String ) but was < undefined >
The ilayer element was a Netscape - specific HTML extension .
Testing for its DOM compliance ( and , by extension , its existence ) seems quite futile .
If I had to guess as to how these tests were generated I ’d say “ open up a browser , spider every DOM property ( or HTML attribute ) , and turn those into existence tests . ”
This raises an important point :
This suite is not built for any sort of standards compliance – at all – it ’s simply designed to check for compatibility between browsers .
Looking at this suite as a compatibility suite we can start to see some use – but it ’s still terribly limited ( only checking for existence is hardly a good - enough indicator of a browser ’s proper support of a property or method ) .
If there ’s one over - arching theme to the Google Doctype release it ’s been “ whatever we can generate automatically , or release with the least amount of fuss , let ’s do that , no matter how simple it may be . ”
I ’m definitely looking forward to when a full release comes along , but this does n’t appear to be it .
NBC announced two significant technology partnerships with Microsoft and Wavexpress today to provide 2008 Olympics coverage over the web .
The new initiatives embody a natural evolution for Olympics coverage considering the times — but they 're available only to users of Vista or Silverlight .
Powered by Wavexpress ' TVTonic
Internet video service and client , NBC Olympics on the Go will allow owners of Media - Center - capable Windows Vista PCs ( that 's Home Premium and Ultimate ) to download " up - to - HD " coverage on a sport - by - sport basis .
Users can chose from a number of channels in Wavexpress ' TVTonic client that NBC 's coverage of the Beijing Games will be categorized into , and the NBC Olympics on the Go client will be able to access event coverage roughly 12 hours after an event ends .
Ars Technica confirmed with Wavexpress that users will not be able to keep downloaded coverage indefinitely , though videos will remain playable at least for the duration of the games .
In addition to going Vista - only for this downloadable Olympics coverage , NBC will be cross-promoting the MSN brand on NBCOlympics.com and featuring Olympics coverage prominently on MSN.com .
As Bill Gates announced at CES back in January , all video at the NBC Olympics site requires Silverlight , Microsoft 's rich web application and video streaming technology that competes with Adobe 's market - dominant Flash .
Microsoft 's been pushing Silverlight pretty hard lately , and if a lot of consumers do n't have a reason to install it yet , the Beijing Games in August should be a good a reason as any .
" Over the past 20 years , we have continually expanded our coverage of the Olympics to new platforms as they have become available , and the Beijing Games will mark another milestone , " said Gary Zenkel , President , NBC Olympics , in a press release .
" By teaming up with MSN and Microsoft , we can give both the core fan and casual consumer of the Olympic Games an amazing online experience , combining high - quality video with the storytelling and analysis that we 're known for .
We chose to partner with MSN and Microsoft , " Zenkel continues , " because technologies such as Silverlight help us deliver the kind of next - generation online viewing experience that will change the way the Olympics is experienced for millions of fans in 2008 . "
Providing summer Olympics coverage in a downloadable format like this is a natural evolution for NBC .
For the 2004 Olympics , all the buzz was about the sheer amount of coverage NBC would be broadcasting ( over 1,200 hours in total ) , as well as the introduction of over 300 hours of HD coverage from NBC and its affiliates .
With NBC
Olympics on the Go , consumers will have a convenient new option for bringing Olympics video footage with them , though the coverage will be sandboxed to PCs — and then just the ones running compatible versions of Vista .
As far as portable media players are concerned , " We are not addressing portable players with this service , " Wavexpress told Ars Technica .
" NBC has other distribution outlets for other platforms and types of experiences . "
NBC has yet to make any announcements for those hoping to bring 2008 Olympics footage in something more portable like an iPod , Zune , or PlaysForSure - compatible device .
Break - ins plague targets of US Attorneys

The Permanent Republican Majority Part VI
MONTGOMERY , ALABAMA 
In two states where US attorneys are already under fire for serious allegations of political prosecutions , seven people associated with three federal cases have experienced 10 suspicious incidents including break - ins and arson .
These crimes raise serious questions about possible use of deliberate intimidation tactics not only because of who the victims are and the already wide criticism of the prosecutions to begin with , but also because of the suspicious nature of each incident individually as well as the pattern collectively .
Typically burglars do not break - into an office or private residence only to rummage through documents , for example , as is the case with most of the burglaries in these two federal cases .
In Alabama , for instance , the home of former Democratic Governor Don Siegelman was burglarized twice during the period of his first indictment .
Nothing of value was taken , however , and according to the Siegelman family , the only items of interest to the burglars were the files in Siegelman 's home office .
Siegelman 's attorney experienced the same type of break - in at her office .
In neighboring Mississippi , a case brought against a trial lawyer and three judges raises even more disturbing questions .
Of the four individuals in the same case , three of the US Attorneys targets were the victims of crimes during their indictment or trial .
This case , like that of Governor Siegelman , has been widely criticized as a politically motivated prosecution by a Bush US Attorney .
The main target of the indictment , attorney Paul Minor , had his office broken into , while Mississippi Supreme Court Justice , Oliver E. Diaz Jr. , had his home burglarized .
According to police reports and statements from Diaz and from individuals close to Minor , nothing of value was taken and the burglars only rummaged through documents and in Minors case , also took a single computer from an office full of expensive office equipment .
The incidents are not limited to burglaries .
In Mississippi , former Judge John Whitfield was the victim of arson at his office .
In Alabama , the whistleblower in the Don Siegelman case , Dana Jill Simpson , had her home burned down , and shortly thereafter her car was allegedly forced off the road .
While there is no direct evidence linking these crimes to the US Attorneys  office targeting these individuals , or to the Bush administration , there is a distinct pattern that makes it highly unlikely that these incidents are isolated and unrelated .
All of these crimes remain unsolved .
A FIRE IN ALABAMA
On Feb. 21 , 2007 , a private residence located at 1429 West Main Street in Rainsville , Alabama caught fire .
The house belonged to whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson , a long - time Alabama Republican lawyer and political opposition researcher who was then preparing to come forward in connection with the conviction of former Alabama Democratic governor Don Siegelman and his co-defendant , Republican fundraiser and businessman , Richard Scrushy .
According to the police report obtained by RAW STORY , the east side of the building was completely damaged and the entire structure sustained damages of roughly 30 percent .
( See attached report . )
The cause of this fire is unknown and there has been no formal investigation to date .
Simpson was not home at the time of the incident .
According to Simpson 's attorney in Montgomery , Alabama , Priscilla Duncan , the timing of the fire at Simpson 's home should raise questions .
Jill " was talking to Siegelman 's attorneys about what she was witness to , discussing going public , " said Duncan in a conversation late last week .
" On February 15 she also sent a letter to Art Leach [ Scrushy 's attorney ] . "
Six days after Simpson sent the letter to Leach , her house caught fire .
According to Simpson 's subsequent May 7 , 2007 affidavit and her sworn testimony before the US House Judiciary Committee Sept. 14 , Siegelman 's prosecution was allegedly orchestrated by senior officials in the Bush administration , primarily former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove .
Simpson testified that two weeks after the November 2002 election in which Siegelman was defeated by Republican Bob Riley , Republican operative Bill Canary -- who was serving as Riley 's campaign advisor -- held a conference call with Riley 's staffers about " how to handle Siegelman . "
As reported in Part I of RAW STORY 's investigative series , Simpson alleges that during this call , Canary stated that " his girls " would " take care of Siegelman . "
Simpson says she understood " his girls " to be a reference to Canary 's wife , Leura Canary , the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama , and the couple 's long - time friend , Alice Martin , the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
Both women had been appointed by George W. Bush in 2001 and had been investigating Siegelman since taking office .
Siegelman would later be indicted in Leura Canary 's district .
Karl Rove has publicly denied any involvement in the investigation and prosecution of Siegelman but refuses to testify to this under oath .
Neither Bill nor Leura Canary has offered a comment for any of our articles in the investigative series .
THE CAR ACCIDENT
Less than two weeks after her house caught fire , Simpson 's car was allegedly forced off the road .
She was rushed to Marshall Medical Center South and was treated for bruising on her arms and chest .
According to the police report of the accident , Simpson was heading northbound on U.S 431 when a " non contact " vehicle made an improper lane change into her lane .
Simpson swerved to avoid hitting the vehicle , almost going into the ditch , and struck a car parked in a driveway .
( In the police sketch of the accident below , Simpson 's car is marked # 1 .
The parked car is marked # 2 . )
According to the police report , the driver of the non-contact vehicle was Mark Roden of Rainbow City , Alabama .
Ms. Simpson told RAW STORY several weeks ago that a state trooper interviewed Mr. Roden at the scene of the accident , and " when the trooper asked him for his employment information , Mr. Roden said that he was a officer with the Attalla police department .
He was then allowed to leave without a citation . "
The city clerk for the city of Attalla , Alabama confirmed to us that Mark Roden was indeed a former police officer with the Attalla Police Department , but she could not provide additional information .
Calls left for the Attalla police chief were not returned .
Repeated attempts to reach Mark Roden at the residence listed on the accident report have been unsuccessful .
According to Priscilla Duncan , on the day of the car accident Simpson had met with Richard Scrushy , the co-defendant in the Siegelman case , to discuss coming forward as a whistleblower .
" It is definitely coincidental , " Duncan said .
FORMER GOVERNOR'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE BURGLARIZED
-- TWICE
Simpson was not the only one involved in the Siegelman case to fall victim to crimes .
According to Governor Siegelman 's daughter , Dana Siegelman , their family returned home from a summer trip in 2004 to find the house unlocked and the doors open .
Nothing had been taken , although the home contained computers , stereos , and jewelry .
Ms. Siegelman explained that the only things disturbed were in Siegelman 's office , including his papers , which seemed to have been rifled and were in disarray .
Ms. Siegelman says that her family experienced this once more in the summer of 2004 and that the timing of the two burglaries appeared strange , because it was during this period that charges were brought against her father by the office of US Attorney Leura Canary .
According to Siegelman 's daughter , the family did not report these incidents to the police at the time because they already felt targeted by the US Attorney 's office and the FBI , as well as being uncertain as to what had actually occurred .
" It was only later , when we realized how deceitful our government really could be , " Dana said , " that we suspected our house might have been bugged or Dad 's files had been sifted through -- when the same thing happened to his lawyer , Susan James . "
SIEGELMAN'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE BROKEN INTO
Don Siegelman was sentenced to over seven years in a state penitentiary in June 2007 .
He was not allowed out on bail during his appeal , but was immediately shackled , manacled and moved out of state without his lawyers being informed .
The severity of the sentence prompted 44 former state attorneys general of both parties to write a letter to Congress , asking them to investigate Siegelman 's prosecution , which they describe as having " sufficient irregularities as to call into question the basic fairness that is the linchpin of our system of justice . "
Montgomery attorney Susan James immediately prepared to file an appeal on Siegelman 's behalf with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals .
James had handled much of the sentencing part of Siegelman 's case and was now part of the appeal team .
On July 1 , 2007 , James ' office was broken into .
As with Siegelman 's home , no computers or office equipment were taken or anything of any value .
James told the Associated Press , " They went through our client files . "
James expanded on the break - in in a recent interview with RAW STORY .
She said the burglars went through several file cabinets with documents filed under the letter " S , " which might have included Siegelman 's files if she had not moved them earlier after a previous break - in .
" This burglary is unusual , " said James .
" File cabinets were left open .
Drapes were closed and the blinds were pulled down . "
James said that the only reason that someone would need to close the drapes and pull down the blinds was if they wanted to turn the lights on to look for something .
She asserted that the office next door to hers was not burglarized , even though it also had computers and equipment .
When asked what she made of the cases described in this article , James said she'd not been aware of the number of break -ins and the similarities between them .
" The entire scenario appears to be a pattern unrelated to just random burglaries and random crimes , " James said .
" Our break - in was treated as a routine burglary but when you add the facts of what appear to be other similar burglaries together , this is something that definitely bears further investigation . "
Dana Siegelman says that her family now has " little doubt as to why or who was behind it , " but did not elaborate .
ALABAMA BUSINESSMAN'S OFFICE APPEARS BURGLARIZED - WHILE HE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY US ATTORNEY
Sometime between Sunday , March 2 and early the next morning , the office of Montgomery insurance executive and life - long Republican , John Goff was vandalized by persons unknown .
" We came in to work one day and the window was knocked out , " Goff told Raw Story in a phone interview .
Goff explained that the $ 400 window described in the police report was the sliding glass front door of his office .
According to the police report obtained by Raw Story ( See attached report . ) , a large pane of glass was smashed .
At the time the of the incident at his office , Goff was the subject of what he alleges is a politically motivated prosecution orchestrated by the US Attorney 's Office for the Middle District of Alabama , Leura Canary , in retaliation for a politically embarrassing lawsuit he filed against the State 's well - connected Republican governor , Bob Riley , last year .
Leura Canarys husband , Bill Canary , served as a campaign advisor to Riley when he ran against Siegelman in the 2002 election .
In essence , the US Attorney appears to bringing charges against the perceived enemies of her husbands client .
A month after the incident at Goffs office , a grand jury indicted Goff on charges of embezzlement , mail fraud , and conspiracy .
The charges stem from a dispute between Goff and two reinsurance companies over insurance premiums Goff collected from clients .
The original dispute was settled by arbitration and litigation several years ago .
The arbitration panel agreed that Goff had failed to pay what he owed .
Goff reached a settlement with the Alabama Department of Insurance for complaints arising from the same dispute in the spring of 2005 .
It is not clear why federal prosecutors decided to revisit the matter in 2007 and launch a criminal investigation against Goff , indicting him in 2008 .
Goff and his lawyers maintain that federal prosecutors with close ties to Riley are rehashing settled business in order to punish Goff for blowing the whistle on an alleged attempt at extortion by lobbyists for Riley .
They alleged that US Attorney Leura Canary has a conflict of interest because her husband , Bill Canary , is on the list of witnesses to be deposed in Goffs lawsuit against Riley and others in his administration .
The US Attorney 's Office for the Middle District of Alabama did not return repeated calls and emails seeking comment .
MISSISSIPPI SUPREME COURT JUSTICE'S HOME BROKEN INTO
The break - ins and arson are not , however , restricted to Alabama .
In Mississippi , there was another alleged political prosecution , a bribery case brought by the Bush - appointed US Attorney for the Southern District , Dunnica Lampton , against attorney Paul Minor and three judges , including Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver E. Diaz Jr. , Minor and two of the judges have also fallen victim to break - ins and arson .
On May 14 , 2004 , while Judge Diaz and his family were out of town , a neighbor noticed an intruder and called the police .
According to the police report , the front door of the Diaz home appeared to have been kicked in and a window broken .
( See attached police report . )
In a striking similarity to the Alabama cases , the Diaz burglars appeared not to have been interested in valuables of any sort .
" Our door was kicked in and our documents were rummaged , " Diaz said in an extensive interview for Part V of our investigative series .
" Televisions , computers and other valuables were not taken , despite the fact that we were out of town for several days and the home was left open by the burglars .
We could not figure out a motive for the burglary and reported it to the Biloxi Police Department .
The crime was never solved . "
A FIRE IN MISSISSIPPI
In the early morning of Sept. 15 , 2003 , the Biloxi , Mississippi office of another of the defendants in the Paul Minor case , former Mississippi judge John Whitfield , was set on fire .
At approximately 3:30 am , Whitfield 's secretary , Michele Herman , was awakened by a call from the fire alarm company informing her that the office was ablaze .
Herman was the first of Whitfield 's associates to arrive at the scene .
Her boss and other colleagues joined her soon after .
Herman described what happened after she arrived .
" I rushed to the office to watch the fire department put the fire out .
It was contained to my office because we close doors between offices when we leave , " Herman wrote in an email .
" Just about everything I had was destroyed -- over 20 years worth of my research and books and photos and paintings and such . "
From the outset , the Biloxi fire and police departments treated the fire as a case of arson .
Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms were also involved , as were investigators from the US Attorney 's office .
However , the only suspect in the arson case was Whitfield himself .
" It was us , me and John [ Whitfield ] and a former cop that worked with us , and Mike [ Crosby , Whitfield 's attorney ] that kept telling the fire officials that it looked like something was splashed all over the wall of the outside of the house that we used as an office , " Herman stated .
" They ignored us until John hired an independent fire inspector / arson expert . "
According to Herman 's recollection , local authorities announced that same day that they intended to confiscate files and documents that had survived the blaze .
Whitfield 's lawyer , Mike Crosby strongly objected to this , since he was concerned that privileged information -- including Whitfield 's defense file and the case files of his clients -- would fall into the hands of the FBI and the ATF and be used against Whitfield in his upcoming trial .
In a letter obtained by RAW STORY , dated Sept. 19 , 2003 , Crosby wrote to the judge overseeing the seizure of files and hard drives to register his strenuous objections .
The files and disks contained information that was critical to the operation of Whitfield 's law practice as well as his defense file for the Diaz / Minor case .
Crosby explained that he'd offered to make copies of all the materials for the investigators , if only he could have the originals back .
The authorities refused .
( See attached letter . )
Repeated attempts to reach Crosby for comment have been unsuccessful .
" No one has ever been charged with the crime , as far as we know , " Herman added .
" They dropped it after they investigated John -- he was their suspect , you know .
Only problem was , he did n't own the building , had nothing to gain -- no motive for destroying the building . "
YET ANOTHER MISSISSIPPI BREAK-IN
Also charged by US Attorney Dunnica Lampton was Paul Minor , a successful trial lawyer and the largest individual Democratic campaign donor in Mississippi .
Minor was convicted of bribery and mail fraud and is now serving time in a federal penitentiary in Florida .
In the summer of 2003 , Minor 's Biloxi , Mississippi law office was allegedly broken into .
According to his secretary , Janet Miller , a brick was used to shatter her office window and the break - in targeted only her office .
" I panicked because they took my whole computer -- it had all of my bookkeeping on it and I had an old back up that I had not updated since March , " Miller said .
" It had a lot of Paul [ Minor ] 's personal stuff on it , his business , and of course it had all of the accounting for the law firm on it from 2000 forward . "
Miller said that files were also rummaged through , but she could not say for sure if anything was taken because it was so chaotic .
No other office in Minor 's suite of offices were disturbed .
This crime , like the others , remains unsolved .
HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF ?
John C. Villines , ICPS , CPP , has studied crime causation and crime prevention for 30 years .
As a security consultant , he has provided services to private industry , the United States Government , law enforcement agencies , community organizations and others .
He is the Director of John C. Villines LLC , often appears as an expert witness criminal cases , and was up until recently the Chairman of the Georgia Board of Private Detective and Security Agencies .
Villines was asked in the most general terms what he makes of this series of crimes .
He was not provided with the names of the individuals or any information that would identify the Alabama and Mississippi cases .
" I would avoid drawing conclusions based upon the amount of information you have provided , " Villines wrote in an email response .
" But it would be reasonable to expect that the burglar or burglars is seeking information . "
RAW STORY asked Villines if these crimes could be identity theft - type crimes or something similar .
" Certainly , identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in the United States , " Villines responded .
" However , a series of burglaries and arsons such as you have described would not be the primary crimes I would expect to see associated with attempts to steal personal identifiers . "
" It would seem more reasonable to expect that the burglar (s ) have targeted information related to specific individuals , and that the value of the information is related to a personal motivation ( either on the part of the burglar (s ) or someone who has contracted their services , as in the famed Watergate burglary ) .
Possible motives ( speculation ) : acquire damaging information about a third party , or recover personal information to keep it from being discovered by others . "
The pattern of break-ins and other crimes in Alabama and Mississippi and the serious questions surrounding possible intimidation tactics are not without precedent .
From the 1960's to the 1980's , similar tactics were used by the Nixon and Reagan administrations to spy upon and demoralize their political opponents .
In 1971 , a group of anonymous activists broke into FBI headquarters in Media , Pennsylvania and made off with more than a thousand documents , which were then mailed to major newspapers and politicians .
The documents revealed the existence of a secret counterintelligence program -- known as COINTELPRO for short -- dedicated to investigating , undermining , and discrediting anti-war and civil rights groups .
As part of this program , violent attacks against activists by right - wing groups were sometimes allowed to go forward or even incited by FBI informants within those groups .
The death of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in 1972 and strict new guidelines passed by Congress in 1976 were believed to have put an end to such abuses .
Two high FBI officials were even convicted in 1980 of having ordered agents to break into the homes of friends and relatives of members of the Weather Underground , including the sister of Bernadine Dohrn .
These safeguards , however , broke down during the administration of President Ronald Reagan , who pardoned the two officials and had their convictions expunged .
The FBI was once again a political tool , which not only investigated liberal members of Congress , such as Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Christopher Dodd , but also paid right - wing groups , including the followers of Reverend Moon , to spy upon and disrupt individuals and organizations opposed to the Reagan administration 's support for right - wing dictators in Latin America .
Pulitzer Prize - winning investigative reporter Ross Gelbspan wrote in Break - ins , Death Threats and the FBI ( 1991 ) about " the mystery of the little - publicized epidemic of low - grade , domestic terrorism .
It includes break - ins , death threats , and politically motivated arson attacks which have plagued hundreds of activists and organizations across the country for the past seven years .
While the FBI has repeatedly denied any role in these activities , the Bureau has , at the same time , refused scores of requests to investigate what is clearly an interstate conspiracy to violate the civil liberties of the victims .
" From 1984 , when the first reports of mysterious political break - ins and death threats began to surface , the list of such episodes has continued to escalate .
...
Of nearly 200 political break - ins and thefts of files reported by Central America and Sanctuary activists , not one has been solved . "
Whether or not the recent cases in Alabama and Mississippi actually represent the reemergence of COINTELPRO tactics from the past remains unclear .
There is no solid evidence tying any of the cases to one another .
But there does appear to be a common pattern , both in who is being targeted and also in how the burglars have conducted their operations .

World Service reporter , BBC News
Iraq is said to have the world 's largest untapped oil reserves
It 's difficult to imagine today , but 50 years ago the Iraqi oil industry was directed from offices thousands of miles from Baghdad .
In the 1950s , number 214 Oxford Street , London , was the headquarters of the Iraq Petroleum Company .
For three decades , the IPC held a stranglehold over Iraqi oil - a monopoly only broken with nationalisation in the 1960s .
But once again , foreign oil companies are waiting for another opportunity to return to Iraq .
With governments eager to see the rocketing price of crude oil kept under control , focus on Iraq is increasing .
Shortlist
So what 's on offer ?
According to some , Iraq has more unexploited reserves of oil than anywhere else in the world .
It has 115 billion barrels of proven reserves , but industry estimates say potential oil fields could more than double that .
" Iraq is the one country that has so much proven and potential reserves - that puts it on a par with Saudi Arabia , " says Tariq Shafiq , a veteran Iraqi oil engineer who started his career with the Iraq Petroleum Company .
Pumping it out of the ground is technically cheaper than anywhere else in the world , making it even more attractive to foreign oil companies , Mr Shafiq explained to the BBC World Service 's Newshour programme .
A shortlist of 35 companies has been recently been approved by the Iraqi government to bid for oil contracts .
They are waiting for the Iraqi parliament to approve new laws governing the industry .
After two years , there has been little progress .
Capital
So what are the obstacles ?
Mr Shafiq led the team that drafted the law and he says his draft 's emphasis on developing existing oil fields has been altered .
The reserves in the ground are the assets of the future generations and there 's no need to mortgage them today
Tariq Shafiq ,
Iraqi oil engineer " Iraq today does not require a new exploration effort , " he says .
" The reserves in the ground are the assets of the future generations and there 's no need to mortgage them today . "
At the current rate of production - more than two million barrels per day - Iraq does not need to look for new oil fields for more than 100 years .
So why spend capital on new exploration , he says .
Political wrangles
But that 's only one issue .
Mr Shafiq claims several other elements of the draft , around the governance of the industry , have been watered down because of the political wrangles between regions and the federal government .
Oil refineries are key to the Iraqi economy
It is these negotiations - over jurisdiction of the country 's natural resources - that are causing the greatest concern in Baghdad .
OMV is an Austrian oil company that is already operating in Iraq .
It is n't alone .
About 20 other companies have signed contracts too - with the Kurdish regional government , the authority for the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq .
The regional government 's head of the foreign relations , Falah Mustafa Bakir , says these contracts are based on law .
" We have independent legal opinion that confirms this fact .
Whatever we have done is legal and constitutional , " he says .
" We do n't want to go back to the old - fashioned type of state - run oil industry .
What we want is an efficient free - market approach . "
The Iraqi government disputes this .
In an interview with the BBC , the Iraqi oil minister , Dr Hussein Ali Shahristani , says the contracts have no standing .
" The companies that have signed these contracts have no right to work on Iraqi territory .
They will pay the full consequences of their actions , " he said . "
" That oil is the property of the Iraqi people and it should be handed over to the Iraqi government . "
Peace and security
The oil legislation also faces opposition from nationalists in the Iraqi parliament and oil workers ' unions , who fear it could pave the way to foreign control .
" The law very clearly calls for production sharing contracts , something we have a lot of reservations about , " says Hassan Juma 'a , the president of Iraqi oil unions .
" If these contracts last for 30 or 40 years , it will give domination to the foreign companies .
And their profits could be greater than those received by the Iraqi government . "
Hussein Al Shahristani says they have nothing to fear .
" If Iraq needs help from international oil companies , they will be invited to co-operate with the Iraqi National Oil Company , on terms and conditions acceptable to Iraq , to generate the highest revenue for Iraq , " he states .
" Iraq will always have control of its national wealth and oil is the most important Iraqi national wealth . "
In the short term , the oil ministry will buy in technical expertise via six service agreements with foreign companies .
These will boost daily production by half a million barrels by the end of the year .
And the money is available .
It is estimated the government will receive $ 70bn in oil receipts this year alone .
And there is more than $ 30 bn sitting in its oil revenue accounts .
If Iraq does have the largest unexploited oil reserves in the world , it 's still unclear if they will be a harbinger of peace and security or another cause of sectarian tensions .
Meanwhile , on the streets of Baghdad , people 's thoughts are preoccupied with security and basic services , such as electricity and water .
Many wonder if Iraq 's national wealth will ever improve life for them .

Hugh Winkler holding forth on computing and the Web
The Oceanside Police Department on Thursday defended its investigation into an incident in which an off - duty San Diego police officer shot a woman and her 8 - year - old son after a traffic altercation .
Oceanside Police Capt .
Tom Aguigui said investigators are still trying to figure out what led Officer Frank White to fire five shots at Oceanside resident Rachel Silva ’s car in a mall parking lot .
White was not arrested or tested for drugs or alcohol .
But he was questioned after the shooting , which occurred about 9:15 p.m. on March 15 .
A supervisor from the San Diego Police Department , a lawyer provided by the Police Officers Assn. and a “ peer support ” representative from the department were with White during the questioning .
Advertisement
White has been put on paid administrative leave .
White ’s wife , a Carlsbad police dispatcher , was with him in the car when the shooting occurred , and has been interviewed by police .
Silva , 27 , has refused to be interviewed by police .
After she was treated at a hospital for her wounds , police required her to take a blood test .
The results have not been released .

Silva was driving on a suspended license and had two drunk - driving convictions , according to court records .
Aguigui said police had probable cause to order Silva ’s blood drawn , but none to make a similar decision involving White .
He said San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne was briefed about the incident as a courtesy to a fellow police department , but no similar briefing has been given to Silva ’s attorneys .
On the night of March 15 , both White and Silva called 911 for help .
Aguigui would not describe the traffic incident or say whether White believed that his life was in danger .
Silva was struck twice in the arm ; her son , Johnny , was struck once in the leg .
Silva ’s ex-husband , a Marine serving in Iraq , has been given emergency leave to be with his son .

Aguigui said four bullet holes were found in the windshield of Silva ’s car and one in the front passenger ’s window .
The driver ’s window of White ’s vehicle was shattered .
But Aguigui declined to describe the relative location of the two cars when the shooting occurred .
He said he could not estimate when the case would be taken to the district attorney for a decision on what , if any , charges would be filed .
Silva , who is being represented by civil rights attorney Eugene Iredale , filed a claim Wednesday with the city of San Diego for unspecified damages .
The claim alleges that White , 28 , who has been an officer for two years , is “ manifestly unsuited ” for his job and that Oceanside police are showing favoritism toward a fellow officer .

The claim also asserts that the San Diego department has been negligent in not testing its officers periodically to discover “ rage tendencies . ”
“ It seems to me the temperament shown -- the rage -- is the kind we do not want in a police officer allowed to carry a firearm , ” Iredale said .
Lansdowne , in a telephone interview , said that all officer candidates are given a thorough psychological screening before being hired .
He said that the department has psychological services available for officers and that they can either ask for help or be referred by their supervisors .
Advertisement
“ We have a very good system , ” he said .
If her claim is rejected , Silva will be able to file a lawsuit .
At the sometimes combative Oceanside news conference Thursday , Aguigui denied suggestions of favoritism toward White .
“ We are doing our best to do a very fair and complete investigation , ” he said .

San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom loves it — unsurprising , considering the many green initiatives he ’s supported in the city .
He could n’t stop talking about how “ great ” and “ fantastic ” he thought La Casa was as he toured the building this morning , and listened attentively as homeowner Robin Wilson described the building ’s many green features : the countertops made from discarded rice hulls , the recycled flooring , the chandelier whose shimmering LED lights will last for over 15 years .
“ This is not a modest or symbolic effort , ” he commented .
“ This is real .
This is not fanciful . ”
And for San Francisco residents , “ real ” green housing is about to be a lot more attainable .
Speaking to reporters after the tour , Newsom announced that he is creating a residential wind working group , tasked with figuring out how to revamp the city ’s zoning and building codes to allow wind turbines on private lots .
If implemented , it would be the first urban program of its kind .
It ’s possible this is a pipe dream , as the announcement seemed to take Newsom ’s staff by surprise .
“ I guess we ’re doing residential wind , ” said deputy communications director Brian Purchia , adding that although the idea had come up before , he had n’t realized it was a go .
But Newsom insists that his commitment is both firm and pragmatic .
“ This is who I am , this is what I want to do , ” he said , emphasizing that the project , along with the city ’s other green policies , would survive even the worst opposition or budget cuts .
“ Money is an excuse , ” he said .
“ It ’s never the problem .
Money always follows great ideas . ”
It ’s a good thing he ’s confident , because homes like Wilson ’s do n’t come cheap : Greening La Casa cost her several million dollars .
Wilson , a local green contractor who began remodeling the house in 2006 , says she ’s aware that the price tag is not for everyone .
What she wanted , she says , was to give people an idea of what was possible , an inspiration .
“ I want people to be able to pick and choose what works for them , ” she said .
Newsom , meanwhile , said that the city plans to find a way to make green choices affordable , through a combination of financial incentives as well as a carbon tax that he will place on the ballot in November .
Going green makes financial sense , he said , and businesses know it .
“ This is going to be mandated very soon , ” he said .
“ In 15 years , you ’re not going to be able to build in San Francisco without doing everything she ’s done and more . ”

April 14 , 2008  --
At 39 months in the doghouse , George W. Bush has surpassed Harry Truman 's record as the postwar president to linger longest without majority public approval .
Bush has n't received majority approval for his work in office in ABC News / Washington Post polls since Jan. 16 , 2005 — three years and three months ago .
The previous record was Truman 's during his last 38 months in office .
Truman 's problems included both economic recession and the war in Korea , which , in October 1952 , 56 percent of Americans said was not worth fighting .
Bush 's approval , likewise , has suffered overwhelmingly because of the unpopular war in Iraq ; his job rating correlates almost perfectly with views of the war .
In the latest ABC / Post poll , just 33 percent of Americans approve of Bush 's work , a point from his career - low 32 percent earlier this year .
Sixty - four percent disapprove , with those who " strongly " disapprove outnumbering strong approvers by a 3 - 1 margin .
The president 's rating has been remarkably stable — 32 or 33 percent approval in the last nine national ABC / Post polls , comprising nearly 10,000 interviews since July .
Indeed , Bush has n't exceeded 36 percent approval since November 2006 .
His rating specifically on handling the war in Iraq is equally poor — 33 percent approve , 65 percent disapprove — and on the economy it 's even worse , with a record 70 percent disapproval .
GROUPS — All of Bush 's ratings are marked by sharp partisanship .
Just 7 percent of Democrats approve of his work overall ( a point from the low in this group ) compared with 74 percent of Republicans .
( Fewer Republicans , 59 percent , approve of his work on the economy , a career low . )
Indeed Bush 's ratings have been more partisan on average than those of any president in ABC / Post polls dating to 1981 — slightly more so than Bill Clinton 's and Ronald Reagan's , and especially more so than Bush 's father's .
( Specifically , there 's been an average 57 - point gap between Democrats and Republicans in their ratings of Bush , compared with 54 points for Clinton , 50 points for Reagan and 34 points for Bush 's father . )
Among Bush 's lowest ratings in overall approval are 8 percent among strong opponents of the war , 9 percent of African - Americans and 17 percent of liberals ; his highs , beyond Republicans , include 75 percent of war supporters and 77 percent among the few who say the economy 's in good shape .
In a larger group , conservatives , 56 percent approve .
The balance , as often is the case in U.S. politics , is tipped by the political center .
Just 27 percent of independents and 23 percent of moderates approve of his job performance , the latter a career low for the president .
YEAR to YEAR — Bush 's year - to - year ratings help tell the tale .
Bolstered by his response to 9/11 , he averaged 72 percent approval in 2001 , 74 percent in 2002 and 62 percent in 2003 — 66 in the first half of that year , but 56 percent in the second half as the war in Iraq continued .
As the war went on , Bush 's ratings fell further — to an average 50 percent in 2004 ( remaining just high enough for him to win re-election ) , 46 percent in 2005 , 39 percent in 2006 and 34 percent in 2007 .
He 's averaged 33 percent so far this year .
Three other postwar presidents have gone lower than Bush 's career - low 32 percent — Truman at 22 percent ; Richard Nixon , 24 percent ; and Jimmy Carter , 28 percent .
Similarly , just two presidents have seen lower full - year averages than Bush 's in 2007 — Nixon and Truman .
HIGHS and AVERAGES —
There 's some irony in the fact that Bush , now record holder for the longest period below majority approval , also holds the highest approval rating — 92 percent in an ABC / Post poll a month after the 9/11 attacks , unsurpassed in polling by ABC News since 1981 and by Gallup before it since December 1943 .
The next highest rating was Bush 's father 's , at 90 percent during the 1991 Persian Gulf War ; third was Truman — irony again — at 87 percent in June 1945 , a month after VE Day .
Boosted by his pre-2004 ratings , Bush 's average approval rating across his career is 51 percent .
But he 's still in the lower tier of postwar presidents .
In the top rank are John Kennedy , Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush , with average ratings of 71 , 65 and 63 percent , respectively .
In the middle , Reagan , Clinton and Lyndon Johnson , at 57 , 57 and 56 percent .
And in the lower tier , Bush ( so far ) , Nixon , Gerald Ford , Truman and Carter , with career averages ranging from 46 to 51 percent .
METHODOLOGY — This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone April 10 - 13 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,197 adults , including an oversample of African - Americans for a total of 213 and an oversample of Catholics for a total of 292 ( both weighted to their correct share of the national population ) .
The results have a 3 - point error margin for the full sample .

To my sisters planning to vote for McCain
June 10 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
I realize it hurts that Hillary did n’t get the nomination , especially after all of the early media attention that said she was the inevitable candidate .
It was a historical moment on its own , providing clear evidence of the cultural shift that finally allowed a woman to become known as the most credible candidate for the Democratic ticket .
I realize that she was going to vindicate every woman , create a victory for every female held back and left behind by this sexist culture of ours .
She called much - needed attention to the inequalities faced by women in America and the unfulfilled promises of liberty and justice for all .
Now the internet is ablaze with former Hillary supporters promising to either vote for McCain , to not vote at all or to write in Hillary on election day .
As a woman , from my heart to yours , I ask you to remember why you supported Hillary in the first place .
You care about the plight of women , you are sick and tired of being treated like a second - class citizen , you want change to come and you want it now .
I ask you to consider how staying home on election day , writing Hillary in or voting for McCain abandons that clarion call .
Will you work further destruction on your sisters and daughters in order to protest Hillary ’s loss of the nomination ?
Will you work to secure a darker future for all women , now that your first choice is no longer available ?
The Guardian reports on June 5 , 2008 that McCain “ has promised to appoint only conservative judges to the supreme court – a key aspiration of anti-abortionists , ” and he “ has said he favours a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in almost all cases . ”
The current alignment of the Supreme Court is already grim when it comes to the most fundamental tenet of female equality – that we have the right to choose our own destiny .
It is likely that the next President will have at least one opportunity to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court .
We risk a return to the incomprehensible days of when women were legally considered second - class citizens , deprived of control over their own bodies and forced to seek unsafe methods to terminate a pregnancy .
If you are a supporter of women ’s rights , I do n’t have to convince you of how real this threat is .
There are a multitude of other policy issues that McCain supports that are contrary to the interests of women in general and the country as a whole .
For example , “ in April , he skipped a Senate vote on giving women equal pay for equal work , arguing that it would encourage litigation .
He has opposed every attempt to raise the minimum wage since it was last increased in 1997 . ”
But that is only the beginning : “ McCain has voted to restrict union rights across the US , has backed cuts in health provision for the elderly , supports the burden of health insurance being taken away from employers and put on the shoulders of individuals . ”
There is also the abundant evidence concerning McCain ’s personal character , which at its core appears to be the definition of sexism and misogyny .
Let ’s not forget the “ joke he told to a Republican fund - raiser at the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal : “ Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly ? ” he japed .
“ Because her father is Janet Reno . ” ”
Apparently , that is the nature of McCain ’s sense of humor .
Then there is this report , confirmed by three journalists :
McCain ’s wife Cindy was playfully twiddling with his hair one day .
“ You ’re getting a little thin up there , ” she said .
McCain grew red in the face and replied : “ At least I do n’t plaster on the makeup like a trollop , you cunt . ”
Whether you vote for him , for Hillary or do n’t vote at all , you abandon the rights and future of women to a man who ca n’t even provide basic respect to his current wife .
It is also important to look beyond the reports of his hateful comments to his reported life choices , including how he has treated his first wife .
McCain ’s conduct to his first wife has been described as “ brutal , ” and he has confirmed that he cheated on her while she recuperated from a terrible car accident that left her disfigured for life .
She forgives him , but can you ?
On behalf of all women , can you support a man like this ?
If you are true to the reasons you supported Hillary , if you truly care about the fate of women in America , then it is time to let go of the disappointment and frustration that Hillary did n’t make it this year .
If you support McCain by your affirmative vote or refusal to cast one for Obama , understand that it will appear that the only possible justification for your abandonment of women is that it is far more important to keep a nigger out of the White House .
I could n’t possibly offend you with my use of that horrible word .
The fate of women is not your true concern if you now support John McCain for President .
Obama is the candidate who will work hard for the equality of all people , his record and policies make that clear .
To abandon Obama and the Democratic Party in order to support John McCain leads to but one conclusion : you are willing to sacrifice freedom and equality for all women before you let a nigger hold the highest office .
I say that horrible word again because I ’m trying to speak in a language you might understand .
Do n’t think for a moment that your racism is n’t shining through every shrill promise you make to work against Obama .
Your motives are obvious if you try to claim that your support for McCain is a protest on behalf of women ’s rights .
Obama speech confronts America 's racial divide Bold address seen as watershed moment - but risky campaign maneuver

Democrat Barack Obama , who has catapulted to stardom as the first major African American candidate for president , took the boldest risk of his political career Tuesday by confronting head - on the matter of race relations in America - an issue that suddenly threatens to derail his White House bid .
Obama 's speech in Philadelphia called on America to break the " racial stalemate " that has long divided the country .
It produced widespread agreement among political observers that it was a defining moment in the campaign , one that underscored what sets the Illinois senator apart - ethnically , politically and oratorically - from the rest of the presidential pack .
But it was less clear whether American voters - ethnics , whites and working class in key states like Pennsylvania - would embrace the frankness of a discussion in which Obama said he could n't denounce his mentor and former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , while acknowledging he had heard controversial sermons in the pew of his Chicago church .
Political insiders , preachers and academics who have examined the issues of race , politics and religion say that whether Americans accept or appreciate his candor will become clear over the coming days .
But many suggest that Obama 's gutsy and heartfelt appeal will be remembered as a watershed in American presidential politics .
In the speech , delivered just a stone 's throw from where the Declaration of Independence was drafted and signed , Obama said he would no more disown Wright for racially oriented comments from the pulpit than he would disown his white grandmother for her own occasional insensitivity and racism .
" These people are part of America , " Obama said .
" What we know , what we have seen , is that America can change . "
Obama advisers said he wrote the deeply personal speech himself .
They said it was delivered in Philadelphia because of the city 's historical significance , not because it is the most populous black city in Pennsylvania , site of the next primary vote on April 22 .
Rage acknowledged
James Taylor , associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco , where he teaches classes on politics , race and civil rights , said Obama 's speech acknowledged what has been simply unmentionable before , that " there 's a certain rage ... in dealing with the grievances that different segments of society have . "
Obama 's pastor Wright " was part of a generation who had to sit in the back of buses , " and while many whites still say that " slavery was 150 years ago , leave it alone , " Obama pointed out that " there 's still a lot of people who have lived the experiences ( of segregation and racial prejudice ) and were traumatized by it , " Taylor said .
Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown said those comments showed that Obama " took the issue of race in the world on ... he personalized it in a way that made it believable - and he got away from what could have been a fatal liability for him . "
" You 're never going to be able to get rid of race as an issue , period .
It 's crazy to think that , " said Brown , who addressed his own issues of race and culture in " Basic Brown , " his recently published memoir .
Still , the man once known as the powerful " ayatollah " when he was speaker of the California Assembly noted that until recently , Obama 's campaign looked to be blind to the potential damage from Wright 's incendiary comments in the pulpit at Chicago 's Trinity United Church of Christ , where Obama has worshiped for 20 years .
' A maturing moment '
But by speaking frankly to both black and white Americans about his experiences as a biracial man in racially divided America , Obama delivered " a real maturing moment , " Brown said .
Garry South , who was a senior adviser to the presidential campaign of Democratic Sen .
Joe Lieberman - an Orthodox Jew who also faced questions about his religious and cultural beliefs on a national stage - said Obama 's " candor , bluntness and reasoning " were the backbone for an address that " has the potential to be a game - changer in the race . "
" He took a development that could have derailed his candidacy and turned it around in a brilliant and stunning way , " South said .
" This is the stuff that presidential leadership is made of .
No other candidate for president in the history of America could have given this speech , and the historical nature of it should be striking to Americans . "
" Every American schoolkid - indeed , every American , regardless of race - should be required to read this speech , " he said .
Obama 's long - time pastor became a major issue after video clips appeared on the Internet showing Wright , in a booming voice from his Chicago pulpit , suggesting that Americans were partly to blame for the Sept. 11 attacks , and accusing the country of continuing to treat African Americans as second - class citizens .
Hard to navigate
The Rev. Amos Brown , whose passionate sermons in San Francisco also have stirred controversy , cautioned that discussions about the issues Obama addressed Tuesday are particularly hard to navigate because they raise the matter of a cultural as well as a racial divide .
Brown , pastor of San Francisco 's Third Baptist Church , made headlines after Sept. 11 , 2001 , when he gave a soul - searching sermon criticized by political leaders , including Rep. Nancy Pelosi .
But he said that , like Wright , his comments also were widely misunderstood ; he said he intended not to assign blame but to engage in a broad discussion of America 's political and leadership role in the world .
" Black preaching is engaged , passionate , and those who do n't know it and never heard it would be offended , " Amos Brown said .
In his own sermon , he said , " I raised questions : America , what did you do to invite this kind of activity upon us ? "
But many Americans outside such traditional congregations " do n't understand that in the black church , traditional funerals are not just for mourning , " he said .
" They are an occasion not just to honor the dead but give a challenge to the living . "
Obama 's weaknesses
Still , Shelby Steele , a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University - and author of " A Bound Man : Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win " - wrote this week that the controversies surrounding Obama 's relationship with Wright underscore his biggest weaknesses .
" What could he have been thinking ?
Of course , he was n't thinking , " Steele wrote in a piece in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday .
" But now the floodlight of a presidential campaign has been trained on this usually hidden corner of contemporary black life : a mindless indulgence in a rhetorical anti-Americanism as a way of bonding and of asserting one 's blackness , " Steele wrote .
" Yet Jeremiah Wright , splashed across America 's television screens , has shown us that there is no real difference between rhetorical hatred and real hatred . "
But the Rev. J. Alfred Smith Sr. , longtime leader of Oakland 's Allen Temple Baptist Church - and an Obama supporter - said the Illinois senator accomplished a major feat .
" The purpose of the speech was to deal with the broader issue of race , which the country has not been willing to face , " he said .
" He was endeavoring to get people to look at race not specifically as it relates to Jeremiah Wright ... but as it relates to the issue of justice :
Why do we have disparities in education , in employment , in health ? "
" He talked about how race is exploited to produce division ... and how politicians have exploited race to produce fear in order to get elected , " Smith said .
" He pointed out that his mother is white , his grandmother is white , and his daddy is black . "
" If there 's anybody who can understand both sides , he can , " said Smith .
" And he has refused to play the race card himself . "
( CNN ) --
In the face of mounting controversy over headline - grabbing statements from the Rev. John Hagee , CNN has learned that presumptive Republican nominee John McCain decided Thursday to reject his endorsement .
McCain later also repudiated the support of Rod Parsley , an Ohio preacher who has called Islam an inherantly violent religion .
McCain told CNN's Brian
Todd that he rejected Hagee 's endorsement after Todd brought to his attention Hagee 's comments that Adolf Hitler had been fulfilling God 's will by hastening the desire of Jews to return to Israel in accordance with biblical prophecy .
" God says in Jeremiah 16 : ' Behold , I will bring them the Jewish people again unto their land that I gave to their fathers .
...
Behold , I will send for many fishers , and after will I send for many hunters .
And they the hunters shall hunt them . '
That would be the Jews .
...
Then God sent a hunter .
A hunter is someone who comes with a gun and he forces you .
Hitler was a hunter , " Hagee said , according to a transcript of his sermon .
In a statement to CNN on Thursday , McCain said " Obviously , I find these remarks and others deeply offensive and indefensible , and I repudiate them .
I did not know of them before Rev. Hagee 's endorsement , and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well . "
Watch how the Hagee endorsement unraveled »
Shortly after McCain 's announcement Thursday afternoon , Hagee withdrew his endorsement , citing critics who had been " grossly misrepresenting " his positions .
" I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues .
I have therefore decided to withdraw my endorsement of Sen.
McCain for president effective today , and to remove myself from any active role in the 2008 campaign , " he said in a statement .
" I hope that the Sen. McCain will accept this withdrawal so that he may focus on the issues that are most important to America and the world . "
McCain also said that his relationship with Hagee did not compare with Sen. Barack Obama 's lengthy association with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , whose own inflammatory comments remain , for some Republicans , a persistent campaign issue even though Obama has denounced his former minister .
" I have said I do not believe Sen. Obama shares Rev. Wright 's extreme views .
But let me also be clear , Rev .
Hagee was not and is not my pastor or spiritual adviser , and I did not attend his church for 20 years .
I have denounced statements he made immediately upon learning of them , as I do again today , " McCain said .
The Arizona senator had renounced comments from Hagee that termed the Catholic Church " the great whore " and " an apostate church . "
Hagee is pastor of a 19,000 - member evangelical church in San Antonio , Texas , and founder of a global Christian broadcast network .
In a statement released before McCain rejected his endorsement , Hagee said his words had been taken out of context .
" The intentional mischaracterization of my statements by an Internet journalist seeking to use me as a political football in the upcoming presidential race is a gross example of bias at its worst .
I will not stand idly by while my character is assassinated and my views on the Holocaust are grossly distorted .
" To assert that I in any way condone the Holocaust or that monster Adolf Hitler is the biggest and ugliest of lies .
I have always condemned the horrors of the Holocaust in the strongest of terms . "
He also pointed to millions of dollars worth of donations his ministry had made to humanitarian efforts in Israel .
Hagee has been a strong supporter of Israel for years .
One prominent Jewish group does not believe that the pastor is anti-Semitic but is deeply concerned with the comments .
" The notion that the Holocaust was part of God 's plan ... as a way of punishing the Jews is a deeply , deeply troubling ... assertion to be repudiated by all people of conscience , " said Rabbi David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism .
With his fellow Republican candidates trying to cast him as too liberal this year , McCain aggressively courted Christian conservative leaders to bolster his credentials with the GOP 's base .
The impact on the self - styled maverick 's standing among conservatives remains in question , with exit polling suggesting that the GOP 's most conservative voters remain uneasy with him .
Candidates who have suspended their campaigns , such as former Arkansas governor and Baptist minister Mike Huckabee , still poll in double digits .
And Hagee is not McCain 's only religious backer whose comments have sparked controversy .
McCain has faced pressure to distance himself from the Rev. Rod Parsley over the minister 's statement that Islam was " an antichrist religion that intends through violence to conquer the world . "
The Council on American - Islamic Relations is calling on McCain to repudiate Parsley 's endorsement .
A McCain spokesman says the senator rejects the remarks and adds that it 's entirely inconsistent with what McCain believes .
But the campaign is not rejecting the endorsement at the moment .
CNN 's Brian Todd , Dugald McConnell , Ed Hornick and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .
All About John McCain • Jeremiah Wright • The Roman Catholic Church
They are quite rare events but on occasion , artists actually encourage fans to share their music online .
Singer Joss Stone has no problem doing so at all .
In fact , after a recent concert in Argentina she said that piracy is " brilliant " .
Joss Stone , who won a Grammy last year , loves music , but hates the the music industry .
In a recent interview she said that – unlike herself – most artists are brainwashed by the industry , and she encouraged people to share her music .
After the show a reporter asked her what she thinks of piracy , and people who download her songs off the Internet .
Her response baffled the reporter , as she simply told him : “ I think it ’s great … ”
There was an awkward silence for a few seconds , the reporter probably expected to hear something else from her .
“ Great ? , ” he said .
“ Yeah , I love it .
I think it ’s brilliant and I ’ll tell you why , ” Stone continued .
“ Music should be shared . [… ]
The only part about music that I dislike is the business that is attached to it .
Now , if music is free , then there is no business , there is just music .
So , I like it , I think that we should share . ”
“ It ’s ok , if one person buys it , it ’s totally cool , burn it up , share it with your friends , I do n’t care .
I do n’t care how you hear it as long as you hear it .
As long as you come to my show , and have a great time listening to the live show it ’s totally cool .
I do n’t mind .
I ’m happy that they hear it . ”
Stone went on to say that most artists have probably been “ brainwashed ” by the record labels , when they discourage their fans from downloading music .
Of course , Stone is not the only artist who actually wants people to share their work .
Last year rapper 50 Cent made some positive remarks about filesharing , and Nine Inch Nails takes it even further , as they upload their music onto BitTorrent sites themselves .
These artists are spot on , in fact , several studies have shown that artists actually benefit from filesharing .
The more music people share , the more CDs they buy and the more concerts they visit .
Introduction
An infinite sum of the form
( 1 )
is known as an infinite series .
Such series appear in many areas of modern mathematics .
Much of this topic was developed during the seventeenth century .
Leonhard Euler continued this study and in the process solved many important problems .
In this article we will explain Euler ’s argument involving one of the most surprising series .
You are likely to have already met perhaps the most important series which is the geometric progression .
Given constants and we want to sum
( 2 )
If we can make sense of the infinite sum – something known by Newton – which is
( 3 )
This was one of the first , and only , general results known during the seventeenth century .
Another series then known was
( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 )
Similar methods were used to find the sums
( 8 )
Now all these series converge .
That is to say we can make sense of the infinite sum as a finite number .
This is not true of a particularly famous series which is known as the harmonic series :
( 9 )
The following medieval proof that the harmonic series diverges was discovered and published by a French monk called Orseme around 1350 and relies on grouping the terms in the series as follows :
( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 )
The harmonic series diverges
It follows that the sum can be made as large as we please by taking enough terms .
In fact this series diverges quite slowly .
A more accurate estimate of the speed of divergence can be made using the following more modern proof .
This uses a technique known as the integral test which compares the graph of a function with the terms of the series .
By integrating the function using calculus we can compare the sum of the series with the integral of the function and draw conclusions from this .
In this case we compare terms in the series with the area under the graph of the function .
In particular , figure 1 shows that
( 13 )
Figure 1 : The series 1/n above the graph of 1/( 1+x )
( 14 )
( 15 )
Figure 2 : The series 1/n below the graph of 1/x
The harmonic series generalised
( 16 )
( 17 )
( 18 )
( 19 )
Of course the integral on the right is easy .
Solving this givesNow , the functionis unbounded .
By this we mean that there is no limit to how big we can make it by taking sufficiently large values of .
So we can makeas large as we please .
A similar argument comparing the series to the functionshows thatso that we can estimate how fast the series diverges .
The harmonic series can be described as " the sum of the reciprocals of the natural numbers " .
Another series that presents itself as being similar is the " the sum of the squares of reciprocals of the natural numbers " .
That is to say , the series
The first question we ask is " Does this series converge ? " .
If it does we next ask " What is the sum ? " .
To answer the first question we notice thatand soand comparing with terms in the series ( 4 ) that we encountered earlier gives that

Euler 's solution to the Basel Problem
Leonhard Euler
The series converges , but the exact value of the sum proves hard to find .
Jakob Bernoulli considered it and failed to find it .
So did Mengoli and Leibniz .
Finding the sum became known as theand we concentrate on Euler 's solution for the rest of this article .
Before solving this problem we look briefly at a piece of theory Euler used which allowed him to write the functionin a particular way .
This really could ( or perhaps should ) be the subject of an article in its own right .
What Euler knew , as as we will see in a moment , is thatcan be written as an " infinite polynomial " in the following way :
This is called a power series forbecause it is a series in terms of powers of .
You may be aware that you can approximatewhenis small .
This just uses the first term in the series above .
You can get better approximations toasandby taking successive terms .
Most other functions , such asetc. have power series .
It is series such as these that your pocket calculator uses to calculate numerical values .
In formula ( 20 ) is in radians not degrees and it would not be nearly so beautiful ifwas an angle in degrees .
In fact , one of the reasons we choose to use radians is because this allows us to write the formula in this way .
Euler was working on the Basel Problem at the age of 24 in 1731 by calculating a numerical approximation .
This is an arduous task by hand with a series which converges as slowly as this .
In 1735 he arrived at the following exact result :
( 23 )
This is a truly remarkable result .
No one expected the value , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter , to appear in the formula for the sum .
Euler starts with an th degree polynomial with the following properties :
has non-zero roots , .
Then may be written as a product in the following form :
( 24 )
We paraphrase Euler ’s next claim as " what holds for a finite polynomial holds for an infinite polynomial " .
He applies this claim to the polynomial
( 25 )
which is an infinite polynomial with .
Furthermore , as Euler knew , can be written as a series :
( 26 )

This has zeros at for since these are the zeros of .
We can now use the claim above and write as an infinite product and equate the two as

The second line pairs the positive and negative roots – the last line uses the difference of two squares to combine these .
If you do n’t believe this can be done you are right to question the logic here !
Euler is being incredibly bold in his assertion that " what holds for a finite polynomial holds for an infinite polynomial " .
His use turns out to give the correct answer in this case !
Euler ’s trick is to write in two different ways .
He exploits this by expanding the right hand side .
This infinite product will be very complicated but there will be a constant term and one can collect the term without too much effort as follows :
( 31 )
Now Euler equates the coefficients of to conclude that
( 32 )
which gives
( 33 )
Now Euler did n’t stop here – he expanded the product further and equated other coefficients to sum other series .
In this way he obtained

In 1744 he obtained

by this method .
In principle his method solves

This is the story of all Palestinians
Message from Mona ( a Jerusalemite ) :
Dear Friends and Family ,
I am writing to share a little about what is happening in my life lately .
As most of you know , I have been in Jerusalem since March 18 with Ramzi who at the time had barely turned 5 months .
We left Habib and made the sacrifice to be apart for the coming 4 months for the sake of preserving my Jerusalem ID , to keep my residency status .
I know this might sound strange , but as a Palestinian who has lived her whole life in Jerusalem , and despite the fact that my family has lived in Jerusalem and Palestine for centuries , according to the Israeli law , Palestinians living in Jerusalem are only residents but not necessarily permanent residents , and therefore are at risk all the time of losing their residency rights .
For the past 3 years , I have been married to Habib , a Palestinian by blood but an American by citizenship , because Habib ’s Jerusalem residency was revoked in 2004 - although Habib was born in Jerusalem , and has lived there until his adult life .
Anyways , now it was my turn to renew my entry visa to “ Israel ” ( yes , I needed a visa in my own country ) - I met with a lawyer who asked for a substantial amount to help me renew my entry visa , which would preserve my residency until the next time I have to renew ( a maximum of 3 years ) , but this time the Israelis refused to renew it and instead told me that since I made the decision to marry an “ American ” , who ca n’t reside in Jerusalem , I have made a decision to seek residency in a foreign country and am therefore “ choosing ” to abandon my residency rights in Jerusalem .
( Palestinians are not allowed to have dual residency or citizenship , a law that is not applicable to Israelis who are able to hold dual or multiple citizenships . )
To make a long story short , I lost my residency rights in my own country !!!!
I can only go back to visit as a tourist , and have to acquire a tourist visa from the Israeli embassy !!
The ironic thing is that all my family still live there !!
But I can never join them , I do n’t have a choice in the matter .
We , the people of the land are being thrown out ( !!!)
Do n’t e surprised , if you look into your dictionary for the synonym of Zionism that would , in one way and another , what it is !
On my way back from the lawyer ’s office , I was stopped by Israeli soldiers who asked to see my papers - they spoke Russian - I thought to myself , these immigrants know nothing of this land they are serving and protecting - they do n’t even know the language -
They come from Russia , Europe , Africa , the US , and other places and choose to reside in my country - and they can !!!!
Not only that but they can limit my movement in my country , and even kick me out of it !
When I complained to my lawyer about this injustice he simply answered , “ Mona , this is occupation !!! ”
Not at all the legal answer I was looking for at - there is no human law that can protect me , or preserve my rights .
Needless to say , I have lost my right to return , to my country ….. to the only country I ever belonged to , the only place I ever called home .
As an adult who has been living under occupation for the past 33 years , I was upset but I ca n’t say that I was surprised by what happened to me .
However , what surprised me was what is happening with my 7 month old , Ramzi .
Ramzi was born in the US and therefore got an American passport .
Although he is the son of two full blooded Palestinians who call Jerusalem and Palestine home , he was denied residency rights in Jerusalem and was given a tourist visa .
I asked the lady at the airport when we first arrived if she could give Ramzi ( then 5 months old ) a 4 month Visa , rather than the traditional 3 month visa , I showed her my residency card ( at the time I still was considered a resident ) , and showed her our return plane tickets .
She said no , and said that I should apply for an extension for Ramzi at the ministry of interior .
To avoid conflict and to make my life easier I asked the lawyer to apply for an extension for Ramzi ….. to my surprise Ramzi was denied .
The Israeli government refused to grant a 7 month old baby an extension on his visa , not even with the help of our lawyer and all his connections !!!
So , now I have to face the choice of leaving with Ramzi early and change our vacation plans , or stay with Ramzi here as planned until July 25th , and have my 7 month old be illegally overstaying his welcome in the land of his ancestors .
The ironic thing is that this poor little baby can’t even say mama or baba , yet he is pausing a security threat to Israel that they denied him a one month extension on his visa !!
So now , my little family of three are added to the millions of Palestinians who lost their right to reside in their country and have been kicked out of their homes .
We now are residents of Las Vegas , but I will always refer to Palestine as my home .
Since the 1948 diaspora of our people , the Palestinians in the world have been waiting for a just solution , that would give them the right to return to their homeland , and now 60 years later the list gets longer everyday with people just like the 3 of us who were driven out of our country .
I will never give up the hope that one day I would have the choice to live in Palestine , and I will make sure that Ramzi also knows that he has a right to return !
Mona

“ The ( joint ) development plan for North Tapti is nearing finalisation and is expected to be placed before the ONGC board shortly . ”
Pratim Ranjan Bose
Kolkata , June 29 Cairn India and ONGC ( Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ) have near - finalised the plan for joint development of Ambe and North Tapti offshore marginal gas fields in the Gujarat coast .
According to sources , the project will lead to natural gas production of 1.5 million metric standard cubic metre a day ( mmscmd ) from Cairn operated Ambe field and 2 mmscmd by ONGC ’s North Tapti .
The entire production of 3.5 mmscmd gas and associated oil will be processed at Cairn ’s existing operations at Hazira .
ONGC and Cairn have opted for the joint development route to optimise the investment in pipeline , processing and other infrastructure in these marginal fields .
Ambe is a satellite gas field of Cairn ( 40 per cent ) operated CB / OS - 2 joint venture in Cambay basin .
The other partners in the joint venture are ONGC and Tata Petrodyne .
The satellite field , discovered in 2001 , is surrounded by ONGC ’s North Tapti .
According to sources , the Cairn - operated joint venture has already pegged the estimated cost of developing Ambe at approximately Rs 300 crore .
ONGC may have to pump in Rs 500 - 600 crore for development of North Tapti .
When contacted , ONGC sources admitted that they were moving ahead with the plan to jointly develop the North Tapti field .
“ The ( joint ) development plan for North Tapti is nearing finalisation and is expected to be placed before the ONGC board shortly , ” a company source told Business Line .
ONGC proposes to build two platforms in North Tapti for production of 2 - 2.2 mmscmd gas and associated oil , which will be connected to Cairn ’s existing pipeline network for processing at Hazira .
While comments were not available from Cairn , industry sources said that the CB / OS2 JV would develop one production platform at Ambe .
Apart from gas , the field was expected to produce 7,000 barrels of oil and condensate .
According to a Cairn announcement in April , the CB / OS - 2 JV is currently producing a little more than 1 mmscmd ( 36 million standard cubic feet a day ) of natural gas and 10,000 barrels of oil from Lakshmi , Gauri and CB - X fields .
The offshore Lakhsmi and Gauri are ageing fields and are on a declining phase of production .
CB -X is an onshore marginal field .
Self Protecting Global Offset Table ( GOT )
http://em386.blogspot.com
24 August 2008
Draft Version 1.4
Introduction
This paper describes a simple technique for Executable Linkable Format ( ELF ) objects to protect themselves from a potential exploitation technique of unknown vulnerabilities by marking specific pages read - only from user space virtual memory .
This technique requires no kernel patching or third party programs .
GOT protection already exists in the form of PT_RELRO marked program headers and can be achieved using the GNU Linker ( ld ) flag -z and the keyword ' relro ' .
However sometimes these features may not be available on your target platform , and sometimes it may be worth exploring other ways to achieve them .
That is the purpose of this paper , to explore another way to implement a read - only Global Offset Table .
It is assumed that the reader possesses some knowledge of C , ELF , binutils and the Linux operating system .
All research was performed on a modern Ubuntu Linux 8.04 ( Hardy Heron ) operating system .
Also it should be noted that this article mentions two different ' linkers ' .
One is the GNU linker ( ld ) which is generates ELF objects at compile time .
The other is the dynamic linker ( ld - linux ) which is used at runtime .
Constructor Functions ( ctors )
A constructor function in basic terms is a function that runs prior to another function .
The term ' constructors ' is usually associated with C++ programs .
Classes usually execute constructors upon the creation of a new instance .
However generic constructors are entirely possible to implement in C using a GCC attribute :
__attribute__(( constructor ) ) void foo_func ( )
The function foo_func ( ) will execute before main ( )
We can test this with a simple program :
# cat test.c __attribute__(( constructor ) ) void foo_func ( ) { printf ( " Hello from foo_func
" ) ; } int main ( ) { printf ( " Hello from main
" ) ; return 0 ; } # gcc -o test test . c # ./test Hello from foo_func Hello from main
You can read more about GCC attributes here http://www.ohse.de/uwe/articles/gcc-attributes.html.
The technique covered in this paper occurs in a constructor function that is executed before main ( ) .
This allows our protection code to be added to preexisting code bases without any major modifications .
Despite our protection functions being executed before main ( ) there are certain things in memory we simply cannot alter .
If our protections become to invasive we run into runtime errors , which creates stability issues .
Just like full kernel level protections such as PAX and Exec - Shield , we want to avoid disrupting program runtimes at all costs .
Runtime GOT PLT Protection
The GOT ( Global Offset Table ) is used by dynamically linked ELF objects .
The ELF 1.2 specification states the following about the ELF relocation process :
" Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with symbolic definitions .
For example , when a program calls a function , the associated call instruction must transfer control to the proper destination address at execution .
In other words , relocatable files must have information that describes how to modify their section contents , thus allowing executable and shared object files to hold the right information for a process 's program image .
Relocation entries are these data . "
If you want to read more about dynamic ELF relocation I have written a decent overview on my blog .
By default on modern Linux systems relocation is done the lazy way ( RTLD_LAZY ) by the dynamic linker ( ld- linux ) .
What this means is a function 's location is only looked up when that function is first called .
Every function in a loaded shared library that the program calls has a GOT entry .
The default location in the GOT will point to the dynamic linker itself until the function is called , then the GOT is rewritten with the actual location of the function .
This is mainly for performance reasons .
However the dynamic linker can be forced to lookup the absolute location of all functions when the program is first executed .
The way to force this is using the environment variable LD_BIND_NOW .
Setting it to a non NULL value will force the dynamic linker to lookup all function locations immediately after all shared libraries are loaded and fill in the GOT with the correct values .
The GOT is an easy target for exploit writers .
When an arbitrary 4 byte overwrite is possible anywhere in memory an attacker can overwrite a pointer in the GOT for a function that has not yet been executed , such as exit ( ) .
When the program finally calls exit ( ) it 's PLT entry will reference it's offset in the GOT and use its value as the location of the exit ( ) function .
This is usually overwritten with an attacker supplied function such as system ( ) or an indirect execution of shellcode .
The first implementation of self GOT protection comes in the form of a special constructor function that checks for the LD_BIND_NOW environment variable , locates it 's own GOT in memory and marks the memory segment read - only .
My first implementation did not work too well for various reasons .
For one I was not controlling the location of the GOT , I was simply allowing GCC to compile my test program and place its ELF object data to their default location .
This presented several problems .
For one , calling mprotect ( ) on non page - aligned locations was failing .
It was simply not feasible to mprotect ( ) the ELF base and beyond just to protect the GOT .
There are plenty of other memory segments adjacent to the GOT that MUST be writable such as the .bss segment .
So the first problem becomes quite clear .
If we want to mprotect ( ) the GOT , or any other sensitive memory segments , then we have to group them near a page aligned boundary separate from other segments that must remain writable .
Of course like anything else , there is the easy way to do this and the hard way .
The hard way consists of rewriting the binary , which is necessary for closed source applications , this has the potential to be messy which means we may interfere with our application .
The easy way is to use a GNU linker script to tell the linker how to setup our sections at compile time .
This is of course the preferred method .
The GNU linker ( ld ) has its own interpreted scripting language .
This language is used to write linker files that tell the linker how to create the final object file .
To view the default linker script type the following :
# ld -- verbose GNU ld ( GNU Binutils for Ubuntu ) 2.18.0.20080103 Supported emulations : elf_i386 i386linux elf_x86_64 using internal linker script : ==================================================
/* Script for -z combreloc : combine and sort reloc sections */ OUTPUT_FORMAT ( " elf32-i386 " , " elf32-i386 " , " elf32-i386 " ) OUTPUT_ARCH ( i386 ) ...( output cropped ) ...
For additional linker scripts , most Linux distributions store them in /usr / lib / ldscripts .
The default script is around 197 lines long .
Most open source projects use the default linker script , as it generates a binary with a common layout .
In order to make our self GOT protection technique work we are going to have to create a custom linker script .
One which places sensitive areas of memory where we want them to be .
Preferably on page aligned boundaries so that mprotect ( ) can be used .
Let 's take a quick look at the typical layout of ELF object data in an example program :
# cat test - prog.c # include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < string .h> char global_var [ 256 ] ; int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { char * ptr = NULL ; char buffer [ 128 ] ; ptr = buffer ; if ( argc == 3 ) { strcpy ( ptr , argv [ 1 ] ) ; printf ( " Copied buffer : [ % s ]
" , buffer ) ; strcpy ( ptr , argv [ 1 ] ) ; strncpy ( global_var , argv [ 2 ] , 255 ) ; printf ( " Copied into global_var : [ % s ]
" , global_var ) ; } return 0 ; } # gcc -o test - prog test - prog .c # readelf - Sl test - prog There are 36 section headers , starting at offset 0xe64 : Section Headers : [ Nr ] Name Type Addr Off Size ES Flg Lk Inf Al [ 0 ] NULL 00000000 000000 000000 00 0 0 0 [ 1 ] .interp PROGBITS 08048114 000114 000013 00 A 0 0 1 [ 2 ] .note .

The section header has its own permission markings such as W for write , A for allocate , X for execute and more .
However these are inconsequential to the program once its in memory .
The ELF program header and its correlation to the section header is what we need to look at .
The process of our protection technique is to make sure the dynamic linker has resolved all function locations at process creation and then mark the GOT read only .
As stated before this is not possible yet because the GOT ( .got. plt in our example ) appears to be on the same page as the .bss and other important sections that must be writable .
So we must use our linker script to control where the GOT is placed .
Use the following command to pipe the ld default script to a text file .
# ld -- verbose > ld.txt
Now we want to edit this file .
Make sure to strip all contents above the ' === ' dashed line , these are just comments .
You also want to remove the trailing ' === ' line from the file .
Now around line 136 you should see the '.got ' and '.got.plt ' sections .
We want to change a few lines here that tells the GNU linker where to place the sections .
The following patch accomplishes this by telling the linker to place the .got and .got. plt at least one MAXPAGESIZE beyond the .bss section .

Notice the extra ' ALIGN ( CONSTANT( MAXPAGESIZE ) ) ' expression , this pads our sections at least one page beyond the end of the .bss section .
Now we compile , make sure the sections are placed correctly and test the program .

Notice the .got and .got.plt sections are placed appropriately .
However we still have a problem here , they are still marked RW .
This is where we need to get creative with our constructor function .
Our constructor function has to be able to locate its own GOT in memory and mprotect ( ) it read - only .
The simplest way is by locating its own ELF header in memory , locating the program header for the PT_DYNAMIC segment and using it to find the dynamic DT_PLTGOT entry .
This entry gives us our .got. plt location .
Using a simple ( but hackish ) AND - bitmask we can grab the address the page the .got. plt starts on and mprotect ( ) it accordingly .
My constructor function plus the example code is below and commented in detail .
# cat got - spg.c # include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < string .h> # include < unistd.h > # include < elf.h > # include < errno.h > # include < sys / mman.h >

Our process map above shows the page we marked read - only is being enforced properly .
If an attacker tried to write a pointer value to the GOT during an exploitation attempt it would fail .
Other Protections
So now we have protected our own .got. plt from being written to by attackers .
But what other parts of memory can we protect ?
The .dtors section seems like a good target .
And all we need to do is move its location in the linker script below .got and .got.plt .
What about .rodata ? .jcr ? ctors ? data.rel.ro?
Below is a patch to the default linker script to move these sections .

Conclusion
We can easily turn our constructor function into a simple library that can be linked into any program .
I tested the GOT protection technique on Snort IDS version 2.8.1 .
Below is the output of its ELF section header and its memory mapping .

When run with LD_BIND_NOW environment variable and our constructor function , Snort worked without any runtime issues .
The interesting part about the technique is that it was done without any special dynamic linker support and does not use or depend on its ' - z relro ' option .
Therefore the concept is technically ' portable ' to another ELF based system that uses a different tool set without native protection mechanisms .

Via Campesina
Rome , June 3 , 2008 --
Now that the FAO expects that hunger will affect an extra 100 million people by the end of the year , heads of states and leaders from around the world are gathering in Rome for the FAO " High - Level Conference on World Food Security : the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy " .
The international peasant ’s movement Via Campesina welcomes this sudden high level interest in food and agriculture production , but reminds governments and international institutions that the current climate and food crisis are not the result of any sudden natural disaster .
They are the fruit of decades of policies of trade ``liberalisation '' and of the vertical integration of production , processing and distribution by corporate agriculture .
Therefore , governments today have to take full responsibility for the current crisis and take resolute actions to solve it .
Even though they produce food , most family farmers suffer from the current high food prices alongside urban workers workers .
Many of them do not own the land they farm , they produce for export or to pay off they debt , they work as agricultural workers .
For decades , countries have been forced to open their markets and import food .
They have lost their capacity to feed themselves which has made them excessively dependent on the world market ’s prices .
This has contributed to the recent hunger riots in various parts of the world .
Under the principle of ``free trade '' , food is now considered a commodity like any other , subject to profit taking and financial gambling .
The current price hikes are mainly due to speculation by major traders and investors because food production is now competing with agrofuels which worsen the crisis as does climate change .
Moreover , governments have dismantled the agrarian policites that sustained food production and supported transnational companies producing seeds , pesticides , fertilisers and food to strengthen their control over the food chain .
The development of industrial agriculture has destroyed the environment , over exploited soils and greatly contributed to global warming ( generating from 17.4 % to 32 % of the greenhouse gases ) .
Meanwhile , family farmers have been pushed from their land and driven to poverty .
Based on that experience , farmers and small food producers are now rejecting the promises of the so called ``New Green Revolution ' ' and the ``miracle '' seeds such as the GMOs .
Small family farmers and food producers gathered in the Via Campesina deplore that participation of the civil society at the FAO high level conference is being denied .
They are telling heads of states today that it is past time for governments to focus on small scale sustainable food production and local markets .
This will allow soils to regenerate , conserve fuel and reduce global warming .
It will also give jobs to millions of farmers , fisher - folks , pastoralists and all those who are feeding the people of the world .

The International Fight League ( IFL ) released a statement that its next show at the Izod Center in East Rutherford , N.J. has been canceled because of " financial situations , " signaling perhaps the eventual demise of the struggling mixed martial arts promotion .
In fact , FiveOuncesOfPain.com is reporting that it is " unlikely that the IFL has the funding needed to keep its offices open past October . "
This latest move is designed to create more time -- perhaps six more months -- for the promotion to dig itself out of the financial crater it began digging with its inception back in 2006 .
The goal is to find a partner and to " explore options for maximizing shareholder value " and to " continue to downsize its staff to reduce costs . "
In short , the IFL is looking to sell or land a major investor who can turn the ship around .
In the meantime , its fighters will be able to compete for other promotions if desired .
Here 's a snip :
" The IFL is working with other top MMA organizations to keep its top fighters active in the sport and showcase their talent , while it pursues options that may enable it to continue its MMA operations .
Several IFL athletes will compete on the Adrenaline MMA card in Chicago on June 14 , and announcements with other promoters working with IFL athletes are expected in the near future . "
The IFL 's original concept was in stark contrast to the industry 's biggest player , the Ultimate Fighting Championship , providing a new approach to the business .
The IFL proposed annual salaries and health benefits for its fighters ( as opposed to purses ) and placed the emphasis on teams ( rather than individuals ) as the cornerstones of its business model .
It was one that UFC President Dana White often referred to as the " dumbest on the planet . "
Even though there were some milestones , including television deals with FOX Sports Net and MyNetworkTV , the IFL never was able to capture the attention and interest of fans .
And that 's despite some great events and a talented fighter roster .
Perhaps it was a flawed business model or just the cold hard reality that it is extremely difficult to own and operate a successful and profitable MMA promotion unless it is somehow affiliated with the UFC brand .

Ginger ( centre ) is seen here with two other dogs of her breed A street - sweeping truck has sucked a dog up through its bristles on a New York street , leaving its horrified owner holding nothing but the lead .
Robert Machin , 57 , had just finished walking his two Boston terriers in the Bronx and was about to load them into his car when the truck appeared .
He recalls being whipped around , only to glimpse Ginger meeting her end in the sweeper 's round brushes .
City sanitation officers described the dog's death as " rare and unfortunate " .
But Mr Machin , a retired public transport worker , questioned whether the driver had been observing proper procedures .
The truck , he said , seemed to have been barrelling through the street at an unsafe speed .
Truck chase Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It happened so fast , " he told the New York Daily News .
" It spun me around , and as it spun me around , I caught a last glimpse of her .
" I was devastated .
I was completely dumbfounded and shocked .
I mean , I just witnessed my dog sucked up into a street sweeper . "
He said he had chased the truck for about two and a half blocks , shouting for the operator to stop .
The driver eventually came back but refused to turn off the whirring brushes that had crushed Ginger , until he arrived , the paper adds .
The Department of Sanitation offered its condolences to Mr Machin and his family but added : " It is important for all New Yorkers to remember to maintain the safety of their animals while walking city streets . "
Ginger 's master who , according to the New York Daily News , plans to contact the Humane Society and hire a lawyer , said his lost dog had been like family to him .
" My children are all grown up , " he said .
" These two dogs , they 're my life , " he added , choking back tears .

According to new research presented at the American Public Health Association ’s Annual Meeting & Exposition in Washington , D.C. , 33 percent of the most popular songs of 2005 portrayed substance use .
The study , in which researchers analyzed 279 of the year ’s most popular songs according to Billboard magazine , also found that allusions to substance use varied widely by genre .
Rap music led the way with 77 percent of songs referring to substance use , followed by country at 37 percent and R&B / hip - hop at 20 percent .
Rock and pop were on the lower end of the spectrum at 14 percent and 9 percent , respectively .
Alcohol and marijuana were the substances most frequently portrayed .
Substance use was commonly associated with partying , sex , violence and / or humor , and was most often motivated by peer / social pressure , sex , and / or money ( for instance , through trafficking ) .
The majority of songs with substance use portrayed more positive than negative consequences of use .
“ Previous research has shown that exposure to substance use messages in media is linked to actual substance use in adolescents , ” said Brian A. Primack , MD , EdM , lead researcher on the study .
“ That is why we need to be aware of exposures such as these , especially when they are associated with highly positive consequences and associations . ”
What 's the real federal deficit ?
The federal government keeps two sets of books .
The set the government promotes to the public has a healthier bottom line : a $ 318 billion deficit in 2005 .
The set the government does n't talk about is the audited financial statement produced by the government 's accountants following standard accounting rules .
It reports a more ominous financial picture : a $ 760 billion deficit for 2005 .
If Social Security and Medicare were included — as the board that sets accounting rules is considering — the federal deficit would have been $ 3.5 trillion .
Congress has written its own accounting rules — which would be illegal for a corporation to use because they ignore important costs such as the growing expense of retirement benefits for civil servants and military personnel .
Last year , the audited statement produced by the accountants said the government ran a deficit equal to $ 6,700 for every American household .
The number given to the public put the deficit at $ 2,800 per household .
A growing number of Congress members and accounting experts say it 's time for Congress to start using the audited financial statement when it makes budget decisions .
They say accurate accounting would force Congress to show more restraint before approving popular measures to boost spending or cut taxes .
" We 're a bottom - line culture , and we 've been hiding the bottom line from the American people , " says Rep. Jim Cooper , D - Tenn . , a former investment banker .
" It 's not fair to them , and it 's delusional on our part . "
The House of Representatives supported Cooper 's proposal this year to ask the president to include the audited numbers in his budgets , but the Senate did not consider the measure .
Good accounting is crucial at a time when the government faces long - term challenges in paying benefits to tens of millions of Americans for Medicare , Social Security and government pensions , say advocates of stricter accounting rules in federal budgeting .
" Accounting matters , " says Harvard University law professor Howell Jackson , who specializes in business law .
" The deficit number affects how politicians act .
We need a good number so politicians can have a target worth looking at . "
The audited financial statement — prepared by the Treasury Department — reveals a federal government in far worse financial shape than official budget reports indicate , a USA TODAY analysis found .
The government has run a deficit of $ 2.9 trillion since 1997 , according to the audited number .
The official deficit since then is just $ 729 billion .
The difference is equal to an entire year 's worth of federal spending .
Surplus or deficit ?
Congress and the president are able to report a lower deficit mostly because they do n't count the growing burden of future pensions and medical care for federal retirees and military personnel .
These obligations are so large and are growing so fast that budget surpluses of the late 1990s actually were deficits when the costs are included .
The Clinton administration reported a surplus of $ 559 billion in its final four budget years .
The audited numbers showed a deficit of $ 484 billion .
In addition , neither of these figures counts the financial deterioration in Social Security or Medicare .
Including these retirement programs in the bottom line , as proposed by a board that oversees accounting methods used by the federal government , would show the government running annual deficits of trillions of dollars .
The Bush administration opposes including Social Security and Medicare in the audited deficit .
Its reason : Congress can cancel or cut the retirement programs at any time , so they should not be considered a government liability for accounting purposes .
Policing the numbers
The government 's record - keeping was in such disarray 15 years ago that both parties agreed drastic steps were needed .
Congress and two presidents took a series of actions from 1990 to 1996 that : • Created the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board to establish accounting rules , a role similar to what the powerful Financial Accounting Standards Board does for corporations .
•
Added chief financial officers to all major government departments and agencies .
• Required annual audited financial reports of those departments and agencies .
• Ordered the Treasury Department to publish , for the first time , a comprehensive annual financial report for the federal government — an audited report like those published every year by corporations .
These laws have dramatically improved federal financial reporting .
Today , 18 of 24 departments and agencies produce annual reports certified by auditors .
( The others , including the Defense Department , still have record - keeping troubles so severe that auditors refuse to certify the reliability of their books , according to the government 's annual report . )
The culmination of improved record - keeping is the " Financial Report of the U.S. Government , " an annual report similar to a corporate annual report .
( The 158 - page report for 2005 is available online at fms.treas.gov/fr/index.html. )
The House Budget Committee has tried to increase the prominence of the audited financial results .
When the House passed its version of a budget this year , it included Cooper 's proposal asking Bush to add the audited numbers to the annual budget he submits to Congress .
The request died when the House and Senate could n't agree on a budget .
Cooper has reintroduced the proposal .
The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board , established under the first President Bush in 1990 to set federal accounting rules , is considering adding Social Security and Medicare to the government 's audited bottom line .
Recognizing costly programs
Adding those costs would make federal accounting similar to that used by corporations , state and local governments and large non-profit entities such as universities and charities .
It would show the government recording enormous losses because the deficit would reflect the growing shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare .
The government would have reported nearly $ 40 trillion in losses since 1997 if the deterioration of Social Security and Medicare had been included , according to a USA TODAY analysis of the proposed accounting change .
That 's because generally accepted accounting principles require reporting financial burdens when they are incurred , not when they come due .
For example :
If Microsoft announced today that it would add a drug benefit for its retirees , the company would be required to count the future cost of the program , in today 's dollars , as a business expense .
If the benefit cost $ 1 billion in today 's dollars and retirees were expected to pay $ 200 million of the cost , Microsoft would be required to report a reduction in net income of $ 800 million .
This accounting rule is a major reason corporations have reduced and limited retirement benefits over the last 15 years .
The federal government 's audited financial statement now accounts for the retirement costs of civil servants and military personnel — but not the cost of Social Security and Medicare .
The new Medicare prescription - drug benefit alone would have added $ 8 trillion to the government 's audited deficit .
That 's the amount the government would need today , set aside and earning interest , to pay for the tens of trillions of dollars the benefit will cost in future years .
Standard accounting concepts say that $ 8 trillion should be reported as an expense .
Combined with other new liabilities and operating losses , the government would have reported an $ 11 trillion deficit in 2004 — about the size of the nation 's entire economy .
The federal government also would have had a $ 12.7 trillion deficit in 2000 because that was the first year that Social Security and Medicare reported broader measures of the programs ' unfunded liabilities .
That created a one - time expense .
The proposal to add Social Security and Medicare to the bottom line has deeply divided the federal accounting board , composed of government officials and " public " members , who are accounting experts from outside government .
The six public members support the change .
" Our job is to give people a clear picture of the financial condition of the government , " board Chairman David Mosso says .
" Whether those numbers are good or bad and what you do about them is up to Congress and the administration . "
The four government members , who represent the president , Congress and the Government Accountability Office , oppose the change .
The retirement programs do " not represent a legal obligation because Congress has the authority to increase or reduce social insurance benefits at any time , " wrote Clay Johnson III , then acting director of the president 's Office of Management Budget , in a letter to the board in May .
Ways of accounting
Why the big difference between the official government deficit and the audited one ?
The official number is based on " cash accounting , " similar to the way you track what comes into your checking account and what goes out .
That works fine for paying today 's bills , but it 's a poor way to measure a financial condition that could include credit card debt , car loans , a mortgage and an overdue electric bill .
The audited number is based on accrual accounting .
This method does n't care about your checking account .
It measures income and expenses when they occur , or accrue .
If you buy a velvet Elvis painting online , the cost goes on the books immediately , regardless of when the check clears or your eBay purchase arrives .
Cash accounting lets income and expenses land in different reporting periods .
Accrual accounting links them .
Under cash accounting , a $ 25,000 cash advance on a credit card to pay for a vacation makes the books look great .
You are $ 25,000 richer !
Repaying the credit card debt ?
No worries today .
That will show up in the future .
Under accrual accounting , the $ 25,000 cash from your credit card is offset immediately by the $ 25,000 you now owe .
Your bottom line has n't changed .
An accountant might even make you report a loss on the transaction because of the interest you 're going to pay .
" The problem with cash accounting is that there 's a tremendous opportunity for manipulation , " says University of Texas accounting professor Michael Granof .
" It 's not just that you fool others .
You end up fooling yourself , too . "
Federal law requires that companies and institutions that have revenue of $ 1 million or more use accrual accounting .
Microsoft used accrual accounting when it reported $ 12 billion in net income last year .
The American Red Cross used accrual accounting when it reported a $ 445 million net gain .
Congress used cash accounting when it reported the $ 318 billion deficit last year .
Social Security chief actuary Stephen Goss says it would be a mistake to apply accrual accounting to Social Security and Medicare .
These programs are not pensions or legally binding federal obligations , although many people view them that way , he says .
Social Security and Medicare are pay - as - you go programs and should be treated like food stamps and fighter jets , not like a Treasury bond that must be repaid in the future , he adds .
" A country does n't record a liability every time a kid is born to reflect the cost of providing that baby with a K - 12 education one day , " Goss says .
Tom Allen , who will become the chairman of the federal accounting board in December , says sound accounting principles require that financial statements reflect the economic value of an obligation .
" It 's hard to argue that there 's no economic substance to the promises made for Social Security and Medicare , " he says .
Social Security and Medicare should be reflected in the bottom line because that 's the most important number in any financial report , Allen says .
" The point of the number is to tell the public : Did the government 's financial condition improve or deteriorate over the last year ? " he says .
If you count Social Security and Medicare , the federal government 's financial health got $ 3.5 trillion worse last year .
Rep. Mike Conaway , R - Texas , a certified public accountant , says the numbers reported under accrual accounting give an accurate picture of the government 's condition .
" An old photographer 's adage says , ' If you want a prettier picture , bring me a prettier face , ' " he says .

Due to increased tax receipts , the Bush administration says it 's goal of cutting the federal deficit in half by 2009 is a year ahead of schedule .
But deficit numbers vary depending on who 's counting .
A man walked free from court today after he admitted setting alight an RAF pilot who was dressed as a sheep for a fancy dress party .
Phillip Buckingham , 24 , set fire to the costume made from cotton wool and pillows at a boozy graduation party at the Linton - on - Ouse air base , in North Yorkshire , in November .
His victim , Martin Geraghty , 26 , suffered 13 % burns in the incident , which followed a traditional piano - burning ceremony that dates back to the second world war , Teesside crown court heard .
Buckingham , of Peterborough , in Cambridgeshire , admitted causing grievous bodily harm as part of a " stupid , drunken prank which went very badly wrong " , the court heard .
The judge , Brian Forster , handed him a 12 - month jail sentence , suspended for a year , and ordered him to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and to pay his victim £ 7,500 in compensation .
Buckingham must also pay £ 900 prosecution costs .
Forster said : " It is quite clear from the information available to the court that this was indeed a reckless prank committed in circumstances where you had not considered the consequences of what you were about to do . "
Buckingham , who works in research and development for Anglian Water , was a guest of two trainee pilots at the party , which had a rural theme .
They were watching the piano - burning ceremony and discussed how a member of staff burned his hands jumping over the embers at a previous event , the court heard .
Dan Cordey , prosecuting , said : " It led to a discussion about what would happen to Martin Geraghty if he attempted the feat in his fancy dress costume .
The consensus was it was a stupid idea . "
Buckingham took a lighter from his pocket and set fire to the married father - of - one 's costume .
" The complainant hit out at the defendant in an attempt to get away as the flames caught hold , " Cordey said .
Geraghty threw himself to the ground and rolled on the floor trying to put out the flames while people threw drinks over him .
Buckingham was arrested at the base and in interviews he admitted to having been so drunk he could remember little about the incident .
Geraghty , who was in training at the time , was off work for six weeks but managed to graduate in March despite his injuries , which required skin grafts .
The court heard Buckingham was himself the victim of a bizarre accident some years ago when he lost an eye due to an injury caused by a wallpaper stripper while he was scraping a wall .

A Summary of The Politics of Nonviolent Action : Power and Struggle
By James L. VanHise
When it comes to strategic nonviolence , Gene Sharp is the man .
No one has thought more , spoken more , and written more about the subject .
His magnum opus is The Politics of Nonviolent Action , published in 1973 .
In over 800 pages of heavily footnoted text , Sharp analyzes the technique of nonviolence more methodically and in greater depth than anyone ever has .
All hierarchical systems require the cooperation of people at every level — from the lowliest workers to the highest bureaucrats .
When enough people withdraw their support for a long enough time , the power of the ruler disintegrates .
The Politics of Nonviolent Action is essentially about how this can be most effectively accomplished .
Sharp stresses that strategic nonviolence is not passive , nor is it a way of avoiding conflict .
He sees conflict as necessary and inevitable .
Strategic nonviolence is a method of actively engaging in resistance through carefully planned campaigns of disobedience and disruption .
In this book Sharp makes no attempt to explore the possibilities of using nonviolence for social change or national defense .
Rather , he analyzes nonviolence solely as a technique — the theory behind it , its methods , its dynamics .
Politics is broken down into three volumes the first of which , Power and Struggle , I will review here .
The Nature of Power
Power and Struggle is the smallest of the three volumes ( only a hundred pages ) but is in some ways the most important because it focuses on the nature of power .
The view of power described here is crucial to understanding why nonviolent strategies can be so effective .
Sharp puts forth two ways of looking at the nature of political power .
One is the monolithic model , where people are dependent on their ruler for support .
This model assumes the government is “ … a ‘ given , ’ a strong , independent , durable ( if not indestructible ) , self - reinforcing , and self - perpetuating force . ”
From this point of view , the only means of opposing the power structure is with overwhelmingly destructive force .
This model provides the justification for war and violent revolution .
The monolithic theory of power is only true when both the rulers and the ruled believe it is .
For obvious reasons , this is a conception of power that those with power like to perpetuate .
A more realistic view of political power recognizes that rulers derive their power from those over whom they rule .
The cooperation of those around a ruler is absolutely essential if ( s ) he is to have any power at all .
Without at least the passive support of the general population and his / her agents ( cabinet members , aids , legislative bodies , police , military officers , etc. ) the most powerful dictator in the world becomes just another crackpot with dreams of world domination .
The technique of strategic nonviolence is based on this insight .
Why People Obey
Clearly the question of why people obey is central to understanding the dynamics of political power .
Sharp lists seven reasons :
Habit :
In my opinion habit is the main reason people do not question the actions their “ superiors ” expect of them .
Habitual obedience is embedded in all cultures .
After all , is n’t that what culture is — habitual behavior ?
Fear of sanctions :
It is the fear of sanctions , rather than the sanctions themselves , that is most effective in enforcing obedience .
Moral obligation :
This “ inner constraining power ” is the product of cultural programming and deliberate indoctrination by the state , church and media .
Self interest :
The potential for financial gain and enhanced prestige can entice people to obey .
Psychological identification with the ruler : People may feel an emotional tie with the leader or the system , experiencing its victories and defeats as their own .
The most common manifestations of this are patriotism and nationalism .
Zones of indifference : People often obey commands without consciously questioning their legitimacy .
Absence of self - confidence : Some people prefer to hand control of their lives over to the ruling class .
They may feel inadequate to make their own decisions .
When analyzing human obedience , the psychological factor is decisive .
Domination and submission are psychological states of mind .
Withdrawing support , even symbolically , calls into question the props and illusions that hold Power up .
Yet people are often ignorant of the power they hold , and governments conspire to maintain the illusion of their monolithic power , making their subjects feel helpless .
Violent Sanctions
It may seem counter - intuitive that nonviolent resistance can be effective against rulers who have massive amounts of force at their disposal .
But that is precisely the beauty of nonviolence .
Using violence against “ violence experts ” is the quickest way to have your organization or movement crushed .
That is why governments frequently infiltrate opposition groups with agents provocateurs — to sidetrack the movement into violent channels that the violence professionals ( police , military , security agencies , etc. ) can deal with .
After World War II military historian Basil Liddell Hart interviewed German generals about their reactions to the various forms of resistance they encountered during the war .
In his essay “ Lessons from Resistance Movements ” he writes about the difficulties Nazi generals had in dealing with nonviolence :
“ Their evidence also showed the effectiveness of non-violent resistance … .
Even clearer , was their inability to cope with it .
They were experts in violence , and had been trained to deal with opponents who used that method .
But other forms of resistance baffle them — and all the more as the methods were subtle and concealed .
It was a relief to them when nonviolent forms were mixed with guerrilla action , thus making it easier to combine drastic and suppressive action against both at the same time . ”
When rulers choose to use their superior force ( what Sharp calls “ sanctions ” ) against nonviolent actionists , they sometimes find that it does not bring about the desired results .
First , all sanctions must be carried out by the ruler ’s agents ( police or military personnel ) who may or may not obey ( or may drag their feet and only make a show of obeying ) .
A ruler ’s agents can become unreliable for a number of reasons .
They may become reluctant when ordered to commit especially brutal acts against people who are clearly presenting no physical threat .
Agents may also feel their leader is losing his / her mantle of authority , or may begin to sympathize with the opposition ’s cause .
Rulers have another potential problem when using violent sanctions against nonviolent actionists .
Too much brutality may result in what Sharp calls “ political jiu- jitsu ” where the opposition group is able to increase their unity and support while politically throwing the ruler off balance and weakening his / her regime .
This can happen when martyrs are created , or when third parties ( either foreign countries or internal groups ) who were previously neutral are appalled by the brutal treatment of nonviolent actionists and begin to sympathize with their cause .
Furthermore , sanctions do not always achieve their intended effect because it is impossible to physically force a person to obey .
To take an extreme example , someone can put a gun to my head and order me to dig a ditch .
But the choice to dig or not is still mine .
If he pulls the trigger the ditch will certainly not get dug .
For those who think that it really comes down to the same thing it should be pointed out that history is full of examples where masses of people willfully refused to comply with their ruler ’s wishes , despite the very real risk of injury or death .
Victory
Sharp cites three ways that nonviolent actionists can prevail .
The first is conversion .
Gandhians and many religious groups insist that converting the opponent to their point of view — winning their hearts and minds — is the only true victory .
Accommodation , on the other hand , occurs when the opponent does n’t agree with the resisters , but decides it is too costly to continue the fight .
Accommodation is probably the most common path to victory .
The third way that success can be achieved is through what Sharp calls nonviolent coercion .
This occurs when the opposition is forced to make concessions against its will because its power base has been dissolved .
Thus , even when a nonviolent campaign is unable to change its adversary ’s way of thinking , it can still wield power and influence the course of events .
Until recently , nonviolent action has not been recognized as a legitimate method of struggle .
Sharp lists a number of reasons for this oversight :
Rarely have nonviolent actionists been romanticized as heroes .
Rather , warriors and terrorists and their dramatic acts of heroism are mythologized for future generations .
Historians have accepted the dominant culture ’s view that violence is the only legitimate form of combat .
Historians conspire with the ruling class to keep the people ignorant of their own power .
Western civilization is “ biased toward violence . ”
It requires a “ new way of viewing the world . ”
It is a paradigm whose time has not yet come .
Nonviolence has never been seen as a coherent conceptual system .
Consequently , historical examples of nonviolent action are viewed as isolated events rather than as different aspects of the same technique of struggle .
Nonviolence is unfairly compared to violence .
Nonviolence is often used when violence has no chance of success .
When nonviolence fails , the method is condemned .
But when violence fails , strategy or tactics are blamed — not violence as a method .
Nonviolence successes are written off as flukes .
Partial successes are seen as total failures .
The Future
Since The Politics of Nonviolent Action was published , public awareness of nonviolence as a legitimate and effective form of struggle has blossomed .
The technique has been used successfully in numerous high visibility conflicts , most notably the ousting of Marcos in the Philippines ( 1986 ) and the prevention of a military coup in Russia ( 1991 ) .
Although history is filled with such examples , they seem to be occurring with increasing frequency in the late twentieth century .
Perhaps it is an indication that we are finally realizing that using violent methods against those in power — who are violence specialists — is not strategically smart .
Perhaps there are more effective ways to wage conflict .
The Other Volumes
Part Two : The Methods of Nonviolent Action
Here Sharp examines 198 different kinds of nonviolent actions , giving historical examples of each .
He breaks them down into three broad categories :
Protest and persuasion Social , economic and political noncooperation Nonviolent intervention
Part Three : The Dynamics of Nonviolent Action
This is an exploration of nonviolent strategy and tactics that can be used against violent , repressive opponents .
Sharp explains how the relative power relationships of all parties should be carefully analyzed so the resisters can develop a strategy that uses their strengths to attack their opponent ’s weaknesses .
The problem of dealing with brutal repression is explored , along with the phenomenon of “ political jiu- jitsu . ”
Also included in this volume is a discussion of how the act of nonviolent struggle itself can be beneficial to groups and their society .
The feeling of empowerment that evolves within resisting groups during a campaign can bring about increased self - esteem and personal development , whereas the use of violence tends to create callousness and de-humanization .
The use of nonviolence also disperses power throughout a society , in contrast to violent struggles that tend to centralize power .

SAN FRANCISCO  Google had little desire to own a premium slice of the nation ’s airwaves , but a week into a federal auction for wireless licenses , it found itself at risk of being the winning bidder for the coveted spectrum .
The spectrum would have cost $ 4.7 billion , Google ’s biggest single investment .
Winning would have thrust the company into the wireless business and could have sent Google ’s battered shares even lower .
Google and other companies began publicly discussing some of the auction ’s behind - the - scenes action after an anti-collusion rule prohibiting participants from commenting was lifted Thursday .
Google bid in the auction to honor a promise made to the Federal Communications Commission .
Last summer , the company vowed to bid a minimum of $ 4.6 billion , the reserve price , for a set of frequencies known as the C block as long as the F.C.C. imposed some “ openness ” conditions on it .
The F.C.C. imposed two conditions , requiring the owner of the spectrum to open its network to devices and services from third parties .

A blog at the BBC picked up this piece at Asia Times on Obama and called it “ insightful , utterly wrong - headed , weird , incomprehensible all in one , ” tagging it with the headline above .
We already knew this , but we ought to be prepared , cause anthropology is going to figure prominently in the 2008 US election .
I do n’t think anthropology will always be lauded as a virtuous scientific or humanistic pursuit .
Consider the scurrilous propoganda of the Asia Times article , as the author parrots anthropological critique :
America is not the embodiment of hope , but the abandonment of one kind of hope in return for another .
America is the spirit of creative destruction , selecting immigrants willing to turn their back on the tragedy of their own failing culture in return for a new start .
Its creative success is so enormous that its global influence hastens the decline of other cultures .
For those on the destruction side of the trade , America is a monster .
Between half and nine - tenths of the world ’s 6,700 spoken languages will become extinct in the next century , and the anguish of dying peoples rises up in a global cry of despair .
Some of those who listen to this cry become anthropologists , the curators of soon - to - be extinct cultures ; anthropologists who really identify with their subjects marry them .
Obama ’s mother , the University of Hawaii anthropologist Ann Dunham , did so twice .
Obama profiles Americans the way anthropologists interact with primitive peoples .
That ’s only the beginning .
There is so much going on in the AT column that it is hard to know where to begin .
Obama is slimed in a number of ways .
As a Third Worldist / communist revolutionary :
When Ann Dunham chose to follow Lolo Soetero to Indonesia in 1967 , she brought the six - year - old Barack into the kitchen of anti-colonialist outrage …
Barack Obama is a clever fellow who imbibed hatred of America with his mother ’s milk , but worked his way up the elite ladder of education and career .
As a whimp under the thumb of important women and therefore not a real man ( … a meme also reproduced in the pages of the NYT fairly frequently by everyone ’s favorite nutty columnist , Maureen Dowd ) :
… there is a real Barack Obama .
No man – least of all one abandoned in infancy by his father – can conceal the imprint of an impassioned mother , or the influence of a brilliant wife …
… Never underestimate the influence of a wife who bitch - slaps her husband in public …
As a Muslim ( the author reproduces suspicion while ostensibly rejecting it ) :
Barack Obama received at least some instruction in the Islamic faith of his father and went with him to the mosque , but the importance of this experience is vastly overstated by conservative commentators who seek to portray Obama as a Muslim of sorts …
He shares the resentment of Muslims against the encroachment of American culture …
As mentally ill :
…he is the political equivalent of a sociopath .
It is conceivable that Barack Obama , if elected , will destroy himself before he destroys the country .
Hatred is a toxic diet even for someone with as strong a stomach as Obama .
In this one column are condensed many recent threads here at SM , from the question of anthropology ’s putative Euro - American bias ( ironically , Asia Times accuses anthropology of being an arbiter of anti-American values and a fomenter of revolution ) , to the policing of the family ( “ As he recalled in his 1995 autobiography , Dreams From My Father , Obama idealized the Kenyan economist who had married and dumped his mother , and was saddened to learn that Barack Hussein Obama , Sr , was a sullen , drunken polygamist ” ) to the status of anthropological knowledge in contemporary political debates .
This is coming from a publication called Asia Times , but the author is the anonymous Spengler , about whom not much is apparently known , including his nationality .
Obama is an outsider in so many ways with regard to the typical profile of a presidential candidate , all of which this AT column indexes under the sign of ‘ anthropology . ’
“ Anthropology ” means : feminine or effeminate , non-white , leftist , elitist , dishonest , multi- personalitied , and so on .
Sure , the AT piece is a rant in an obscure corner of the internet .
But you can bet that should Obama receive the nomination , we will see much more bullshit like this .
You can expect this kind of examination of Ann Dunham to leap into primetime on Fox News and MSNBC , if it has n’t already .
The question will be whether Obama ’s brilliance and charisma can shine through .
I certainly hope so .
Anyway , I do n’t know .
This thing leaves me nonplussed .
What do we do with this ?

On September 27th , the FBI published photos of the hijackers of Flight 77 :
Meanwhile , back at the ranch , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ( AFIP ) , does a miraculous job and identified nearly all the bodies on November 16th 2001 .

The AFIP suggest these numbers ; 189 killed , 125 worked at the Pentagon and 64 were passengers  on the plane .
The AA list only had 56 and the list just obtained has 58 .
They did not explain how they were able to tell victims  bodies from hijacker bodies .
In fact , from the beginning NO explanation has been given for the extra five suggested in news reports except that the FBI showed us the pictures to make up the difference , and that makes it so .
Now , being the trusting sort , I figured that the government would want to quickly dispel any rumors so we could get on with the chore of kicking Osama / Sadaams butt ( werent these originally two different people ? ) .
It seemed simple to me .
. . produce the names of all the bodies identified by the AFIP and compare it with the publicized list of passengers .
So , I sent a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the AFIP and asked for an expedited response , because we were getting ready to send our boys to war on the pretext that Osama / Sadaam had done the deed .
Fourteen months later , a few US soldiers dead , many Iraqi civilians pushing up daisies , and I finally get the list .
Believe me that they werent a bit happy to give it up , and I really have no idea why they choose now to release it .

No Arabs wound up on the morgue slab ; however , three ADDITIONAL people not listed by American Airline sneaked in .
I have seen no explanation for these extras .
I did give American the opportunity to revise their original list , but they have not responded .
The new names are : Robert Ploger , Zandra Ploger , and Sandra Teague .
The AFIP claims that the only passenger  body that they were not able to identify is the toddler , Dana Falkenberg , whose parents and young sister are on the list of those identified .
The satanic masterminds behind this caper may be feeling pretty smug about the perfect crime , but they have left a raft of clues tying these unfortunates together .
Stay tuned for part two to take a much closer look of the cast of characters on this ill - fated flight .
Two decades after the Exxon Valdez supertanker veered off course , slammed into a reef in Prince William Sound , and created the nation 's worst oil spill , some Alaskans say they 've been hit by another disaster – a legal one .
A US Supreme Court ruling Wednesday trimmed punitive damages for the 1989 catastrophe by at least 80 percent .
So , instead of the $ 2.5 billion that some 32,000 plaintiffs had been awarded , the court decided the damages should equal no more than the $ 507.5 million already paid in compensation to private plaintiffs .
Reaction in Alaska was fast and furious .
" Tragic , " said Gov. Sarah Palin .
" Adds insult to injury , " said Alaska 's congressional delegation in a statement .
" A slap on the wrist " for Exxon , said Tim Joyce , mayor of the fishing hub of Cordova , which was at the center of the disaster .
Not long ago , some Alaskans worried that the fishing hub would sprout " spillionaires " – ordinary people suddenly rich from lump - sum Exxon payouts .
Now in Cordova , there is talk of giving up homes , fishing permits , and the town itself , said Riki Ott , a local fisherman , scientist , and environmentalist .
" There are some people , they look like they 've been shellshocked . "
Some residents had already pledged anticipated punitive payments to settle debts .
" We did n't spill the oil , you know , and we 're the ones being injured by this .
Again , " said Ms. Ott , who spent much of Wednesday painting protest signs with slogans like : " Guilty Until Proven Wealthy . "
Anyone looking to a big punitive award as a source of more compensation had misplaced hopes , said ExxonMobil spokesman Tony Cudmore .
" This case was about punishment and whether further punishment was warranted .
It was not about compensatory damages . "
The company says that after spending $ 3.4 billion on cleanup , settlements with the Alaskan and US governments and other groups , fines , and various types of compensation , it needed no more punishment .
Legitimate claims for compensation were handled swiftly and fairly , Mr. Cudmore said .
" Most people who sought compensation were compensated within a year of the spill , and the court recognized that . "
The court 's majority found that Exxon had acted without " intentional or malicious conduct , " and a 1 - to - 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages " is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases , " according to the decision penned by Justice David Souter .
Plaintiffs said the court failed to take into account the damages that never were compensated in the first place , due to the quirks of maritime law and the long years it took for environmental impacts to manifest themselves .
For example , the collapse of Prince William Sound 's herring population became evident only years after the spill , plaintiffs say .
Cordova fisherman and community leader R.J. Kopchak calculated that the area lost $ 126 million through 2005 because of canceled harvests .
He lost about $ 500,000 in earnings , he said , not to mention his now useless $ 18,000 worth of herring - fishing equipment that sits under a moss - covered tarp .
Also uncompensated were the lost millions of dollars of wealth held in fishing permits .
That wealth vanished when values plunged to as low as 10 percent of prespill levels .
Maritime law allowed compensation only when permits were sold at losses .
" What we all should have done is sell each other our permits so that we would have had realized losses , " Ott says .
Alaskan natives who could n't gather fish , game , and meat from oiled waters and beaches got a $ 20 million settlement , the estimated cost of replacing wild foods with store - bought substitutes , not the $ 160 million that plaintiff economists believed reflected true cultural damages , said Lloyd Miller , an attorney for the plaintiffs .
ExxonMobil has argued that Prince William Sound recovered long ago from the spill , and that any ecological changes – including the herring collapse – are due to other factors .
For some , the spill 's impact goes beyond dollars .
" The biggest thing that hurt the most that I lost were the dreams and goals that I had , " said local fisherman and artist Mike Webber , sitting on a Cordova dock a month before the Supreme Court ruling .
Mr. Webber drew on his Tlingit Indian heritage last year to carve a " shame pole " ridiculing ExxonMobil 's unpaid debts .
" I 've been wanting to do a healing pole , [ but ] I have n't found out anything to put on the pole to tell that we 've healed , " he said .
We ’ve all seen tag clouds by now , the visualization technique that shows the importance ( however defined , but typically by prevalence ) of a word by assigning a proportionately sized font .
But now comes along a tool that treats these clouds as art .
Wordle ’s “ Beautiful Word Clouds ” is quite addictive , allowing you to enter the raw text and then play around with layout algorithms , fonts and coloring schemes to produce some very nice looking clouds .
The author — Jonathan Feinberg — works here at IBM , a fact I did not discover until I had already wasted hours playing with the tool .
So maybe I can count this as work now ?
Here are a few examples of word clouds formed by analyzing three different texts .
Can you guess the identity of the three texts ?
Some of my wish - list items are :
In my previous blog , A Big , Long D*ck for Valentine 's Day , I alerted you to a patent that could help you realize your manly potential .
But I 'm here to tell you it 's not all fun and games .
Today , more than ever , sexual prowess cannot occur free of responsibility .
So if you love your partner , or even if you do n't and you only love yourself , you owe it to yourself to practice safe sex .
That 's why today I am providing you with a patent that reconciles safety with fun .
United States patent 5163447 is for a Force - Sensitive , Sound - Playing Condom !
That 's right , it 's a musical condom !
This baby looks and acts like a traditional condom and yet , manages to go a step further by incorporating " a chip - controlled piezoelectric sound transducer ( 18 ) which plays a melody or voiced message when during intercourse the contacts of the sound - playing unit are closed and the transducer is activated " by forceful movements .
Just think of all the fun you 'll have - besides the sex of course .
The prophylactic works like this : record a song or message , put the prophylactic on , begin your business , then every time you thrust your recording is played out loud .
You can be as sweet as you like , " I love you Valentine , " as dirty as you like , " Who 's your daddy ? " or as conceited as your partner suspects you are by recording things like a drum roll , or the theme song from Apocalypse Now , Wagner 's : The Ride of the Valkyries .
Anyway , the musical condom is my pick today not because a condom is particularly new or unusual , but because I like the fact that the inventor , Paul Lyons , found an innovative way to improve on an established product without reinventing the wheel , so to speak .
So remember to keep those you love , even if it 's only you , safe and amused this Valentine 's Day with United States patent 5163447 .
At last , your love has got it 's own soundtrack !

Evolution is Dead
Well , not quite .
And only natural evolution is dying .
For thousands of years , mankind has bred plants and animals to create more desired and useful plants and animals .
For instance , modern corn has been bred to such a large size that it is no longer able to reproduce without mans assistance .
Modern dairy cows produce too much milk ; because if they are not often drained of milk , they could leak , burst , become infected , and possibly die .
Furthermore , most domesticated dogs can not survive in the wild even with special training .
Since natural evolution is extremely slow and mankinds selective breeding programs only take a few generations to produce a completely new species , natural evolution has already taken a backseat to mankinds breeding programs .
Additionally , mankind has successfully killed off several species all together .
For instance , there are no more European wolves in existence and mammoths probably became extinct because of mankind .
Even certain diseases have been permanently eradicated from the planet , and dozens of other diseases will soon be too .
Again , natural evolution did not cause most of the extinctions during humanitys reign .
Currently , scientists are creating new species with desired characteristics in the lab significantly faster than evolution creates new species .
In a single generation , new species can be artificially created and destroyed , while natural evolution could take thousands of years to do the same but only haphazardly .
Scientists are even able to replace flawed or damaged genes with different genes to attempt to cure genetic defects .
This is something that natural evolution could possibly never correct .
Eventually scientists will be able enhance even people .
For example , imagine not only correcting your eyesight with gene therapy , but also ensuring that all of your descendants do not inherit your old genes of poor eyesight too .
Scientists will one day be able to enhance the memory and intelligence of your children , so that they will do better in school and achieve more in life .
Doctors and scientists will be able to customize babies before they are born just like picking options at a car dealership .
In the near future , natural evolution or random changes in the genetic code of any species can be quickly fixed if desired .
Even perfectly good genes can be immediately improved upon .
As a result , natural evolution is doomed .
Mankinds meddling of Mother Nature is only going to increase exponentially as bioengineering become more understood and perfected .
Therefore artificial evolution is the future .

The limitations , if any , that geography places on the protections of the constitution , statutory codes , the common law , and natural law .
When and how the protections of the common law or natural law are surrendered or need not be recognized or enforced by a specific court .
The relationship of absolutely owned private property to constitutional rights .
When and how absolutely owned private property protected by the Bill of Rights can lawfully be converted to public property in which the government shares a qualified property interest ( moiety ) , a usufruct , or any degree of lawful CIVIL control .
It is therefore for constitutional decision support so that human beings will know how to invoke its protections in a judicial and legal setting in all their interactions with their regional governments .

Majesty , We Have Gone Mad
An open letter to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 26th May 2008
Your Majesty ,
In common with the leaders of most western nations , our prime minister is urging you to increase your production of oil .
I am writing to ask you to ignore him .
Like the other leaders he is delusional , and is no longer competent to make his own decisions .
You and I know that there are several reasons for the high price of oil .
Low prices at the beginning of this decade discouraged oil companies from investing in future capacity .
There is a global shortage of skilled labour , steel and equipment ( 1 ) .
The weak dollar means that the price of oil is higher than it would have been if denominated in another currency .
While your government says that financial speculation is an important factor , the Bank of England says it is not ( 2 ) , so I do n’t know what to believe .
The major oil producers have also become major consumers ; in some cases their exports are falling even as their production has risen , because they are consuming more of their own output ( 3 ) .
But what you know and I do not is the extent to which the price of oil might reflect an absolute shortage of global reserves .
You and your advisers are perhaps the only people who know the answer to this question .
Your published reserves are , of course , a political artefact unconnected to geological reality .
The production quotas assigned to its members by Opec , the oil exporters ’ cartel , reflect the size of their stated reserves , which means that you have an incentive to exaggerate them .
How else could we explain the fact that , despite two decades of furious pumping , your kingdom posts the same reserves as it did in 1988 ?
( 4 )
You say that you are saving your oil for the benefit of future generations ( 5 ) .
If this is true , it is a rational economic decision : oil in the ground looks like a better investment than money in the bank .
But , reluctant as I am to question your majesty ’s word , I must remind you that some oil analysts are now wondering whether this prudence is a convenient fiction ( 6 ) .
Are you restricting supply because you want to conserve stocks and keep the price high , or are you unable to raise production because your fabled spare capacity does not in fact exist ?
I do not expect an answer to this question .
I know that the true state of your reserves is a secret so closely guarded that oil analysts now resort to using spy satellites to try to estimate the speed of subsidence of the ground above your oil fields ( 7 ) , as they have no other means of guessing how fast your reserves are running down .
What I know and you may not is that the high price of oil is currently the only factor implementing British government policy .
The government claims that it is seeking to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , by encouraging people to use less fossil fuel .
Now , for the first time in years , its wish has come true : people are driving and flying less .
The AA reports that about a fifth of drivers are now buying less fuel ( 8 ) .
A new study by the Worldwide Fund for Nature shows that businesses are encouraging their executives to use video conferences instead of flying ( 9 ) .
One of the most fuel - intensive industries of all , business - only air travel , has collapsed altogether ( 10 ) .
In other words , your restrictions on supply – voluntary or otherwise – are helping the government to meet its carbon targets .
So how does it respond ?
By angrily demanding that you remove them so that we can keep driving and flying as much as we did before .
Last week Gordon Brown averred that it ’s “ a scandal that 40 % of the oil is controlled by Opec , that their decisions can restrict the supply of oil to the rest of the world , and that at a time when oil is desperately needed , and supply needs to expand , that Opec can withhold supply from the market . ” ( 11 ) In the United States , legislators have gone further : the House of Representatives has voted to a bring a lawsuit against Opec ’s member states ( 12 ) , and Democratic senators are trying to block arms sales to your kingdom unless you raise production ( 13 ) .
This illustrates one of our leaders ’ delusions .
They claim to wish to restrict the demand for fossil fuels , in order to address both climate change and energy security .
At the same time , to quote Britain ’s department for business , they seek to “ maximise economic recovery ” from their remaining oil , gas and coal reserves ( 14 ) .
They persist in believing that both policies can be pursued at once , apparently unaware that if fossil fuels are extracted they will be burnt , however much they claim to wish to reduce consumption .
The only states which appear to be imposing restrictions on the supply of fuel are the members of OPEC , about which Gordon Brown so bitterly complains .
Your majesty , we have gone mad , and you alone can cure our affliction , by keeping your taps shut .
Our leaders , though they do not possess the faintest idea of whether or not the oil supplies required to support it will be sustained , are also overseeing a rapid expansion of our transport infrastructure .
In the United Kingdom we are building or upgrading thousands of miles of new roads and doubling the capacity of our airports , in the expectation that there will be no restriction in the supply of fuel .
The government ’s central forecast for the long - term price of oil is just $ 70 a barrel ( 15 ) .
Over the past few months I have been trying to discover how the government derives this optimistic view .
In response to a parliamentary question , it reveals that its projection is based on “ the assessment made by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in its 2007 World Energy Outlook . ” ( 16 ) Well last week the Wall Street Journal revealed that the IEA “ is preparing a sharp downward revision of its oil - supply forecast ” .
Its final report wo n’t be released until November , but it has already concluded that “ future crude supplies could be far tighter than previously thought . ” ( 17 ) Its previous estimates of global production were wrong for one simple and shocking reason : it had based them on anticipated demand , rather than anticipated supply ( 18 ) .
It resolved the question of supply by assuming that it would automatically rise to meet demand , as if it were subject to no inherent restraints .
Our government must have known this , but it has refused to conduct its own analysis of global oil reserves .
Uniquely among possible threats to the economy and national security , it has commissioned no research of any kind into this question ( 19 ) .
So earlier this year I asked the department for business what contingency plans it possesses to meet the eventuality that the IEA ’s estimates could be wrong , and that global supplies of petroleum might peak in the near future .
“ The Government , ” it replied , “ does not feel the need to hold contingency plans ” ( 20 ) .
I am sure I do not need to explain the implications , if its forecasts turn out to be wildly wrong .
Your majesty , I recognise that this is not among your usual duties as the ruler of Saudi Arabia .
But I respectfully beg you to save us from ourselves .
Yours Sincerely ,
George Monbiot

TORONTO ( Reuters ) -
You can browse the latest porn magazines at Canadian shops , but tough new laws mean that cigarette packages are simply too suggestive .
A pack of Canadian cigarettes with a warning label is seen in Montreal , June 28 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Shaun Best
Shop owners in Ontario , Quebec and a few other provinces must now hide tobacco products from their customers under rules that will cover most of Canada by year - end as the country tries to stamp out smoking by young people .
The provincial governments want to discourage the habit by “ de- normalizing ” the presence of cigarettes , which typically enjoyed prime placement behind the cash register .
Retailers must store cigarettes in drawers or behind grey wall coverings that cost as much as C$ 1,000 ( $ 980 ) , leaving some fuming over the cost , inconvenience , and hypocrisy .
“ It ’s a pain in the ass , and a double - standard that the government supports liquor sales , ” said a Toronto shop owner who did not want to be named , but who noted children too young to buy pornography are still free to eye the plastic - covered magazines , which are only partly hidden by their shelving .
“ It ’s kind of like a nanny state . ”
The law has its critics , including those who point accusingly at Ontario ’s provincially owned liquor stores .
But advocates say the seemingly draconian measure will eventually work , and is too important to get bogged down by morality .
“ Pornography , with all its faults and deficits , wo n’t kill you , ” said Michael Perley , director of the Ontario Campaign for
Action on Tobacco , an anti-smoking lobby group .
“ Tobacco industry products kill one in two of their long - term users . ”
Perley ’s group , backed by national cancer and medical associations , complains that the cigarette industry paid retailers to display their colorful products in prominent positions in retail stores .
The latest move puts Canada , which already bans cigarette advertising and sports sponsorships by tobacco companies , among a small group of countries which hides tobacco products at the cash register .
Iceland was first in 2001 and Thailand followed in 2005 , while Ireland is moving in the same direction .
Canadian retailers complain the law will confuse customers and sellers , and stifle sales of their top product .
But the provinces , which are responsible for managing Canada ’s publicly funded healthcare system , say they are trying to curb the country ’s No. 1 cause of early death , cancer .
Canada ’s explicit health warnings on tobacco products , including graphic images of blackened lungs and rotten teeth , are already considered among the world ’s most direct .
“ It does n’t take long to de- normalize social psychology , ” said Toronto cigarette - smoker Karolina Jonsson .
“ People underestimate just how much advertising we are exposed to every day , and cigarettes are the same . ”
Ottawa has decided that an American soldier who fled the army over the Iraq war will not face the risk of abuse or mistreatment if returned to the U.S .
That means Corey Glass can now be deported to the United States , where he faces possible jail time for desertion .
Glass , of Fairmount , Ind. , was a sergeant in military intelligence who spent five months in Iraq .
Based on what he saw and did there , he decided the war was illegal and decided he could n't go back .
He spent seven months in hiding before seeking asylum in Canada , which he knew had been sympathetic to Vietnam draft dodgers .
Glass , who lives in Toronto , maintains that when he signed up for the U.S. National Guard , he thought he was joining a humanitarian organization .

Server features
---------------
AppArmor profiles : a greater number of server applications are now protected by default with AppArmor , a kernel technology that limits the resources an application is allowed to access , providing added protection against undiscovered security vulnerabilities .
Memory protection : additional protection now prevents direct access to system memory through / dev/mem and / dev/kmem , and the lower 64 K of system memory is no longer addressable by default , changes which help to defend against malicious code .
The kernel now also loads Position Independent Executables at randomized addresses , making it harder for application security vulnerabilities to be exploited .
Virtualization and iSCSI : KVM is now an officially maintained option , which combined with libvirt ( CLI ) and virt - manager ( GUI ) management tools allows for a simple and efficient virtualization option on hardware that supports virtualization extensions ( AMD - V or Intel - VT ) .
Mounting iSCSI targets is now supported ( including in the installer ) , allowing Ubuntu to interoperate with this class of cost - efficient Storage Area Network solutions .
Ubuntu Education Edition
------------------------
Add-on configuration : Edubuntu is now provided as an add - on to Ubuntu rather than a separate stand - alone flavor , permitting even greater reuse of Ubuntu technologies .
Kubuntu features
----------------
Kubuntu comes with the rock solid KDE 3 for those who want a commercially supported desktop .
For those who want something more exciting , a KDE 4 Remix is available bringing this cutting edge new version to you first .

With Steve Jobs ' announcement that the iPhone3 Gwill have geolocation built - in , plenty of people are excited about finding good restaurants near them or worried about the privacy implications of that
But the new capability could be adapted by a different , unexpected crowd : citizen scientists taking the real - time environmental pulse of cities and suburb .
One requirement of this data - gathering effort would be maintaining the integrity of the data input .
GPS eliminates the need to accurately report location data , which is a major area of human error .
With Apple putting devices with these capabilities into the hands of more and more consumers , scientists could discover a huge untapped data - gathering resource if they can churn out cheap sensors that can communicate with the iPhone .
That would be the next step in the new trend of turning real built and natural environments into data that can be visualized in virtual environments , i.e. , of marrying geographic and virtual space .
When we asked futurist Jamais Cascio what the Internet will look like in 2020 , he responded :
It will be indistinguishable from the physical world ....
At a glance , I can see environmental information .
Oh , it 's raining ?
How much has it rained ?
What 's the pollen count ?
What 's the forecast ?
All of these bits and pieces of how we appreciate the world around us will be given greater specificity and made graspable .
To create that digital instantiation of the real world , you need data about it .
While some programs like the Center for Embedded Network Sensing at UCLA or MIT 's Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling are attempting to put top - down pervasive sensor networks into some regions ( like Singapore ) , citizen scientists could present a more distributed , alternative way of gathering environmental data .
In fact , Nokia has already unveiled a concept design for an EcoSensor phone that would allow users to see data about the air that they are breathing or the water they are drinking .
Maybe a dedicated environmental device could find a niche market , but it seems to us that a $ 200 iPhone with cheap sensor add - ons could be the right combination to drive large - scale adoption of citizen science applications like crowdsourced environmental sensing .

探偵をしていると明らかにノイローゼという依頼人もいる
ノイローゼの依頼人による調査依頼
探偵を長くしているとさまざまな悩みを抱えた老若男女と面談することになる。
どういう訳かノイローゼの依頼人と面談する事も多い。
典型的なのが大きく分けて２種類のノイローゼの依頼人がいる。
盗聴・盗 撮
一つ目はなんと言っても盗聴、盗撮関連のノイローゼである。
正直に言うと仮に１０件の盗聴相談があると６割はノイローゼと思っても良い。
しかも自宅に盗聴器が設置されているという人は９割はノイローゼと疑ったとしても過言ではない。
「 盗聴されているかもしれないから検索に来て欲しい」
ここまではよくある盗聴器捜索の問い合わせの依頼内容である。
どのような被害があるのですか？と問いかけに普通だとあるところで話をした内容が他人や別の会社に漏れている形跡があるからという返答が多い。
正常な返答である 。
ところが中には 「私が部屋を移動すると２階の人や下の階の人もついてきて床や天井をたたき出す。これは盗聴器がついているからだ」と言う人や、
「 テレビを消したのに声がする。しかもお前を見張っていると言っている。盗聴器からの声に違いない。」
「 どこからか判らないが電磁波みたいなのをあてられている。カーテンを閉めても居場所が分かるのは盗聴器が付けられているからに違いない」などなど。
どれもこれも完全にノイローゼである。
しかも普通に生活している人たちなのである。
正直、このように明らかなノイローゼの人からの依頼は受けたくない。
丁寧にお断りしようとするも中には必死にお願いしてくる。
こういった人にとっては探偵は医者かカウンセラーのようなものなのかもしれない。
実際に盗聴調査に赴き、いろいろと精査するが設置されているはずがない。
今度は付いてない事を説明するのにもかなりの時間を取られ一苦労である。
それでも依頼人は依頼人である。
どうにか説得し納得させ帰路につくのであるが数倍の疲労感を味わうこととなる。
最近では盗撮されているという相談もくるのであるが殆どが同様のノイローゼである。
何しろ自宅の部屋にカメラが仕掛けられていてずっと誰かに見られているという。
集団ストーカ ー
二つ目は盗聴と相関するのであるが自分が不特定多数の人から見張られ、つけ回されているという相談。
確かにストーカーの被害に実際に遭って困っている人もいるのでノイローゼとは決めつける事は出来ない。
ただ実際のストーカー事件と異なり、共通して言えるのは「不特定多数に見張られている」という事である。
しかも依頼人の行き先々にいろいろな人が依頼人の顔を見て携帯電話で連絡を取り合っていたり、どこにいってもそんな人物が現れるのは大きな組織や団体が動いている違いないと思い込んでいる。
ひどい人だとどこから情報を集めたのか「宗教団体が組織ぐるみで私を見張っている」とか「ＣＩＡが動いている」と突拍子もないことを言ってくる人もいる。
また近所の商店や何度か行ったことのあるお店の人が突然、冷たくなったのは誰かが私の悪口を言いふらしていると言い始めるなど典型的なノイローゼの症状である。
こちらは真面目にストーカー被害者かと話を聞いていくとこの様な話になっていくともう相談も中止にして依頼を断ろうとする。
しかし、盗聴ノイローゼの人と同じである。
当人は必死なのである。
簡単に無視も出来ないのである。
どういう訳か信じられないがこういった人たちも普通に生活しているのである。
中には資産家の人もいる。
騙している訳ではないが数週間、依頼人を尾行する人がいないかを確認し依頼人が怪しいという何人かの人物をマーク、身元を調査したりとスタッフ総出で対応、結果、高額な調査料金を支払って頂いたというケースもあった。
ただしこういった人の場合、より以上にビデオなどを駆使し調査結果を丁寧に説明していかないと納得はしてくれず、むしろ勝手に思っている組織に買収されたのではと疑ってくる人もいるのである。
基本的にノイローゼと判断できる人の依頼は正直、受けたくないのが探偵の内緒の実情である。
尚、あくまでも統計的なものであるが季節の変わり目になるとこの様なノイローゼの依頼人が増えるのは何かしらの因果関係があるのかもしれない。
A Senate Armed Services Committee ( SASC ) investigation has concluded that top Pentagon officials had assembled lists of harsh torture techniques in the summer of 2002 for use on prisoners in America ’s Guantánamo Bay prison gulag .
The Senate ’s findings strongly refute claims by top Bush administration officials that their approval of such techniques were in response to requests from field commanders “ far down the chain of command , ” The Washington Post reports .
According to Joby Warrick ,
The sources said that memos and other evidence obtained during the inquiry show that officials in the office of then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld started to research the use of waterboarding , stress positions , sensory deprivation and other practices in July 2002 , months before memos from commanders at the detention facility in Cuba requested permission to use those measures on suspected terrorists .
( “ Report Questions Pentagon Accounts , ” The Washington Post , June 17 , 2008 )
During hearings Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee , it was revealed that the CIA played a larger role in the Bush administration ’s “ enhanced interrogation ” policies than previously acknowledged .
Torture , according to minutes of an October 2 , 2002 meeting at Guantánamo Bay , “ is basically subject to perception , ” CIA counterterrorism lawyer Jonathan Fredman told a group of military and intelligence officials .
“ If the detainee dies , you ’re doing it wrong , ” The Washington Post reports .
The hearings , and supporting documents released by the SASC , revealed that Fredman , whose Agency handlers had been granted virtual carte blanche by the Justice Department to torture suspected “ terrorists , ” discussed
the pros and cons of videotaping , talked about how to avoid interference by the International Committee of the Red Cross and offered a strong defense of waterboarding .
“ If a well - trained individual is used to perform this technique , it can feel like you ’re drowning , ” he said , according to the meeting ’s minutes , which do not provide a verbatim transcript .
Fredman said medical experts should monitor detainees .
“ If someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used , regardless of the cause of death , the backlash of attention would be severely detrimental , ” he was quoted as saying .
( Joby Warrick , “ CIA Played Larger Role in Advising Pentagon , ” The Washington Post , June 18 , 2008 )
While Fredman ’s “ expertise ” on abusing prisoners recommends placing physicians , psychiatrists and other trained medical personnel in American torture chambers , in itself a clear breech of international norms and the military ’s own procedures , his callous disregard for human rights hardly absolve high - level administration officials .
As ABC News reported in April , during dozens of top - secret talks and meetings at the White House , the National Security Council Principals Committee , which included Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft , “ discussed and approved specific details ” of how “ high - value ” prisoners would be interrogated .
Indeed , so explicit were these discussions that one source told ABC News , “ the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed . ”
One top official reported Ashcroft as having said , “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
In a statement released Tuesday , Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the Armed Services Committee , wrote :
… how did it come about that American military personnel stripped detainees naked , put them in stress positions , used dogs to scare them , put leashes around their necks to humiliate them , hooded them , deprived them of sleep , and blasted music at them .
Were these actions the result of “ a few bad apples ” acting on their own ?
It would be a lot easier to accept if it were .
But that ’s not the case .
The truth is that senior officials in the United States government sought information on aggressive techniques , twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees .
( “ The Origins of Aggressive Interrogation Techniques , ” Carl Levin , United States Senator , June 17 , 2008 )
As Philippe Sands ’ investigative piece in last month ’s Vanity Fair revealed , after the Principals Committee reached a decision to torture , Bush administration “ little Eichmanns ” provided the necessary “ legal ” gloss to implement these criminal policies :
The fingerprints of the most senior lawyers in the administration were all over the design and implementation of the abusive interrogation policies .
[ David ] Addington , [ Jay ] Bybee , [ Alberto ] Gonzales , [ Jim ] Haynes , and [ John ]
Yoo became , in effect , a torture team of lawyers , freeing the administration from the constraints of all international rules prohibiting abuse .
( “ The Green Light , ” Vanity Fair , May 2008 )
But as The Washington Post reported Tuesday , the new evidence presented by the Armed Services Committee challenged previous statements by
William J. “ Jim ” Haynes II , who served as Defense Department general counsel under Rumsfeld and is among the witnesses scheduled to testify at today ’s hearing .
Haynes , who resigned in February , suggested to a Senate panel in 2006 that the request for tougher interrogation methods originated in October 2002 , when Guantanamo Bay commanders began asking for help in ratcheting up the pressure on suspected terrorists who had stopped cooperating .
A memo from the prison ’s top military lawyer that same month had suggested specific techniques and declared them legal .
However , “ memos and e-mails ” obtained by Senate investigators suggest otherwise .
In July 2002 , Haynes and other top Defense Department officials “ were soliciting ideas for harsh interrogations from military experts in survival training . ”
By late July , despite strenuous objections by military lawyers who viewed such methods as patently illegal breeches of the Geneva Convention , a list was compiled that included many of the torture techniques that infamously became synonymous with the Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib and Bagram airbase repertoire .
Indeed , military criminal investigators , “ attempting to develop evidence to prosecute suspected terrorists , objected strenuously to techniques they considered illegal and likely to damage chances of a conviction , ” The Wall Street Journal reports .
Journal reporter Jess Bravin reveals that ,
In an October 2002 email to a colleague , Special Agent Mark Fallon of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service said that comments like those of Col. Beaver and Mr. Fredman could “ shock the conscience of any legal body ” looking into interrogation methods .
“ This looks like the kinds of stuff Congressional hearings are made of , ” he wrote .
( “ Ex -Pentagon Lawyers Challenged on Torture , ” The Wall Street Journal , June 18 , 2008 )
In a major breakthrough that demolish the mendacious claims of the Bush regime , the Senate report provides irrefutable evidence that top Pentagon and CIA officials sought out military and “ outsourced ” mercenary personnel , including psychologists , to reverse - engineer U.S. military Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) tactics taught pilots and Special Operations Commandos caught behind enemy lines for use on prisoners designated “ enemy combatants ” by the administration .
According to Levin , in July 2002 , Richard Shiffrin , a Pentagon Deputy General Counsel called Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Baumgartner , the Chief of Staff at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) , the DoD bureau that oversees SERE training “ and asked for information on SERE techniques . ”
Baumgartner responded by drafting a memo with three attachments .
According to Levin ’s statement and supporting documentation released by the SASC ,
One of those attachments ( TAB 3 ) listed physical and psychological pressures used in SERE resistance training including sensory deprivation , sleep disruption , stress positions , waterboarding , and slapping .
It also made reference to a section of the JPRA instructor manual that talks about “ coercive pressures ” like keeping the lights at all times , and treating a person like an animal .
Another attachment ( TAB 4 ) , written by Dr. Ogrisseg , also a witness today , assessed the long - term psychological effects of SERE resistance training on students and the effects of the waterboard .
Scarcely a week after Baumgartner ’s memo , the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) issued two opinions drafted by Jay Bybee and John C. Yoo addressed to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales .
These are the infamous Torture Memos , one of which still remains classified .
As current Assistant Attorney General of the OLC Steven Bradbury testified earlier this year before the House Judiciary Committee , the “ CIA ’s use of the waterboarding procedure was adapted from the SERE training program . ”
At this point , JPRA staff were “ finalizing plans ” to conduct training for interrogation staff from U.S. Southern Command ’s Joint Task Force 170 at Guantánamo Bay .
In mid-September 2002 , a group from Guantánamo , “ including interrogators and behavioral scientists , travelled to Fort Bragg , North Carolina , and attended training conducted by instructors from the JPRA SERE school .
None of the three JPRA personnel who provided the training was a trained interrogator , ” Levin reveals .
As I wrote in April , those who committed these unspeakable atrocities “ were acting out scenes from a CIA ‘ masterwork ’ composed decades earlier : KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation . ”
The July 1963 CIA torture manual describes a fear - cloaked shadow world of hooding , isolation , sensory deprivation , drugging , sexual humiliation and other unseemly interrogation techniques , many of which were “ perfected ” by “ outsourced ” psychiatrists on their patients during the 1950s and 1960s during the Agency ’s criminal MKULTRA “ mind - control ” experiments .
Fast - forward 50 years , and the fruit of these Nazi - like experiments in psychological torment are all - too - discernible in the hollowed - out eyes and shattered minds of America ’s “ war on terror ” prisoners .
As former Pentagon lawyer Richard Shiffrin told The New York Times , the Rumsfeld ’s Defense Department turned to SERE out of “ great frustration ” at the nature of the intelligence obtained from prisoners through lawful means .
As Salon investigative journalist Mark Benjamin , a reporter who broke many stories on the reverse - engineering of SERE tactics as a torture tool , writes ,
But as more and more documents from inside the Bush government come to light , it is increasingly clear that the administration sought from early on to implement interrogation techniques whose basis was torture .
Soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the Pentagon and the CIA began an orchestrated effort to tap expertise from the military ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape school , for use in the interrogation of terrorist suspects .
… SERE training has nothing to do with effective interrogation , according to military experts .
Trained interrogators do n’t work in the program .
Skilled , experienced interrogators , in fact , say that only a fool would think that the training could somehow be reverse - engineered into effective interrogation techniques .
But that ’s exactly what the Bush government sought to do .
As the plan rolled forward , military and law enforcement officials consistently sent up red flags that the SERE - based interrogation program was n’t just wrongheaded , it was probably illegal .
( “ A Timeline to Bush Government Torture , ” Salon , June 18 , 2008 )
What were the results obtained by Shiffrin and others into the efficacy of reverse - engineered SERE tactics ?
“ It was real ‘ Manchurian Candidate ’ stuff , ” Shiffrin told the Times .
An apt description if ever there were one , of the post - Constitutional order created by the Bush administration and their corporatist masters .
Why then , do top Democratic party leaders , including Carl Levin , continue to insist “ impeachment is off the table ” ?
Johnny Telvor was not happy about Barack Obama becoming the Democratic presidential nominee .
Not happy at all .
Standing outside the sturdy courthouse in the sweltering heat of a West Virginia afternoon in the small town of Williamson , Telvor smoked a cigarette and bluntly gave his opinion of Obama 's historic mission to be America 's first black president .
' We 'll end up slaves .
We 'll be made slaves just like they was once slaves , ' he said .
Telvor , a white Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton in West Virginia 's primary , said he planned to vote for Republican John McCain in November .
' At least he's an American , ' he added with a disarmingly friendly smile .
Such racist opinions are a rough antidote to the giddy optimism that has swept through much of America 's chattering classes over the past week .
Since Obama beat Clinton and finally became the Democratic nominee liberal pundits from New York to San Francisco have eagerly discussed how Obama 's unique candidacy will put America 's racially charged past behind it .
The United States , they have argued , is finally prepared to elect a black president and absolve its historic sins of slavery and Jim Crow .
But the uglier truth is that part of white America remains secretly - or sometimes openly - deeply distrustful of the idea of a black president .
Nowhere is this more evident than in the vastness of the Appalachian mountains that run from Maine through West Virginia and all the way down to Georgia .
Here Obama faces his greatest problem in convincing poor white citizens to vote for him .
They certainly have not backed him so far .
In West Virginia Clinton trounced Obama by more than 30 points .
It is a place of deep poverty and astonishing natural beauty - and it is overwhelmingly white .
Outsiders deride it as ' hillbilly ' country .
But it is also somewhere that has a special place in America 's heart .
Appalachia is where the TV series The Waltons was set .
It is a place of deep family values , where clannish folk have created a vibrant mountain culture of God and guns .
It is also a place not used to voting for a black politician .
' McCain will win here , ' said Telvor .
' No doubt about it . '
Williamson is a typical slice of Appalachia .
The town of 3,000 souls lies on the banks of the Tug Fork River , overshadowed by the mountains that surround it .
A railway runs through the centre of town , which has long been used to hard times as the coal industry faded away .
The town is in the heart of Mingo County in West Virginia .
In last month 's Democratic primary , a staggering 88 per cent of people in Mingo County voted for Clinton - the highest number in the whole state - compared with just 8 per cent willing to put a cross by Obama 's name .
Those are landslide numbers that even some third world dictators would be embarrassed to record .
And , as went Mingo , so went the entire state .
' This state is white , elderly and working class .
This is not natural Obama country .
People are not used to having black politicians on the ballot , ' said Professor Allan Hammock , a political scientist at West Virginia University .
The sheer scale of Clinton 's win in West Virginia - repeated throughout most Appalachian counties from Pennsylvania to Georgia - took many pundits by surprise .
But it did not shock people in Williamson , Jack Spence among them .
The elderly retiree , enjoying the hot weather on a street bench , said he voted for Clinton and , now she has lost , he plans to sit out the November election .
' I can't vote for a Republican .
My daddy would just roll over in his grave , ' he said .
But nor can he bring himself to vote for Obama , though he insisted it was not because of race .
' That does not matter to me .
Though it might to a lot of folks around here , ' he said .
Was there anything Obama could say during the coming campaign to convince him ?
' Nope , ' Spence replied .
Then he broached the one issue many Americans consider off - limits : the potential security threat to Obama .
' Look , someone will kill him .
Whoever Obama picks as running mate will end up being president . '
Spence 's ready smile and chatty manner on the thorny issue of Obama 's possible murder gave little clue as to whether he thought it would be a bad thing or not .
Often such sentiments are dismissed as the ramblings of a few diehards , carrying with them the prejudices of a by - gone age .
After all , Iowa , a very white state , was the place Obama first won .
But the fact is Obama 's Appalachian problem is very real .
Williamson and West Virginia are far from alone in rejecting Obama .
Take Pikeville , Kentucky .
It welcomes visitors with a cheerful sign that boasts it is one of ' the 100 best small towns in America ' .
But it is not friendly country for Obama .
On Pikeville 's main street , just outside a now abandoned Obama campaign office , Stanley Little laughed when asked if he could support Obama .
' I will vote for McCain , ' he said .
Little , a maintenance man for local offices , had one simple reason why he too was rejecting his long family history of voting Democrat .
' McCain is one of us .
Obama ain't , ' he said , leaving little doubt as to who he meant by 'us ' .
Pikeville 's rejection of Obama in Kentucky topped even Mingo County's .
Pike County , a huge stretch of forest and hills in the east of Kentucky , voted for Clinton by a thumping 91 per cent versus a mere 7 per cent for Obama .
Only nearby Magoffin County ( where Clinton scored 93 per cent ) is even less friendly to an Obama candidacy .
It is not just an Appalachian issue .
There are pockets of this sentiment across America from the working class white suburbs of Philadelphia to the rust belt towns of Ohio and Michigan .
Many poor , white Americans are prepared to flock to McCain rather than face a black occupant of the White House .
No public courtship between Obama and Clinton - carried out on the nation 's TV screens - is likely to change that .
In Georgia a local bar owner has been selling T - shirts featuring Obama being endorsed by a cartoon monkey eating a banana .
The sale prompted outraged coverage in the local media but the T - shirts quickly sold out .
In Vincennes , Indiana , an Obama campaign office was vandalised on the eve of the state 's primary , its windows smashed and its walls spray - painted with the words ' Hamas votes BHO ' ( for Barack Hussein Obama ) .
The difficult truth is that Appalachia is unusual mostly because many people here are willing to openly talk about what some of their fellow citizens are secretly thinking .
In exit polls of the recent primaries in Kentucky and West Virginia , one in five Democrats confessed to pollsters that race was a factor in their voting choice .
' West Virginia and Kentucky were just more honest than other parts of the country .
A lot of other people know it 's not socially acceptable to mention that sort of thing , ' said Professor Andra Gillespie , a political scientist at Emory University and expert on racial politics .
Indeed much of America 's media has been resolutely focused on a ' post - racial ' vision of America despite the clear evidence that race remains a huge divide in American life .
Obama 's own bi-racial background and his campaign 's language of inclusivity have conjured up a beguiling image of a race - free America .
It has built on other recent black political successes in America , such as Newark mayor Cory Booker and Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick , who have won on the back of black - white voting alliances .
There is truth to it too .
Obama has run a remarkable campaign , winning many white states such as Kansas and Montana .
He has attracted vast , racially diverse rallies , especially of young people who seem open to putting racial divides behind them .
And indeed there is much hope that Obama can change things .
Gillespie points out that recent studies have shown that white voters in US cities that have elected a black mayor for the first time prove far more willing to elect one for a second term .
' They realise the sky has not fallen in .
That life went on , ' Gillespie joked .
If Obama does win the White House , that experience could be repeated on a national scale for all Americans .
Few things could be more important in finally drawing the poison of racism out of American life .
But behind such optimism , another America looms .
It is an America far from the headlines that have proclaimed Obama 's candidacy a revolution that will atone for a race - tinged history .
This is the America where outrageous rumours that Obama is a Muslim are readily believed .
It is the America where Telvor is able to voice a sentiment that ' Obama might actually be the antichrist ' without apparent irony or fear of contradiction .
It is a slice of America trapped in the dreadful history of race relations and the legacy of slavery and segregation .
On the streets of towns such as Pikeville and Williamson , and in the minds of people like Little and Telvor , that past lives on .
It is kept in the present by poverty , joblessness and a fear of the different .
It is also a powerful force that should not be underestimated .
It could even decide who will be the next President .
' McCain will beat Obama .
There 's a lot of Democrats around here that will be switching side to vote for him , ' Little said .
Behind him a white - washed message in the closed Obama Pikeville office read : ' Vote Obama 08 : change ! '
In the brutal summer heat it seemed a forlorn hope .
It was asking for the overthrow of generations of entrenched prejudice .
But , come November , a black president might finally be pulling up a chair behind the desk in the Oval Office .
If he does , that slogan of change might just end up being a prophecy .
Even in Appalachia .

TEHRAN -- Expediency Council Chairman Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani declared here on Friday that the Western powers should take Iran ’s warning “ seriously ” regarding their wrong policies against the Islamic Republic .
Addressing the Western powers in a Friday prayer sermon , Rafsanjani said , “ You have adopted a wrong path , and through such approaches you only put Iran and the region in trouble , and will not benefit from such behavior .
” He said the West should “ take this warning seriously and stop its wrong and hegemonic approaches .
” The warning came as the 27 - nation European Union on Monday agreed new sanctions on Iran .
The sanctions move came as a surprise to Iranians as Tehran was still studying an updated package that EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana submitted to Iranian officials during his visit to Tehran on June 14 .
The sanctions include an asset freeze on Iran ’s largest state bank , Bank Melli , an act which Rafsanjani described as “ insolent ” .
The main bone of contention between Tehran and the West is Iran ’s nuclear enrichment program .
Iran is a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and has the legal right to enrichment for civilian purposes .
The former president said Iran has repeatedly declared that it does not seek nuclear weapons and only wants to develop its industry and benefit from peaceful nuclear energy .
“ We are prepared to build trust through political negotiations , ” Rafsanjani asserted .
“ They want to put extra pressure on us , ” he said .
Rafsanjani also called the G8 foreign ministers ’ statement on Iran “ duplicitous ” .
The Group of Eight foreign ministers meeting in Japan on Friday issued a statement urging Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program .
The Group of Eight comprises Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the United States .
“ We have advised the Western powers several times that their rhetoric against Iran is not to their interest and will not resolve the issue , ” Rafsanjani said .
He told the West , “ You are too insignificant to say if Iran should be rewarded or punished .
” He said a country like Iran can only be approached through “ appropriate rhetoric , negotiations , and reasonable statements ” .
The statements by Rafsanjani followed a warning by Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani who on Wednesday advised the world powers to heed IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei ’s warnings and stop “ provoking ” Iran .
Earlier this months ElBaradei said he would offer his resignation if the Islamic Republic was attacked .
Larijani said the distrustful atmosphere created by the West ’s recent behavior has left little chance for interaction .
The European Union needs to adopt “ constructive and logical ” strategies to regain Iran ’s trust , he added .
“ If you intend to hold talks with Iran over the package of proposals , why have you taken the path of confrontation before the package is investigated ? ” he asked the European Union .
The Majlis speaker warned that Iran is scrutinizing the EU ’s actions and will revise its cooperation “ if they decide to use negotiations as a means of justifying their illegal measures .

Something ’s wrong with the Republican logo .
The stars are upside down .
Five - sided stars that point upwards — like those on the Democratic donkey and the American flag — traditionally symbolize the forces of good .
An overturned pentagram , however , represents the goat ’s head of Satan and the forces of evil — and there are three on the Republicans ’ elephant .
The GOP ’s stars were n’t always upside down ; some say the change occurred around 2000 .
When I called up the RNC to ask about the logo ’s history , staffers invariably said , “ we ’ll have to get back to you on that ” and never did .
“ Huh , that ’s interesting , ” said one , who clearly had n’t noticed Satan hiding in plain view .
“ I have a feeling some neo -pagan democratic designed this logo , ” wrote a commenter on the conservative web site Free Republic .
Besides like - minded rants that the design is a huge slap in the Grand Old Party ’s face , some online chat - room goers speculated that the inverted stars are linked to secret society symbolism .
In any case , the stars have not only turned for the Republicans : A Hillary Clinton website featured a photo of an American flag with upside down pentagrams at the time of the New Hampshire primary .

Gas Prices Taking Effect : 11 Billion Fewer Miles Driven
This March
It seems like high gas prices are finally having an affect on the US .
For a while , people got by on the hope that prices were just in a spike , but with oil prices soaring above even the most cynical forecasts , it looks like expensive gas , and changed driving habits , are here to stay .
The Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) just released their March , 2008 numbers , and they show a huge decline of 4.3 % over last March .
4.3 % might not seem like a whole lot , but just by looking at the above graph , you can see that any drop would be in huge contrast to the trend over the last 25 years .
2008 marks the first time since 1979 that there has been a drop in miles travelled in over the month of March .
This drop corresponds to 11 billion less miles traveled , according to FHWA .
Over the first quarter of 2008 , greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector have also dropped 9 million metric tons compared to past years , something that no amount of political posturing has yet to accomplish .
As we come up on the most heavily travelled summer months and a national average price for unleaded gasoline about to pass the magic $ 4.00 mark , it will be interesting to see if this trend continues .
When more data comes out , we ’ll be sure to cover it .
In the meantime , you can check out these breakdowns of miles travelled in both city and rural areas over the last 3 years :

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The unrelenting rise in oil prices has put U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in the precarious position of trying to talk down inflation without raising interest rates .
The result may be a blow to the central bank ’s credibility , just as Bernanke was finally winning plaudits from many on Wall Street for his handling of the credit crisis .
“ They ’ve painted themselves into a corner , ” said Gabriel Stein , an economist at Lombard Street Research in London .
“ I think the Fed is losing credibility by the buckets right now . ”
The Fed is expected to keep its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent when its policy - setting committee meets this week .
It has more than halved rates since mid-September in a bid to prevent the housing slide and credit contraction from triggering a deep recession .
But as the U.S. economy weakened in recent months and rates fell , the dollar ’s slump deepened .
That has contributed to rising prices for oil and other commodities that are priced in dollars , and has also made imports more expensive .
Overall inflation rose by an uncomfortably high 4.2 percent year - over - year in May , which under normal circumstances might have encouraged the Fed to raise rates .
The trouble is , the economy remains fragile , as evidenced by the persistent rise in unemployment , the still - weakening housing market , and a slowdown in manufacturing .
And it is not just a U.S. problem .
Inflation is running at the highest level in more than a decade in China and India .
Mexico ’s central bank raised borrowing costs for the first time in eight months on Friday to tackle inflation stemming primarily from soaring food prices .
“ The dilemma now faced by the ( Fed ’s monetary policy ) committee is that while the economy has not collapsed , it is not exactly providing signs of an imminent recovery , ” said Joseph Brusuelas , chief economist with Palo Alto , California - based Merk Investments .
The Fed “ is caught in between what it should do -- raise rates -- and what it needs to do , remain on hold . ”

BERNANKE VS TRICHET
In a speech earlier this month , Bernanke tried to tackle price pressures another way , by raising concerns about the inflationary impact of the falling dollar .
That caught investors ’ attention because it is unusual for the Fed chairman to talk about currency matters , which are normally the purview of the Treasury secretary .
While Bernanke ’s comments sent the dollar higher and cooled the oil rally , markets reversed course just days later when Bernanke ’s European Central Bank counterpart , Jean - Claude Trichet , said an ECB rate hike could come as early as July .
That prompted some investors to speculate that there may be a rift between the two central banks , although sources on both sides of the Atlantic dismissed that idea .
Still , whether there is bad blood or not , the gap between U.S. and euro zone interest rates looks likely to widen further , and that could put more pressure on the dollar -- and provide more fuel to the oil market .
If the ECB raises its rate by one - quarter of a percentage next month as expected , it would stand at 4.25 percent , more than double the federal funds rate .
That would encourage currency traders to dump dollars in favor of higher yielding euros .
Complicating matters for both Bernanke and Trichet is the fact that much of the inflation pressure is coming from beyond their borders .
Emerging markets accounted for more than 50 percent of oil consumption last year , up from 30 percent in the 1960s , according to JPMorgan research .
As oil prices surged above $ 130 per barrel , pushing U.S. gasoline costs to the psychologically significant $ 4 per gallon , U.S. consumers have cut back on driving and sought more fuel - efficient ways of doing business .
Emerging markets have been slower to curb their usage , but that looks set to change .
JPMorgan predicted that global oil demand would fall this year for the first time since 1993 .
Just last week , China increased retail gasoline and diesel prices by as much as 18 percent , which may help cool demand .
But with world oil supplies tight , it still may not be enough to bring U.S. cost pressures back down to the Fed ’s comfort level , leaving Bernanke in a stagflation bind should the economy keep slowing while price pressures persist .
If inflation remains stubbornly high , Bernanke may have to do more than just talk about it , a strategy that Lombard ’s Stein dubbed , “ speak loudly and carry a twig . ”
Stein said Bernanke had already done damage to the Fed ’s inflation - fighting credibility in recent weeks when he and other Fed officials talked tough -- only to retreat when markets got carried away and priced in a series of rate hikes .
“ When Trichet says ‘ We ’re going to raise rates , ’ markets say ‘ We believe you . ’
When Bernanke says ‘ We ’re going to raise rates , ’ markets say , ‘ Why should we believe you ? ’ ” Stein said .
I ’ve always been bothered by those " Property Of Blank University " t- shirts that used to actually be the loaned ( or stolen ) property of college athletic departments but have now become popular enough that you can find them , for sale , in nearly any university store or gift shop in the US .
Few people would assume that somebody with a " Property of " shirt had stolen their clothing .
In fact , it ’s often impossible to find the shirts except on sale anymore — and rarely from universities themselves .
Here ’s my response .
For those that do n’t know ( and that ’s certainly many ) , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon is the nineteenth century French anarchist and mutualist most famous for saying , " La propriété , c’est le vol ! "
In English : " Property is theft ! "

The DIA and the military services maintain a large number of military attachés and a much smaller network of clandestine case officers to satisfy foreign intelligence requirements .
The Defense HUMINT Service became operational October 1 , 1995 , to consolidate the human intelligence ( HUMINT ) capabilities of the DIA , Army , Navy , and Air Force .
The proposed section extends to the DIA the language of the CIA Information Act of 1984 , which exempted certain files in the CIA 's directorate of operations from the Freedom of Information
Act on the basis of an extensive public record , multiple hearings , and specificity as to exactly which files would be covered .
Unlike the CIA
Act , however , there were no public hearings on the proposed DIA exemption , no debate , no testimony , and no public record other than a misleading five - paragraph " background paper " from the DIA .
And while the CIA had argued in 1984 that the operational exemption would actually produce a net increase in released material , it is clear that the application of such an exemption to the DIA would drastically reduce the number of documents currently being released .
Released Documents that would be Withheld under the Proposed Legislation
Excerpt of a February 1976 report from the U.S. defense ( DATT ) and Air Force ( AIRA ) attachés in Santiago , Chile .
HUMINT Reports on Human Rights Abuses in Chile and Guatemala HUMINT Reports on other Political and Military Issues The State Department 's Electronic Reading Room
If passed by the full Congress the legislation would effectively shield the activities of foreign death squads , torturers and kidnappers from public scrutiny and would greatly undermine the efforts of official truth commissions  many of which have been aided by the declassification of such records  to clarify responsibility for human rights violations .
Below are examples of the kinds of military HUMINT reports that would be exempt from release if the Senate language is included in the final bill .
The first eleven documents  released through FOIA and special declassification projects  contain important information on human rights abuses committed by Chilean and Guatemalan security forces .
The next set of documents cover a range of political and military matters and are included to illustrate the broad range of topics covered by defense intelligence operational reports .
These records are just a small sample of the hundreds of DIA HUMINT reports that the Archive has obtained .
There are also many more of these kinds of DIA documents available at the State Department 's Electronic Reading Room , including dozens of additional reports about human rights violations in Chile and Guatemala .
HUMINT Reports on Human Rights Abuses in Chile and Guatemala
U.S. Defense Attaché , Santiago , " DINA , Its Operations and Power , " February 6 , 1974 .
The reporting officer ( " R.O. " ) relates a conversation he had with an undisclosed source about a pending legal matter in Chile shortly after the military coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet .
Referring to a matter unrelated to intelligence , the source tells the officer that it can be accomplished as long as the Chilean National Intelligence Directorate ( DINA ) approves .
The source explains that there are three souces of power in Chile : " Pinochet , God , and DINA . "
U.S. Defense Attaché , Santiago , to DIA , " Activity at Suspected Chilean Air Force Interrogation Building , " February 2 , 1976 .
The U.S. Defense and Air Force attachés provide an eyewitness account of the beating of detainees outside a suspected Chilean Air Force interrogation building in Santiago .
The officers report that guards " armed with police type billy clubs " repeatedly struck prisoners " most frequently at the rear of knee joints . "
Another source reports that one of the prisoners , a small boy , was repeatedly struck by the guards , who also banged the head of an elderly man against the wall .
U.S. Defense Attaché , Santiago , to DIA , " Disappearance of Eduardo and Julio Budnick , " August 5 , 1976 .
A source confirms to the U.S. Air Force attaché that two Jewish businessmen , Eduardo and Julio Budnick , have been detained by the Chilean government .
" Based on source 's position " and on information from a separate source , the reporting officer believes that the Budnicks are being held by Chilean intelligence .
U.S. Navy Defense Attaché , Santiago , " Covert Countersubversive Activities in Chile , " November 5 , 1977 .
[ Best Copy Available ]
The U.S. Defense attaché in Santiago provides information concerning recent covert intelligence operations carried out by Chilean security forces .
The operations , the source reports , are intended " to deal with the threat , real or imagined , of extremist subversion . "
The report details the involvement of Chilean security forces in kidnappings and robberies designed to appear to be the work of leftist subversives , and in bombings directed against safe houses used by the left .
A source explains that the military intelligence chiefs had determined that " the best way to deal with the safe house problem was blowing them up , if possible , with the terrorists present . "
DIA , " Suspected Presence of Clandestine Cemeteries on a Military Installation , " April 11 , 1994 . [ Guatemala ]
Sources tell U.S. military intelligence officials that from 1984 - 86 , the army 's intelligence directorate ( D - 2 ) coordinated the counterinsurgency campaign in southwest Guatemala from the southern airbase at Retalhuleu , using it as both an operations post and an interrogation center .
Small buildings that were once used as interrogation cells have since been destroyed , and pits " that were once filled with water and used to hold prisoners " have been filled with concrete .
To dispose of the prisoners after interrogation , D - 2 personnel would fly them out over the ocean and push them  sometimes still alive  out of the aircraft .
" In this way , the D - 2 has been able to remove the majority of evidence showing that the prisoners had been tortured and killed . "
Officers currently stationed at Retalhuleu wishing to grow plots of vegetables have been denied permission to cultivate certain areas " because the locations . . . were burial sites that had been used by the D - 2 during the mid-eighties . "
DIA , " The Fate of Those Captured , " November 3 , 1994 . [ Guatemala ]
An informant attests that guerrillas captured by the Guatemalan military must work with military intelligence ( D - 2 ) against their former units or face summary execution .
Only those with significant " propaganda value " are paraded before the media , while most all others are interrogated extensively , and then either recruited by the D - 2 or killed .
The source adds that this has been a long - standing practice that has not changed under the army 's current leadership .
DIA , " The Rising Impact of the Bamaca Case on the Guatemalan Military Establishment , " November 24 , 1994 .
[ Guatemala ]
A source within the Guatemalan military describes the army 's response to increasing U.S. pressure to clarify the fate of captured rebel leader Efraín Bámaca Velásquez  the husband of an American lawyer .
The army high command , the source states , has ordered military personnel to destroy any " incriminating evidence . . . which could compromise the security or status of any member of the Guatemalan military . "
The destruction of documents , holding pens and interrogation facilities has already been accomplished at the Retalhuleu air base , and the army has designed a strategy to block future " United Nations investigating commissions " from entering bases to examine army files .
The author of the cable asserts that , " All written records concerning this case and probably a thousand others like it have , by now , been destroyed . "
DIA , " Problems with Military History , " February 24 , 1995 .
[ Guatemala ]
The Guatemalan army vice chief of staff has reportedly prevented an army historical commission  charged with writing an official history of the internal conflict  from gaining access to the Guatemalan army archives .
In doing so , Pineda has defied orders from his immediate superiors , and is said to be working with officers from the Intelligence Directorate ( D - 2 ) " to keep embarrassing ' events from reaching public scrutiny . "
The source is concerned " that some records may  disappear ' as a result of BG Pineda and friends [ sic ] efforts . "
Memorandum for Director of Operations , US Army Foreign Intelligence Activity , " Operational Summary of Intelligence Information [ Excised ] RE : Efraín Bamaca , Michael DeVine , and Colonel Julio Alpirez , " April 17 , 1995 .
[ Guatemala ]
An undisclosed source provides information on the involvement of Guatemalan Col. Julio Alpirez in the murders of U.S. citizen Michael DeVine and guerrilla commander Efraín Bámaca Velásquez , the husband of an American lawyer .
Bámaca , who was captured by the army in 1989 , was placed in a full body cast to prevent escape , and later executed .
DeVine , an innkeeper , was picked - up by an army patrol investigating his ties to arms and narcotics trafficking .
He " was tortured and murdered " by one of the soldiers who reportedly " wanted to rob him of what he carried . "
DIA , " HUMINT to Suffer with Loss of Military Commissioners , " July 20 , 1995 .
[ Guatemala ]
A source tells the reporting officer that a recent decision by the Guatemalan president to disband a nation - wide network of civilian intelligence informants will dramatically weaken the army 's HUMINT capability .
The military commissioners have historically " formed the backbone of the G - 2's HUMINT networks , " but have also been involved in activities " which could have been labeled as illegal by current human rights standards , " such as " the elimination of individuals viewed to be a threat to the government and the army . "
DIA , " Transition of the Military Commissioners , " August 29 , 1995 .
[ Guatemala ]
Although the network of some 35,000 Guatemalan military commissioners is to be formally decommissioned [ see previous document ] , more than 25,000 will be secretly retained as " army collaborators " and " will continue to have an invisible role within the army . "
This arrangement , according to the source , " allows the army total deniability if and when they are asked if the military commissioners have been totally disbanded . "

Proposed Legislation
S.2549
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001
( passed by the Senate July 14 , 2000 )
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate was expected to approve as soon as Wednesday the biggest government program yet to tackle a deep housing market slump feared to be dragging the economy into recession .

The legislation would create a $ 300 billion fund to help up to 400,000 troubled homeowners refinance costly , exotic mortgages into more affordable , government - backed loans .
It easily cleared a Senate test vote by an 83 - 9 vote on Tuesday .
The bill is opposed by the White House but supported by Democrats and many Republicans .
It would also overhaul regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored enterprises that are the largest U.S. mortgage financing companies .
If the Senate approves it , the bill would have to be reconciled with a similar measure already passed by the House of Representatives .
Lawmakers hope to send a final package to President George W. Bush by mid-July .
The two main Democratic authors of the legislation , Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank and Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd , met face - to - face on Tuesday .
The White House signaled on Tuesday that it could support the bill if lawmakers trimmed certain spending provisions .
“ The most significant concern that we have with the bill is that it would provide for $ 4 billion to states to purchase already foreclosed homes , ” Bush administration spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters .
“ And our concern is that that just helps the banks , that does n’t the consumers . ”
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said some part of the Senate bill are objectionable and the Bush administration wants them changed .
He declined to say whether the White House would veto the bill .
Alabama Sen . Richard Shelby , the main Republican architect of the housing package , said he expects that some spending will be dropped before the bill is presented to Bush .
“ I think at the end of the day , we will knock that out , ” Shelby said of the state grants , in remarks to reporters .
The proposed refinancing fund would be bankrolled by a tariff on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Other provisions of the bill would send $ 4 billion in aid to communities hard hit by foreclosures , reform mortgage disclosure and give $ 180 million to loan counseling centers .
As Congress debated , more industry data underscored the severity of the housing slump .
Home prices slid 15.3 percent in April compared to a year earlier , according to a survey of top metropolitan regions from S&P / Case Shiller .
The glut of vacant homes on the market , caused by falling prices and rising foreclosures , has made the stocks of some homebuilders look cheap , said investment bank Credit Suisse .
Credit Suisse forecast that home inventories would peak in spring 2009 .
“ This bill needs to be made law as soon as possible , ” Jerry Howard , chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders , an industry group , said at the press conference .
Think you might escape the aftereffects of a limited nuclear war that happens on the other side of the globe from you ?
Think again .
Imagine that the long - simmering conflict between India and Pakistan broke out into a war in which each side deployed 50 nuclear weapons against the other country 's megacities .
Karachi , Bombay , and dozens of other South Asian cities catch fire like Hiroshima and Nagasaki did at the end of World War II .
Beyond the local human tragedy of such a situation , a new study looking at the atmospheric chemistry of regional nuclear war finds that the hot smoke from burning cities would tear holes in the ozone layer of the Earth .
The increased UV radiation resulting from the ozone loss could more than double DNA damage , and increase cancer rates across North America and Eurasia .
" Our research supports that there would be worldwide destruction , " said Michael Mills , co-author of the study and a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
" It demonstrates that a small - scale regional conflict is capable of triggering larger ozone losses globally than the ones that were previously predicted for a full - scale nuclear war . "
Combined with the climatic impact of a regional nuclear war – which could reduce crop yields and starve hundreds of millions – Mills '
modeling shows that the entire globe would feel the repercussions of a hundred nuclear detonations , a small fraction of just the U.S. stockpile .
After decades of Cold War research into the impacts that a full - blown war between the Soviet Union and the United States would have had on the globe , recent work has focused on regional nuclear wars , which are seen as more likely than all - out nuclear Armageddon .
Incorporating the latest atmospheric modeling , the scientists are finding that even a small nuclear conflict would wreak havoc on the global environment ( . pdf ) – cooling it twice as much as it's heated over the last century – and on the structure of the atmosphere itself .
Mills ' work , which appears online today in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science , used a model from National Center for Atmospheric Research to look at the impact of throwing 5 million metric tons of black carbon , or soot , into the atmosphere .
He found that when a cluster of cities are burning together , they end up creating their own weather , pumping soot 20,000 feet into the atmosphere .
Once there , sunlight would heat the smoke , and drive it up 260,000 feet above the earth 's surface .
Along the way , the hot soot would cause a variety of atmospheric changes with a net result of huge reductions in ozone , which in the stratosphere serves as sunblock for the earth .
In the middle latitudes , the researchers found the ozone layer would be reduced by 25 to 45 percent , with the polar regions losing 50 to 70 percent of their ozone coverage .
This thinning is known as a " hole " in the ozone layer , and would be many times the size of the famed hole over Antarctica .
According to research cited by the paper , the increase in ultraviolet light falling to earth at the 45 - degree latitude – a little south of Portland , Oregon – would cause damage to DNA to increase 213 percent .
" It would have a dramatic effect on skin cancer and cataracts and be very damaging to crops and ecosystems , " Mills said .
The reduced levels of ozone would persist for five years , with substantial reductions in ozone continuing for another five years after that .
Even if the cause of the war were local , its impacts would be felt across the globe .
" Pretty much everywhere [ would be ] affected , " Mills concluded .

These enclaves have emerged on the outskirts of prospering , overburdened cities , from this frontier town next to the capital to the edges of seam - splitting Bangalore .
They allow their residents to buy their way out of the hardships that afflict vast multitudes in this country of more than one billion .
And they reflect the desires of India ’s small but growing ranks of wealthy professionals , giving them Western amenities along with Indian indulgences : an army of maids and chauffeurs live in a vast shantytown across the street .

“ A kind of self - contained island ” is how Mrs. Chand ’s husband , Ashish , describes Hamilton Court .
India has always had its upper classes , as well as legions of the world ’s very poor .
But today a landscape dotted with Hamilton Courts , pressed up against the slums that serve them , has underscored more than ever the stark gulf between those worlds , raising uncomfortable questions for a democratically elected government about whether India can enable all its citizens to scale the golden ladders of the new economy .
“ Things have gotten better for the lucky class , ” Mrs. Chand , 36 , said one day , as she fixed lunch in full view of Chakkarpur , the shantytown where one of her two maids , Shefali Das , lives .
“ Otherwise , it is still a fight . ”
When the power goes out , the lights of Hamilton Court bathe Chakkarpur in a dusky glow .
Under the open sky , across the street from the tower , Mrs. Das ’s sons take cold bucket baths each day .
The slum is as much a product of the new India as Hamilton Court , the opportunities of this new city drawing hundreds of thousands from the hungry hinterlands .
In China , the main Asian competitor to which India is often compared , the state managed early on to harness economic expansion for huge public works projects and then allow more and more Chinese to partake of the benefits .
There , the poor are far less likely to be deprived of basic services , whether clean water or basic schooling .
Tea and ... what ?
Toast ?
Sympathy ?
No , oranges .
From the start Leonard Cohen was out to surprise by cunning .
No wonder , then , that he had to struggle for attention in the golden age of screamers .
Janis 's ecstatic rasp , Hendrix 's maddened guitar , Lennon 's glottal roar , even Dylan 's adenoidal faux - country all made sounds through which their lyrical inventions had to fight for air , and if not quite up to snuff , those words could hide behind the wall of noise .
But Cohen 's minimalist drone was the drowsy couch on which his poetry lay , fully exposed , with nowhere else to go .
In the 60s , his lyrics grabbed attention through teasingly incongruous unions : " Like a worm on a hook / Like a knight from some old - fashioned book " .
For all I know , Suzanne did feed Leonard tea and oranges , but it was the coupling of the prosaic and the exotic ( oranges , as Cohen well knows , did indeed come originally " all the way from China " ) , the yoking together of serenity and sharpness , that makes the line jump from the chant .
Suzanne is , after all , " half crazy " so when she takes " you down to her place near the river " it may not be entirely for a picnic .
On the other hand , " that 's why you want to be there " .
OK , then , peel me an orange .
More than many great singer - songwriters of his generation ( Dylan excepted ) , Cohen makes no bones about reaching for the heavy literary hitters for inspiration .
Lorca gave him the spooky , beautifully sinister Take This Waltz - although Cohen 's free translation of the Spanish arguably makes a more unsettlingly powerful poem than the original - " a forest of dried pigeons " ( Lorca ) becomes " there 's a tree where the doves go to die " ( Cohen ) ; " take this waltz with its closed mouth " ( Lorca ) turns to " take this waltz with the clamp on its jaw " ( Cohen ) .
When Cohen does invoke the canon it 's usually with a shrewd knowledge of how it 's been used and abused through the generations .
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's Sail On , O Ship of State , the anthem on which Cohen 's Democracy builds to the marching beat of a snare drum , was written in 1850 as fears for the endurance of the Union were grave .
After the civil war , the poem , set to music for choral performance , accompanied routine displays of patriotic chest - beating .
But the tone of Cohen 's Democracy could scarcely be less rah-rah ; it 's more a scalding spit in the eye .
" It 's comin ' ... from the fires of the homeless , from the ashes of the gay ...
From the homicidal bitchin' /
That goes down in every kitchen ...
From the wells of disappointment /
Where women kneel to pray . "
Compared to the freakshow ferocity that dominates The Future , in which Cohen turns porno - totalitarian : " Give me absolute control / Over ev 'ry living soul " ; " Give me crack and anal sex / Take the only tree that 's left /
And stuff it up the hole in your culture " .
Democracy is , if not exactly warm and cuddly , at least a qualified redemption : " I love the country but I can't stand the scene " .
The starchy Longfellow anthem gets made over , in the election year of 1992 , into a disabused song of possibility .
For a while , projecting his own bouts of depressive melancholy on to the state of things , Cohen specialised in acid - burn nihilistic jeremiads , demonic impersonations of the forces of darkness , growled at the mic .
The Book of Revelation took over from New Testament sweetness , which came as a relief to those of us who had had enough of his gentle Jesus , the kind that shows up at music festivals in knee - hole jeans smilingly beatifically , ready for dope and three days of love .
Cohen 's gospel people stalk through contemporary streets and bedrooms , so the card dealer of The Stranger Song turns out to be : " Just some Joseph looking for a manger " .
But every so often the more adamant Yahweh of the Old Testament shows up , bringing the year 's transgressions to a mighty reckoning .
A cohen is , after all , a high priest .
As seriously as he takes this persona of Satan deploring sin , it 's the more inward meditations on his favourite subject - " L. Cohen " ( as he styles himself at the end of Famous Blue Raincoat ) - that have always drawn from him the most intensely felt and precisely visualised writing , and have challenged his melodic composition to go beyond minimalist dirge to match the force of the poetry .
Cohen 's subjects in this vein of mutilated romanticism have been the usual post - Renaissance suspects : valedictions , loss and remorse , emotional cruelty ( inflicted and received ) , the inseparability of tenderness and pain .
Sometimes images , often of wistfully recollected visions - " Your hair on the pillow like a sleepy golden storm " , in Hey , That 's No Way to Say Goodbye - are allowed to hang in the song for the sheer metaphorical hell of it .
They work so seductively they disarm the carping lit-crit who might pause to wonder if storms , unlike the lover , can actually ever be " sleepy " ?
If there 's just a touch too much of happy self - regard about some of those early ballads , from the mid 70s on , the onset of years Cohen saw in his musical mirror encouraged him to use imagery as building blocks in beautifully constructed , authentically poetic narratives .
In the sad love triangle of Famous Blue Raincoat , Cohen transfers a garment he wore to fraying point to " my brother , my killer " , who had run off with his wife , and had given her just " a flake of your life / And when she came back she was nobody 's wife " .
In the strongest songs of this period , Cohen makes sure to skid away from self pity - " Well , my friends are gone / And my hair is gray / I ache in the places where I used to play " - into something more akin to rueful gratitude : " I 'm just paying my rent every day / In the Tower of Song . "
So perhaps it 's not surprising that Hallelujah , the song in which music making and love making wrestle with each other , is the one most covered by other singers , and without draining the power of the piece into empty rhapsody .
But to get the heartache you want from Cohen - and you know you do - you need to hear the old ( ish ) baffled , battle - scarred Cohen himself sing " The minor fall , the major lift " , his voice falling for the forbidden Bathsheba bathing naked on the roof , where " Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you " .
But nothing works out as planned .
The overthrow happens as the music soars , the omnipotent sovereign - psalmist is bound and shorn , and it's from that moment , when the composing - lover is pierced to the quick , that music gets born .
Hallelujah .
Welcome , watchdog.net
As you ’ve probably noticed , it ’s political insanity season in the US .
I can hardly go outside these days without running into someone complaining about the latest piece of campaign gossip .
I ’ve mostly tried to keep it off this blog , but it ’s hard to not get swept up in the fever .
As someone who wants to make a difference in the world , I ’ve long wondered whether there was an effective way for a programmer to get involved in politics , but I ’ve never been able to quite figure it out .
Well , recent events and Larry Lessig got me thinking about it again and I ’ve spent the past few months working with and talking to some amazing people about the problem .
I ’ve learned a lot and must have gone through a dozen different project ideas , but I finally think I ’ve found something .
It ’s not so much a finished solution as a direction , where I hope to figure more of it along the way .
So the site is called watchdog .
net and the plan has three parts .
First , pull in data sources from all over — district demographics , votes , lobbying records , campaign finance reports , etc. — and let people explore them in one elegant , unified interface .
I want this to be one of the most powerful , compelling interfaces for exploring a large data set out there .
But just giving people information is n’t enough ; unless you give them an opportunity to do something about it , it will just make them more apathetic .
So the second part of the site is building tools to let people take action : write or call your representative , send a note to local papers , post a story about something interesting you ’ve found , generate a scorecard for the next election .
And tying these two pieces together will be a collaborative database of political causes .
So on the page about global warming , you ’ll be able to learn more about the problem and proposed solutions , research the donors and votes on the issue , and see or start a letter - writing campaign .
All of it , of course , is free software and free data .
And it ’s all got a dozen different APIs to make it easy for others to build on what we ’ve done in their own work .
The goal is to be a hub , connecting citizens , activists , organizations , politicians , programmers , and everybody else who ’s interested in politics .
The hope is to make it as interesting and easy as possible to pull people into politics .
It ’s an ambitious goal with many pieces and possibilities , but with all the excitement right now we want to get something up as fast as possible .
So we ’ll be developing live on watchdog .
net , releasing pieces as soon as we finish them .
Our first goal is to put up data about every representative and a way to write them .
I ’ve managed to find an amazing group of people willing to help out with building it so far .
And the Sunlight Network has encouraged me and graciously agreed to fund it .
But we still need many more hands , especially programmers .
If you ’re interested in working on it , whether as a volunteer or for pay , please send me an email — me@aaronsw.com — telling me what you ’d like to help with .
We only officially started work yesterday , so there ’s not much up yet , but hopefully it ’ll give you a sense of where we ’re going :
You should follow me on twitter here .

I ’ve seen messages posted on this board refering to breaking in of new barrels .
What is this procedure ?
Is it different for chrome lined vs. regular barrels ?

The break in fad was started by a fellow I helped get started in the barrel business .
He started putting a set of break in instructions in ever barrel he shipped .
One came into the shop to be installed and I read it and the next time I saw him I asked him What was with this break in crap ?.
His answer was Mac , My share of the market is about 700 barrels a year .
I cater to the target crowd and they shoot a barrel about 3000 rounds before they change it .
If each one uses up 100 rounds of each barrel breaking it in you can figure out how many more barrels I will get to make each year .
If you will stop and think that the barrel does n’t know whether you are cleaning it every shot or every 5 shots and if you are removing all foreign material that has been deposited in it since the last time you cleaned it what more can you do ?
When I ship a barrel I send a recommendation with it that you clean it ever chance you get with a brass brush pushed through it at least 12 times with a good solvent and followed by two and only 2 soft patches .
This means if you are a bench rest shooter you clean ever 7 or 8 rounds .
If you are a high power shooter you clean it when you come off the line after 20 rounds .
If you follow the fad of cleaning every shot for X amount and every 2 shots for X amount and so on the only thing you are accomplishing is shortening the life of the barrel by the amount of rounds you shot during this process .
I always say Monkey see Monkey do , now I will wait on the flames but before you write them , Please include what you think is happening inside your barrel during break in that is worth the expense and time you are spending during break in

No flame here Mr. Mac .
When my personal history is comparable to yours , I may throw rocks – not until then though .
I have done this on factory barrels and had good results .
I usually use JB compound for the first few shots and through cleaning after range sessions .
The aggressive use of JB seems to smooth things up pretty quickly .
( duh ) I do not have a custom barrel on any of my rifles .
( yet )
Would you still hold that the procedure is unneeded on factory barrels ?

I answered this and lost it on transfer so will shorten this one and try to get my point across in fewer words .
When some one uses JB on one of my rifles I void the warrantee !
For two reasons .
!
it dimensionally alters the barrel dimensions and not evenly and the second reason is the barrel maker laps the barrel with a grit of lapping compound that is most effective in preventing metal fouling .
Then a customer polishes that finish away with JB .
I would n’t be as apposed to it if it were applied on a lead lap and very sparingly .
It is very obvious when you look at a barrel with a bore scopes all the sharp edges are worn off the rifling .
if it has JB used on it on a regular basis .
As you know , it is an abrasive of about 1000 grit .
As for using it on factory barrels I will say that while it is difficult to hurt a production barrel but the thing that hurts a match barrel will do the same to a factory barrel

I understand what you are saying about JB compound , but , for example , I have a rifle in .375×338
Mag that copper fouls so badly that even JB bore paste does n’t do it .
Even the stronger solvents do n’t seem to phase the stuff .
I have several other rifles that are just as bad .
What would you suggest I do ?
Please do n’t say buy another rifle .
If I do , my wife will kill me .

Gale , Please excuse my poor memory 8 ^ )
If I remember correctly , at AR15.com or maybe at Bushmaster ’s site I read something about having to fire 100 – 150 rounds with no cleaning or perhaps minimal cleaning .
The article said something about leaving some residue in the barrel to help polish / smooth the barrel ’s internal finish .
To clean the barrel before completing this break in procedure would put you back at square one .
This pertained to an AR15 with a chrome lined barrel .
From what you are saying …
I take it the break - in will only be a waste of ammo .
Am I understanding you correctly ?

Thats right .
it is a waste of barrel and time .
I do n’t know much about lined barrels but it may be that the barrel is rough due to the plating process .
With high volume fire as in full auto it helps to protect against erosion and no one is concerned with accuracy as it is spray and pray .

bullseye :
My credentials are n’t as impressive as Mr. McMillan ’s , but I do have some experience with new factory barrels and used ones that have been neglected or abused by previous owners .
Factory barrels are n’t lapped or polished as a rule ; the first couple of hundred shots through therefore , apparently serve to ‘ season ’ the bore , wearing away microscopic imperfections .
Especially during this time , firing too many rounds too fast is not a good practice .
I try to keep the barrel cool , especially until a few hundred shots have gone down the bore .
That means that at least at first , I shoot only a few shots per session , and of course cleaning after each session .
It ’s not so much the cleaning that helps is the gradual wearing in .
I have used JB Paste for years on neglected barrels , to scour out years of fouling there was nothing better until the electric de-re-unplaters came along .
Maybe JB is n’t good for fine lapped bores .
All I know is that it is a rejuvenator and accuracy restorer on neglected barrels of the ordinary kind .
As for chrome plated bores I have little experience with them , and can make no recommendation .

Gale , may I pick your brain on a question I have been wondering about ?
It has nothing to do with bbl break in , but this is as good a place as any to ask it .
You mentioned above that JB , and I ’m sure other compounds or cleaning methods ( I think the ‘ tornado ’ brushes are a plot by the factory bbl manufacturers ) , will wear down the sharp edges of the rifling .
My question is how important is the sharpness of the rifling to accuracy .
Have you done any experiments with sharp vs. dull rifling , all other aspects of the bbl being equal ?
Maybe this type of examination would be a better test of when a bbl has bit the dust instead of throat wear , for instance .
TIA

Look at it this way , A barrel starts out with nice sharp areas of the corners of the rifling .
Along the way you build a big fire in it a few thousand times and it burns the corners off .
Now take a barrel that to break in you put an abrasive on a patch and run it in and out .
The result is that you take the corners off the rifling so that all that fire which would have started with sharp rifling is now starting with rifling that is thousands of rounds old .
Which means that a lot of the life is gone .
A lap always cuts more on each end where the compound reverses direction as it starts back through the barrel which means that it is enlarging the bore at each ends of the barrel .
And last picture a patch riding along the barrel with abrasive on it .
It is removing material at a given rate .
It comes to a place where there is copper fouling and it rides over it cutting the same amount that it was cutting before it came to the copper .
You continue until all the fouling is gone and what have you done ?
You have put the came contour in the barrel steel that was in it when it was metal fouled .
It would not be as bad if it were used on a lead lap but I ask why would you want to abuse the barrel when you can accomplish the same thing without the bad side effects .
There is Sweats , Otters foul out or just a good daily cleaning with a good bore cleaner till the fouling is gone .
To top this off I will relate a true happening .
I built a bench rest rifle for a customer and as usual I fired 5 groups of 5 shots and calculated the aggregate .
It was good enough to see that the rifle was capable of winning the Nationals so I shipped it .
I got a call from the new owner saying how happy he was with it the way it shot .
About 4 weeks later the rifle showed up with a note saying it would n’t shoot .
Sure enough when I tested it it was shooting groups three times the size if the ones I had shot before I shipped it .
When I bore scoped it the barrel looked like a mirror and the rifling was n’t square it was half round .
From that time on I put a flyer in each gun saying if any abrasive was use in it voided the Warrantee .
Now I am not trying to stop you from doing what you want but just inform you what is happening when you use JB .
Brass brushes are softer than barrel steel and does no harm .
S/S brushes are harder than barrel steel is definetly a no no .
Nylon may surprise you to know is very abrasive
If you doubt this look at the carbide eye on yout fishing rod where nylon line has worn groves into it .

If the previous post was for me , I believe you misunderstood my question .
I absolutely believe you are correct about not using abrasives .
My question was on the effects of rounded rifling on accuracy .
Since the rifling is there to impart an angular velocity to a bullet , I was wondering if you had done any experiments with sharp vs. rounded rifling to see how much it affected the accuracy and any theories on why it affected it .
My comment on the tornado ( SS ) brushes shows that we are of a like mind on this .
My theory is that , as you hinted at , the use of abrasives near the muzzle create imperfections in the roundness of the bore and greatly affect the bullet as it leaves the muzzle .
Since it is almost impossible for a human to impart the same cleaning action on the entire inside diameter of the muzzle evenly , they can ruin the muzzle very quickly .
Any imperfections in this area , no matter how minute , can affect accuracy .
Using any harsh cleaning methods can cause these imperfections .

This is very interesting to me .
I have used JB and other compounds and I am rethinking that use .
Outers cleaning kits are fairly inexpensive …………..
John Feamster once wrote that his break in procedure for a target rifle was to clean every 60 rounds or so ..
The Barnes folks tell you to clean when your barrel stops shooting well ..
Things to think about .
I still like an aggressive cleaning on factory barrels for the first few rounds .
Might have to get the Foul - Out and see how it works .
Time for a new gun !!!!

As far as the stuff about AR15 barrels on the Bushmaster website goes , that is for chrome lined barrels only , and it says so in the text .
I know because I ’m the guy that wrote it .
In our experience at the factory , barrels would get less fouling if they were fired 200 or so rounds before the first cleaning , then cleaned whenever the accuracy started to suffer .
We recommended this on our lined barrels only , as the DCM rifles with unlined barrels we tried this on in testing did n’t respond well to it .
A “ Foul Out ” unit is probably the best bet for those , or any unlined barrel , and is handy for getting out fouling on lined barrels as well .
Everyone should be aware that this is one area that is being driven by popular demmand right now , with little or no real research being done by anyone in the industry .
Barrel break - in is rapidly becoming a popular myth , where some people will tell you straight out that no rifle will shoot if it ’s not “ broken in ” right .
Well , that ’s just crap .
Any barrel made well will shoot well unless it ’s neglected or abused , and that ’s just a simple fact .
Any effect breaking in a barrel may have would probably have to be measured with a micrometer at the target , as the difference would be almost neglegible .
I used to put it this way .
Unless you are firing from a solid benchrest , with front and rear rests , handloaded match ammo made specifically for the barrel you are shooting , and firing single shots allowing the barrel to cool between each round , you wo n’t be able to tell the difference anyway , so for crying out loud , go shoot your rifle !
More time using it and less time playing with it , and you ’ll be a lot happier .
Works on a lot of levels , if you get my meaning .
That ’s my $ .02 , if it ’s of any use to anyone .
Do n’t go nuts with breaking in rifle barrels , it ’s not worth the trouble .
As always , IMHO , YMMV , etc… — — —— ——

With regard to break - in of factory barrels , I can offer this observation :
In three brand - new rifles that I broke in over the last 3 years , ( 700 , M - 77 Mk II , M - 70 ) I ran dry patches through each and found … shavings !
No kidding !
I was esp. shocked to find fresh stainless steel shavings down the bore of the Sendero !
You can do what you want afterwards , but ALWAYS clean the bore thoroughly before that first shot out of a production rifle .
You might also want to strip the action and carfully wipe the lugs , too .
I just ca n’t believe that steel shavings grinding down your bore with the force of your first group can be very good for your future accuracy ! — — ————
Will you , too , be one who stands in the gap ?

The metal shavings would have had to get in the barrel after it was test fired .
The barrel was a hammer forged or buttoned barrel which is not machined and is very smooth finished .
No one ever said not to clean a new rifle only that it is not necessary to break it in .
" This Is Your Baby , Go To It "
he approved of his national security team personally deciding which specific torture techniques should be used against prisoners :
" Well , we started to connect the dots , in order to protect the American people . "
Bush told ABC News White House correspondent Martha Raddatz .
" And , yes , I 'm aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . "
As first reported by ABC News on Wednesday , the most senior Bush administration officials repeatedly discussed and approved specific details of exactly how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency .
The high - level discussions about these " enhanced interrogation techniques " were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed -- down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC news .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
" choreographing " the torture

Powell said that he did n't have " sufficient memory recall " about the meetings and that he had participated in " many meetings on how to deal with detainees . "
Powell said , " I 'm not aware of anything that we discussed in any of those meetings that was not considered legal . "
was
Then - Attorney General Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions .
He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal .
But he argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources said .
According to a top official , Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : " Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . "
beyond
For insights into healthy marriages , social scientists are looking in an unexpected place .
A growing body of evidence shows that same - sex couples have a great deal to teach everyone else about marriage and relationships .
Most studies show surprisingly few differences between committed gay couples and committed straight couples , but the differences that do emerge have shed light on the kinds of conflicts that can endanger heterosexual relationships .
The findings offer hope that some of the most vexing problems are not necessarily entrenched in deep - rooted biological differences between men and women .
And that , in turn , offers hope that the problems can be solved .
Next week , California will begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples , reigniting the national debate over gay marriage .
But relationship researchers say it also presents an opportunity to study the effects of marriage on the quality of all relationships .
“ When I look at what ’s happening in California , I think there ’s a lot to be learned to explore how human beings relate to one another , ” said Sondra E. Solomon , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Vermont .
“ How people care for each other , how they share responsibility , power and authority  those are the key issues in relationships . ”
A little Botox goes a long way in “ Sex and the City , ” but a little decent writing would have gone even further .
A dumpy big - screen makeover of that much - adored small - screen delight , the movie was written and directed by Michael Patrick King , one of the guiding lights and bright wits of the original series , based on Candace Bushnell ’s newspaper columns and subsequent book .
Once again , Sarah Jessica Parker has stepped into the dizzyingly high heels of Carrie Bradshaw , that postmodern Lorelei Lee  a hardly working New York writer with a passion for men and Manolos  but this time she ’s taken a terrible tumble .
Fans of the show were accustomed to Carrie ’s falls , metaphoric and literal ( as in her spectacularly horrible trip during her catwalk promenade ) ; they were crucial to the show ’s appeal , softening its hard , brittle edges .
Then in her mid-30s , Carrie was one of New York ’s most fearless of the zipless
It Girls , able to leap tall men in a single bound without batting a single mascaraed eyelash , but as the show ’s nifty opening credit sequence reminded you , episode after episode , she was n’t above getting muck on her tutu .
Her vulnerability  and that of her girlfriends  was the badly kept secret of the show , the glue holding together the froufrou , the lunches , those absolutely fabulous and ghastly clothes and all that muscly man bait .
The froufrou and the lunches are back , as are , kind of , Carrie ’s three girlfriends , Miranda ( Cynthia Nixon ) , Charlotte ( Kristin Davis ) and Samantha ( Kim Cattrall ) , all tricked out with their customary accessories ( men , children , handbags ) .
Also back and in and out of Carrie ’s bed is Mr. Big ( Chris Noth ) , the longtime lover and habitual heartbreaker with whom she had ( hallelujah ) reunited during the show ’s bitter and sweet finale four years ago .
Written by Mr. King , that episode opened with Carrie wandering Paris in a funk and then stumbling into bliss by literally falling to the ground with Big .
At once melancholic and defiantly hopeful , it was the kind of rueful happy ending that did n’t make you choke on your own tears .

“ Sex and the City ” delivered the television goods for six seasons , no small thing in the pop culture annals .
That should have been enough or at least plenty for all concerned , but Ms. Parker apparently felt compelled to go big screen , making good on a project that had started to come together in 2004 , only to fall apart over money issues and Ms. Cattrall ’s reluctance to climb aboard .
I wish Ms. Parker had let that bee in her bonnet go silent , because the movie that she and Mr. King have come up with is the pits , a vulgar , shrill , deeply shallow  and , at 2 hours and 22 turgid minutes , overlong  addendum to a show that had , over the years , evolved and expanded in surprising ways .
WASHINGTON  After months of wrangling , Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress struck a deal on Thursday to overhaul the rules on the government ’s wiretapping powers and provide what amounts to legal immunity to the phone companies that took part in President Bush ’s program of eavesdropping without warrants after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The deal , expanding the government ’s powers to spy on terrorism suspects in some major respects , would strengthen the ability of intelligence officials to eavesdrop on foreign targets .
It would also allow them to conduct emergency wiretaps without court orders on American targets for a week if it is determined that important national security information would otherwise be lost .
If approved , as appears likely , the agreement would be the most significant revision of surveillance law in 30 years .
The agreement would settle one of the thorniest issues in dispute by providing immunity to the phone companies in the Sept. 11 program as long as a federal district court determined that they received legitimate requests from the government directing their participation in the program of wiretapping without warrants .
With AT&T and other telecommunications companies facing some 40 lawsuits over their reported participation in the wiretapping program , Republican leaders described this narrow court review on the immunity question as a mere “ formality . ”
Another of the big four banks now believes the Australian dollar will rise above parity with the American greenback .
Three weeks ago Westpac tipped $ US1.01 for the Australian currency by early next year .
Now ANZ has raised its forecast to $ US1.04 by the end of this year .
The revised prediction has been prompted by a change of mind on interest rates .
ANZ expects official interest rates to be raised again twice this year , with the first tightening to come in August , in response to worsening inflation figures .
The currency 's strength will also be supported by high commodity prices and possibly more cuts to US interest rates .
Last week the dollar rose to its highest level since being floated in 1983 , pushing above 96.5 US cents .
At around 7:30 am AEST it was sitting at 95.85 US cents .

Ham hocks do n't do justice to my home cooking , and salt pork does n't either .
The only seasoning to give that delicious , salty , sultry , wonderful , smoky flavor is bacon grease .
Most Southerners are raised to save all forms of bacon grease and put it in a can next to the stove .
There ai n't no seasoning on the market shelves that can do the same bodacious things to food that bacon grease does .
Gone are the days when most of us had to load up on calories and fat to be fortified enough to pick cotton , wash diapers , bale hay , and drive the bush hog all day .
Nowadays , we do n't get enough exercise and need to cut calories and fat because no one wants the physique of an older Elvis Presley .
I agree that we should cut fat , but not bacon grease .
I will run laps around my mail box to work off any inches that glorious bacon grease might add to my thighs .
If I could n't season my cornbread with bacon grease , I might as well just eat a handful of sawdust .
For Sunday breakfast , I usually try to do something special for my family because all during the week , they eat frozen waffles , cold cereal , and Pop Tarts .
I fry a bunch of bacon and sausage , and then I spoon out some of the drippings and fry my eggs in it .
With the leftover drippings , I make sawmill gravy and ladle it over a couple of piping hot cat - head biscuits , oh baby .
Sawmill gravy is really yummy over grits , too , unless you are a liberal democrat who likes sugar on your grits .
I do n't want you to think that bacon grease is good only for your occasional sawmill gravy , beans , and cornbread .
Lord have mercy , no .
We Southerners have been known to use bacon grease just as we 'd use butter .
Some of us have been known to put it on the supper table with a spoon in it !
Bacon grease is the best seasoning for greens ( cabbage , turnip greens , collard greens , poke salet , spinach ) , beans ( pinto , navy , butterbean , kidney , green , Lima ) and peas ( black - eyed , purple - hulled , pink - eyed , English ) .
There are also other vegetables like grits , onions , potatoes , and carrots that bacon grease imparts its earthy flavoring .
In addition to vegetables , bacon grease makes a delicious dressing .
Heat some bacon grease in your favorite cast iron skillet , and stir in vinegar and sugar .
Serve this dressing hot and on the side with tossed tender young lettuce leaves and chopped green - tail onions .
Okay , now that I have persuaded you about bacon grease , where do you start ?
First , you have to start saving the drippings from your bacon .
You can put the grease in any container you like -- it just depends on your preferences .
I use an old percolator coffeepot to put my drippings in .
My Momma uses a real bacon grease holder .
Her container separates out the bits of bacon from the liquid grease .
Personally , I like all of those little pieces of bacon because they add character to my dishes .
Some folks cook up a bunch of bacon in their cast iron skillet and leave the grease sitting there .
The next time they cook , the grease is already in the pan and ready to go .
Just heat up the skillet with the grease and then plop in your eggs or hash browns .
The skillet wo n't rust ( actually , that 's how you season a cast iron skillet , by the way ) and the grease wo n't go bad unless a bug falls in the grease or you have mice in your house .
You may also wonder about the shelf life of bacon grease .
There is a restaurant in Memphis , Tennessee , named Dyer 's Hamburgers , that fries its hamburgers in eighty - five year old grease .
I reckon bacon grease would keep forever , but mine never lasts that long .
With a seasoning as versatile as bacon grease , you wo n't have to buy as much salt , ham hocks , and other flavorings .
Therefore , using bacon grease can save you a lot of money .
Go ahead down to the yard sale at the corner and purchase that pretty little grease container that you 've had your eye on since last week .
Next , fire up the stove and fry up a pound or two of bacon and then save your drippings .
Now you are prepared to create your own culinary masterpieces with the awesome flavoring of my dear bacon grease .

Danmec is a password - stealing trojan which has been around for a couple of years , but in the last year new components have been introduced by the author , turning it into a more complete crimeware family .
One of these components ( developed last year ) is the Asprox trojan , which is designed to create a spam botnet which appears to be solely dedicated to sending phishing emails .
As of yesterday , we observed the Asprox botnet pushing an update to the infected systems , a binary with the filename msscntr32.exe .
The executable is installed as a system service with the name " Microsoft Security Center Extension " , but in reality it is a SQL - injection attack tool .
When launched , the attack tool will search Google for .asp pages which contain various terms , and will then launch SQL injection attacks against the websites returned by the search .
The attack is designed to inject an iframe into the website source which will force visitors to download a javascript file from the domain direct84.com .
This file in turn redirects to another site , where additional malicious javascript can be found .
Currently the secondary site appears to be down , however it is likely that when successful , the site attempts to exploit the visitor 's web browser in order to install additional copies of either Danmec , Asprox and / or the SQL attack tool .
Because the tool is distributed by the botnet , it may appear to be worm - like in its operation , which may lead to conflicting reports in the media and blogs about the true nature of the attack .
However , the SQL attack tool does not spread on its own , it relies on the Asprox botnet in order to propagate to new hosts .
Additionally , a similar attack technique is currently being seen spreading game - password - stealing trojans from China .
Whether the tool is related or just the attack syntax is shared , it is clear that SQL injection attack activity is on the rise from multiple sources .
The initial HTTP requests used by the msscntr32.exe attack tool will appear similar to the following :
GET / page.asp?id=425;DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR( 4000 ) ; SET%20 @S=CAST(0x4400450043004C004100520045002000400054002000760061007200630 0680061007200280032003500350029002C00400043002000760061007200630068006

Connection : Close
Note the use of both Firefox and Opera in the User - Agent string .
This could be an effective means to block the attack in the short term , since User - Agent ACLs are built in to most modern webservers .
However , this is not likely to stay constant .
VirusTotal shows sparse detection by AV vendors at this time , but detection should improve in the coming days .
The following Snort signatures could be used to reliably detect spam coming into an MTA from an Asprox bot :
alert tcp any any -> any 25 ( msg : " Asprox - style Message ID " ; flags : A+ ; dsize : < 80 ; content : " Message - ID|3a20 | " ; depth:12 ; content : " |0d0a| " ; within : 68 ; flowbits : set , asproxmessageid ; flowbits : noalert ; http://www.secureworks.com/research/threats/danmecasprox sid:1001290 ; rev:1 ; ) alert tcp any any -> any 25 ( msg : " Asprox phishing email detected " ; flags : A+ ; content : " From|3a20 | " ; depth:6 ; content :

The answer is so simple that it may temporarily disorient you .
Civil unions are a government function Marriage is a church function
In other words , civil unions declare that two people are unified according to the government , e.g. taxes , insurance , power of attorney , etc. , while marriage declares two people united within a specific religious context ( God does or does not approve ) .
These are separate things .
So , all existing marriages should become civil unions , and governments should be the authority for all such partnerships in the future .
If someone would also like to get married ( whatever that means to them ) — either before or after entering into a civil union — they can take that to church where it belongs .
Governments should decide who can civilly unite , while the couple ’s church should maintain the right to deny them a marriage if something about them goes against that churches religious views ( interracial , gay , wrong faith , etc. ) .
If the couple does n’t like that decision they ’re free to choose another church .
In short , churches do n’t tell governments who can civilly unite ( secular ) , and governments do n’t tell churches who they can or cannot marry ( religious ) .
This approach elegantly embodies the American concepts of equality , separation between church and state , and religious freedom .
The only thing interesting about this approach is that we ’re collectively too stupid to realize that it ’s the solution .

TEHRAN ( Press TV ) --
A senior Iranian commander says the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps is geared up to counter any act of aggression against the country .
Speaking to reporters on an IRGC command ship in the Persian Gulf fleet headquarters , Major General Mohammad - Ali Jafari said Saturday that Iran ’s armed forces are prepared to detect and repel any potential attack against the country ’s nuclear facilities .
After overseeing a military exercise aimed at detecting and destroying mock targets in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz , Maj .
Gen. Jafari asserted that Iran ’s army is equipped with cutting - edge military warfare enabling it to instantly respond to any act of aggression .
The maneuver , which was a rehearsal of different passive defense methods , included torpedo and missile speedboat drills , sources told Press TV .
Maj .
Gen .
Jafari ’s remarks came a day after a New York Times report quoted Pentagon officials as saying that over 100 Israeli F - 16s and F - 15s staged a maneuver off the southern Mediterranean island of Crete in the first week of June .
According to the report , the Israeli jets flew more than 900 miles , roughly the distance from Israeli airfields to an Iranian nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz .
Although Israeli officials have declined to comment on the report , military analysts believe the exercise was a ‘ dress rehearsal ’ for a possible air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities .
Israel accuses Iran of ‘ producing bomb - grade uranium ’ and has repeatedly threatened the country with war .
This is while Israel bars inspections of its nuclear facilities and is widely believed to have over 200 nuclear warheads in its arsenal .
Israel calls its approach of neither denying nor admitting that it has nuclear weapons ‘ strategic ambiguity ’ .
Iran , however , is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and allows the UN nuclear watchdog to conduct inspections of its nuclear facilities .

Half say the government is doing too much , 43 % too little to solve country 's problems
PRINCETON , NJ --
When given a choice about how government should address the numerous economic difficulties facing today 's consumer , Americans overwhelmingly -- by 84 % to 13 % -- prefer that the government focus on improving overall economic conditions and the jobs situation in the United States as opposed to taking steps to distribute wealth more evenly among Americans .
Lack of Support for Wealth Redistribution Spans Political Party , Income Groups
Americans ' lack of support for redistributing wealth to fix the economy spans political parties : Republicans ( by 90 % to 9 % ) prefer that the government focus on improving the economy , as do independents ( by 85 % to 13 % ) and Democrats ( by 77 % to 19 % ) .
This sentiment also extends across income groups : upper - income Americans prefer that the government focus on improving the economy and jobs by 88 % to 10 % , concurring with middle - income ( 83 % to 16 % ) and lower - income ( 78 % to 17 % ) Americans .
Half of Americans Think Government Is Doing Too Much , Not Too Little
A separate question finds Americans more likely to believe government is doing too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses ( 50 % ) as opposed to saying government should do more to solve the country 's problems ( 43 % ) .
This broad question is not directed specifically at the economy , but reinforces the general idea that many Americans are leery of too much direct government intervention in fixing the country 's problems .
This philosophical issue appears to divide Americans by both political party and income groups .
Republicans think the government is currently doing too much , by 72 % to 24 % ; independents are split , with 47 % saying the government is doing too much and 44 % saying it is not doing enough ; and Democrats say the government needs to do more by 58 % to 36 % .
Upper - income ( 57 % to 38 % ) and middle - income ( 54 % to 40 % ) Americans tend to agree that the government is doing too much , while those with lower incomes tend to say the government should do more ( by 55 % to 36 % ) .
Commentary
With Barack Obama suggesting a variety of tax increases for upper - income Americans and John McCain opposing them , one might assume that Americans ' minimal support for government getting into wealth redistribution to help the economy would favor McCain .
Although the margins are much smaller when it comes to the idea that government is doing too much as opposed to too little to solve the country 's problems , this issue would also seem to favor McCain .
However , the situation gets somewhat more complicated when income and wealth redistribution are mixed with more specific efforts to stimulate the economy .
Consider the current tax rebates .
They represent a clear case of income redistribution because they are phased out for upper - income taxpayers .
Still , they also have had a stimulative effect on the economy , and they received overwhelming support across political lines when they passed in February .
Now Obama has proposed another economic stimulus package and a permanent $ 1,000 income - tax cut for lower - and middle - income taxpayers .
The idea seems to be that the government can't do much about surging food and energy prices -- but it can cushion the blow of these price increases on those who can least afford them by sending lower - and middle - income Americans cash payments and providing them with a tax reduction .
Obama would fund these payments by increasing taxes on higher - income Americans .
One presumed advantage of this proposed government approach to rising food and energy prices is that it allows the free markets to work .
Prices are then left to drive the adjustments the U.S. economy will have to make to manage the new reality of much higher global commodity costs .
And while the benefits of these payments will not be based on how much higher food and energy costs affect an individual consumer , thereby creating additional inequities , they will favor those who conserve .
For example , those who get government payments and do not own a car will be proportionally better off than those who do own a car and travel significant distances to work .
However , the downside is the income and wealth redistribution aspects of this process .
While , in the abstract , many Americans believe that the wealthy do not pay enough taxes , the forced - choice question reported on here shows that there is a strong feeling that taxing one group to give the money to another is not the favored approach to fixing the economy .
In sum , free - market advocates can take considerable solace in Americans ' overwhelming belief that the government should not focus on redistributing income and wealth , but on improving the overall economy .
And , to a lesser degree , Americans also believe government continues to do too much -- not too little -- to solve the nation 's problems .
On the other hand , the economic turbulence of 2008 could end up getting government into significant new income and wealth redistribution programs unless the Treasury and the Federal Reserve act soon to stabilize and reduce today 's unmanageable food and energy price increases .

The Japanese Logistics Pressurized module firmly attached to the International Space Station 's Harmony node .
Spacewalkers worked with robotic arm operators to install the module March 14 , 2008 , completing the space station 's 15 - nation partnership on orbit .
This story was updated at 11:59 a.m. ET .
HOUSTON ?
Two spacewalking astronautsworked through the night high above the Earth to install Japan 's first orbital room and attach hands to a two - armed robot named Dextre .
InternationalSpace Station ( ISS ) flight engineer Garrett Reisman and mission specialist RickLinnehan , a member of the STS - 123 space shuttle Endeavour crew , spent more thanseven hours outside of the space station to complete their on - orbitconstruction work .
With astronaut Takao Doi at the controls of the shuttle ' srobotic arm , their efforts left the JapaneseLogistics Pressurized module ( JLP ) securely latched onto the station .
" Takaoshows once again that he is the man , " said Dominic Gorie , commander of theSTS - 123 mission , who assisted Doi from Endeavour 's flight deck .
Doi , a JapanAerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) astronaut , is slated to open up thestation 's newest room Friday evening and complete the space station program 's15 - nation partnership on orbit .
Gorie andhis crew are slated to perform at least four more spacewalks during the longeststation - bound shuttle mission NASA has ever attempted .
In addition to Doi , Gorie worked with shuttle mission specialists Bob Behnken and Leopold Eyhartsto support the spacewalker 's efforts .
Linnehanand Reisman 's spacewalk started Thursday at 9:18 p.m. EDT ( 0118 GMT March 14 ) and wrapped up Friday morning at 4:19 a.m. EDT ( 0819 GMT ) .
The excursion wasReisman 's first and Linnehan 's fourth , giving the veteran spaceflyer 28 hours 22 minutes of total spacewalking time .
Neworbital room
Shortlyafter Linnehan and Reisman left the station 's Quest airlock Thursday night , they crawled across the ISS toward Endeavour 's payload bay .
Thespacewalking duo unplugged cables and removed protective covers from the 9.2 - ton module ?
the first piece of Japan 's Kibo massive three - part laboratory ?
making quick work of readying the cylindricalcloset , as Reisman has called it , for installation .
As the spacewalkersfinished configuring the room , they witnessed an orbital sunrise .
" Goodwork guys , sun 's coming up , " Mike Foreman , spacewalk choreographer and STS - 123 mission specialist , told his colleagues as the sun crept over the Earth .
" Check your visors . "
Doi and Gorie then grappled the JLP with Endeavour 's robotic arm , twisting and turning the module into place several hours later to the top of the Harmony node Fridayat 4:06 a.m. EDT ( 0706 GMT ) .
" Grappleconfirmed , " mission controllers here at Johnson Space Center said as Behnken and Eyharts secured the JLP into place .
Helpinghands
Leaving the Japanese module in shape for installation , Linnehan and Reisman moved to thepallet containing the piecesof Dextre on the Port - 1 truss of the space station .
The twoastronauts unwrapped the 115 - pound ( 52 - kilogram ) " hands " of therobot , known as orbital tool changeout mechanisms , and worked during the nextfour hours to bolt them onto the automaton 's 662 - pound ( 300 - kilogram ) arms .
In abriefing after the spacewalk , mission managers here at Johnson Space Centersaid a problem with supplying power to Dextre 's pallet is likely caused by a faulty " keep alive " cable that warms vital electronics .
Pierre Jean , actingprogram manager for the Canadian space station program , said grappling therobot's " head " with the space station robotic arm Friday eveningshould give it power and prove his team 's hypothesis .
" We 'repretty confident that 10 o'clock tonight we should have the answer to thisparticular [ problem ] , " Jean said .
Duringtheir orbital work , Linnehan and Reisman pointed out spectacular views of Earthbelow ?
atolls in the Indian Ocean , Madagascar , and Chicago 's night lightsincluded .
" Don 'tlook down , but over you 're left shoulder is New York , " Reisman toldLinnehan as they attached Dextre 's hands .
" You can make out Long Island sound , and you can see the whole thing at night .
It 's amazing . "
After theastronauts finished their work and secured themselves in the safety of theairlock , spacecraft communicator Nick Patrick congratulated Doi and " Dom " Gorie on their robotic arm work .
" Greatjob to all of you on the flight deck today , " Patrick said .
" Thankyou very much Nick , " Doi responded .
" Dom and I had a greattime . "
Shuttle Endeavour launchedfrom Kennedy Space Center early Tuesday morning anddocked at the space station Wednesday night .
Mission managers expect to seethe 100 - ton orbiter and its seven - astronaut crew on the ground March 26 around 8:33 p.m. EDT ( 0013 GMT March 27 ) .

Monday
THE best schools in the world , it is generally agreed , are in Finland .
In the OECD 's Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) studies , which compare 15 - year - olds ' reading , mathematics and science abilities in more than 50 countries , it routinely comes top .
So politicians , academics , think - tankers and teachers from all over the world visit Finnish schools in the hope of discovering the magic ingredient .
Journalists come too , and now it 's my turn .
And since I 'm coming this far north , I want to take in Sweden too .
That social - democratic paradise has carried out school reforms that make free - market ideologues the world over weak at the knees .
In the 1990s it opened its state - education system to private competition , allowing new schools to receive the same amount for each pupil as the state would have spent on that child .
Sweden is my first stop .
My week starts with post - breakfast coffee with Widar Andersson , an ex-chairman of Sweden 's Independent Schools Association .
When the independent schools reforms were first mooted in 1991 , he was a member of parliament for the Social Democrats , in one of their rare spells in opposition .
“ I think I was the only Social Democrat in favour of the reforms , ” he tells me .
In 1994 , when they came into force , he and two state - school teachers opened one of the very first independent schools .
It was not the first time he took on the state : years earlier he and a few other social workers had set up a private company trying innovative ways to treat drug addicts .
“ I learned there must be other ways to do things than those the state has decided are right , especially in a country like Sweden where the state is so large , ” he says .
Then I head to the education ministry .
The minister is in budget negotiations , but his officials brief me on the new government 's plans ( a centre - right coalition is once more in power ) .
Copying Finland seems to be the name of the game : more teacher training , and lots of special - needs teaching .
It must be galling to live next door to the world 's best schools , especially when to the rest of the world , the two countries look essentially identical .
Back in London , a Russian acquaintance who lived in Sweden for many years had offered me his explanation for the gap in school achievement between Finland and Sweden : Finland never did the 70s , he says , while the Swedes did it wholesale and are still stuck there .
Swedish teachers can't even take a child 's mobile phone away if he is using it during class , he fumes .
Bertil Östberg , State Secretary to Jan Björklund , the education minister , laughs and agrees ; apparently the great mobile - phone - in - class scandal was an issue in a previous election campaign .
“ We will give teachers the right to confiscate mobile phones , ” he assures me .
I hear that the 1970s orthodoxy — that competition and grades destroyed a child 's motivation — means that Swedish children who are failing to learn can proceed right through compulsory school without anyone intervening or even noticing .
If parents ask for a report , they can be given one — but it must n't include anything that looks like a grade .
I offer the sort of fatuity I imagine such documents include : “ Helen has contributed nicely to classroom discussion ” .
It is acknowledged as a classic of the genre .
The new government , I am told , will make grades and reports not only legal , but compulsory .
Next , a visit to Sodra Latin ( South Latin ) , a popular and prestigious gymnasium ( upper high school , for 16 - 19 - year - olds ) .
Education at this age is not compulsory , and although Sodra Latin is a state school , entry is highly competitive .
It is particularly strong in music , with chamber and symphony orchestras , a jazz band and an excellent choir .
The youngsters are clever and motivated .
But , says the head teacher , it is the first time most have experienced competition , and many study late — the school is open till 10 pm — and come in at weekends too .
I dine with Carl - Gustaf Stawström , the managing director of the Association of Independent Schools .
He gives me a nice example of the way the market is providing choice and variety , as well as pressure for higher standards .
His own daughter attends an independent gymnasium which crams most schooling into half - days .
“ If you want only to find problems , you see people who are trying to do things cheaply , ” he says , “ but she is a keen athlete and trains in the afternoons , so it suits her very well . ”
Tuesday
I SPEND my second day in Sweden with representatives of Kunskapsskolan , Sweden 's biggest chain of independent schools ( it has 21 secondaries and 9 gymnasiums ) .
It has recently been awarded a contract to open two “ academies ” — independent state schools — in London , and I have been intrigued by what I 've heard about its highly personalised teaching methods .
At Kunskapsskolan Enskede , a few kilometres from the centre of Stockholm , I am met by Christian Wetell , its head teacher , and Kenneth Nyman , the company 's regional chief .
They explain the “ voucher system ” from which they make their money .
For each pupil the school teaches , it receives from the local government what it would have spent educating the pupil in one of its own schools ; in return , independent schools cannot charge anything extra , and must accept all students who apply .
Provided schools follow Sweden 's national curriculum , they have wide latitude in their methods and pacing .
Consumers consuming
Kenneth sheds an interesting light on the thorny comparison with Finland .
You have to look , he says , at what sort of students each country 's system wants .
Sweden aims to produce socially conscious generalists .
The Finnish system , by contrast , drives rather narrowly at academic success .
We talk about the unwritten rules which children pick up by osmosis .
Sweden has a Lutheran tradition : citizens are expected to work hard , do their share , solve their own problems and contribute to the general good .
“ The limit to freedom , ” he says , “ is when you negatively affect others . ”
Sweden 's national culture thus constrains its students ' apparent freedom .
Christian shows me around his school .
It is bare but pleasant , with lecture theatres , open areas where students work at their own pace and classrooms with doors for tutorials .
Kunskapsskolan posts the entire curriculum on a website .
Each week students agree on their goals for the next week , and the timetable of classes and lectures they will attend , individually with a tutor .
They do most of the work on their own .
The following week their progress will be reviewed .
I am shown a student 's logbook for the past term ; mostly , progress has been uneventful , but on one page is the dire warning that this young person will have to work all Easter to catch up .
A few weeks later , to my relief , there is a smiley face and a message : “ Well done !
You 're back on track . ”
“ If I compare myself with my friends who went to a regular school , ” Teo Derviskadic , a boy in his final year , tells me , “ it feels I have matured more ; I plan my days better .
They ask me , how you can keep up , how can you decide where to be ?
But some kids here have missed out , because they did n't learn to take responsibility . ”
After school lunch ( delicious ) , Per Ledin , the company 's CEO , takes me on to Kunskapsskolan Globen , a gymnasium nearby .
Looking directly at me to see how I react , he says : “ We do not mind that we are being compared to McDonald's . ”
Education is a service industry ; to turn a profit , a service industry needs customers .
“ So you only make a profit by being popular , like a hotel , which only makes money if it has guests in most rooms most nights . ”
Next , he drives me to meet Peje Emilsson , one of Kunskapsskolan 's founders and chairman of its board .
He tells me about the company 's move into England .
“ Personalisation is a buzz - word among British school leaders .
They recognise that will be difficult with corridors and classrooms and teachers at the front . ”
Peje 's interest in education reform was sparked when his daughter 's state school refused to let her switch from a mathematics programme to social sciences ( “ We need more girls in mathematics , ” they told her ) .
She moved to one of Sweden 's few private schools .
As I take a taxi to the airport for my flight to Helsinki , I reflect that it's hard to imagine any Swedish school — state or independent — treating a valued customer like that today .

Wednesday
I AM feeling nostalgic .
I spent two years in Finland in the late 1990s on a European Union post - doctoral fellowship at the University of Jyvaskyla in central Finland , and have n't been back since .
I wonder how much things will have changed — the country had only just joined the European Union back then , and has since joined the euro and experienced an economic boom .
First stop this morning is Kulosaari comprehensive school , in a suburb of Helsinki .
Finnish comprehensives teach children from seven to 16 ; after that almost all youngsters spend another three years in either grammar or vocational schools .
Kulosaari school is lovely .
The children are calm ( far calmer than those at my son's primary school in Cambridge , England ) and talk to adults respectfully , but as equals .

Benefit from the best
Dan Wood , from Maidstone in England , one of two native English speakers on the staff , teaches children in the school 's bilingual programme .
He has been in Finland for ten years now , and has no intention of leaving .
“ My mum works in a school at home , ” he tells me .
“ I really just do n't want to go back to that system , the stress of school inspections . ”
One thing surprises me : the number of children being taught in “ special education ” classes .
I am used to children with learning difficulties being integrated into mainstream classes whenever possible .
But in Finland , large numbers , including many with behavioural difficulties rather than more strictly medical problems , are taught separately .
Of the 20 children in the two special classes that I see , 18 are boys .
I think again of my own nearly - seven - year - old , a clever , naughty little menace who I am sorry to say has caused his teachers and classmates considerable trouble , and wonder in which class this school would put him , and how he would fare there .
The special classes undeniably do a good job : as well as having the world 's highest average standards , Finnish schools have one of the smallest gaps between the best - performing students and the worst .
But Finland is also proud of its low “ between - school variation ” — and this looks like my first myth .
There certainly is segregation in Finnish education , but it happens between classes , rather than between schools — and very , very early .
After lunch I visit Helsinki's teacher - training facility .
Matti Meri , a professor of pedagogy , tells me that the root of the Finnish education system 's success is its extraordinary ability to attract the very best young people into teaching : only around 10 % of applicants are accepted for teacher training .
By chance , a group of trainee teachers has met for coffee and a chat after two - week stints teaching abroad .
They laugh when a young man who has returned from England tells them that the school emailed him a few weeks before he travelled to inform him of its dress code : no jeans or piercings , no outlandish hairstyles .
He has taught in Finland with his hair spiked , in a T - shirt and frayed jeans — and no one raised an eyebrow .
At the National Board of Education , I ask Irmeli Halinen what other countries should learn from Finland .
The most important lesson , she says , is to develop excellent initial training for teachers .
Second , start education late and gently — Finnish children are seven before they start formal school .
And she offers a third lesson : “ We do n't waste energy or money or time on inspections or national testing . ”
I ask her about the system 's weaknesses ; she tells me getting rid of bad teachers is difficult .
Head teachers are trained to handle alcohol problems , and can insist that a teacher attends an alcohol - abuse programme , but it is almost impossible to get rid of them if such help does n't work .
( Alcoholism is a serious problem in Finland , a country cursed — in this respect — with a history that is both Nordic and Russian . )
In Kulosaari , the head teacher , Anneli Rautiainen , said alcoholic teachers in Finland are moved between classes and sometimes even between schools , so that they do n't do too much damage to any one child 's education .
( She hastens to point out this is not a problem she is experiencing . )
On the way back to my hotel , I reflect that if Finnish teachers were n't generally so excellent , those inspections and national tests might look a bit more attractive .

Thursday
THE OECD 's PISA studies are exhibit A for the excellence of Finland 's schools .
Finland routinely comes top , or occasionally second , in tests every three years of 15 - year - olds ' abilities in reading , mathematics and science .
It is impressive , but the suspicious - minded ( or perhaps just the begrudgers ? ) wonder if it is really all down to brilliant schools .
I have a suspicion of my own .
When I lived in Finland in the 1990s I learnt rather little Finnish ( they speak great English , and I 'm lazy ) , but I learnt to read words and say them correctly in about half an hour .
Each letter corresponds to one sound , and only one ; there are no exceptions and no combinations of letters that make different sounds , like “ sh ” or “ th ” .
If a letter is repeated , it is simply said for twice as long .
Is it , perhaps , just easier to learn to read and write in Finland than practically anywhere else ?

Finland 's high vowel - per- student ratio
This morning I am off to Helsinki University 's Centre for Educational Assessment .
Jarkko Hautamäki and his colleagues do not reject my theory , but they tell me that in Hong Kong , which also does very well in PISA , Chinese orthography is claimed to be part of the reason !
If the same claim is made for both Chinese and Finnish , then either one is wrong or both are insufficient .
Mr Hautamäki and his colleagues believe the latter ; they reel off a list of factors they think contribute to Finnish academic success .
One is the ubiquity of print : “ Almost every family has a newspaper delivered to the home , ” he says , “ and foreign language programmes are subtitled , not dubbed . ”
Another is Finnish diligence .
In a country with harsh weather and , until recently , a largely agrarian population , it is understood one must work , and work hard .
Students took the PISA tests seriously , leaving very few questions blank .
That boosted scores , since there were no marks lost for wrong answers .
And Finnish children are good at tests , too , because they get them in school all the time , to help them understand how they are doing .
“ Tests to Finnish children are important but not scary , ” he tells me .
So , I ask him , was Finland 's high score a mirage , caused by nothing more profound than sensible spelling and good exam technique ?
No , he says ; the country 's schools do two exceptional things — and he can prove it , with charts .
The first shows “ inter - generational income elasticity ” in various countries .
This is the technical term for the correlation between people 's income and that of their parents .
In Finland it is low : parental income is a minor influence on earning .
In other words , Finns switch economic classes easily .
In Britain and America , it is high , meaning the opposite .
“ Finns trust teachers and schools — and this chart shows that we trust them for a reason , ” he says .
“ What Finnish schools do is genuinely effective . ”
The second shows the profile of the PISA results in various countries .
“ Between - student ” variation in Finland is extremely low , meaning a narrow gap between the scores of the most able and least able groups .
This trick is easy to pull off if standards are uniformly low , but Finland 's average is the world 's highest , meaning it does almost unbelievably well by its weakest students .
In the afternoon , I go to the Finnish parliament to meet the education minister , Sari Sarkomaa .
Before the meeting , I peek into the empty debating chamber .
There are large naked figures carved on the walls , one with particularly plump buttocks .
It is typical of this utterly unprudish nation .
Finns cannot understand the foreign habit of wearing swimming costumes in the sauna ( a Finnish invention ) ;
Finns pile in naked , family with guests , all generations together .
Ms Sarkomaa is completely — and rightly — obsessed with keeping the status of teachers high .
“ We will do anything possible to keep the profession attractive , ” she says .
“ Yes , salary is important [ teachers did pretty well in the last public - sector pay deal ] , but many other factors can help .
We need to improve the training of school principals .
Such highly educated workers want to have highly qualified managers . ”
If Finnish teachers ever decided to turn militant , they would be able to bring the country to its knees in no time .

FINLAND'S schools may lead the world , but its universities are nothing special .
This bothers the Finnish government .
“ As a country that thinks its future is purely dependent on its know - how , we cannot afford average results in universities , ” says Jyrki Katainen ( pictured ) , the finance minister .
This is my last appointment before I fly back to London , and Mr Katainen is telling me that his government thinks greater independence and a bit of capital may help the country 's universities to specialise and innovate .
So it has offered any universities willing to set up charitable foundations a deal too good to refuse : any money they raise by 2010 , the government will top up by 2.5 times as much .

Katainen : Equality booster
Finland is hardly the only country worried about the global reputation of its universities .
As with schools , the advent of international rankings has made list - watchers of everyone .
The Shanghai Jiao Tong and THE rankings are enormously important both for universities , which are increasingly reliant on international students , and for countries , who take their positions on the charts quite seriously .
Most countries have decided that the way to break into the top ranks is to boost a few chosen universities rather than fund all equally .
They look to America , which dominates the top of both rankings .
Its elite private institutions have enormous endowments and attract top names ; small liberal - arts colleges provide a more intimate education ; many state universities offer an excellent education at a keen price ; and its community colleges give no -frills tuition to locals and often serve as a springboard for future progression .
So , I ask Mr Katainen , does the Finnish government hope to see an elite emerge ?
The answer is a flat no .
That would not be the Finnish way : equality is one of the country 's fundamental values
Fees for university study are also off the agenda .
“ There is not even a debate about this .
We think that as a nation we can get the average quite close to the top , ” he says coolly .
I have my doubts that the same trick can be pulled off with universities as with schools — but if anyone can do it , it will be the Finns .
I leave for the airport with a lot to think about .
I 've seen two very different ways to organise state schooling , and there 's no question which one I preferred .
The problem is , it was n't the one that produced the best results .
I loved Sweden 's profusion of different sorts of schools — surely different methods work for different children .
I loved the way competition was forcing schools to think more pointedly about quality — Kunskapsskolan 's head teachers know that when a student is unhappy with what they offer , they risk 70,000 kronor walking out the door .
And most of all I loved that Swedish parents are in control of state education — municipalities can't close small rural schools against the wishes of local parents in the name of efficiency , for example , because parents would simply threaten to open their own schools .
But it is Finland 's no-choice , teacher - knows - best version of schooling that beats the world .
That poses challenges , both for my orthodox free - market beliefs and for other countries desperate to bottle the magic and export it .
Can it really be true that if you dismantle schools inspectorates , make it practically impossible to sack teachers and refuse to publish exam results ( officials and schools get to see how Finnish students do on national tests ; parents and children do n't ) , you can make every school a good school ?
Somehow , I doubt it .
After all , England 's schools could do pretty much what they liked in the 1970s , and many did , with hardly impressive results .
Finland 's secret is simple : its teachers are so highly regarded that the very best young people compete for this coveted job .
The successful few study for at least five years and are actually taught how to teach ( you would be surprised how rare this is on teacher - training courses ) .
And then , once they start work , their students pay attention and work hard ( when I asked Finns whether there were some families who despised education and resented schools , they seemed puzzled by the question ) .
I have seen what works .
But I do n't know how my country — where anti-intellectualism is rife , and where , sadly , all too often those who can't do , teach — could replicate it .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- President Robert Mugabe was sworn in Sunday after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared he overwhelmingly won the country 's disputed runoff election .
" I , Robert Gabriel Mugabe , do swear that I will well and truly serve Zimbabwe in the office of president , so help me God , " Mugabe said at the State House complex in Harare , standing before a red - robed judge wearing a white wig .
His words were met with loud applause .
The international community has roundly called the election -- allegedly marred by violence and vote rigging -- a " sham . "
Many voters expressed fear of government retaliation if they did not take part in the vote to extend Mugabe 's rule .
Some said they were required to report the serial numbers on their ballots to Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front .
Watch as Mugabe gets sworn in »
Zimbabwe 's Electoral Commission released the final results of Friday 's runoff vote , showing that Mugabe won by an almost 9 - to - 1 margin , with voter turnout about 42 percent .
The final tally , according to the electoral commission , showed Mugabe snaring 2.2 million votes , or about 86 percent of the ballots , to opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai 's 233,000 .
The commission 's quick turnaround was a contrast to the five weeks it took the ZEC to release results from the March 29 election .
Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic
Change quickly denounced the results , calling the election " a one - man race , a one - man circus . "
" We have nothing to do with the so - called Mugabe win , " MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa " In effect we believe that whatever ZANU - PF and Mugabe are doing is just but a continuation of the sham . "
He added , " We do not in any way associate ourselves with the so - called win . "
A government official confirmed earlier Sunday that invitations had been sent out for Mugabe 's inauguration , but said the ceremony would not be held until official results were announced and a winner declared .
A Zimbabwean journalist said there was activity at the presidential residence Saturday night .
Tents were erected and trucks drove in and out of the property , leading reporters to speculate that a swearing - in ceremony was in the works .
Tsvangirai was among those invited to the ceremony , but he would not attend , Chamisa said before the ceremony .
" How do you invite a man to a false wedding ? " he asked .
Mugabe was the sole candidate in the runoff .
Tsvangirai pulled out last week , citing violence and intimidation , but the government said it was too late to remove his name from the ballots .
Before the results were official , Mugabe said he won in all parts of the capital city of Harare and many parts elsewhere .
Though there were reports Friday of low voter turnout , the state - run newspaper lauded record turnout , and Mugabe said he did not know what prompted people to vote in such overwhelming numbers .
Mugabe made the claims Sunday at a funeral for his wife 's relative .
It was broadcast on state television .
" Turnout was very low , " Irene Petras , executive director of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights , said Sunday .
" A lot of people [ were ] dragged to the polling station to fill out a ballot paper . "
The MDC reported that ZANU - PF supporters herded rural voters to the polls and forced them to vote .
The party said about 90 of its supporters have been killed in the weeks preceding the election .
Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga said he would not " dignify the charges with comment " and declared the voting process peaceful .
He also said MDC supporters burned down some polling stations .
Members of the Pan - African Parliament observer mission , however , said the election was not " free , fair and credible . "
" The environment was tense , hostile and volatile , " said Marwick Khumalo , a lawmaker from Swaziland .
" And there was a high level of intimidation , violence , displacement of people , abduction and loss of lives . "
The mission said opposition parties were not allowed to hold rallies and were shut out from broadcasting their campaign messages on state - run media .
" There was hate speech , incitement of violence and war rhetoric that instilled fear and trepidation amongst voters , " Khumalo said .
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga called on the African Union to send troops to Zimbabwe , saying the ongoing crisis in the country is a " shame and embarrassment . "
Odinga , a former opposition leader who became Kenya 's prime minister after a power - sharing deal following a disputed election in that country , made the comments during a visit to his home province .
He made a similar appeal earlier this month .
" The information that we have right now is that Mugabe is proceeding with impunity , completely disregarding the world opinion , " he said .
" And I have suggested that the United Nations should support the African Union and come up with a peacekeeping force that will be deployed in Zimbabwe so that some calmer decisions can be facilitated . "
Opposition leaders and international observers have called the election a " sham " -- a word that President Bush also used to denounce the voting .
Tsvangirai supporters say he defeated Zimbabwe 's longtime leader in the March elections .
But when the results were reported , the Mugabe - appointed commission said Tsvangirai had not won by enough to avoid a runoff .
Mugabe has been the country 's only leader since it gained its independence from Britain in 1980 .
Tsvangirai remained holed up for a sixth day Saturday at the Dutch Embassy in Harare , Chamisa said .
Tsvangirai fled to the embassy last week , saying he feared for his safety .
Matonga on Saturday said that the government would be willing to sit down with Tsvangirai and MDC members " as long as they are not pushing the British agenda or an American agenda . "
Mugabe has called the MDC a creation of the West .
However , Tendai Biti , MDC secretary - general , said Saturday that the runoff had closed some doors in the eyes of the MDC .
" A government of national unity , as far as we 're concerned , is history , " he said , saying that some sort of transitional arrangement might be possible .

CBS ' Chief Foreign Correspondent , Lara Logan , spoke with Bob Schieffer on Face The Nation about the real situation on the ground in Iraq and General David Petraeus ' upcoming appearance before Congress to dump propaganda give a progress report on the Bush / McCain surge .
As Logan puts it , the recent fighting in Basra may have all but negated nearly all progress that the surge may have brought :
" Well , the last few weeks have really been brutal for General Petraeus because he really was looking at a year where he had managed to be quite successful in reducing violence , particularly in Baghdad and some of the surrounding areas .
One of the main reasons for that are the agreement with the Sunni tribes and also with some Shiite tribes , the militias that they were forming and working with the Americans .
But , those gains have almost disappeared in the face of the recent violence which spread so quickly from Basra in the south of Iraq ... "
John Amato :
Twenty people were killed last night which as she puts it was a very determined defense by these militias --- not wanting to give up their power base and as the American Commander in charge of Sadr City said :
" He said this fight began as a fight for these rocket launch sites and it's now all about killing Americans . "
I thought this was an Iraqi operation all along --- sorry , I 'm confused .

A Portland man says he was tackled , pushed off his bike , and then tasered repeatedly by a Portland Police officer in Southeast Portland last night .
The Portland Police Bureau , in a written statement about the incident , say that Phil Sano ( a.k.a. “ Rev Phil ” ) did not have a front light on his bicycle and that he refused to stop when officers requested .
The incident occurred around 9:30 pm on SE 7th Street , just north of SE Morrison Ave.
Phil Sano says he was riding along and felt cold , so he went to zip up his jacket .
Then , in an email he sent me just hours after the incident , he wrote ,
“ Across the street a man in all black shouted at me and started walking my way .
I stopped pedaling , but did n’t stop because my hands were not on my brakes .
He then sprinted , lunged and tackled me .
I then scuffled to separate him and stood apart from him in a defensive position . ”
Then , Sano says , he was tasered several times .

“ I felt a sharp sting in my back and heard a repetitive clicking .
I turned around to see that I was being tasered ! ”
At that point , Sano maintains he still did not know what was going on and he repeatedly asked the officers to explain what he had done wrong .
At that point , Sano says two officers were holding him down and he could still feel the taser charge flowing into his back .
“ I was still freaked out and yelled again , why are you shooting me ? ”
Sano says the cops yelled for him to “ get down ” , but that he still had no idea who was accosting him .
He wrote , “ It was pretty dark and they were wearing all black without any sort of shiny badge … .
They looked kinda ’ like cops , but generally cops do not tackle bikers unless it is Critical Mass . ”
According to Sano , he was tasered “ point blank ” in the chest and the lower back and that he began to “ spasm out of control as the surge of electricity involuntarily constricted ” his muscles .
“ … the cop took two steps after him , grabbed him by the shirt , yanked him off the bike , ran hum up the sidewalk and slammed him against the wall and then right away started tasing him . ”
– Diana Spartis ( she witnessed the entire incident )
After pleading repeatedly for them to stop , Sano says they continued and that , “ without question , I could tell they enjoyed seeing me become so helpless , so weak .
It was humiliating . ”
Once the tasering stopped , Sano said he laid in a small puddle of his own urine , breathing irregularly and “ seething with rage ” .
“ I can still feel their knee on my neck as I write this , but even then I knew they were in the wrong … really , really fucking wrong . ”
He added , “ There was no cause for such violence ; I was not harming anyone and I made sure that everyone within earshot knew it . ”
Sano says that all the while , a barb from the taser remained lodged in his chest .
Luckily , he remembers , a passing ambulance heard him screaming , stopped on the scene , and removed the electrode from his chest .
Sano says that the EMT , “ was very concerned ” that his speeding heart rate would not slow down .
Once everything calmed down , Sano says the cops told him that he was stopped because he did n’t have a front light .
Sano admits he did n’t have his front light on his bike , because someone had stolen the cradle it attaches to .
He says the cops found his light in his fannypack a few minutes later .
According to Sano ’s recollection of the incident , he heard Officer Smith say , “ You should have stopped when I told you to .
Then none of this would be necessary . ”
A written statement just released by the Portland Police Bureau ’s Public Information Officer Brian Schmautz says that the officers were in uniform and were dealing with another woman and had “ turned on their lights to alert traffic while they talked to her . ” *
Then , writes Schmautz , they saw Sano roll by without a light and , “ One of the officers told Sano to stop , but Sano ignored him . ”
Here is the rest of Schmautz ’s statement :

tasers entered Sano ’s body .

“ The officer , then reached out to stop Sano and they began to struggle .
Sano refused to comply with any of the officers orders and continued to resist until additional officers arrived .
The officers attempted to Taser Sano , but it was ineffective because of Sano ’s clothing .
Sano was eventually arrested and taken to jail .
Sano apparently admitted he had been drinking , but was not given field sobriety tests because the officers were not arresting him for DUII .
FYI , the officers checked Sano ’s history and learned that the Police Bureau had given Sano a warning for a bike light and a free bike light in the past . ”
_________
Diana Spartis , a 28 year - old Sellwood resident , was being cited for not having a light on her bike when the incident took place .
On the phone with me this morning , she said Officer Smith was telling her about the importance of having a light when Sano rode by on the other side of the street .
Spartis says the Officer noticed Sano also did n’t have a front light then yelled at him to stop .
She then told me , “ He [ Sano ] did n’t stop immediately , and the cop took two steps after him , grabbed him by the shirt , yanked him off the bike , ran him up the sidewalk and slammed him against the wall and then right away started tasing him . ”
Sartis recollects that she was “ maybe 50 feet away ” and says , “ I did not see him [ Sano ] do anything physical to the cops … he was n’t cooperating fully , but he also was n’t doing anything that should have provoked them that much .
He was screaming , ‘ no ! no ! , why are you doing this ? ' ”

The two officers involved in the incident were Officers Erin Smith and Ron Hoesly .
Both are members of the Traffic Division .
I have no knowledge of Officer Smith other than this report from a Critical Mass ride back in February of 2005 .

Officer Hoesly is a motorcycle cop .
Back in August of 2006 I joined Officer Hoesly for a ride - along .
I frequently see Hoesly around town and he is always friendly and congenial .
Hoesly and Smith initially charged Sano with Resisting Arrest , Attempted Escape III , and Disorderly Conduct .
He was also cited for not having a front light ( ORS 815.280 ) and Failure to Obey a Police Officer ( ORS 811.535 ) .
( UPDATED *)
At his arraignment at the Justice Center in downtown Portland a few hours ago , Sano says the clerk told him he had been given a “ no - charge ” .
* According to a source who is a lawyer that means ( for whatever reason ) the case is not going forward , but the charges can brought back to life at a later date .
My source says this could be an indication that either the police or the DA ’s office did n’t think they could prove , or did n’t want to try to prove , the charges .
This is n’t the first time Sano has had run-in with the police .
During the 2006 World Naked Bike Ride , Sano was involved in an altercation with an off - duty police officer who was the passenger in a motor vehicle that was being held up during the ride .
Sano alleged that the vehicle ’s driver tried to run him over .
In that case , Sano was charged with several misdemeanors ( including Criminal Mischief and Disorderly Conduct ) and faced 2 1/2 years in jail .
The case was ultimately dismissed and Sano was set free .**
( This incident is being discussed on the Zoobomb Forum and in the Portland Bike Forums . )

(* Note : I added a part of the Police statement that mentioned the Officer ’s vehicle lights being on several hours after I initially posted the story .
** I added information about Sano ’s Naked Ride trial at 10:23 pm on Wednesday night .
UPDATE : The Oregonian has quoted another Police spokesperson as saying they did n’t taser Sano until he became “ combative ” .

They 're outraged over their portrayal in newspapers and are planning to march on one tabloid 's headquarters this weekend .
But are emos a weird rock cult or as pleasant a group of teenagers as you 're likely to meet ?
You must have seen them , often clad in black , some in skinny jeans and converses , some in make - up - boys and girls alike .
These are emos , a gloomy if essentially non-violent youth tribe who revel in their outsider status and a particularly angst - laden brand of punk - pop .
Listening to a band like My Chemical Romance is a cathartic thing
Kate Ashford , emo , 17 While previous generations of bands , like the Smiths and Nirvana , may have also stood accused of wallowing in gloom , to the critics at least , the emo scene specialises in the kind of morbid lyrics that make Leonard Cohen sound like Sinitta .
Here is a passage from Dead ! by emo superstars My Chemical Romance ( MCR ) : " Have you heard the news that you 're dead ? / No -one ever had much nice to say / I think they never liked you anyway / Oh take me from the hospital bed . "
Young Hearts Run Free it is not .
Click here for key elements of the emo wardrobe
But emos have never gathered on Brighton Beach to ruck with mods or rockers .
Emo fans instead emphasise their sensitivity and thoughtfulness - as one might expect with the " emotional " etymology of their name .
Many belong to the " straight edge " sub - scene whose followers forsake drink and drugs .
Emo march
But the focus of bands like MCR , Dashboard Confessional and Fall Out Boy on inner torment and alienation from one 's peers has unsettled many parents .
The movement has provoked a flurry of press condemnation rarely seen since Johnny Rotten first publicly expressed his views on the British constitution .
On Saturday , hundreds of emos are planning to march on the Daily Mail 's headquarters in protest at the newspaper 's coverage of their subculture .
The tabloid has labelled emo a " suicide cult " which glorifies self - harm and " romanticises death " - a charge vociferously denied by most emos .
Fans vehemently deny the music encourages suicide or self - harm
As she knuckles down to prepare for her A - level exams , Kate Ashford , 17 , from Tunbridge Wells in Kent , offers a less sinister explanation for the appeal of MCR .
The theatrical angst and drama of emo is , she suggests , no more than an outlet for a generation creaking under the weight of social expectation .
" Being a teenager has got to be so much more difficult these days , " Kate says .
" There 's a lot more exams and pressure to get into university .
" Listening to a band like MCR is a cathartic thing .
And I suppose emo style is meant to be about standing out , looking different - even if all the other emo kids are dressed the same as you . "
Matthew Hirons , a 22 - year - old web developer from Stourport - on - Severn , is even more phlegmatic .
He suggests that the critics take the music far more seriously than the fans .
" People say emo is all about depression and suicide , " he says .
" But I 'm a happy person .
I 've got a girlfriend and a good job .
I just like the music and the fashion .
" I think anyone over 25 will find it hard to understand what it 's all about .
Even I 'm a bit past it for an emo , to be honest . "
It is a largely teenage trend and is characterised by depression , self - injury and suicide
Daily Mail on emo
The musical roots of emo lie in the 1980s US hardcore punk scene , when some bands pioneered a heart - on - sleeve subgenre known as " emo-core " or " emotional hardcore " .
A move towards a more mainstream , poppy sound by several emo leading lights took it overground , but the scene 's histrionic subject matter irritated many .
Fans were even subjected to violence .
Footage of emo kids being beaten up by gangs of punks and heavy metal fans in Mexico attracted nearly a million hits on YouTube .
Yet for all the ire it provokes , media and popular culture lecturer Dr Dan Laughey , author of the study Music and Youth Culture , believes emo is essentially harmless .
" Emo fans are mostly middle - class , often going through puberty , " he says .
" For the majority of fans , emo music acts like a release valve , driving away all the negative energy and emotion inside them . "
And for all that the scene is preoccupied with alienation and misery , its champions claim it offers a comradeship of sorts .
" At the end of the day , it 's quite empowering for a lot of kids , " concludes NME news editor Paul Stokes .
" It 's about saying , ' We 're outsiders , but we 're all teaming up ' . "
Even veteran music journalist David Quantick , who despises what he regards as the ostentatious breast - beating of emo , admits that he cannot bring himself to hate its adherents .
" Being a teenager is awful , " he says .
" It does n't matter that emo music is rubbish - it gives them something to cling to .
" In 10 years time we 'll have all these 30 - year - olds on I Love 2008 talking about how embarrassed they are to have been emos .
We 'll have a Tory prime minister who 's a Fall Out Boy fan . "
EMO LOOKS 1 : " Emo hair is characterised by long fringes that sweep over one eye , " says Liz Morris .
" It takes some inspiration from Japanese ' manga ' , with punk elements .
It 's usually black , with streaks of vibrant colour , and poker straight .

My 16 year old daughter is regularly insistant that emos are not depressive or suicidal .
Her music and clothing choices are not unique , every generation have had a " look " .
I can honestly say my daughter 's circle of emo friends are the nicest kids and are welcome at our house anytime .
Sharon Devine , Wigan Surely just repackaged Goths ...

As the mum of two emo children I have to say I see little difference in their clothes , make - up and hairstyles to the ones I had and wore in the early - mid 80s .
We just did n't have as good hair products .
What really irks me is the abuse they get in the street because of the way they dress and the music they enjoy .. from Buckie - swilling neds in Helly Hansen .
I know whose kids I prefer .
Nikkii , Perth I wish the media would stop using the term " emo " to describe these adolescents and their terrible commercial music .
Unfortunately , real emo has been appropriated by the media and others to represent something far - removed from the music I grew up listening to and continue to cherish to this day .
Nathan , Canada
Some of this may be correct , my kid and his friends are a bit emo .
He 's classified gifted academically , and a vegetarian , as are many of his friends .
They do wear more than just black though .
But classifing Dashboard Confessional as depressing is just wrong .
They are sooooo romantic .

Anyone living in Liverpool will tell you there is a big emo scene here .
Now I am not a massive fan of emo bands - I grew up on Nirvana and Pearl Jam but the message is still the same .
I would put it to these scaremongerers that I have not once heard on the news of a gang of emos terrorising the streets of Britain .
I put it to the polliticians and the tabloids that I , a soon - to - be - father , would be happier if my child wore dark clothing and stood out from the crowd listening to the angst driven rock .
Rather that than my child wish to don a set of Lacoste tracksuits to gang up and terrorise my streets .
Rather than creating hysteria maybe we should do some real soul searching about what Britain 's real problems are .
Andre , Liverpool Being an Emo , Goth , Punk , Cyberpunk - whatever is just a label that gets attached to a group of kids looking for answers in music and lyrics .
These kids are intelligent , usually of a kind and thoughtful disposition and yes , they are sensitive to their surroundings and culture .
It is this sensitivity and uncertainty that might lead to self harm as a form of frustration rather than the fault of the music or scene .
I used to try and work this one out with my mates when one of us was at the end of a good kicking by a nice , " normal " member of my local community and we came to the conclusion that folk who are too afraid to express their difference are afraid of the difference in others .
Did n't help when we were picking up our teeth and watching those meatheads trying to crack onto our girlfriends .
Worry not about the Emo .
They can take care of themselves and will cause you no harm .
Look to the hoodie boys and girls who hide their faces , they 'll get ya every time .
Damien Bidmead , Eton I was a Goth in my late teens , early 20s .
I am now 40 .
We dressed how we did cos we liked the music and it was all part of it .
Just because someone dresses differently and expresses their individuality and taste does n't mean they are on drugs or violent .
When will people stop stereotyping teenagers in this way ?
My mum used to dye my hair for me when I was a Goth and did not see my like minded friends as a " threat " or even think we were on drugs ( which we incidentally , were not ) .
We , as parents , should encourage our children ( I have two of my own ) to express themselves and think for themselves whilst hopefully showing and teaching them how to steer clear of the bad influences , such as drugs , in their lives .
That 's what my mum did with me and I hope it works with my children .
S Grace , Leeds , UK
For heaven 's sake " leave the kids alone " - surely someone at the Daily Mail must have worn brothel creepers , carried a flick comb and looked a right idiot shoulder - padding their way down the street trying to look cool .
It is a necessary part of growing up that kids create their own identities within their peer groups - just be grateful they are n't joining gangs and carrying knives .
Lighten up - even I like MCR and Fall Out Boy and I am a 50 - year - old , ex- biker granny .
Sue , Boston Media organisations like the BBC and these tabloid papers should stop trying to understand the subdivisions of musical culture .
The vast majority of you are outsiders staring in , desperate to put a label or a convenient explanation on what you see .
Stuart Bell , Shetland , UK I would have my kid become an emo a thousand times over rather than become beer swilling , " Ingerlund " - chanting skinhead .
Look at the statistics of how many emo and Goth kids go on to higher education as opposed to the trackie - bottom wearing potheads who hang around on street corners all over this country .
When was the last time anyone saw an emo or a Goth accused of stabbing , robbing or assaulting someone ?
These kids are the real future of this country .
Mike Johnson , Worthing , Sussex
Why do people insist on labeling themselves to a specific subculture ?
Teenagers are too influenced by the media and their fellow peers to realize that they need to be independent and have their own beliefs and way of life .
Since I am a 16 year old I have witnessed first hand the problems that these subcultures create .
Hatred builds between groups such as " chavs " and " emos " that is creating a new type of discrimination .
Instead of encouraging these subcultures the government and the media should be trying to bring teenagers together in unity to help the world problem instead of becoming selfish individuals built up with hate for different types of people which can lead to problems later in life .

After eight brutal months on Wall Street , the Dow Jones industrial average finally made it official : Blue - chip stocks have stumbled into bear territory .
A brief 155 - point slide on Friday afternoon brought the decline in the Dow to 20 percent from its October peak , an ignominious figure that is generally regarded as marking the start of a bear market .
The index ended down 107 points , a mere 0.1 percent above the threshold .
The broader Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index has not fallen quite as much .
The eight - month journey has roughly followed the twists of the subprime mortgage crisis , with a significant drop after the Bear Stearns collapse and a tantalizing rally when the economy appeared to recover slightly last month .
But in June , as the price of oil kept rising and the pain in the financial industry showed no signs of easing , the losses gained momentum .
Many investors concluded that the economy was in worse shape than they had initially feared .
This month , as the price of crude has gained about $ 13 , the Dow has shed more than 1,000 points .
The index closed at 11,346.51 .

If you ’re not a convicted drunk driver , should you still be required to have an in - car breathalyzer fitted ( at your expense , ‘ natch ) to your next new vehicle ?
Apparently , some automakers — including GM and Toyota — think so .
They and a few others are working together under the auspices of something called the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety , which is a $ 10 million federal “ research program ” that is trying to develop just such technology for mass introduction a few years from now .
At the moment , the only people who have to deal with ( and pay for ) in - car Breathalyzers are convicted drunks ; the devices are basically ignition locks that prevent the vehicle ’s engine from being started until the would - be driver blows into the tube and the system determines he ’s not liquored up .
But by 2012 or so , in - car breath sniffers could be standard equipment in every new vehicle sold , force - fed to you by the tag team of Washington , Detroit and , of course , the ever - busy Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) .
No conviction necessary .
Advocates say the technology under development would be “ less intrusive . ”
Instead of making the driver blow into a little tube like they make you do at those roadside “ sobriety checkpoints , ” a system of passive alcohol sensors would be fitted to the car that could take a Blood Alcohol Content ( BAC ) reading via a person ’s skin — as when your hand touches the shifter or steering wheel .
This “ quiet ” approach is supposed to make us feel better about being pre-convicted and treated like known and duly processed irresponsible drunks every single time we get behind the wheel of a car .
It does n’t work for me .
I dislike drunk drivers as much as Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( is anyone actually for drunk driving ) ?
But I certainly do object to policies and regulations that impose cost and hassle and arguably , petit tyranny , on people who have done absolutely nothing to warrant it .
This is n’t about nannyism so much as it is about upending a few basic bedrock Western ideas about criminal justice , rights and responsibilities .
Chief among these being that each of us gets treated as a specific individual .
If we do something wrong , we get specifically held accountable for it ; the guy next door who had nothing to do with it is n’t dragged along for the ride .
But that ’s just what is happening here — indeed , has already happened — from those so - called “ sobriety checkpoints ” ( which mostly “ check ” perfectly sober drivers ) to the growing kudzu of “ primary enforcement ” seat belts laws that pester ( and ticket ) people for not wearing a seat belt , an action that may not be especially smart on an individual level but which has very little to do with the safety or well - being of others .
What ’s even worse than these growing harassments , however , is how few object to them on principle .
Perhaps it ’s because of the continuous dumbing - down of the populace , which knows all about Lindsay Lohan ’s latest bender and who ’s the latest finalist on American Idol but no longer understands that the ends do n’t justify the means — and that down that road lies much worse than henpecky tickets and having to pay a few more bucks for your next new car as a result of some government mandate .
People used to get that ; today , most do n’t seem to .
It ’s the only way to explain the tsunami - like effectiveness of the word , “ safety ” — which does n’t have to be specifically defined , quantified , subjected to cost - benefit analysis or throttled back by the once - superior claim of the individual ’s “ personal bubble of authority ” — where he or she formerly reigned supreme , free of the suffocating and endless edicts of others who claim their evaluation of a perceived risk trumps your personal right to choose .
Just say “ safety ” ( and for added emphasis , include “ our children ” ) and no objection can be sustained .
This latest bit of ugliness burbling up from the stinkpot of government - corporate do - gooderism is merely a symptom of the underlying canker that is our ignorance — and acquiescence .
Earlier generations of Americans would have said , “ Hold on a minute .
I have n’t been convicted of driving drunk ; hell , I ’ve never even been suspected of it .
Why in the world should I be required to buy an alcohol sniffer to check me out before I drive ? ”
They would have insisted on tough punishment for the specific dimwit who got behind the wheel of a car impaired by booze .
But they would have insisted , with equal toughness , that everyone else be left the hell alone to go about their business in peace .
Today , however , the siren song of saaaaaaaaafety is like a secular version of the prayer call in Muslim countries .
When people hear it , they automatically fall down on their knees en masse and begin to worship .
God may be great — but “ safety ” is rapidly gaining ground on him .

You would have to be harder hearted than I to ignore the anguished search of parents of autistic children for the cause of their child 's condition .
" I saw it , " they say ; " one shot , and then the child who had talked and laughed started retreating into himself . "
It 's hard to argue with someone 's pain .
Nonetheless , I 'm going to .
Our brains are designed to learn by associating events that happen at the same time , or in close sequence .
When you were a little kid , that 's how you learned that if you touched the stove , you got burned , long before you understood how combustion worked .
We have other ways of learning as well , but that temporal link is the strongest , most primal association .
We go through our whole lives looking for those connections .
This is not a bad heuristic , but of course , it often leads one astray , which is why there are so many ridiculous " cures " for hiccups .
The fact that your child regressed after having a shot does n't mean that the shot caused the regression .
It suggests a theory . . . but that theory has been tested , and found wanting .
The anti-vaccination websites sustain their belief by systematically excluding anyone offering counterevidence from the domain of acceptable sources .
Pharma studies can't be trusted because they have a profit motive .
The CDC is in hock to big business .
The " medical establishment " wants to make money giving your children unnecessary shots .
In fact , the only person you can trust is the guy writing the website .
This is the sure sign of a crank .
It is possible that all these people are wrong -- science has had much more spectacular failures in the face of clear evidence .
But there is no such thing as a multi-million person conspiracy .
Those sites pick apart the studies that show no link between vaccinations and autism , while ignoring much more glaring problems with the studies supporting that link .
The state of medical research is indeed pretty horrifying to people who do other kinds of research , thanks to a combination of human subject problems and generally abysmal statistical practice .
But the problems are even more likely to be found in the poorly funded , inadequately staffed , and usually ineptly designed studies purporting to show a link between vaccination and autism .
A doctor who has been working with autistic children for decades offers a very interesting paper on the topic , which I found via Blissful Knowledge .
He reports that well before the vaccine theory , parents always identified something to causally link with their child 's late onset autism :
On the Children ’s Unit at WMHI we had both forms of Autistic Disorder .
In some children the clinical signs and symptoms of autism had been present from birth .
In others , the child was quite normal ( neurotypical ) at birth and reached developmental milestones , including language acquisition at the usual times and in the usual manner .
But then at age two , three or four , a conspicuous regressive process began robbing the child of all of that natural progress .
Interestingly , in these late onset cases the parents all had some sentinel event that , in their mind , accounted for the cause of this dreadful regressive pattern : “ ever since he fell off the pier and nearly drowned ” ; “ the time he got trapped in the silo ” ; or “ ever since he went into the hospital to have his tonsils removed ” .
The point is that there is a natural tendency on the part of parents to seek out and blame some event or procedure for the onset of such startling regression in a child who has otherwise been developing normally .
Dr. Down called that regression the “ loss of wonted brightness ” .
Dr. Down attributed this regression to the “ second dentition ” .
Obviously , in seeking causes , one has to separate out temporal relationship to causal relationship .
. . .
I saw cases of late onset autism well before there was an acceleration of vaccine schedules to their present levels .
And in each of those cases the parents pointed toward some special event that in their mind was responsible for the onset of the regression .
A full century earlier Dr. Down described cases of late onset autism well before there were any vaccination schedules at all .
As I pointed out above , he ascribed that regression , temporally at least , to the ‘ second dentition ’ .
Looking for those links is entirely natural .
But fingering vaccines has real and terrible consequences .
Millions of children die worldwide every year from childhood diseases that we 've eliminated here through vaccination .
Now , because these websites are frightening people about vaccination , we 're seeing a resurgence of those diseases .
People are dying from them again , and others are being left with permanent health impairment .
Leaving children unvaccinated means going back to
Leg braces and iron lungs for people with polio ( 57,628 cases in 1952 )
Encephalitis and sterility for people with mumps ( 200,000 cases a year in the 1960s )
Congenital rubella syndrome for children whose mothers contracted the illness during pregnancy .
Blindness , pneumonia , encephalitis , and death - - one per thousand - - for people with measles ( nearly 1 million cases a year in the US before vaccines ) .
Encephalitis and pulmonary hypertension for people with whooping cough -- thanks to people who do n't vaccinate their kids , in 2001 , 17 people , mostly infants , died of pertussis ( 200,000 cases in 1940 ) .
Cardiac arrest and paralysis for people with diptheria ( 207,000 cases and about 15,000 deaths in 1920 ) .
The vaccines scare us because the diseases do n't .
And they do n't because of the vaccines .
“ This Law Is a Bomb that May Kill Everyone ”
Dick Cheney wants the Iraqi government installed by the U.S. occupation to sign a “ security pact ” with Washington by the end of July .
( The pact , including a status - of - forces agreement , would be signed by the U.S. president but not constitute a treaty requiring Congressional approval . )
U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker has been feverishly struggling to meet the deadline and to commit the next administration to the agreement ’s terms .
But that may be a tall order .
Prime Minister Nour al - Maliki says negotiations are only in a beginning stage ; public opinion is opposed to the pact based on leaked information about its content ; and a majority of members of the Iraqi parliament have endorsed a letter to the U.S. government demanding U.S. withdrawal as the condition for “ any commercial , agricultural , investment or political agreement with the United States . ”
Few Americans are familiar with the proposed treaty .
If they were , they might be shocked at its provisions , ashamed about its naked sadism .
It :
* grants the U.S. long - term rights to maintain over 50 military bases in their California - sized country
* allows the U.S. to strike any other country from within Iraqi territory without the permission of the Iraqi government
* allows the U.S. to conduct military activities in Iraq without consulting with the local government
* allows U.S. forces to arrest any Iraqi without consulting with Iraqi authorities
* extends to U.S. troops and contracters immunity from Iraqi law
* gives U.S. forces control of Iraqi airspace below 29,000ft .
* places the Iraqi Defense , Interior and National Security ministries under American supervision for ten years
* gives the U.S. responsibility for Iraqi armament contracts for ten years
Humiliating , right ?
The sort of conditions most Americans can’t imagine themselves accepting from a foreign occupying power .
What self - respecting people would ever agree to such provisions ?
Especially after their country ’s been illegally invaded and occupied , on the basis of lies .
Perhaps a million have been killed by the invaders and the civil strife they ’ve unleashed .
Two million have been driven into foreign exile , two million internally displaced .
Thousands have been humiliated , terrified and tortured by the invaders .
Millions ’ electrical and water supply still lags behind Saddam - era levels .
Millions ’ personal security and enjoyment of human rights has deteriorated as a result of the invasion .
Why should their leaders sign such an agreement ?
No doubt some key figures in the Bush administration have asked themselves that , and here ’s what they come up with .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York holds $ 50 billion of Iraq ’s foreign exchange reserves as a result of the UN sanctions dating back to the first Gulf War .
These include virtually all oil revenues that under UN mandate must be placed in the Development Fund for Iraq “ controlled ” by the Iraqi government .
$ 20 billion of this is owed to plaintiffs who ’ve won court judgments against Iraq , but a presidential order gives the account legal immunity .
Bush can threaten to remove the immunity and wipe out 40 % of Iraq ’s foreign reselves if Baghdad does n’t cooperate .
At the same time , Bush can tell al - Maliki that if Iraq enters into a ‘ strategic relationship ” with the U.S. , the U.S. will arrange for Iraq to finally escape those lingering UN “ Chapter Seven ” sanctions .
Perhaps Bush and Cheney are confidant that this carrot and stick approach will force the Iraqi government to sign the deal .
But Iranian political leader Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani hardly exaggerates in saying the proposed deal is designed “ to turn the Iraqis into slaves of the Americans ” and to create “ a permanent occupation . ”
Many Iraqis use similar language .
“ The agreement wants to put an American in each house , ” claimed a supporter of Shiite cleric and nationalist firebrand Mutada al - Sadr .
“ This agreement is poison mixed in poison , not poison in honey because there is no honey at all . ”
“ Why , ” he asks , “ do they want to break the backbone of Iraq ? ”
The mainstream Shiite cleric and politician Abdul - Aziz al - Hakim , head of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ; formerly the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq or SCIRI ) , agrees that the proposed agreement would “ violate Iraq ’s national sovereignty . ”
He claims a “ national consensus ” against it has developed .
( President Bush in December 2006 met with al - Hakim , calling his “ one of the distinguished leaders of a free Iraq , ” and he is sometimes mentioned as Washington ’s first choice for prime minister if al - Maliki does n’t adequately put out .
So his opposition is especially significant . )
Al - Hakim is close to Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the most widely respected Shiite cleric in 60 % Shiite Iraq .
The ayatollah is thought to oppose the pact but has not yet made a pronouncement about it .
Meanwhile the Association of Muslim Scholars , the largest Sunni political group in the parliament , warns that the pact paves the way for “ military , economic and cultural domination ” by the Americans .
Al - Sadr ’s followers staged rallies around the country after prayers last Friday and plan to continue weekly peaceful demonstrations demanding that the Baghdad government hold a national referendum on the security treaty issue .
The U.S. opposes such a referendum , aware that pact opponents would surely win .
So Al - Maliki is between a rock and a hard place .
He can sign the agreement and continue to receive U.S. support , strengthening the popular perception that he is a U.S. puppet .
Or he can submit to the referendum demand , alienating and embarrassing his country ’s invaders , revealing to the world the depth of Iraqi antipathy to the occupation .
That way he loses U.S. support .
Either way he seems headed towards the door .
In January 2007 Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told Congress that if al - Maliki did n’t cooperate with U.S. forces in suppressing Shiite militias in Baghdad , “ he has to face is the possibility that he ’ll lose his job . ”
At the same time U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and President Bush were both threatening to end support for al - Maliki if he did n’t “ follow through on his promises ” to the U.S.
In August 2007 , after al - Maliki publicly praised Iran for its “ constructive role ” in Iraq , Bush warned him .
“ My message to him , ” he told the press , “ is , when we catch you playing a non-constructive role , there will be a price to pay . ”
For his part al - Maliki has indicated there are limits to his servility .
He sent forces against al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in Baghdad in February of this year , but they fought poorly and had to be saved from embarrassment by the mediation of a commander of Iran ’s vilified Quds Force friendly with both al - Sadr and al - Maliki .
He has refused to break his strong ties with the Iranian government and politely asked the U.S. to leave his country out of its quarrel with Iran .
He does not seem wedded to his post or determined to retain it at any cost ; “ I wish I could be done with it even before the end of this term , ” he told the Wall Street Journal in January 2007 .
“ I did n’t want to take this position .
I only agreed because I thought it would serve the national interest , and I will not accept it again . ”
Does n’t sound like a man who wants to go down in history as the man who sold Iraq to the Americans in the summer of 2008 .
Likely successor Abdul - Aziz al - Hakim has opposed the deal so far .
Meanwhile , there ’s this other Iraqi item on Cheney ’s urgent to - do list : the passage of the Iraq Hydrocarbon Law by the Iraqi Parliament .
This was drafted by BearingPoint ( a McLean , Virginia - based management consulting provider listed by the Center for Corporate Policy as the number 2 top war profiteer of 2004 ) in February 2006 and then presented to the newly - appointed Iraqi Oil Minister Hussein Al - Shahristani .
Shahristani then met in Washington DC with representatives of Shell , BP , ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips to get their comments on the draft .
He promised the International Monetary Fund that the Iraqi parliament would pass the law by the end of 2006 , but its members had n’t even seen the 33 - page draft law yet .
Months earlier an Oil Ministry official had said that Iraqi civil society and the general public would not be consulted at all on this matter .
A secret appendix to the draft law , according to London - based Iraqi political analyst Munir Chalabi , “ will decide which oil fields will be allocated to the Iraqi National Oil Company ( INOC ) and which of the existing fields will be allocated to the IOCs [ international oil companies ] .
The appendices will determine if 10 % or possibly up to 80 % of these major oil fields will be given to the IOCs . ”
This , in other words , is another national humiliation in the offing .
As six women Nobel Peace Prize recipients wrote in September 2007 , it “ would transform Iraq ’s oil industry from a nationalized model to a commercial model that is much more open to U.S. corporate control .
Its provisions allow much ( if not most ) of Iraq ’s oil revenues to flow out of Iraq and into the pockets of international oil companies . ”
It is one of those “ bench marks ” the Bush administration has imposed on Iraq , with Congressional support , as conditions for U.S. withdrawal , but even the most recent revised version , hammered out between Kurdish representatives and the Maliki cabinet , faces tough political opposition .
Cheney was hoping this would be a done deal — done quickly on the sly — as of last summer .
But al - Maliki still has n’t delivered , and as a State Department report to Congress in April 2008 notes , labor opposition is formidable : “ The 26,000 member Iraq Federation of Oil Unions has voiced its members ’ strong opposition to the current draft of the hydrocarbon framework legislation and has demonstrated a capacity to disrupt oil production and refinery operations with strikes . ”
Last year union chief Subhi al - Badri declared , “ This law cancels the great achievements of the Iraq people .
If the Iraqi Parliament approves this law , we will resort to mutiny .
This law is a bomb that may kill everyone .
Iraqi oil . … belongs to all future generations . ”
Even the Iraqi minister of planning and development , Ali Baban , has vowed to “ resign one hour after [ the ] passing [ of the ] oil and gas draft law . ”
And the Sadrists of course are bitterly opposed .
Add the globalization of the oil industry to the security treaty provisions listed above .
Imagine how Iraqi public opinion will react if Cheney and the neocons succeed in forcing this package of laws through the Iraqi parliament .
Everybody knows the “ return of sovereignty ” is a sham , and claims of “ democracy ” a cover for continued occupation .
The “ benchmark ” capitulations the Americans demand add insult to injury , inscribing in law and veneer of multilateralism that which has been seized by brute force .
They oblige those under the boot to kiss it .
The Cheney cabal ( exuding Islamophobia and contempt for poor and working people everywhere ) seems to actually suppose it will be able to win that degree of slavishness , and to celebrate such crowning imperialist triumphs in Iraq , by the end of the Bush term .
They also seem to think they can attack Iran , expanding the “ Long War ” before handing it over to the next administration .
But that would mean provoking the outrage of the overwhelming majority of Iranians and Iraqis simultaneously .
Seems just too stupid to believe , even from a rational imperialist ’s own point of view .
But aside from Rep. Dennis Kucinich , few in Congress have made issues of the security treaty , hydrocarbon law , or plans for a strike against Iran .
The mainstream media is for the most part unquestioning , subdued , as the Bush administration continues to subject the Muslim world to unbearable provocations .

The prime minister of Thailand , Samak Sundaravej , said Wednesday that his government would try to create a cartel of rice - producing countries in partnership with Vietnam , Cambodia , Myanmar and Laos .
“ We do n’t aspire to be like OPEC , but we hope to be just a group of five to help each other in trading rice on the world market , ” Mr. Samak was quoted as saying in The Nation newspaper .
Governments in Thailand , the world ’s largest rice exporter , have for many years toyed with the idea of using their dominant market position to influence the price of rice in the same way that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries tries to set crude oil prices .
The plan appears to be in a nascent stage .
“ I think it ’s time to do it , probably within the term of this administration , ” Noppadon Pattama , Thailand ’s foreign minister , said Wednesday .
But if successful , a cartel could have far - reaching consequences on the rice market , sustaining prices at their current historic highs and worsening a food crisis that is hurting Asia ’s poorest consumers .
The price of Thai B - grade rice , a benchmark variety , has nearly tripled in recent months and is now hovering at about $ 1,000 a ton .
Maintaining rice prices would please large - scale rice farmers and traders in countries like Thailand and Vietnam , but it would anger places like the Philippines , Singapore and Hong Kong , which rely heavily on imported rice .
Plans for the cartel were front - page news in the Philippines on Thursday .
The current ruling coalition in Thailand received the backbone of its support from rural areas , and Mr. Samak appears eager to capitalize on the rice price increase .
Thai rice farmers now “ have an opportunity , ” he said in a recent interview .
Unlike corn , wheat and other grains that are widely traded globally , only a small number of countries export rice .
The largest rice producers , China , India and Indonesia , consume most of their rice crop domestically .
Thanks to a vast , fertile delta , which allows farmers to harvest three or four times a year , Thailand exports about 10 million tons annually , twice as much as Vietnam , the second - largest rice exporter , and three times what the United States exports .
Rice prices rose sharply in March and April after many exporting countries , including Brazil , Egypt , India and Vietnam , announced that they were restricting exports to ensure domestic supplies .
Outside a Co-op supermarket in Edinburgh on Friday , I met three sisters , all doing their shopping for this weekend .
In their baskets were tins , mainly - Ambrosia creamed rice and minted peas .
They were peering at stickers and examining labels with the look of hardened sceptics .
' Terrible , just terrible , ' said Betty Pryde , at 82 the eldest of the three .
' Look at the price of these eggs . '
They were free range , and cost £ 1.28 for six - 60 per cent more than in most supermarkets a year ago .
' Everything 's gone up .'
The sisters live apart but they often shop together , pooling their state pensions .
Jean , 78 , the youngest , said she does n't bother looking at the prices , she just gets what she needs .
Her older sisters looked at her as if she had just said something naughty .
' Oh no , you 've got to watch the prices - bread , milk , everything , it 's all going up , ' said Nan , 79 .
And they all agreed their weekly shopping bill was up a good 10 per cent on last year , although the cost of gas and electricity was more of a worry to them .
' It 's the price of oil , is n't it ?
And the bad weather ? ' said Nan , musing over the reason for the price rises .
' The shops , they all like a profit well over the score , ' added Jean .
' Aye , well , I must get on , ' said Betty .
Clearly this was the wrong moment for a long chat .
' I want a bit of fish for my supper , and I imagine that 's gone through the roof , too . '
When they had gone , the Co-op in Easter Road , Leith , was as empty as a church on Monday .
But the discount grocery store Lidl , a block away in the Kirkgate shopping centre , was throbbing .
Poundstretcher next door was packed , as was the discount frozen foods store , Farm Foods .
And no wonder - food prices are rising faster than they have at any time since the mid-1970s .
The middle class in Britain has barely noticed , but here in one of the poorer corners of Scotland , people are feeling the pain .
Everyone in the stripped - down warehouse of Lidl , where the posters promise , simply enough , ' 40 per cent cheaper ! ' , had a story to tell .
Shubnam Rasoul , 23 , out shopping with her husband , Shahid , and their two small children , said : ' I never buy anything for myself any more .
And I never buy anything that 's full price - it 's all in the sales . '
Shahid , who works in a Leith butcher 's shop , said that the price of their lamb is up 10 per cent since last month .
' We spend £ 200 a month now on groceries for the family , ' he complained .
Probably 25 per cent more on a year ago .
It 's frightening ' .
While a litre of orange juice is 57 p in Lidl , it sells for 99 p in the Co-op .
Such products , and staple foods like eggs , bread , frozen peas , butter and cheese have seen price rises of between 20 and 30 per cent in mainstream supermarkets .
Mysupermarket.co.uk , which collates supermarket prices daily , puts the overall rise last year at 12 per cent .
That means the average family 's shopping bill has gone up by £ 750 a year .
From Lidl , I went to another food shop , only a mile from Leith , but a planet away in every other way .
Occupying part of a terrace in the grandeur of Edinburgh 's New Town , Herbie 's is a fittingly stylish grocer / cafe - the sort of place where they do n't put price labels on the goods in the chill cabinet because , presumably , no one is particularly bothered .
If you do ask , a pint of milk here costs 75 p - in Lidl it 's 32 p .
I was introduced to five obviously middle - class Edinburgh women , the fundraising committee of the PTA for one of the city 's private schools .
They were having a meeting over cappuccinos .
Did any of them know how much a pint of supermarket milk cost , I asked .
Eighty pence at Waitrose , said one confidently , and the others nodded .
And how much has the price gone up ?
Not much : it 's about the same , they all agreed .
In fact a pint of milk costs 40 p at the supermarket , and is up by 15 - 20 per cent on a year ago .
Two of the women - none wanted to be named - did n't think food prices had gone up noticeably .
But the other three were n't so sure .
They 'd seen a difference in their weekly shopping bills .
' Tesco deliver , ' said one .
' We 're vegetarians and it 's usually the same order .
And it 's usually £ 180 .
But it 's been £ 200 lately .
Another laughed : ' My husband 's certainly noticed we 're spending more . '
' Do you know , ' says the third , ' I have actually started looking at labels in the supermarket .
Prices per kilo , and so on . '
Everyone smiles - how absurd it seems .
' It 's going to be interesting , ' says James Walton , chief economist with the food retail industry 's education body , IDG .
' UK shoppers aged under 50 have so far never experienced food - price inflation . '
Essentially , throughout most Britons ' lifetimes , food has become cheaper .
But , in December , the inflation rate ( by the government 's preferred consumer price index , the CPI ) was 2.1 per cent , while for all foods it was 5.9 per cent .
' Habits will change , although it 's unlikely we 're going to see Soviet - style queues at empty shelves . '
However , label - watching may become a habit for those Edinburgh women , because - and all the analysts agree on this , if nothing else - this is only the beginning .
Walton 's organisation is funded by the supermarket industry , whose bosses are , in public , largely in denial about the significance of the price rises .
But Walton , himself , forecasts two further years of similar increases , at least .
All the indicators , the prices of every food staple , are on the up - wheat doubled in price at one point last year .
' It 's something the industry has expected and is thus , hopefully , a manageable cycle , ' he says .
' No hunger riots .
But we have enjoyed food prosperity for a long time , and we 're seeing the end of that . '
Others offer an even more bleak assessment .
Jacques Diouf , head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation , spoke recently of a ' very serious crisis ' brought about by the rise in food prices and the rise in the oil price .
Various global economic bodies are forecasting rises of between 10 per cent and 50 per cent over the next decade .
There have already been riots about food prices in Mexico , West Bengal , Morocco , Senegal and Yemen , although not in Edinburgh .
But the factors behind the price rises in Leith are exactly the same as those in Mexico , or in China - where , last Wednesday , the government introduced price controls on dairy products , meat , vegetables and cereals .
And while food price inflation hit 18 per cent last year in China , there 's no good reason why they should not do that here .
In fact , there are a lot of reasons why they should .
There have been four chief drivers of food price inflation in the last two years .
The first is the huge rise in oil prices : $ 100 a barrel means food that is four - times as expensive to plant , irrigate , harvest and transport as it was six years ago .
Some commodities brokers are now betting on oil going to $ 200 a barrel within a decade .
The second factor is the climate : drought , hurricanes and floods around the world last year made for terrible harvests - from Australia to the Caribbean and the United Kingdom .
The third is the massive rise in the price of the staple - food commodities : wheat , maize and soya .
This has been partly driven by speculation in the markets , partly by the demand for crops to turn into fuel .
Ethanol , a diesel - type fuel made from plants , must bear a lot of the blame .
Since George Bush announced a rush to corn - based ethanol it's done well for American corn farmers - 20 per cent of whose harvest , subsidised by the government , went into fuel tanks rather than flour mills this year .
Bush 's taste for corn - based ethanol is based partly on trying to break the US 's reliance on Middle East oil suppliers , and partly on a ( largely misplaced ) faith in its ecological credentials .
( Its increasingly voluble critics claim that growing grain and then transforming it into ethanol requires more energy from fossil fuels than ethanol generates . )
And , as a result of the vast tracts of farmland now being given over to corn for ethanol production , the price has risen sharply .
Hence the tortilla riots in Mexico , last summer , over the price rise in the corn flour that makes the pancakes .
Some claim that there is now a war between the 850 million chronically hungry of the world and the 800 million motorists - all fighting for the same food crop .
It 's a pretty unbalanced battle : the maize to fill a tank for a ' Chelsea tractor ' would feed a family of four for three months .
In October the United Nations ' spokesman on famine , Jean Ziegler , called the biofuel boom ' a crime against humanity ' .
And as the Economist magazine recently noted : ' The 30 million tonnes of extra corn going to ethanol this year amounts to half the fall in the world 's overall grain stocks . '
Last week , after a mass protest at the price of soya beans in Indonesia ( which rose because of the shortage of corn and other crops to supply the biofuel industry ) , Ashok Gulati , director at the International Food Policy Research Institute said : ' It 's finally a trade - off between filling stomachs and filling diesel tanks in cars and trucks . '
But the last , and perhaps the most disturbing factor in the food price rise , is the financial boom in India and China .
Around the world , and through history , people have eaten more meat as they have become richer .
This is called the nutrition transition and it's now happening , very quickly , in the two most populous nations on the planet .
Hundreds of millions more people are now rich enough to eat meat compared with 10 years ago , with meat consumption in China more than doubling over the past 20 years .
Meat also consumes food resources in a shockingly inefficient way : it takes 8 kg of grain to produce 1 kg of beef , and 4 kg for pork .
But each kilo of grain may need a tonne of water .
And fuel oil is needed throughout the process , to fertilise the grain , pump water and to transport it .
Water and oil will both be in short supply this century .
None of this is a surprise to Tim Lang , professor of food policy at London 's City University , and an adviser to the government through the Sustainable Development Commission .
' I 've been expecting this for two years ' , he says .
' The food system is entering a period of very significant restructuring , the first since the years after the Second World War .
We may look back at the second half of the last century as an era of cheap food .
It 'll be like the Hundred Years '
War , as we were taught it in school : a seminal moment in human history that 's gone and will not return . '
That food is - for the rich world , at least - astonishingly cheap , is undeniable .
The average British household spends 13 per cent of its income on food - for our grandparents that figure would have been 30 per cent .
In Lidl at Leith , I met a 75 - year - old retired nurse with a basket of vegetables - broccoli , leeks , courgettes - along with apples , vinegar and a tin of condensed milk .
' I make jam and I pickle things , ' she explained .
' My daughter thinks I 'm mad , but it 's a habit .
I got married in 1948 , when things were still rationed .
We appreciated everything we got to eat .
Now , we 've got used to having too much .
We throw so much away .
People eat unwisely - they do n't plan , they just shop . '
But could there be positive aspects to the food price rises ?
Some environmentalists believe so , including Tim Smit , founder of the Eden Project , near St Austell in Cornwall .
' Food is ridiculously cheap and we need to pay more - for our environment to be healthy , to cut down on carbon emissions and give more income to our farmers , ' he said .
' It 's said that 30 per cent of all food produced in Britain is thrown away .
We may be getting back to seeing what the real price of food is , and that is healthy for producers and for society . '
So is there a morally preferable price level for food , at which people will value it more , and waste less ?
Raj Patel , a political economist at Cornell University in California , and author of Stuffed and Starved - on the politics of global food supply - says that allowing the market to set prices to make people behave better is not the answer .
' There are greens who are crowing that the price of food going up is going to benefit the environment and help the small producer , ' he says .
' But the benefit of the rises is going to the contractors and the commodity brokers - not to the farmers or to developing world economies .
Nor are supermarkets innocent victims of price rises .
Sainsbury 's and Tesco have recorded double - digit growth in profits last year . '
The supermarkets insist there 's no problem .
Tesco 's finance director , Andrew Higginson , says that ' tales of rampant inflation , based on one or two products , are complete nonsense . '
When I asked Sainsbury 's about the reported 26 per cent rise in the cost of a basket of its food , it said that its prices overall had actually only risen by 1 per cent in 2007 .
As an illustration they sent me a list of five items that had become cheaper , including 200g of Sainsbury 's mixed olive hummous which was 20 per cent down .
Dismissing ' alarmist predictions , ' British Retail Consortium 's head , Kevin Hawkins , said last week that ' intense competition between food retailers was continuing to keep prices down , with retailers absorbing much of the impact of increasing costs themselves . '
But as the situation stands today , at least a third of the world - including the populations of China , Russia and India - have government - imposed price limits on their foods .
' That 's how it 's going , says Lang .
' You can't wriggle out of the facts .
There are water shortages , climate change , energy price rises , population demographics , waste .
We can't go on eating meat the way we do : the economics of it just wo n't add up . '
He 's not expecting food riots in Britain - yet .
' But we 're entering a long period of restructuring , and politicians will have to get involved , ' he says .
' For years , successive governments have got used to food prices going down .
The " leave it to Tesco " policy has dominated .
But that 's over .
After half a century , food security is on the political agenda again . '
And so , you imagine , is hunger .
One family 's trolly trials : 'every week we get less change at the checkout '
Simon Russell and his wife Pauline have found that feeding their two growing boys quality food is becoming increasingly expensive .
Waste manager Simon , 41 , office worker Pauline , 43 , 11 - year - old Liam , 11 , and Ben , eight , pictured right , live in Emersons Green , Bristol , near to several major supermarkets .
They currently spend around £ 150 on food , and try to buy good quality meat and fresh vegetables whenever possible .
Typical meals include Pauline 's ' spag bol ' , a good quality homemade fish pie , and a roast with all the trimmings every Sunday .
A year ago their weekly food bill was nearer £ 120 , and , Pauline says , it is not just her children 's larger appetites that are the problem .
She said : ' You really can see the difference at the checkout week - by - week at the moment .
It 's not like things have doubled in price , you just get less and less change .
I always try and buy quality food , I think very cheap food is a false economy .
By the same measure a lot of organic food is overpriced .
I try and find a happy medium .
' Children and parents are being told how important good food is , but as prices rise it gets harder to buy the nice things that you want .
If you try and stick to the same budget , you just end up with a half - empty shopping trolley .
' I do n't go to Sainsbury 's very often , although I 'd like to , as the quality and range of food there tends to be better than the rest .
However , I end up driving further to go to Asda or Morrisons because of the money you save .
It could be as much as £ 10 a week .
That may not seem like a lot , and we 're not struggling financially , but when you add that up over a year that could pay for a family holiday .
Simon added : ' Family meals are a very important part of our life , and we always sit round the dining table together .
I believe in fair trade ; farmers and producers deserve to get paid a decent price and to keep short - changing them is unsustainable .
But with other prices rising , we have to keep things in perspective and make sacrifices .
' It 's not just food prices that are rising .
Energy bills are already shooting up and petrol is never going to get any cheaper .
All families are going to have to make sensible savings . '
