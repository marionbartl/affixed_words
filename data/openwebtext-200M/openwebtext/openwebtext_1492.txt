FOSSIL COPROLITE Fossilized Dino Dung
All of our specimens are from the American Southwest and are Jurassic Age ( +140 million years old ) Coprolites are from Sauropods , which were dinosaurs that were large , walked on four legs , and had a very long neck and tail .
They were the largest of the dinosaurs .
Some Sauropods were : APATOSAURUS , BAROSAURUS , BRACHIOSAURUS , and DIPLODOCUS , to name just a few .

These days it ’s hard to pick up a newspaper or turn on a news program without encountering stern warnings about the federal budget deficit .
The deficit threatens economic recovery , we ’re told ; it puts American economic stability at risk ; it will undermine our influence in the world .
These claims generally are n’t stated as opinions , as views held by some analysts but disputed by others .
Instead , they ’re reported as if they were facts , plain and simple .
Yet they are n’t facts .
Many economists take a much calmer view of budget deficits than anything you ’ll see on TV .
Nor do investors seem unduly concerned : U.S. government bonds continue to find ready buyers , even at historically low interest rates .
The long - run budget outlook is problematic , but short - term deficits are n’t  and even the long - term outlook is much less frightening than the public is being led to believe .
So why the sudden ubiquity of deficit scare stories ?
It is n’t being driven by any actual news .
It has been obvious for at least a year that the U.S. government would face an extended period of large deficits , and projections of those deficits have n’t changed much since last summer .
Yet the drumbeat of dire fiscal warnings has grown vastly louder .
To me  and I ’m not alone in this  the sudden outbreak of deficit hysteria brings back memories of the groupthink that took hold during the run-up to the Iraq war .
Now , as then , dubious allegations , not backed by hard evidence , are being reported as if they have been established beyond a shadow of a doubt .
Now , as then , much of the political and media establishments have bought into the notion that we must take drastic action quickly , even though there has n’t been any new information to justify this sudden urgency .
Now , as then , those who challenge the prevailing narrative , no matter how strong their case and no matter how solid their background , are being marginalized .
Attribute to The Libertarian Enterprise
Here in the States we have our own horror stories about issues surrounding police abuses of power but every once in a while we hear a horror story from England that is enough to send shivers down the spine .
At 2.15 pm on 5/20/09 the author of the Expedient Homemade Firearms books , Philip A.Luty was arrested at gunpoint by the British " North East Counter Terrorism Unit " ( NECTU ) .
Philip is the well known author of Expedient Homemade Firearms 
The 9 mm machine gun .
[ Buy at Amazon.com ]
Numerous other books and information on building improvised firearms were available on Philip 's website www.thehomegunsmith.com.
The website has , I am told , been temporarily closed until security measures can be put in place to prevent British police from tracing and visiting those who downloaded publications from the site .
More on this chilling development later .
Following Philip Luty 's arrest he was held in a London prison for over nine weeks before obtaining bail .
This is the second time Philip has been arrested and questioned by British police over the books he writes and sells via his website .
No , Philip Luty is not a terrorist , nor does he have any links to terrorists , but it seems that in the UK today the British police are not just happy with obtaining a ban on most types of legal firearms but also want a ban on any publication that shows how to build a firearm and / or ammunition .
Hence the quite unbelievable persecution of those who sell firearms related publications .
As I said earlier this is the second time Philip has been arrested and questioned .
In 2005 he was arrested and questioned over his books and website .
At that time the British " Crown Prosecution Service " ( CPS ) took no further action and the case against Philip collapsed .
Undeterred by this failure , the police waited another three years and then charged him under the UK Terrorism Act 2000 .
The wording of the charges is that Philip " MADE A RECORD OF INFORMATION THAT COULD ASSIST TERRORISTS " .
No folks , I am not joking .
In the UK British police are now trying to create a link between those who commit terrorist acts and those who write gunsmithing publications .
Oh yes , I mentioned above a " chilling development " .
That is putting it mildly .
It turns out that at the same time that Philip was arrested the British police ( Gestapo ? ) paid a visit to over fifty other people across the UK who had downloaded books from Philip 's website .
A Very Worrying Situation
The fact that Philip Luty was arrested and charged under a terrorism act and then held in prison for many weeks is appalling enough , especially when I am told Philip is also suffering from cancer of the esophagus .
But , even more worrying is the fact that the British police could trace those who had downloaded books from his website , and then pay them a visit .
This is a new and frightening development to anyone who cares about freedom and privacy of the individual .
The question every American , and even more importantly every Englishman , must ask themselves is whether Britain is a hitherto unknown satellite state of the former USSR .
This horror story gives a new meaning to the term " on-line security " .
When the police of any country start to arrest and prosecute authors , and do likewise with the readers of their publications after tracing them through online transactions , we need to ask serious questions about the extent of police power .
I would suggest most strongly that the country with the highest number of surveillance cameras monitoring the population , and the largest DNA database in the world , has fallen to a new low on the barometer of freedom .
Books on gunsmithing and the home workshop manufacture of firearms have been on bookshelves , and more recently on the internet , for at least the past forty years .
But of course the individual gun book author is an easy target for the British police .
" Buying Securely On - Line " has new Meaning
Just imagine downloading a book , a perfectly legal gunsmithing book , purchased as the disclaimer in the book says , " for academic study only " , and then finding yourself being questioned or even raided by the British Gestapo !
Secure on - line shopping has a new meaning .
I , perhaps like you , like reading books on the homeworkshop - built firearm .
If I decide to act on the information in the book and use the information to build something illegal or commit an illegal act then that is my private decision .
How the hoot in hell can an author be held responsible for what a reader of his book does or how he behaves ?
Does the hardware store proprietor become responsible if he sells a hammer to a person who then decides to commit a hammer murder ?
What about the car dealer who sells a car to someone who decides to mow down kids in a play area with his one ton killing machine .
Is the dealer responsible ?
However in the case of Philip Luty we are only talking about the sale of legal publications , not a hammer , gun , knife or car .
Obviously British police fear information in the hands of the people just as much as a gun or knife .
And what about the publisher of a book ?
Assuming the book is not published by the author will we see book publishers arrested for publishing material that does not meet the approval of the State ?
When authors and publishers have to censor or moderate their own material under fear of coming to the attention of state sanctioned " thought police " , the freedom of the press and the free dissemination of ideas is in peril .
Britons needs to wake up and smell the coffee .
They need to realise that they are one foot too far along the slippery slope to a totalitarian society .
Americans also need to take note of what has happened on the other side of the Atlantic to one solitary gun rights campaigner and stop being so apathetic to the rights given to them by men of inspired intelligence in the form of the US constitution .
If you live in England I would strongly suggest downloading any of Philip Luty 's books onto CD at your local anonymous internet café and then taking them home to enjoy .
This may keep the grasping hand of Britain 's thought police from molesting your door handle .
I would like to thank Mr.Luty for updating me on his situation .
" I may disagree with what you write but I will defend to the death your right to write it " .

ATHENS — Tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets Wednesday as much of the country went on a 24 - hour strike against government austerity measures .
A small group of youths threw Molotov cocktails at police , who responded with tear gas .
However , the 20,000 people who filed through downtown Athens — a relatively large crowd for a Greek strike — mostly limited themselves to chanting anti-government slogans .

Men between the ages of 25 - 54 are frequently described as being " working - age , " because , well , they 're expected to be working .
But as this chart , via Brad Delong , shows , that 's happening less and less .
Nearly 20 % of men in this age group are out of the workforce , and none of the overall second - derivative labor market improvements seem to be helping much .
How this trend impacts society more broadly should be interesting , to say the least .

The Kennedy Center says it will not be opening up its “ HEIST ” pop -up this weekend in order for its staff to determine whether the event can be accommodated according to the District ’s COVID - 19 reopening guidelines .
The long wait for Queensland motorists is over , with Brisbane 's CLEM7 tunnel set to open on Monday night .
The 6.8 - kilometre tollway , the longest road tunnel in Australia , runs under the Brisbane River and connects the suburbs of Woolloongabba on the south side and Bowen Hills in the north .
Lord Mayor Campbell Newman says the tunnel will be free for the first three weeks until the $ 4.28 toll for cars comes into effect .
" I can now reveal that on Monday night the tunnel will be open , " he said .
" So about midnight she will be fully operational , allowing people to save 24 sets of traffic lights in a journey from the Royal Brisbane Hospital to the Princess Alexandra Hospital .
" It is terrific to see this infrastructure finally delivered . "
The speed limit will be 80 kilometres per hour unless signed otherwise .
The tunnel is named in honour of Brisbane 's longest - serving lord mayor , Clem Jones .
Jahmaal James pleaded guilty on Friday to having gone to Pakistan to obtain paramilitary training for the benefit of the so - called Toronto 18 and was to be set free after being sentenced to time served .
The now 26 - year - old admitted in a Brampton court that he was part of a terrorist group that intended to cause violent jihad .
After entering his plea of guilt , the Scarborough man , who has been in pre-trial custody since June 2006 , was sentenced by Justice Bruce Durno to seven years and credited with time served .
As part of a joint submission , the judge imposed a three - year probation period , a lifetime weapons prohibition and ordered James to provide a DNA sample .
James , who converted from Christianity to Islam , chose not to address the near - empty court .
Defence lawyer Donald McLeod later told reporters that his client is looking forward to getting on with his life .
" This was a very hard , arduous and difficult time for him but I think now he can look forward to sort of doing things differently , " said McLeod .
He explained his client 's attraction to the group as a " blunder , a misstep in his 20s , " and described James as a " smart young man who has a lot going for him . "
According to an agreed statement of fact , James travelled from Toronto to Lahore on Nov. 5 , 2005 , to obtain paramilitary training at a camp in Waziristan .
Crown prosecutor Jason Wakely told the court that James planned to use that training to benefit the Toronto group .
James believed that once he arrived overseas , Aabid Khan , a British resident known as " Mr. Fix - It , " would help him gain admission to one of the training camps in Pakistan .
While there , James made several attempts to meet up with Khan , also known as Abu Omar , but became seriously ill .
" This disrupted his plan , " Wakely told the judge .
" The Crown does not allege that James actually received paramilitary training . "
When James returned to Toronto , on March 22 , 2006 , he became disgruntled with the reckless manner in which the Toronto group was being led and eventually pulled away because he feared the authorities were onto them .
Defence lawyer McLeod told the court that there was also an " ideological shift " in his client , which explains why James distanced himself from those with extremist views .
Outside court , McLeod said that after James returned from Pakistan he delved deeper into Islam and gained a deeper understanding of it .
" He still embraces the religion , " McLeod said of his client .
" But he realizes he may have aligned himself with a portion that was not really to his liking and that 's what he disengaged from . "
James was among 18 people charged with terrorism offences in the summer of 2006 .
Six have pleaded guilty , two have been found guilty and seven had their charges stayed .
Three men still face trial .

Khan , meanwhile , is serving a 12 - year sentence in Britain after being found guilty in August 2008 of terror - related offences .
According to testimony heard during his London trial , Khan travelled often , including to Toronto , where he met with like - minded extremists he had met online and incited them to fight .
He intended to rent an apartment for recruits on their way to Pakistan 's paramilitary training camps and talked about a " worldwide battle . "

At the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland a panel , including United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , told delegates that the issue of water scarcity now poses one of the greatest threats to health , safety , economic growth , human rights and national security .
Water scarcity is the result of various factors : Population growth , increased levels of consumption and climate change all play a part .
Too cheap
Piet Klop , senior fellow at the World Resources Institute , a Washington D.C. , think tank , states that there is another problem that is often overlooked :
Water is just way too cheap .
“ The price of water is a very contentious issue .
But the lack of a fair value for this precious commodity is the chief problem in tackling water scarcity , ” he said .
Klop argues that in most of the world , the price of water is a far cry from what its scarcity value suggests it should be .
Implicit and explicit government subsidies mean that the price of water often does n’t even cover the cost of treating it and pumping it to people ’s houses .
This encourages wastefulness and means there is not enough revenue to invest in water infrastructure , Klop said .
Only 2.5 % is potable
There is plenty of water in the world , but 97.5 % of it is salt water .
We depend on the remaining 2.5 % — much of which is locked away beyond practical use in the polar caps and glaciers — for a vast array of purposes :
From drinking , washing and growing food to managing waste , cooling power stations and as a raw material for industrial processes .
Greg Koch , director of global water stewardship at Coca - Cola , says : “ There is a lot of water in the world and it is a fixed amount that is infinitely renewable .
“ The issues surrounding its scarcity are temporal :
Where is it now , how can I get it , how clean is it ?
Using water is , in and of itself , not a bad thing .
But using it inefficiently can be . ”
Demand for water is growing .
Goldman Sachs estimates that global water consumption is doubling every 20 years .

Advertisement MPs have backed a series of reforms aimed at beefing up the ability of backbenchers to create new laws and hold the government to account .
Proposals backed include a creating a backbench committee to set a timetable for Commons business .
A bid by the Labour and Tory front benches to restrict the committee to setting a timetable for just 15 days per session was rejected by MPs .
The move could change the role of ordinary backbench MPs in Parliament .
The reforms were drawn up by Labour MP and chairman of the public administration committee Tony Wright in the wake of last year 's expenses scandal .
They are aimed at improving the standing of ordinary constituency MPs without government jobs , who currently have limited opportunities to influence legislation and hold ministers to account .
Measures agreed after Thursday 's debate include beefing up the power of select committees by allowing their chairman to be selected by a secret ballot rather than by party bosses
New rules forcing committee chairman to stand down or allowing them to resign if necessary , were also voted through by MPs .
' Too restrictive ' MPs also agreed to back proposals ensuring the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee - the key watchdog that scrutinises government spending - is always an opposition MP ( to ensure the government is held properly to account ) , and to eject any member of a committee who does not attend at least 60 % of meetings .
But they rejected an amendment put forward by the Conservative leadership and supported by the government , to restrict a new backbench committee to timetabling just 15 days ' business per session .
Lib Dem frontbencher David Heath said it was " too restrictive " and it was opposed by members of Tony Wright 's cross -party reform committee .
Under alternative plans passed without a vote , the new backbench business committee will be set up in time for the next Parliament and will control a wide range of non-ministerial debates and motions .
During the debate shadow Commons leader Sir George Young said it meant MPs would " never again be forced to plead for more time from the government in order to debate its own business " .
He said the reforms represented MPs ' best opportunity for decades to make Parliament " more effective , more accountable and more relevant to people outside " .
But Mr Heath pointed to the " collusion " between the front benches on the issue of the backbench business committee , and Labour MP Martin Salter said , if the Conservative amendment had gone through , the new committee would have been " flimsier " .
A separate full house business committee was also backed by MPs to cover the timetable for government and backbench matters - it will eventually include the new backbench business committee - but will not be set up until some time during the next Parliament .
Commons leader Harriet Harman said the " substantial reforms " would give more power to backbenchers to hold the government to account .
MPs also approved a process for electing deputy speakers - which have been chosen by party whips in the past .
But there was some anger among MPs that they were not allowed to vote on whether future Commons Speakers should be elected by secret ballot .
Last year , Speaker John Bercow was elected by secret ballot - Ms Harman insisted that the issue had " already been addressed " and the rules had already been changed .

The number of California homes pushed into the foreclosure process by banks jumped 19.7 % in February from the month prior , according to a report released Monday .
There is a growing gap between those Californians falling behind on their house payments and those actually losing their homes , according to the report by ForeclosureRadar.com .
“ The disconnect between delinquencies and foreclosure sales continues to widen , ” Sean O’Toole , chief executive of ForeclosureRadar , said in a statement .
“ While efforts to slow foreclosures are clearly working , it remains unclear that anything has yet addressed the core problem of excess household mortgage debt . ”
Experts say the gap reflects efforts by banks to keep people in their homes through the Obama administration 's $ 75 - billion plan to help troubled borrowers as well as a reticence on the part of lenders to flood the market with a glut of discounted properties .
After declining for four consecutive months , the number of notices of default filings hit 31,004 in February , according ForeclosureRadar .
Notices of default are the first stage of the foreclosure process .
The number of properties scheduled for foreclosure sale also remained near record levels .
However , actual sales of foreclosure properties , whether back to the bank or those sold to third parties , dropped 11.9 % in February from the month prior .

The World Health Organization estimates that around one sixth of the world lacks access to clean drinking water .
Since those billion people are also the poorest people in the world , water purification techniques need to be cheap to help those most in need .
Since it activates under plain visible light , this new water - purifying photocatalyst may help bring purer water to the world 's neediest people .

A serial sex offender was today sentenced to life in prison after he admitted kidnapping , raping and murdering a teenager whom he ensnared using a fake profile on Facebook .
Peter Chapman was told he must serve at least 35 years in prison by judge Peter Fox today , following the killing of Ashleigh Hall , who was 17 .
The judge said he was " a very great danger to young women , and for what it is worth , I cannot foresee your release " .
Sentencing him at Teesside crown court , the judge said Chapman had been the architect of " an evil scheme , very carefully brought , and with considerable detail , to trap your victim " .
The killer had claimed to be a handsome teenager and used the profile to lure the teenager into meeting him after he befriended her through Facebook .
In reality , he was an emaciated , 33 - year - old convicted double rapist , who was almost toothless and living in his car .
Graham Reeds QC , for the prosecution , told the court Chapman had claimed to be called DJ Pete or Pete Cartwright .
" The photograph is not of him .
It is of a barechested and good - looking boy , who is apparently in his late teens . "
Chapman was , in fact , " a somewhat plainer - looking man who could pass for being rather older than his 33 years .
When she met him on 25 October last year , he kidnapped , raped and murdered her . "
The prosecutor described how the teenager suffered from low - esteem .
The night before Ashleigh 's body was found , she had told her mother she was going to stay with a friend .
In order to entice her into his car , Chapman sent her a text message saying the boy 's father would pick her up .
He texted her to say : " My Dad 's on his way , babe . "
She replied : " He 's here , babe . "
Once in the car , he attacked her .
Ashleigh 's body was found dumped in a farmer 's field near Sedgefield , County Durham , in October .
Her arms were bound and tape was put over her face , suffocating her to death .
Chapman was arrested by chance in a separate police inquiry after a nationwide alert went out to trace his car after he had failed to comply with the requirements of his sex offenders ' registration .
During initial interviews he told police they could " crush his car " .
He later lost his nerve and confessed to murder .
Seen on CCTV at Middlesbrough police station , he tells a custody officer : " I killed someone last night .
I need to tell somebody from CID where the body is .
It has n't been reported yet . "
Detective Inspector Mick Callan , head of Durham police 's major crime team , said : " The truth is he is a predatory sex offender who , through the tentacles of the internet , could reach out to the young and the vulnerable .
" He knows full well that using his real name and picture would not grab the attention of any young woman for a moment .
But by using the picture of a good - looking young man as a cover he has woven a web of attraction and deceit that has sadly had a murderous ending . "
Chapman , who was brought up by his grandparents in Stockton - on - Tees , has a history of sexual offending .
He was the subject of several sexual assault investigations , beginning when he was 15 .
Four years later , in 1996 , he received a seven - year prison sentence for raping two prostitutes at knifepoint during separate incidents and was released in 2001 .
The following year Cheshire police questioned him over the rape and kidnap of a prostitute in Ellesmere Port .
The case was discontinued .
Speaking outside court Andrea Hall , Ashleigh 's mother , said the authorities should have done more to monitor Chapman 's whereabouts after his release from prison .
" They are the sort of people who should be tagged and they should be kept an eye on all the time .
They should n't be allowed out into society anyway . "
Mrs Hall , 39 , also said it was wrong that Chapman , as a registered sex offender , was able to post online as a teenage boy .
" He took somebody else 's photo and put it on the internet and has been posing behind this photo .
It is awful to think that there 's actually a boy out there and he is using his photo to prey on young girls . "
Mrs Hall , who has three other daughters , said she was powerless to stop Ashleigh going out on the night she met Chapman .
" What could I have done ? " she asked .
" She was 17 .
You do n't stop your kids from going out . "
She recalled the horror of hearing a police officer answer her daughter 's phone , having attempted to contact her mobile on 30 occasions .
She said : " I could understand it if Ashleigh had died because of illness but to actually have someone take someone 's life is just unbearable . "
You know what they say about March -- comes in like a lion , goes out like a lamb .
Forget that .
March is Women ’s History Month .
It should come in like a lioness , and go out like one too .
Like , say , Gloria Steinem .
As a seminal figure in the American women ’s movement , Steinem inhabits both history and the here and now .
This time “ here ” happened to be the Skirball Center , honoring a retiring rabbi , Sheryl Lewart .
She wore New York black , ornamented by a Native American beaded necklace that means a great deal to her -- a talisman , a gift from her friend , Wilma Mankiller , who for 10 years was principal chief of the Cherokee Nation .
In a just country , Steinem believes , Mankiller would be president .
Advertisement
As you can probably surmise , Steinem does n’t think that “ just country ” is this one -- not yet , anyway .
How do you pick your fights ?
Poorly !
There are people who ’d suggest that when it comes to women ’s liberation , it ’s game over , a done deal .
Advertisement
That ’s ridiculous .
The first argument was , you do n’t need this movement , you ’re fighting biology , it ’s impossible .
Then we did it anyway .
Then the second argument was , it used to be necessary but it ’s not anymore .
[ That ’s ] just obstruction , and the civil rights movement is suffering from it too , as if having an African American president has now meant that the huge disparity in health and income and employment did n’t exist .
It ’s a tactic to stop the movement .
Are the biases against women more nuanced now ?
No , they ’re not nuanced at all .
They ’re unequal pay , pink - collar ghettos -- 70 % of women are still employed in primarily female occupations that are less well paid .
A parking lot attendant who ’s a guy makes a lot more money than a child - care attendant who ’s a woman .
We have moved forward from 59 cents to 70 - some cents on the [ male ] dollar .
By the fact that we value our children more than our cars , it does not make sense that a parking lot attendant who ’s a guy makes a lot more money than a child - care attendant who ’s a woman .
What about the greater numbers of women in college , in some professions ?
Advertisement
I ’m glad about that , but part of the reason that ’s true is because [ some ] male blue - collar professions pay better than female white - collar professions .
You can still graduate from college with a BA degree and make less than a man with a high school education .
One place that [ advances ] are very important is sports and physical strength and fitness .
Rich cultures , patriarchal cultures , value thin women , like ours ; poor ones value fat women .
But all patriarchal cultures value weak women .
So for women to become physically strong is very profound .
Title IX helped enormously , and sports and fitness have helped a great deal .
Must change happen from the bottom up , or the top down ?
Is it individual or structural ?
It requires both .
It also requires valuing care - giving .
Raising children , taking care of invalids , helping elderly parents is about a third of the work in this country , and it ’s 90 % done by women .
[ When family members do it ] , it could easily be given an attributed economic value :
How much would it cost if you were paying ?
And make that tax deductible .
That would be a huge difference .
The big step for this coming generation is to get to a place where men raise children as much as women do .

I wonder whether you think the war on terrorism may have elevated feminist awareness in this country because of how hideously the Taliban treats women ?
We do n’t need martyrs and we do n’t need examples .
I think we have a bad case of first - ism in this country .
We seem to think that women here are better off than they are in any other country , and that ’s not true .
We are the only modern democracy in the whole world with no national system of child care , no national system of healthcare , no system of family - friendly workplace policies .
Women are a lesser percentage of elected officials [ here ] than in India .
We are not “ first . ”
Where do women ’s issues figure in the healthcare debate ?
Women tend to need the healthcare system more because we bear children .
Insurance companies -- not all of them , but many of them -- “ gender - rate . ”
Women may pay 40 % more for their health insurance than men do .
[ Companies ] are not allowed to [ discriminate ] racially anymore , but they still do it on gender .
They say the reason they get to charge more is we have children .
I would say having children is a socially useful act .
Being female is not a preexisting condition .

Far and away most women believe in equal pay , equal rights , equal treatment , and yet they may shrink from the word “ feminist . ”
How did it become a no - go ?
Because it ’s been demonized by the right wing .
Every time I can bear to turn on Rush Limbaugh , he ’s talking about femi-Nazis .
It has been distorted , just as “ liberal ” has .
Do we need the Equal Rights Amendment ?
Yes we do .
But it ’s going to be quite a long time .
Discrimination based on sex is still not a suspect category in the way that race or national origin or religion is .
Not only do we still have laws on the book that need changing , but capricious legislators could make another law based on sex .
So we still do need it .

Some young women , like some young men , are having casual sex , putting
embarrassing pictures of themselves on Facebook , drinking and fighting like men .
But that ’s not a downside of the movement -- that ’s a downside of the culture .
If men could get public notice by taking their clothes off , they would be taking their clothes off !
The culture still rewards women for certain types of behavior , and it ’s not surprising that when [ they ’re ] young , they think it ’s in their interest and do n’t realize that employers for 30 years are going to be looking at this Facebook page and not hiring you .
You wrote critically about Sarah Palin for The Times in 2008 .
What do her political persona and Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s say about us ?

She is , as I said in that column , a young Phyllis Schlafly .
There ’ll always be a Clarence Thomas , a Phyllis Schlafly , someone who goes against the majority needs of their group .
We create jobs for them too .
If it were n’t for the women ’s movement , there would n’t be anything to sell out !
I do think Hillary Clinton ’s candidacy changed the atmosphere .
I never for a moment thought a woman could win .
It ’s too soon .
But I do think that her candidacy made it possible for many more people to imagine a woman president .
How she got up every morning and took that much punishment , I do n’t know .
She was so strong .
Is there a pendulum to social movements , progress and backswing ?
I think we make progress and we have a backlash .
If we had n’t had a front - lash , we would n’t have a backlash .
We were ownable , like this table .
All women , and men of color -- we were owned like tables and chairs .
We spent a hundred years getting a legal identity as human beings .
That ’s a big thing .
So now we ’re trying to get social and legal equality .

Who ’s at the forefront of the women ’s movement now ?
Now it ’s pretty much everywhere .
The reason people know me is because there were so few of us .
We were , like , 12 crazy women , and now there are all kinds of leadership going on .
If I could have one wish for the women ’s movement worldwide , it would be to have feminist groups everywhere .
We ’re communal creatures .
We need to gather together once a week or once a month and discover that we ’re not alone , and to be able to tell the truth together .
Is Hollywood mending its sexist ways ?
I ’m an outside person watching , but I would say we have made some age progress .
Marilyn Monroe was profoundly depressed at turning 30 .
Now we have women at 40 and 50 who are sexual beings in movies .
We have Meryl Streep , age 60 , playing a lead in a romantic comedy .
But we still have older men with much younger women , rarely the other way around , and when it is the other way around , they call them “ cougars . ”
When it ’s older men with younger women , they call them “ men . ”

Do you have a favorite movie we ’d call a chick flick ?
To me , one of the greatest ever made was “ Antonia ’s Line , ” which won an Oscar for best foreign film in the 1990s .
It was written and directed by a Dutch woman .
We ’ve now had women prisoners of war , and women have been cleared to serve on submarines ; when are we going to have women officially in combat ?
It ’s pretty academic , actually , because warfare does n’t have neat combat zones anymore .
But what it does do is keep women much less likely to be promoted and much less likely to be in command of [ the ] U.S. military , which happens to be the largest managed economy in the world .

What does having women ’s history month mean anymore ?
It means that every other month is men ’s history month .
At least we have one month !

More than 2,000 jobs in universities and colleges across London are at risk and the cuts may be the " tip of the iceberg " , union leaders have claimed .
The University and College Union ( UCU ) said 2,165 jobs in higher education could be axed , with 2,033 of the cuts projected for universities .
Despite the recession several institutions proposing job cuts are not in financial crisis , the union claims .
Universities UK said institutions would seek to " minimise job losses " .
' Worrying snapshot '
The UCU said job losses in the capital made up a third of all total jobs going in post - 16 education nationally , which stands at 5,891 .
Union 's job cut claims London Metropolitan University - 550 University College London - 530 Kings College London - 390 University of the Arts London - 300 Imperial College London - 130 Lambeth College - 49 City University - 35 Southgate College - 30 The Royal College of Art - 26 Hackney College - 20 Tower Hamlets College - 16 Westminster University - 7 Lewisham College - 6 Kensington and Chelsea College - 6 Merton College - 3 Bromley College - 2
It said the five worst affected colleges were London Metropolitan University , the University College of London , Kings College London , University of the Arts London and Imperial College London .
Up to 40,000 students would be affected by the cuts as current staff to student ratios stand at 1:18 , nearly double what it was 30 years ago , the union said .
The UCU 's general secretary , Sally Hunt , said : " These figures offer a worrying snapshot of what is happening in the capital 's universities and colleges ; even more worrying is the fact that many institutions have not set out their plans as yet .
" Universities and colleges need to understand that our members will not sit idly by while their jobs or those of colleagues are axed .
All institutions that are considering slashing jobs need to make a clear , transparent case for the losses and start speaking to us immediately . "
The union also said : " Nobody is saying that the sector in the capital is awash with money but the fact is that universities and colleges in the capital are in relatively good financial health . "
" Extremely premature " Responding to the figures , a spokesman for University College London said it was " assessing all areas of activity " to identify savings in anticipation of reduced public spending .
" We have acknowledged that redundancies can not be ruled out , " he said .
" We will of course endeavour to avoid redundancies and will seek to reduce numbers through normal turnover , redeployment , voluntary severance and early retirement .
It is extremely premature to be talking about 500 job cuts . "
Diana Warwick , chief executive of Universities UK , did not comment on the union 's figures but said no one was " immune from the current economic problems " .
" Decisions on staffing can only be taken at individual university level , " she said .
" Trade unions are always involved in such discussions , and universities have a good track record in handling staffing changes in an open and fair way . "
She added : " They will be seeking to minimise job losses in the face of the current challenges , and to avoid compulsory redundancies . "

If you believe the myth that all cats hate getting wet , then you 've yet to meet the flat - headed cat .
With webbed feet and a streamlined head perfectly adapted for speed in the water , these strange felines not only like the water , they practically live in it .
They are also recognized as the world 's least known feline .
And unfortunately , they may remain mysterious .
According to National Geographic , a new study published in the journal PLoS ONE has indicated that the flat - headed cat 's habitat is rapidly being transformed into vast biofuel plantations .
Native to the swampy peat forests of Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia , the cats are nocturnal , elusive , tiny ( they typically weigh between 3 - 5 pounds ) and difficult to observe .
There are also only two flat - headed cats in captivity anywhere in the world — both in zoos in Malaysia — so little is known about them .
To get an idea of how their population was faring , researchers pieced together scattered records of flat - headed cat sightings since 1984 .
They also developed a computer model to predict how the cat 's historical population and distribution might be effected by modern changes to their habitat .
What they found was shocking .
Almost 70 percent of the area that historically provided good habitats for the flat - headed cat has already been converted into plantations , mostly for the purpose of growing biofuel .
Furthermore , their remaining range has become fragmented , likely making it difficult for remote populations of the cat to breed with one another .
Only 16 percent of that leftover land is currently contained within areas that are protected according to the criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
Thus , with an estimated baseline population of only around 2,500 individuals to start with , it 's likely that the flat - headed cat is in dire straits .
The cat 's predicament is not unique in the region where it lives .
Tropical Southeast Asia has both one of the highest rates of biodiversity and highest rates of deforestation worldwide .
Much of that deforestation is for the purpose of planting palms , a cash crop destined for the biofuel market .
Andreas Wilting of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research , who co-authored the new study , hopes that new awareness surrounding the plight of the flat - headed cat can help bring about protections for all species threatened in the region .
" The next step is to gain further information about the ecology of this little known species and to enforce the protection and thus ensure the sustainability of the key remaining forest habitats , " Wilting said .
Thus , the ultimate fate of the flat - headed cat may rest on whether this unknown but charismatic feline can break into the mainstream .
In the first presidential debate , Trump refused to condemn white supremacists and racism .
He said instead to these groups , and he shouted out the Proud Boys in particular , " Stand back and Stand by . "
Is that a command to his armed base to prepare for violence after Trump loses the election ?
Did he just tell white …
READ THE REST
The BBC plans to axe two radio ­stations – 6 Music and Asian Network – cut spending on imported shows and halve the size of its website , it is claimed today .
The Times says the measures are part of the BBC 's strategic review to be unveiled next month .
Under the plan , the BBC intends to shrink overall services and focus more on quality over quantity .
There have already been reports suggesting that the BBC will axe the digital radio stations 6 Music and Asian Network .
Quoting BBC
Trust sources , the newspaper states that the BBC director general , Mark Thompson , is also being pushed to slash the budget for imported shows such as Mad Men and Heroes by a third .
Thompson reportedly will also introduce a cap on spending on broadcast rights for sports events of 8.5 % of the licence fee , or about £ 300m .
The Times says the BBC's web pages are to be halved , backed by a 25 % cut in staff numbers .
The web operation 's £ 112 m budget will also be cut by 25 % .
It also plans to include more links to newspaper articles to drive traffic to the websites of rival publishers .
In November Thompson hinted at a period of retrenchment for the BBC , which is funded by the £ 3.6 bn annual licence fee .
He said then he was looking at cutting some of the BBC 's digital television and radio services after the analogue TV signal is switched off in 2012 .
He also raised the prospect of " reductions in some kinds of programmes and content " including a look at the " current scope of our website " .
He promised that , after the switchover , a higher proportion of the licence fee would be spent on " original British content " .
The Times reports that the BBC2 budget will be boosted by £ 25 m and the channel will be directed to go upmarket .
This will be funded by 25 % reduction in the corporation 's budget of £ 100 m for foreign acquisitions .
A spokeswoman for the BBC said last night she would not comment on " speculation " .
Here comes the sun( spots )
February , 2010 , was the first month since 2007 with sunspots every day according to Spaceweather.com for February 27 .
A quick check of February 28 confirms the streak .
So far there have been only 2 spot - free days in 2010 .
By comparison there were 260 spot - free days in 2009 , and there have been 772 spot - free days since 2004 .
What this means is that one of the quietest periods of solar activity in recent history may be coming to an end .
The relevance of this is that sunspot activity has been proposed by many , such as Geerts and Linacre , as a possible driver of Earth 's climate patterns , including global warming and cooling cycles .
As with most climate theory , the science has not been settled on the link between sunspots and Earth 's climate .
Most , but not all according to some .
Global Warming theory is considered so sacred and settled that until recently any scientist who questioned the tenets of its conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of climate change were subject to all but ridicule and censure .
Recent events , including the Climategate scandal and a series of years where global temperature has stayed about the same , have tempered this attitude .
But now the sunspots come back and we , as junior scientists are presented with the opportunity to test the hypothesis .
If sunspot activity increases , and other factors such as prevalence of greenhouse gases , volcanic activity , and known cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation continue in their recent patterns and temperature increases , then we may conclude that sunspots do indeed affect Earth 's climate .
If not , then we can eliminate sunspots as a significant contributor to climate change .
We also have the opportunity to make another observation in the realm of the social sciences .
If sunspot activity does increase and temperatures increase even when other factors are accounted for , then if there are any individuals with a vested interest in the carbon trading industry it would be expected that these individuals will attribute the rise in temperatures to CO2 levels increasing .
If no one makes such claims then we can conclude that everyone is really interested in the facts only and have no vested interest in controlling carbon consumption .
A scientist would wait for the data to come in .
A gambler would lay odds on another round of global warming hysteria if temperatures rise no matter what the real reason .
Tom Bruner is not a scientist .
I ’m reviving this long - dormant website for a moment to eulogize my cat , Charley .
Longtime readers of this site know that I adopted two cats , Charley and Thurston , shortly after they were born in December 1999 .
Thurston passed away in 2013 .
This past Sunday , I awoke to find out my Charley cat had passed away peacefully in his sleep .
He made it to a whopping 18 years old .
Charley was a tuxedo cat who was very mischievous in his younger years .
He chewed through cords , he scaled the highest heights , he chased toys around , and he once caught a mouse .
He also loved nothing more than to snuggle with his cat - brother .
Charley could be slow to warm up to people , but once he warmed up to you , he was affectionate and would purr loudly the second you touched him .
In the past few years , Charley had to adapt to a lot of changes .
We had a human baby , we moved , and then Charley ’s brother died .
We debated for a long time about whether to add another pet to the household , and earlier this year , we got a puppy .
We got the puppy in July , and by November , Charley had decided they could be good friends .
Suddenly , he was drinking out of the dog ’s water bowl while the dog ate his food .
He teamed up with the dog to beg me for pieces of chicken .
When the dog ate a dog biscuit , Charley ate the crumbs .
We even installed a special gate with a cat - sized opening , so Charley could come and go as he pleased but still have a dog - free space ( and the dog would n’t steal his cat food ) .
He started sleeping on the dog ’s bed , and I thought that soon they ’d be snuggling together by the fire .
Over the past few weeks , my son would regularly have Charley on his lap and the dog next to him ; or I ’d have Charley on my lap with the puppy at my feet .
I miss Charley already .
It ’s the end of an era – it feels so strange for me to suddenly not have a cat in my house , after living with cats for the past 18 years .
On that note , this will most likely be the last time I post to this website , but the archives will live on .
I started this site in a time before Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr were around .
At this point , I think it ’s outlived its original purpose .
I almost produced a Men and Cats book and a Men and Cats calendar , but neither project came to fruition .
Others subsequently did produce such books and calendars , even though this website was the first project to really celebrate men who love cats , as far as I know .
Thanks to everyone for all your years of support and for those who contributed , I am honored that you chose to share your photos and stories with me and the audience for this site .
Please pet your cats for me .
Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Anthony has covered the National Geographic Northern Hemisphere temperature graph here .
This is the graph under discussion .
Figure 1 . Graph from November 1976 National Geographic article
Since I ’m a suspicious guy who never takes anything on faith , I went and got the original data that was used by National Geographic .
According to Joanne Nova , the early part of the record is from Budyko , and the latter part from Angell and Korshover .
I digitized the data from the original documents .
I was able to replicate the National Geographic graph quite closely .
Then I graphed it against the GISS Northern Hemisphere data .
Here is that graph :
Figure 2 . ( Upper ) Data from November 1976 National Geographic article , and GISS temperature data .
Both datasets are for the Northern Hemisphere .
( Lower ) Difference between the two datasets ( right scale ) .
A few notes , in no particular order .
1. Most of the ~ 0.2 °C difference between the NatGeo and Giss data in the recent record is likely from the 1941 sea surface temperature ( SST ) adjustment .
See here , here , and here for discussion of this adjustment .
There is an abrupt jump 1940 - 1941 .
2 . For the middle part of the record , they track each other pretty closely .
3 . There is another adjustment , again of ~ 0.2 °C , for unknown reasons , in the period from the start of the record to 1906 .
Again , there is an abrupt drop 1906 - 1907 .
4 . The existence of these two adjustments is shown by a discontinuity analysis ( described here on page 2845 paragraph 2 ) .
This is the result of that analysis :
FIgure 2 . Residual Sum of Squares Discontinuity Analysis .
The breaks at 1906 and 1941 are clearly shown by this method of analysis .
So we have two major adjustments of ~ 0.2 °C , for one of which we likely know the justification , and for the other , I have no idea .
Go figure …

A fresh look at forgotten fossils has revealed two new species of giant , filter - feeding fish that swam Earth 's oceans for 100 million years , occupying the ecological niche now filled by whales and whale sharks .
Until now , that ancient niche was thought to be empty , and such fish to be a short - lived evolutionary bust .
" We knew these animals existed , but thought they were only around for 20 million years , " said Matt Friedman , a University of Oxford paleobiologist .
" People assumed they were n't important , that they were an evolutionary failure that was around for a brief time and winked out .
Now we realize that they had a long and illustrious evolutionary history . "
In a paper Feb. 18 in Science , Friedman and five other paleobiologists describe Bonnerichthys gladius and Rhinconichthys taylori .
They belong to the pachycormid genus , an extinct group of immense fishes that ate by drifting slowly , mouth agape , sucking down plankton and other tiny aquatic life .
Prior to the paper 's publication , pachycormids were known from fossils of a single species , Leedsichthys problematicus .
( The species name derives from the fragmented remains of its first fossils . )
Leedsichthys was an impressive creature , reaching lengths of 30 and perhaps even 50 feet , but its fossils have only been found in western Europe and are between 160 and 145 million years old — a brief , relatively unexceptional footnote to animal history .
However , during a chance visit by Friedman to the University of Kansas , researchers from their Natural History Museum told him of odd recoveries from a newly - prepared fossil deposit : delicate plates and long rods of bone , jumbled beyond recognition .
As Friedman put the pieces together , he realized that the plates were part of a jaw , and the rods were gills .
That configuration was known from Leedsichthys , but this clearly belonged to a new species .
Working with other museums , Friedman found more examples of the species , which he dubbed B. gladius .
They had been collected in the 19th century and mistakenly classified as Leedsichthys , or dismissed as uninteresting .
By the time he was finished , Friedman found B. gladius fossils as old as 172 million years , and as young as 66 million years .
In the dusty recesses of London 's Natural History Museum , He also found another pachycormid species , R. taylori ; it had been mischaracterized and forgotten by Gideon Mantell , the English paleontologist credited with starting the scientific study of dinosaurs .
Altogether , the fossils showed that pachycormids were not a footnote , but an evolutionary chapter that spanned more than 100 million years .
" That 's longer than the duration of any living groups of feeders , " said Friedman .
" That 's longer than the Cenozoic , when mammals ascended to ecological dominance . "
The disappearance of B. gladius from the fossil record coincides with the Cretaceous - Paleogene mass extinction , which wiped out the dinosaurs and bequeathed terrestrial Earth to birds , mammals and insects .
Then , extinction was likely caused by an asteroid strike or period of prolonged volcanic activity that shrouded the planet in dust , or both , causing massive die - offs in bottom - of - the - food - chain plants .
With a diet based on photosynthesizing algae , the pachycormids " had the perfect profile of a victim and became extinct , " wrote Lionel Cavin , a paleontologist at Geneva 's Natural History Museum , in an accompanying commentary .
Ten million years after B. gladius disappeared , sharks and rays rose to prominence .
Twenty - five million years after that , modern whales evolved .
As described in another Science paper , the whales ' evolution coincided with a rebirth of the photosynthetic algae that had once fed B. gladius and the other pachycormids .
Friedman plans to continue studying the pachycormids , and hopes his story will inspire other researchers .
" We 've just flagged off a couple examples of these animals , " he said .
" We know there must be others in the fossil record .
Often , when people are collecting fossils in the field , they leave behind the fish , because they 're not thought to be important .
We hope they keep them . "

And yet Pope Benedict should also recognize how precarious the Catholic Church is in Germany .
Like Americans , Germans have already had to cope with a general loss of trust in public institutions .
First there were the bankers , with their insane bets and bonuses .
Then the politicians , who could n’t stop the bankers .
Now there is a loss of trust in the church .
But unlike in America , religion in Germany is already weak .
In the former Communist east , only 2 percent of the population go to church on Sunday ; in the western states , the number is 8 percent .
Some dwindling congregations have had to sell their church buildings .
So far the church is benefiting from the breadth of sexual abuse scandals .
Victims are also coming forward from Protestant institutions , from secular boarding schools and elite academies , from children ’s homes .
Many critics argue that any closed institution where male educators have charge of male children runs the risk of sexual abuse .
Conservative Catholic bishops go further , saying that the sexual abuse committed by their priests is a general social problem , traceable not to the church but to the sexualization of society , to the zeitgeist , to the sins of the 1968 generation .
The truth , they suggest , was that the evil had struck in all sectors of society .
Others have warned of the dangers of a witch hunt , and some have even highlighted a new form of political correctness .
But the figures available so far show that the problem is especially severe in the Catholic Church .
Alois Glück , president of the Central Committee of German Catholics , has urged consideration of the “ church - specific conditions that favor sexual abuse , ” which many have taken as a call for the church to reconsider the matter of its priests ’ celibacy .
This is yet another difference between the Irish and American scandals and our own .
Ireland and America are deeply religious places ; if priestly celibacy is not as well understood there as it once was , it is nevertheless respected .
When it comes to New York City ’s public schools , one thing is not in dispute : there are problems , a lot of them .
The city ’s kids have below average math and reading scores , and very high drop out rates – of 50 large US cities , NY is close to the bottom , at 43rd .
And while there are disagreements about the reasons for these problems , the big dispute these days is about the solutions , and specifically , about the role of charter schools and their relationship to “ traditional ” public schools .
One skirmish took place recently , in the basement auditorium of the Ralph Bunche Trilingual School on West 123rd Street in Harlem .
The room was almost full , as parents and community residents held a tense “ town hall meeting ” with school Chancellor Joel Klein .
Increasing the number of charter schools has been a major priority of Bloomberg and Klein ’s Department of Education .
Plans are set for fall openings of 24 more , bringing the total to 123 , and the mayor is pushing the state legislature to allow him to add another 100 .
Charter schools would then make up 22 % of all schools in the district .
At the meeting , parents ’ questions focused on the area ’s charter school explosion ( 24 of 29 charter schools in Manhattan are located in Harlem ) .
Many expressed anger and frustration with the DOE ’s policy of placing charter schools in existing school buildings , which most cities do not allow .
Existing schools have been forced to cut space usage and programs or move to other less desirable locations .
Even parents who said that they do n’t oppose charter schools in principle , talked about the “ separate and unequal ” situation that is developing , the fomenting of divisions within communities , and the negative impact on the children in the regular schools when their learning and recreational space is usurped by a charter school , often without discussion or advance notice .
But some parents were there to support the charters — the charter school “ movement ” has relied on the fact that many families are indeed desperate for better schools for their children , and the worst schools are mainly in working - class , especially Black and Latino , communities .
Klein claims that the DOE has only the children ’s interests at heart , and that charters give parents choices and advance school reform .
The idea is that charter schools can do better with less , and can experiment with educational approaches , unfettered by the restrictions ( read union rights ) within the public school system .
But national research has shown that in fact , many charter schools are falling short , with one study finding that only 17 percent offered students a better education than public schools – and that 37 percent were actually worse .
New York City ’s charters have had better results , on the other hand .
What is different ?
One big part of the answer is that they do not , in fact , have “ less ” resources .
Those charter schools that are housed in public school buildings ( two - thirds of the total ) receive approximately the same amount per pupil as public schools do .
And charter schools have access to other resources : high powered ( and highly paid ) CEOS and governing boards , favored relationships with DOE officials and other connections with Wall Street and the corporate world , and NYC has a lot of that .
Parents are obviously motivated by their children ’s needs , but Bloomberg and Klein ’s motivation is another thing entirely .
The Chancellor said at the meeting that the DOE only wants the best for children in neighborhoods like Harlem .
But in 2008 , the DOE enacted budget cuts that disproportionately hurt the highest poverty schools , and cancelled out the positive effects of increased need - based funding from the state .*
In 2005 and 2006 , Bloomberg successfully fought efforts that would have reduced class size , a proven way to enhance learning and reduce the achievement gap .
His opposition was undoubtedly due to the proposal to fund this by continuing the city ’s tax surcharge on personal incomes over $ 500,000 .
And just last month , the mayor ’s handpicked Panel on Educational Policy voted to close 19 schools despite overwhelming community opposition and expert testimony about available alternatives , including federal funds , for turning these troubled schools around .
The bottom line is that Bloomberg ’s dream of school reform is a corporate one : weakened union protections for staff and teachers , an expanded role – and profits – for the private sector , and as little public funding and regulation as can be gotten away with .
That scenario cannot provide quality education for all children , which is what the growing movement is fighting for , and which like all the issues facing working people , will require unity and mobilization to win .
*” New York City ’s Contract for Excellent : Closing the Funding Gap or a Funding Shell Game ” http://www.aqeny.org/action-information.php, report by the Alliance for Quality Education and the Fiscal Policy Institute found that the DOE cut more from the schools with the highest poverty rates .

I know it seems like we went through a war and it was sweet to see the Republicans lose .
And , much more importantly , it was good to see more people covered ( kind of , since they have to buy the insurance that they are " covered " by ) .
And there are many great things in this bill , which I have talked about at length .
But this celebration is premature and over - hyped .
The insurance companies are still in charge .
In fact , they have 31 million new customers handed to them by the government .
The issue of costs has simply not been addressed .
As things stand now , there is absolutely nothing that can stop insurance companies from raising your premiums tomorrow .
And they will , at some point .
That 's a guarantee .
I 'm afraid they are going to be a little bit savvier than raising prices immediately though .
Here is the nightmare scenario -- they jack up rates right before the next election ... and blame it on the Democrats .
The Republicans are already previewing this strategy .
They 're talking about how this bill will raise your premiums .
That 's absolutely not true , but it is true that the bill does almost nothing to prevent insurance companies from doing so .
The drama over the passage of this bill was always fake .
The Democrats had overwhelming majorities in the Senate and House .
I never once doubted they were going to pass the bill .
That was n't the question .
The question was what kind of bill they were going to pass .
And the kind they passed was as weak as possible .
Every branch of the health care industry absolutely loved it , from the drug makers to the large hospitals .
No public option .
No Medicare buy - in .
No competition for the insurance companies .
No price controls .
This is the historic victory ?
It feels a little like when we pulled Saddam 's statue down in Baghdad .
Yea , we beat Saddam !
Was that ever a question ?
Of course , we were going to take Baghdad , but that did n't mean we won the war .
With this premature celebration over health care reform , I smell a little Iraq in the air .
The underlying problems still exist .
Yes , they stopped some of the bleeding and some of the bandages they applied were large , but the patient still has cancer .
The rates are never going to stop going up as long as our only option is private insurance companies who are legally bound to make as much money from us as humanly possible while delivering the smallest amount of service .
The wound festers and grows ( with 31 million new customers ) .
When will it pop back up again ?
The next time they decide to raise the rates .
When is that ?
Well , that 's the ticking time bomb .
And it has not yet been defused .
I would n't put up any " Mission Accomplished " signs yet and I would n't promise the American people that we have a historic fix to the health care problem in this country .
Especially when they 're going to see differently the next time they get the bill .
Watch The Young Turks Here
Speaking at the Digital Landscapes conference at UCD , European Director of Google 's online sales John Herlihy said that Google is mostly oriented towards mobile devices , claiming they 'll become more important than desktop PCs .
“ In three years time , desktops will be irrelevant .
In Japan , most research is done today on smart phones , not PCs , ” he said .
True , with Android and Nexus One Google has shown a commitment to extend its dominance from the online world to the mobile world .
But will desktop PCs really become irrelevant ?
Depends on how you look at it .
Google is n't really interested in how we edit our photos ; it 's interested in where we store them , and increasingly , we do that at a place is a part of their domain — the cloud .
And if your data moves to the cloud , and most of your daily online activities are done on devices such as the Nexus One and the iPad , where simple , widget - style applications cater to your precise needs , then yes , desktop PCs as we know them now will become a lot less important .
On the other hand , not many users are ready to ditch the desktop just yet ; we 'll see if it all pans out according to Google 's plans .

Green consumers sometimes take the moral high ground – but it ’s all too easy to slide back down .
New research suggests that those who make “ green ” purchases are subsequently more likely to behave selfishly , cheat and steal .
“ Another way to think about it is that you ’re off the hook – you ’ve done your good deed , ” explains Benoît Monin , a psychologist at Stanford University in California who studies the phenomenon , called “ moral self - licensing ” .
Moral self - licensing has been shown elsewhere , too .
In the run-up to the 2008 US presidential election , for instance , Monin found that people who expressed their support for Barack Obama , thereby winning credit as non-racists , were more likely to later declare that whites would be better suited than blacks for a hypothetical job vacancy in a police department ( Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , vol 45 , p 590 ) .

To find out if green consumerism gives people a similar licence to behave badly , Nina Mazar and Chen - Bo Zhong of the University of Toronto in Canada set up experiments in which students were presented with simulated online stores .
Good shop , bad shop
Students were asked to fill their online shopping baskets with up to $ 25 - worth of items , and half were presented with a store stocked mostly with “ green ” products – compact fluorescent instead of incandescent light bulbs , for instance – to make it more likely that they would shop green .
The other half were given a store stocked with a majority of conventional products .
After their online shopping spree , the students were asked to carry out one of two tasks .
One group was told to allocate $ 6 between themselves and another participant .
Mazar and Zhong found that green shoppers in this group kept more for themselves than the others did .
The most striking results , however , came from the group that carried out the second task .
Students were shown a pattern of dots and asked to say whether more fell to the left or the right of a diagonal line .
They were told they would get half a cent each time they said more dots were on the left , but 5 ¢ each time they said more were on the right – providing a clear incentive to lie about the results to earn more money .
Those who played the game both accurately and truthfully would make $ 2.07 .
The winnings of those who had shopped in the conventional store did not differ significantly from this sum .
The green shoppers , however , earned on average 36 ¢ more , showing that they had lied to boost their income .
Light green fingers
Finally , the volunteers in the second group were shown on screen how much they had won and told to take the right amount of cash from an envelope .
Both groups took more than their due , but the green shoppers on average stole 48 ¢ more than those who had shopped in the conventional store .
“ It ’s a very impressive paper , ” says Monin .
It remains unclear how far the moral glow of green consumerism makes people feel they have licence to cheat and steal in the real world .
Douglas Medin , a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , says that more work must be done to see whether the same thing happens in different situations and cultures .
But moral self - licensing could explain the counterproductive results of some attempts to reduce environmental footprints , such as the recent finding that people in the UK who have made their homes more energy - efficient are more likely to turn up their heating or keep it on for longer .

It is not clear if the hacker posted anything on Mr Obama 's Twitter page
A Frenchman who police say hacked Twitter accounts belonging to US President Barack Obama and celebrities could face jail .
The unemployed 25 - year - old was arrested on Tuesday after an operation lasting several months , conducted by French police with agents from the FBI .
The 25 - year - old is said to have hacked into the micro- blogging website , by simply guessing users ' passwords .
The suspect reportedly targeted other celebrities , including Britney Spears .
After being questioned by police , he was ordered to appear at court in the central French city of Clermont - Ferrand on 24 June .
Hacking into a database in France is a crime which can carry a two - year jail term .
The suspect , who used the pseudonym " Hacker Croll " , had no specialist training , Adeline Champagnat , head of the French central office against online fraud , told Reuters news agency .
He gained access to Twitter accounts by simply working out the answers to password reminder questions on targets ' e-mail accounts , according to investigators .
The former vicar general of the Munich archdiocese did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him for comment at home .
Phone calls to the archdiocese for reaction on Thursday night were not answered .
On Wednesday , speaking generally about the question of Father Hullermann ’s therapy , a spokesman at the archdiocese , Bernd Oostenryck , said , “ Thirty years ago , the subject was treated very differently in society . ”
“ There was a tendency to say it could be therapeutically treated , ” Mr. Oostenryck said .
Father Hullermann was transferred in December 1977 to the St. Andreas Church in Essen , an industrial city in the Ruhr region not far from where he was born in Gelsenkirchen .
The three sets of parents who complained to the church said Father Hullermann had had “ sexual relations ” with their children in February 1979 , according to a statement this week by the diocese in Essen .
In the minutes taken by the priest in charge of the parish at the meeting with the parents , he noted that in order to protect their children they “ would not file charges under the current circumstances . ”
For decades it was common practice in the church not to involve law enforcement in sexual abuse cases .
Vowing to change that , Bavarian bishops called Thursday for strengthening the duty of church officials to report cases of abuse , and even urged a change in German law requiring them to do so .
Spared prosecution after his transgressions in Essen , which according to the statement released by the diocese he “ did not dispute , ” Father Hullermann instead was ordered to undergo therapy with Dr. Huth .
The archdiocese said that order was personally approved by Archbishop Ratzinger .
Dr. Huth said he had recommended one - on - one sessions , which Father Hullermann refused .
Instead the priest took part in group sessions , usually seated in a circle with eight other patients , who had a mix of disorders , including pedophilia .
Dr. Huth , 80 , said that Father Hullermann had problems with alcohol , for which he prescribed medication , but that he was “ neither invested nor motivated ” in his therapy .
“ He did the therapy out of fear that he would lose his post ” and a “ fear of punishment , ” Dr. Huth said .

Two days ago a poster on the popular Godlike Productions message board predicted large quakes might occur on February 27 .
At 3:45 AM today , a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck Chile , the fifth or sixth strongest quake of the last 100 years .
The poster , “ ZOSIME , ” based his prediction on the impact of a coronal mass ejection ( CME ) upon the earth ’s magnetosphere .
The CME eruption was observed leaving the sun several days ago .
His post follows :
For my sister ( and maybe my 6 - years - ago self , too … )
I know you guys are so ready for this .
You ’ve been ready , the road to get here has been a little twisty and I CANNOT wait to be moms together .
Just giddy about it .
Let ’s start there .
We were a few days home from the hospital with Curran , and it had set in that maybe this was going to be harder than I thought .
A big transition .
My body torn up and my nipples chapped and the gut - wrenching worry that this teensy thing may just stop breathing or any number of tragic things that now feel like cold possibilities .
A thoughtful friend mailed a note and I ’ll never forget the perfect timing from an experienced mother .
I still keep it in Curran ’s keepsake journal .
The note reminded me that I was capable - that I was made to be this child ’s mother amidst the overwhelming exhaustion and newness of it all .
Motherhood is such a wild cocktail of elation and … grief maybe ?
I do n’t intend to be dramatic , but your life is never the same .
You think about and prepare for this transition for months , sometimes years , and there is no accurate description that will touch on how you feel the second you look at that baby .
You rebirth yourself in that moment as well .
You ’ve known great love , but nothing like this .
It fills a corner of your heart you did n’t even know was there .
That smell !
His skin !
Those itsy bitsy toes !
Seeing your husband hold his tiny body to his chest .
It ’s out of body , really .
So out of body , that sometimes you feel untethered .
The emotions , the physical healing , being responsible for that small life , getting through the day … it ’s a lot !
You feel so many things in the course of a day .
In the course of a moment .
It is both the best , most tender job AND so effing hard .
All day .
Every day .
You will second guess your own intuition and also find how to truly trust yourself outside of google and other opinions .
There is a lot of chatter about diapers and organic sheets and the best baby wash but there is a quieter murmur about the metamorphosis that occurs as a woman becomes a mother .
That metamorphosis seems to be life - long , far as I can tell , as the caring for these little people grows and changes .
My experience may be nothing like yours .
What worked for me or what I struggled with or when my babies slept or what bottle they liked may not matter at all come your turn .
I find that all that unknowing and problem solving and figuring and filtering through noise , is what builds your own confidence as a parent .
Pilfering through the shoulds and suggestions , to make choices that work for you and your family .
You are his mom and the best person for the job .
Believe that this very moment !
You have support all around you .
I want to pass on to you , just like that well timed note did for me , the affirmation that this role is yours , and you are absolutely capable .
You are everything he needs .
This mom business is immeasurably valuable work .
Let people help .
Drink lots of water .
Find your pockets of relief .
Your body will heal .
It will pass .
Tomorrow is a new day .
Sleep does return .
And it ’s just like every old lady tells you at the market on your most frustrating of days … it goes so fast .

Love you so dearly , my sister .
Happy to be on this wild ride with you .

The Congress should n’t even consider policy changes offering equality for homosexuals while the country is facing a recession and two wars , according to the House Minority Leader .
NBC ’s David Gregory asked Rep. John Boehner ( R - OH ) to comment about President Barack Obama ’s call to end the military ’s controversial policy known as “ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ” Rep . Boehner believes now is the wrong time .

“ In the middle of two wars and in the middle of this giant security threat , why would we want to get into this debate ? ”
Boehner asked , rhetorically .
“ At a time when Americans are asking ‘ where are the jobs , ’ why do we want to get in this debate ? ” he continued .
He added , “ While we ’re fighting over health care and trying to find some way to come to some common ground , why do we want to get into a divisive debate that will do nothing more than distract the real debate that should occur here about helping to get our economy going again and getting American people back to work ? ”
As a professional American TV journalist , it was Gregory ’s duty to “ leave it there . ”

Surge Incapacity
The United States ’ first " civilian surge " took place in August 1901 , when 500 teachers disembarked from the USS Thomas , a converted cattle ship , in Manila Bay — " the men wearing straw boaters and blazers , " according to journalist and historian Stanley Karnow , " the women in long skirts and large flowery hats .
Like vacationers , they carried baseball bats , tennis rackets , musical instruments , cameras and binoculars . "
America ’s colonial enterprise was new :
Only a few months had passed since the Army had subdued a fierce insurgency and commenced governing the Philippines .
The Thomasites , as this proto-Peace Corps came to be known , had responded to an advertisement placed in newspapers across the United States .
The State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) no longer have to put ads in the papers to assemble a civilian force for the state - building effort now under way in Afghanistan , but it ’s remarkable how haphazard , and almost frantic , the system remains .
" It ’s a numbers game , " a USAID official told me , " a body game . "
Only a few of the 400 - odd civilians USAID has hired so far have either language or technical skills ; most are either eager youngsters or post - career officials from the military , State , or USAID .
Jack Lew , the deputy secretary of state who is overseeing the process , says that " it ’s proved incredibly difficult to take on such an urgent challenge when you do n’t have a deep enough bench . "
As an American , this is perplexing .
Why do we not have a deep enough bench — or any bench at all to speak of ?
We used to have one , even after we ceased to be a practicing colonial state .
Tens of thousands of civilians — most of them serving in the Army — governed Germany and Japan in the aftermath of World War II and left behind effective democratic states .
The " strategic hamlet " program in Vietnam — the core of the effort to win " hearts and minds " — involved more than 1,000 civilians , most from USAID .
But after the Vietnam War , both the military and the political leadership recoiled from the idea of counterinsurgency and " small wars . "
The Powell Doctrine stipulated that the United States would fight big wars or none at all , thus effectively eclipsing the space between " war " and " peace " where in the past it had deployed a civilian force .
The Powell Doctrine became received wisdom at precisely the moment it was being superseded by events , for the end of the Cold War produced a set of " complex emergencies " in Somalia , Haiti , Kurdistan , and the Balkans that required a combination of force and large - scale civilian presence .
In 1997 , Bill Clinton ’s administration issued a presidential directive designed to systematize the civilian - military response to such emergencies .
The reserve civilian force envisioned by the plan was never brought into being .
And George W. Bush ’s administration arrived in office ideologically opposed to state - building ; Bush ’s first national security advisor , Condoleezza Rice , sneeringly declared , " We do n’t need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten . "
And then reality reared its ugly head .
The fiasco in Iraq demonstrated even to the ideologues that you could n’t win the war unless you won the postwar as well ; and the postwar required civilian capacity .
In April 2004 , the National Security Council established the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization to orchestrate postwar operations .
Carlos Pascual , the first director ( and now ambassador to Mexico ) drew up a plan to field a rapid deployment force of civilian specialists backed by a pool of 3,000 reservists .
The cost of building the quick force and deploying it for three months would be a paltry $ 350 million a year .
The money was put in the State Department ’s budget , and then cut by the White House .
As Pascual explained to me several years later , the Pentagon believed in the new force , but the civilian agencies , ironically , did not .
The civilian force died yet another death .
The Pentagon under Robert Gates has continued to be an advocate for an " expeditionary " civilian capacity .
In a 2007 speech , Gates pointed out that the 6,600 professional Foreign Service officers could n’t quite man a single aircraft carrier strike group .
Gates called for " a permanent , sizeable cadre of immediately deployable experts with disparate skills " — a remarkable proposal coming from a defense secretary .
The Army already has thousands of its own such experts , but recognizes that the fundamentally political questions raised by state - building , or even disaster relief , require civilian authority and a civilian perspective .
The office of reconstruction and stabilization was finally funded in fiscal year 2009 ; its Response Readiness Corps has now recruited 78 officials , plus 554 on standby .
This will not take you far in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the office is not expected to play an important role in staffing either theater .
Even the thousand - odd civilians now being thrown into the breach in Afghanistan are spread very thin on the ground : A " district support team " may have half a dozen civilians quartered with , and escorted by , 300 Marines — this in a country of more than 28 million spread across an area about the size of Texas .
The civilians , while no longer carrying tennis rackets , are scarcely as well grounded in their jobs as the Marines .
A 2009 report by the National Defense University ( NDU ) notes , " Stabilization has to be led by teams of professionals who specialize in that work , train for it , and develop plans and doctrines for expeditionary operations in the same way that the military plans for crisis interventions . "
The distribution of resources is just as skewed as the distribution of manpower and preparedness .
A State Department official told me that in Kunar province , in the east , the military commander had $ 150 million to spend on local initiatives , while his USAID counterpart had just $ 10,000 .
A military officer is , of course , going to spend that money to support military objectives :
If the local warlord makes himself useful , he ’s probably going to get his share of that money no matter how much the locals hate him .
Officials in the Obama administration suffer none of their predecessors ’ hostility or ambivalence toward the tools of soft power , very much including the civilian force .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been adamant about reclaiming some of the capacities , and some of the authority , that in recent years have migrated to the Pentagon ; and her belief in the centrality of development to American national security dictates a far more prominent role for USAID .
There has been a slew of studies in recent years advocating enhanced civilian capacity ; most of the authors recommend situating that capacity not in State , which is a policy rather than an operation agency , but in some expanded and fortified version of USAID .
The NDU study proposed the establishment of a cabinet - level Agency for Development and Reconstruction .
The administration is now seriously contemplating such questions in its Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review .
Lew , who is running the review , says that before officials figure out where to locate the new corps , they have to ask themselves , " What capabilities do we need ? "
One operation may require 100 agronomists , but if the next demands 100 hydrologists , do you really want to hire all those experts instead of knowing where to find them ?
What " core capacities " must the government retain ?
If you need to be able to both rapidly deploy and sustain a presence over time , so that public health experts do n’t go home after three months — as they do now — does that require two different forces ?
The searing experience of Iraq and Afghanistan has made many Americans doubt the U.S. capacity to do much good at all abroad .
That skepticism is a necessary corrective to the airy fantasies of a few years ago , but it ’s also a new kind of hyperbole .
The Thomasites , four - fifths of whom , by the way , had prior teaching experience and thus more or less knew what they were doing , not only established a national school system in the Philippines , but offered the most benevolent possible face to America ’s colonial enterprise .
They did n’t leave a working democracy in their wake , but that ’s not what we ’re asking of the " civilian surge " in Afghanistan either .
We are hoping they will help tip the scales of Afghan public opinion toward the government rather than the Taliban .
Even that might be too much to ask .
But it would be a shame if we failed because we had n’t taken the responsibility seriously .

O’Connell and company follow in the footsteps of songwriter - producers like Arthur Russell and John Martyn — artists whose descent into effects made their voices all the more poignant and personal .
Frequently , Genericana also pays tribute to laid back club sounds , from dub to ambient techno -- and to the resourcefulness of the producers who invented these genres .

Most likely in preparation for the iPad launch , Apple has just raised the maximum size of apps that can be download over 3G to 20MB .
Until now , the iPhone required a Wi-Fi connection to download apps bigger than 10 mb , probably to preserve wireless carriers .
While this might seem like not much of a change , it actually plays a much bigger role than you think .
Many developers told us it is essential for them to have their apps available over 3G , indeed , most apps are actually bought on the move .
The arrival of the iPad has however created a serious supplementary dilemma .
The higher resolution of the iPad asks for better graphics which take a lot of space .
Developers were left wondering whether to keep their apps under 10 mb and available everywhere , or give them better graphics but lose the 3G sales .
Well , it seems like we 'll be having both in the end .
Nice move Apple !

After a short hiatus , the Amarok team is happy to announce that the Amarok Insider is back .
This time we have prepared many interesting bits for you , straight from the developers .
We also give you an exclusive sneak preview for the upcoming Amarok 2.3 .
Enjoy an insider look into Amarok development !
Interview with a Developer : Mark Kretschmann ( markey )
Since Amarok began with Mark 's determination to create a better free music player , it 's fitting that he is the first we interview for this series .
I can be quite enthusiastic about software , mostly because I spent half of my life doing it , and not just as a job , but because I really love computers and software .
There was a moment that I remember quite well : A few years ago , there was a Free Software conference in Germany , and we had a booth representing Amarok , which was then in the 1.4 version stages .
At one point , I sat down , and stared at the screen for about 10 minutes .
Harald Sitter ( now a Kubuntu developer ) asked me , " What are you doing there ? "
I said : " Honestly , I 'm just enjoying to look at what we have achieved .
This is good . "
I have experienced similar things with other software that I find excellent , for instance Dolphin , Chromium , and Qt Creator .
I guess one has to be a geek to understand this kind of feeling :)
With Amarok 2.3 , I am again having this feeling .
I can stare at the program for minutes , and in my head I 'm thinking back of all the hard problems we have encountered and eventually mastered , and then I just go : " Damn yeah .
Now we have something nice ! "
On the developer side , I have to say that I 'm really happy with our team right now .
Things are not always easy when trying to work with a huge number of developers , under a lot of stress because we have a short release cycle , while doing all this in our spare time .
At the time of this writing , only one of our developers is being sponsored for hacking on Amarok , but only part - time .
We thank Magnatune for this , and hope you will in turn support Magnatune .
The rest of us mostly have a day job , and we do all the Amarok development after work , or on weekends .
I think it 's quite remarkable what we achieve with the little resources we have , quite honestly .
One important aspect is sending in bug reports , on http://bugs.kde.org.
However , it is important to make the descriptions as detailed as possible , and also to check for existing duplicates of the same report .
Finding and removing such duplicates creates a huge workload for our bug triagers .
Further on , we 're always interested in hearing about interesting ideas for improving Amarok , and constructive criticism .
There are several places where our users can directly discuss ideas with our developers , such as IRC , our mailing list , and the forum .
Where should I start ?
Curing world hunger , and becoming king of Gaga - Land .
Those are high on top of my TODO list .
The list is long !
More seriously , what 's really important to me is that the Amarok 2.3 series will finally make a breakthrough on the Windows and Mac platforms .
For us developers it has been frustrating to see that these versions were mostly hindered by small details that were out of our control , like for instance the somewhat buggy Phonon backends on these platforms .
Amarok 2.x has been fully cross-platform from day 1 , there were only a few things that we had to change for each platform .
So we felt it 's a bit of waste what was happening there - we had a powerful music player ready for Windows , but still it could n't really be used .
Thanks so much for opening up to us users and lovers of Amarok , Mark .

*( See the blog post about the Amarok Windows port here : Amarok on Windows : Getting There )
And that will hopefully change now .
I personally think Amarok could see a similar transformation like the VLC media player went through :
It started out on Linux , but it 's now a highly successful application on many platforms .
This is what I wish will happen to Amarok as well .

Now that we have a beautiful new toolbar , how about some screenshots ?
Our website needs 2.2.2 and later , and you are welcome to add to the Forum thread : Amarok Screenshots .
Winners will be featured not only on the website , but here in Amarok Insider
Then there is also the issue of making decisions .
With a huge team of developers , there will naturally be disagreements from time to time .
Fortunately , we have come up with ways for finding solutions for most quarrels quickly , and we always try to reach a consensus , instead of a single person deciding things .
We do not have a formal maintainer , but instead we have a group of core developers .
Last not least , over the years many of us have become friends .
We have been working for such a long time on this ( some for five years and longer ) , that our meetings are almost starting to feel like a family get - together .
By now , some of my fellow developers have become very good friends , and that 's a nice feeling , I think .
We often talk about private things too ; for instance when someone is in trouble , we try to help each other out .
And that 's really great , I think :)
To create your playlist , you might want to search or sort your collection by various attributes , such as genre , ratings , playcount , how recently you acquired them , BPM , or filetype .
Toby genre , you will click the Sort Options icon to the right of the Search bar .
Mousing the Sort Options IconChoose Genre / Artist or Genre / Artist / Album , and then scroll down to your genre of interest , and drag the Artists , Albums , or Tracks you wish over to the Playlist .
Alternatively , you can right - click and choose ' Add to Playlist ' or ' Replace Playlist ' as you like .
Toby genre , typefor instance , into the Collection Search bar .
Same for year ; will get all of your albums tagged as being issued in 1980 .
You can add a '' to get all albums tagged before or after 1990 , by typingor
One can also search for more than one thing at a time .
Remember that you will get only items which matchsearches .
For instance , perhaps you want to listen to all tracks you 've added to your collection in the last 2 weeks , and have not yet heard .
Simply type . w=week(s ) , d=day (s ) , m=month (s ) .
You can search for score ( 1-100 ) , rating ( 1 - 10 ) , format ( mp3 , ogg , etc. ) , and bitrate .
Score is automatically given by Amarok when you play a track to the end , so searching forwould be another way to search for tracks you have n't listened to yet .
Rating is the star system you can assign tracks if you wish .
Remember that you can use half - stars , so the range is from zero to 10 .
Three stars , in other words , would be .
Again , you can use < and > to get all tracks you 've rated , say , 4 stars and above : .
If you would like to see the full range of search terms , click the paper icon next to the search bar , which is the Advanced Search menu .
Click onfor the drop - down menu of all searches .
Amarok has three features which draw many questions , since they all depend on outside processes to create tags or files .
The moodbar is back , but the mood files must be created outside of Amarok , using a script and Gstreamer .
Replay - gain can be used in Amarok , if you choose , to equalize volume within tracks or albums .
And if you tag your tracks with Beats per Minute ( bpm ) , you will be able to search by that tag , which is used in both workout and dance playlists .
I hope to have more for our readers about BPM and Replay - gain tagging in the next
The moodbar returned as of Amarok 2.2.2 .
It shows you the " mood " of a track , which you can then use to figure out when something interesting happens in the song .
In order for Amarok to analyze your music files to create moodbars , you will need to create moodbars using the moodbar program .
( See the wiki for downloads and binary packages . )
The moodbar package requires gstreamer and various plugins depending on the filetypes you use .
You will not need phonon - backend - gstreamer .
The Moodbar has been entirely rewritten .
There are two parts to the new moodbar implementation : the moodbar package , which contains a program that takes a music file and generates a .mood file , and support code in the Amarok source , which runs the binary and displays the moodbar .
The moodbar package depends on the GStreamer libraries .
Without the generated mood files , Amarok cannot show the moodbars for your music .

Have you wondered how to rate or " star " a track when it is n't playing ?
Right - click any track in the playlist or collection pane , and select Edit Track Details .
You might not have noticed the tabs across the top of this Tag Edit screen .
The Summary is interesting , but not editable .
The Tag tab is the familiar Tag Edit screen .
Next , we see Lyrics , which is any stored lyrics you have .
You can freely edit the lyric texts there , also .
Next tab is Statistics , were you can edit the Rating and even the Score if you like .
The tab to the furthest right is new : Labels .
You can begin to label your music with multiple genres , how they make you feel , or any other labels you think might be useful .
For now , searching of labels has n't been implemented but is planned .
Another useful feature of the Tag Edit screen is the file folder icon next to the track name .
Perhaps you notice an error in the track name , or have decided to delete a track .
Click that icon , and you 'll be taken to that file folder in your default file editor , whether it be Dolphin , Konqueror , or another .
There you can Rename the file , or send it to the Trash .
Tag Edit ScreenSince 2.1 , our Playlist menu has been improved .
Some people who were used to the old layout have n't located the new options at the bottom of the Playlist pane .
At the top are all the Playlist Sorting configuration options .
At bottom are icons to Clear the playlist , Save the playlist , Undo or Redo a previous action , Show active track , and the most powerful : Track progression .
We know you love Amarok , because you are reading this Would you like to help out ?
There are lots of work to be done , from developing / programming , to answering questions on IRC , the Forum or mail list , reporting and triaging bugs , or helping us write newsletters .
We 're also hard at work on a new Handbook .
We need writers , editors , copy -editors , and people to do screenshots .
For more ideas , see Contribute Come into # Amarok channel on Freenode IRC .
Do n't sit and idle too long in the channel ; speak up and ask how you can help !
Sometimes there is no one who can tell you , but there is almost always someone to chat with about music or Amarok .
Also , our developers who are improving Amarok 's interface with mobile devices such as mp3 players , smartphones , iPods and such could really use some of your old devices , even if they have cracked screens , very small capacity , weak batteries and such .
As long as they work and come with chargers and cables , they can be useful .
Please write to the Amarok list or stop by IRC if you have such a device to donate .
As lovers of Amarok , we 've all wondered how we can help the developers build a better , more stable Amarok .
One of the best ways is to file good , informative bug reports when we run into problems .
A part of the forum which everyone should read is IMPORTANT README : Bug Reports .
An important caution : we do not accept reports against Amarok 1.x as we do not maintain it anymore .
So please do not file any bug reports against it ; those will be closed .
It 's useful to run Amarok from your console , especially if you are encountering problems .
You will get more output if you useor .
Or you can run Amarok within gdb , the GNU Debugger .
First , install gdb , then run Amarok inside of it in the console : .
You 'll get some startup text , then type , at least in my system .
It is also possible to invoke gdb on a running Amarok , if it starts into a loop or something .
More about that here : How to Create Useful Bug Reports : Retrieving a Backtrace with GDB
If you can , it 's good to come into IRC and ask if what you are experiencing is a known problem .
Please ask your question and wait for at least 20 minutes if it does n't seem busy .
Your developers may be be hard at work , and finish something before they can come discuss your issue with you .
If you do n't have the time , please use the Forum for your question .
Neither of these is not a shortcut to filing a bug report ; simply a way of finding out if your bug report will be useful .
Please never paste long backtraces or other console output in IRC or the forum .
Use a pastebin , such as Amarok Pastebin .
If you have a screenshot , you can use Imagebin If Amarok crashes , a Dr. Konqui window should pop up and ask if you want to file a bug report .
If you have time , and think it 's a useful bug , please take the time to do so .
It 's good to look through your backtrace which Dr. Konqui will display for you and see if there are many lines with ??? in them .
These question marks mean that you do n't have the - dbg ( debugging ) packages for programs Amarok uses such as Xine , Phonon , or some libs .
I have n't found a convenient way to search for all these as a group , but I 've just looked through the list of - dbg packages Synaptic shows , and compared it to the lines with ???
in my old , not - so - useful backtraces .
Dr. Konqui might also report that " your bug report might not be useful , " and assign it only one star .
Fortunately we have a great guide on How to Create Useful Bug Reports ; please use that .
Now Dr. Konqui reports that my backtraces might be useful , so I 'm happy even when Amarok crashes !
More about this here : How to Create Useful Crash Reports : Preparing Your KDE Packages .
In Dr. Konqui , please read each step and answer as best you can .
It also helps to recreate what you were doing , with the same files , to see if you can reliably crash Amarok .
Near the end of the process , you 'll be asked to compare your experience to already - reported bugs .
It will help if you look through the suggested matches , and attach your report to a close match if you find one .
Only file a new bug if you see nothing similar .
Dr. Konqui helpfully displays your backtrace to that of possibly similar bugs , so you can compare them side - by - side .
Once you have finished filing , you will be subscribed to that bug , so the developers can write and ask for more information if necessary .
Also , you 'll hear when your bug is resolved .
Thanks for your help !
Once you 've entered a few useful bug reports , perhaps you want to kick your helpfulness up a level .
Why not build your Amarok from " Git " -- the version control system used for creating Amarok .
Myriam ( Mamarok ) has written a step - by - step tutorial on how to do this , for the non-developer .
See Guide to Compiling Amarok from Git Locally - Full Summary for the step - by - step .
It was rather scary to uninstall Amarok from my system in preparation for the new install from Git , but it was worth the worry !
Be sure to uninstall Amarok - common and Amarok - utils if you have those installed also .
Work slowly and thoroughly through each step , making sure that each package you need is installed , and each step is done completely , before moving on to the next .
I enjoy Synaptic , which is easy to search , but if you are more comfortable using Adept or the console , feel free !
When I had problems , I googled the error messages , to see if someone had already found a solution .
Also , kindly people in #amarok were holding my hand along the way .
Some of the steps you will need to take using the command line , but they are not difficult .
Copy / paste after you understand what you are doing , and watch your computer work hard !
One discovery : if you want a " clean build " , erase your CMakeCache.txt , and run your Cmake command and make install again .
This allows Amarok to be built against ( using ) updated dependencies .
Do n't worry ; your first build will take quite some time , but ccache will remember that build , and tell cmake to only build changes .
One note -- when I ran into repeated errors , and checked my build steps one by one and find them all correct , only to have the error repeat , a restart of KDE solved it .
I have no idea why , but sometimes a restart does help , so try it before giving up .
It really was a thrill to open Amarok again , and see my playlist intact .
Now the bugs I find will be from a fresh build , which will assist the developers in the most helpful way .
Again , check in IRC or on the Amarok Forum before filing a bug against a new build , because bugs are often discovered and fixed within a few minutes .
As mentioned in the preceeding article , the Amarok community has support channels on Freenode IRC .
To connect to IRC , you can use quite a number of clients , including Pidgin .
My personal favorite is Konversation , available in Kubuntu .
Many prefer Quassel Xchat , or for the text - only crowd , IRSSI .
Our channel is called #amarok .
Once you enter , you might want to hang out there for a bit , and see what goes on .
Once you ask your question , please be patient .
The developers and others who help by answering questions and helping folks out , are not at their computers every moment , and sometimes are busy with other tasks too .
Also , do n't ask if you can ask your question !
Just ask .
Wait at least 15 or 20 minutes before giving up , please .
This is a nice write - up of how to conduct yourself , and get the answer to your question or problem :
The Rules of IRC Support .
Besides the main channel , which is English - speaking , we have German : #amarok.de , French : #amarok.fr and Spanish : #amarok.es .
We can always use more people in the channel answering questions and helping people with their problems .
Many of our readers already know about the Internet services available through Amarok , but more might have snuck in while you were n't watching .
Besides the ever - popular , we also have the wonderfulavailable to us , and they even fund one of our developers !
Plus , every purchase from them from Amarok , they share 10 % with Amarok .
Nice !
And remember that 50 % of what you choose to pay goes directly to the artist , unlike CDs purchased from most online services or in record shops .
is a somewhat - similar service based in France .
From the site : Jamendo is a community of free , legal and unlimited music published under Creative Commons licenses .
You might not know how muchis working for us .
First , it keeps your statistics if you create a free account and have Amarok scrobble for you ( report each track you play on your account page ) .
Next , it is now our source for album covers .
Finally , our Dynamic Playlists can use Similar Artists from Last.fm to suggest tracks and artists for your playlists ..
Be sure to move the pointer from 0 to 100 % ; the first time I tried it out , I wondered why my " similar " artists were totally NOT similar .
Duh !
Set up Last.fm and the other Internet services in .
Check each of those you want to give a try .
andI do n't know much about , but have used thesuccessfully to find a couple of favorites from National Public Radio .

At Gen. Augusto Pinochet ’s funeral , one of his grandsons , an Army captain also named Augusto Pinochet , gave a eulogy so defiant and aggressive that he was cashiered the next day .
Earlier , as the general lay in state in his dress uniform and Chileans filed by his casket to pay their last respects , the grandson of another general , assassinated by Pinochet ’s secret police , spat on the former dictator ’s cadaver full in the face .
That was barely three years ago , and it suggested that the ghost of General Pinochet , who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990 and continued as army commander until 1998 , would be hard to exorcise .
But the scenes of Chileans ’ embracing soldiers who aided in rescue and reconstruction efforts after the huge earthquake last month make all that divisiveness seem an eternity ago .
“ This disaster was so immense that what people are seeking above all now is stability , ” said Gregory B. Weeks , author of “ The Military and Politics in Postauthoritarian Chile ” and a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte .
“ This is the first real troop presence since the end of the dictatorship , and obviously raises a certain amount of nervousness .
But it marks a return to a normal civil - military relationship . ”
The euphoria is such that Chileans seem willing to overlook serious lapses in the performance of the other military services .
Instead , public dissatisfaction with the government ’s slow response has been transferred to Michelle Bachelet , who began her term as president four years ago as a symbol of reconciliation .
Still , Ms. Bachelet , the daughter of a general and herself a former defense minister who was jailed , tortured and exiled , stepped down Thursday with an 84 percent approval rating .
Daina Taimina is a mathematician at Cornell University
Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes , a book on how to make geometric models using needlepoint , has won a prize given to oddly - titled books .
Written by Latvian mathematician Daina Taimina , it was adjudged the winner of the annual Diagram Prize after a public vote run by the Bookseller magazine .
Other candidates included Afterthoughts Of A Worm Hunter and Collectible Spoons of the Third Reich .
Last year 's prize went to a guide to containers of Fromage Frais .
Taimina , a mathematician at Cornell University , uses crochet to illustrate the properties of hyperbolic planes .
Difficult to model , these are forms in which lines curve away from each other instead of running parallel or converging .
Her creations , which resemble complex coral formations , have been hailed by academics and included in art shows .
The Diagram Prize has been running since 1978 under the watchful eye of The Bookseller 's Horace Bent .
Mr Bent attributed the book 's win to " the public proclivity towards non-Euclidian needlework " .
Anti-Tory majority needs to assert itself to save Britain , he says in Guardian article
Peter Hain today becomes the first cabinet minister to call for a new era of Labour - Liberal Democrat co-operation , saying " the new development in British politics is the emerging common ground " between the two parties .
He tells the Guardian : " The stakes are very high .
If we recognise our common ground , a new progressive era of political reform based on Britain 's natural anti-Tory majority can take charge . "
Hain 's remarks in an article and accompanying interview appear designed to encourage anti-Tory tactical voting , and to open up the possibility of a form of co-operation between the two other main parties in the event of a hung parliament .
" Only if progressives come together to fight for their beliefs can Labour win the election and be at the centre of a wider movement of like - minded people , " the secretary of state for Wales says .
Hain also calls on progressives of all kinds to vote tactically against the Tories in Labour - Tory marginals .
He argues that tactical voting in such seats " would not require voters to sign up to Labour 's entire record or every one of our policies , still less to renounce their principles " .
He argues that millions of people see themselves not as dyed - in - the - wool Labour supporters but as progressive individuals who may also vote for the Lib Dems , Greens , or Plaid Cymru in Wales .
Hain supports what many see as necessary for a stable coalition government to be formed : a fixed - term parliament , common in most other countries .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , has embraced the proposal , and it is understood that the home secretary , Alan Johnson , also favours the move on the basis that it would be a symbol of the government giving up a power .
It is often argued that a minority party in a hung parliament should not risk joining a coalition without fixed - term parliaments because if the larger party is free to chose the election date , it can manipulate events so that an election is called at a time of maximum advantage to them .
Hain says there are strong similarities between the Labour and Lib Dem programmes , on constitutional reform , handling the economic recovery , public service reform and even civil liberties .
Differences on issues such as ID cards are smaller than is recognised , he suggests .
Many cabinet ministers are privately revising their forecasts for the election in the face of a slew of polls pointing to a hung parliament .
Some privately favour a deal with the Lib Dems even if Labour secures a small overall majority .
Hain admits : " The anti-Tory tactical voting that stood progressives in good stead in the 1997 and 2001 elections has gradually been unwinding .
I detect on the ground that there is an awakening , and people are beginning to realise Tory government would be horrendous .
I think it is very important that the anti-Tory forces come together .
The anti-Tory majority in this country needs to assert itself to save Britain . "
Hain said Labour was for the first time committed to wholesale constitutional reform - the alternative vote system , an elected Lords , and the right of recall of corrupt MPs .
" Together we could allow a really exciting agenda for the next parliament , and I think it is something the Liberal Democrats would support . "
Hain will make a similar appeal more directly on Saturday at the Welsh Labour Pparty conference , where he will appeal to middle Wales not to let the Conservatives back in .
The last poll in Wales by HTV showed Labour leading the Conservatives by 35 to 32 points .

Plastics surround us .
A vital manufacturing ingredient for nearly every existing industry , these materials appear in a high percentage of the products we use every day .
Although modern life would be hard to imagine without this versatile chemistry , products composed of plastics also have a dark side , due in part to the very characteristics that make them so desirable -- their durability and longevity .
Now Rolf Halden , associate professor in the School of Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University and assistant director of Environmental Biotechnology at the Biodesign Institute has undertaken a survey of existing scientific literature concerning the hazards of plastics to human health and to the ecosystems we depend on .
His findings , which appear in the latest issue of the Annual Review of Public Health , are sobering .
Today , plastics accumulate in garbage dumps and landfills and are sullying the world 's oceans in ever - greater quantity .
And plastics and their additives are n't just around us , they are inside virtually every one of us -- present in our blood and urine in measureable amounts , ingested with the food we eat , the water we drink and from other sources .
Halden 's study reiterates the fact that the effects to the environment from plastic waste are acute .
Measurements from the most contaminated regions of the world 's oceans show that the mass of plastics exceeds that of plankton sixfold .
Patches of oceanic garbage -- some as large as the state of Texas -- hold a high volume of non-biodegradable plastics .
Aquatic birds and fish are increasingly victims because biodegradation processes are inadequate to eliminate this durable refuse .
The magnitude of society 's burden of plastic waste is only beginning to be fully appreciated .
In the U.S. , the average person produces a half - pound of plastic waste every day .
Around the world , some 300 million tons of the material are produced each year -- a figure poised to expand , as new forms of plastics are devised to serve a voracious global appetite .
As Halden points out , this annual production alone would fill a series of train cars encircling the globe .
" We 're doomed to live with yesterday 's plastic pollution and we are exacerbating the situation with each day of unchanged behavior , " he said .
Adverse effects to human health remain a topic of fierce controversy , though a growing consensus is emerging that plastics and their additives are not always the benign companions we once assumed them to be .
Halden says he accepted the invitation to write about plastics and human health " because the topic showcases the bigger problem of how to create a sustainable future for modern civilization . "
Two broad classes of plastic - related chemicals are of critical concern for human health -- bisphenol - A or BPA , and additives used in the synthesis of plastics , which are known as phthalates .
Halden explains that plastics are polymers -- long chains of molecules usually made of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen and / or silicon , which are chemically linked together or polymerized .
Different polymer chains can be used to create forms of plastics with unique and useful properties .

BPA is a basic building block of polycarbonate plastics , such as those used for bottled water , food packaging and other items .
While it has been considered benign in the form of a heavily cross - linked polymer , its bonds can break down over time , when plastics are repeatedly washed , exposed to heat or other stresses , liberating the building blocks of the chemical , which are toxic .
BPA has been recognized since the 1940s as an endocrine disrupting chemical that interferes with normal hormonal function .
Adding to the health risks associated with BPA is the fact that other ingredients -- such as plasticizers -- are commonly added to plastics .
Many of these potentially toxic components also can leach out over time .
Among the most common is a chemical known as di-ethylhexyl phthalate or DEHP .
In some products , notably medical devices including IV bags or tubing , additives like DEHP can make up 40 or 50 percent of the product .
" If you 're in a hospital , hooked up to an IV drip , " Halden explains , " the chemical that oozes out goes directly into your bloodstream , with no opportunity for detoxification in the gut .
This can lead to unhealthy exposure levels , particularly in susceptible populations such as newborns . "
What are the overall effects of the plastics we unwittingly ingest ?
The literature Halden surveyed is ambiguous on this point , despite more than half a century of study .
Part of the difficulty lies in the absence of good controls for studying health outcomes , as plastic exposure is a global phenomenon , and finding unexposed subjects for comparison is nearly impossible .
It is known however that health effects vary depending on who is exposed -- and when .
Infants and pregnant or nursing mothers are at heightened risk for toxic exposure or passage of BPA and additives like DEHP .
This January , the FDA announced an important reversal of its 2008 claims regarding the safety of bisphenol - A , expressing new concern about " potential effects of BPA on the brain , behavior and prostate gland of fetuses , infants and children , " and pledging to collaborate with other federal health agencies to reevaluate the chemical 's safety .
Studying the effects of low - dose exposure is tricky , usually requiring a very large number of study subjects .
Instead , epidemiologists tracking the problem frequently base their conclusions on data gathered from individuals known to have unusually high levels of a chemical -- often the result of high - level occupational exposure .
Halden insists that further study on low - dose exposure is essential to settle the matter of health risks , noting some evidence in the literature suggests that high - dose studies may be inadequate to properly understand toxic effects from continuous low - level exposures .
advertisement
Halden explains that while plastics have legitimate uses of benefit to society , their brazen misuse has led to a radically unsustainable condition .
" Today , there 's a complete mismatch between the useful lifespan of the products we consume and their persistence in the environment . "
Prominent examples of offending products are the ubiquitous throwaway water bottles , Teflon - coated dental floss and cotton swabs made with plastic PVC sticks .
All are typically used for a matter of seconds or minutes , yet are essentially non-biodegradable and will persist in the environment , sometimes for millennia .
Despite the scourge of discarded plastics and the health risks these substances pose , Halden is optimistic that society can begin to make wiser choices and develop more sustainable products , formed from biodegradable , non -toxic chemical building blocks .
New forms of polymer , some made from renewable materials that are digestible by microorganisms , are being explored .
Ultimately , converting to petroleum - free construction materials for use in smart and sustainable plastics will become a necessity , driven not only by health and environmental concerns but by the world 's steadily declining oil supply .
As Halden emphasizes , the manufacture of plastics currently accounts for about 8 percent of the world 's petroleum use , a sizeable chunk , which ultimately contributes to another global concern -- the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
" We are at a critical juncture , " Halden warns , " and can not continue under the modus that has been established .
If we 're smart , we 'll look for replacement materials , so that we do n't have this mismatch -- good for a minute and contaminating for 10,000 years . "
Nobody can be sure , though .
The science is not far enough along , partly because our regulation of toxins is so limp .
Companies do n’t have to release much of their internal safety data .
And regulators face a terribly high burden of proof .
They can often take action only after they have demonstrated that a substance is harmful — a task that corporate secrecy can make impossible .
“ I can get information on only 20 percent of chemicals we interact with on a daily basis , ” says Alan Goldberg , a toxicologist at Johns Hopkins .
Erik Olson , a food and consumer product expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts , sums up the situation this way : “ We ’re a heck of a lot closer to the Wild West than the nanny state . ”
The story of denture cream and zinc is a good example .
A dentist in the Navy noticed the link between zinc and copper deficiency in the 1950s , according to Dr. Harold Sandstead of the University of Texas in Galveston .
Studies in later years confirmed the relationship .
Early last decade , researchers made the connection from excess zinc to copper deficiency to neurological problems .
“ It ’s nothing new , ” Peter Hedera , a Vanderbilt University neurologist , told me .
“ If you researched the field , you would find out . ”
In 2008 , Dr. Sharon Nations of Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and other researchers published a study in the journal Neurology that took the research one step further .
It specifically tied denture cream to severe neuropathy .
Dr. Hedera followed up that study with another one analyzing 11 patients with high , unexplained zinc levels .
To his surprise , all 11 turned out to be heavy users of denture cream .
Yet even after those studies appeared , GlaxoSmithKline continued to sell Poligrip .
The company simply inserted a small piece of paper into the product ’s box containing some mild statements that barely even seemed to be warnings .
The headline on the insert was , “ For Best Results Start With a Small Amount . ”
Perhaps even more questionable than GlaxoSmithKline ’s response has been that of Procter & Gamble , the giant consumer products company that also makes Crest , Tide , Pampers and Head & Shoulders .
Procter is still selling a denture cream with zinc in it .
Why ?
The cream , Fixodent , has only about half as much zinc as Poligrip did .
Even so , it may be enough to cause problems .
Some of the 11 patients in the Hedera study were Fixodent users .
“ I would withdraw both ” — not just Poligrip but also Fixodent , Dr. Hedera says .
Supernatural or Science ?
If you had visited Coral Castle in the 1940 ’s you would have been greeted enthusiastically by a man weighing a mere 100 pounds and standing just over 5 feet tall .
He would have asked you for ten cents admission and introduced you to his fantasy world .
As you moved around his sculpture garden in stone , and the significance of each piece was explained , you would have been witness to the great pride Ed Leedskalnin took in his work .
Since it is documented that no one ever witnessed Ed ’s labor in building his beloved Coral Castle , some have said he had supernatural powers .
Ed would only say that he knew the secrets used to build the ancient pyramids and if he could learn them , you could too .
Today , you can tour the Coral Castle using our audio stands , with narration available in English , Spanish , French or German .
We also have knowledgeable guides available to conduct tours .
Features of the Coral Castle Museum include a 9 - ton gate that moves with just a touch of the finger , a Polaris telescope and functioning rocking chairs – all made entirely of stone .
We wonder what was the inspiration that could cause a man to spend 28 years to carve a Coral Castle from the ground up using nothing but home made tools .
An homage to unrequited love ?
Perhaps to illustrate ancient sciences that defy gravity ?
Or maybe just sheer , raw human determination ?
The Coral Castle is an everlasting mystery to those who explore it .
Will Conroy Jump Into Bed With AFACT ?
Now that the iiNet vs AFACT court case has ended with a win for common sense , the discussion has moved to what ’s going to happen next .
And the consensus seems to be that one of three things will happen : Either AFACT will appeal , they ’ll start suing individual pirates or they ’ll lobby the government to change the law so that ISPs will be held accountable for their customers actions .
I have a feeling that this is n’t going to end well …
Let ’s take a look at the different options :
AFACT Appeals
Despite the fact that the conclusion seemed like common sense to almost everyone , AFACT still has 21 days to decide whether or not they ’ll appeal the decision .
There ’s the possibility that on appeal the verdict could be overturned , but guessing whether that would happen would be as reliable as guessing what the weather will be like in 12 months time .
AFACT ’s lawyers will be looking long and hard at their chances right about now , and their decision will not be jumped into haphazardly .
AFACT Starts Suing Individuals
This was a favourite tactic for the music industry , but it was also a failure .
Despite some big wins , the people they sued generally had nowhere near the amount of money the companies were asking for in damages .
Not to mention the amount of negative sentiment that comes from suing individuals , especially if they ’re downloading something that is n’t legally available .
If AFACT goes down this road , expect a backlash .
AFACT Sweet - talks Conroy Into Changing The Law
This is the scariest alternative .
Back when the court case first began , Conroy ridiculed the iiNet defence , clearly demonstrating that his personal feelings on the issue were clearly on the side of AFACT .
AFACT believe that they lost the court case on a technicality – a technicality that they ’ve already stated they want the Government to remedy .
Considering Conroy ’s previous statements about the case – and piracy in general – not to mention his misguided plans to filter the Internet , this option seems more and more likely .
It ’s kind of cynical , but really – if the law does n’t work out in your favour , just have the law changed .
It ’s funny that in all of this , nobody from AFACT ’s camp has said anything about improving the legal options for downloading their content in Australia .
Considering the take - down notices customers from other ISPs are seemingly ignorant of geographical limitations placed on legal options , it ’s a sad situation when rather than learning from their loss , AFACT has instead opted to talk about driving blindly forward in a sea of litigation and lawyers .
For a lot more detailed information on the trial , as well as the outcome , both ITnews and ZDNet are leading the coverage .
A novel report explores the possible relationship between fluctuations in the stock market and the incidence of local heart attacks .
The results were presented at the annual scientific meeting of the American College of Cardiology by a team of researchers from Duke University Medical Center .
The initial data analysis showed an increased incidence of heart attacks from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease from January 2008 to July 2009 .
After conducting a comprehensive analysis looking specifically at the relationship with the stock market during that time , there was a trend between increased heart attacks with stock market declines .
However , when results were adjusted to account for a known seasonal increase in heart attacks during winter months , the relationship was less clear .
" In the unadjusted findings we saw a strong trend , " says Christopher O'Connor MD , Director of the Duke Heart Center and senior author of the paper .
" However , previous studies have not done these analyses with a seasonal correction .
Previous research has shown that myocardial infarctions ( MIs ) occur more frequently during winter months than summer months .
When we corrected for seasonality , we learned the time of year could be impacting our results . "
After the U.S. suffered a severe economic crisis in the fall of 2008 , the Duke researchers designed a pilot , single site observational study to explore whether the economic crisis and stock market volatility impacted cardiovascular ( CV ) event rates .
Few studies have explored how economic trends impact cardiovascular events , explains Mona Fiuzat , PharmD , a researcher at Duke and the study 's lead investigator .
During preliminary analysis , when the data were plotted against the daily NASDAQ opening values during the decline period , it revealed an inverse relationship between heart attacks and stock markets .
" You can see the visual pattern , " says Fiuzat .
" During the period that the NASDAQ was declining , the MI rates were increasing . "
However , when more rigorous testing was used to specifically test the correlation with stock market values and eliminate the seasonable variability , the research question could no longer be answered .
" The stock market declined during the winter , and previous studies show more MIs occur during the winter , " says Fiuzat .
" Therefore , we can't say definitively that there is an association .
There is the possibility that there is no relationship . "
Fiuzat and O'Connor say the study had other limitations , including its sample size , its regional bias , and the large variability of MI events within the Duke database .
They plan to conduct a larger study , over a longer period of time , to determine whether a relationship between the stock market and heart attack rates exists .
This right here is called “ Waterfall . ”
It ’s totally beautiful .
Let ’s just get that straight right now .
Next , let ’s talk about what the heck it is .
It ’s a project by designer Barbara Bona that came to her brain while she was studying the space of a window .
Noting that while during the day , a window shows natural daylight , during the night , it ’s totally just a black , blank screen .
So she decided to take advantage of the space and totally light up the night .
She made the totally modern decision and got herself a bunch of LED bulbs .
Then she picked up a handful of fabric .
Bona then took the initiative and integrated the bulbs right into a curtain rod , noting that of all the things in the home arena , the curtain rod must certainly be one of the least innovated upon .
The LEDs show true , “ powerfully and directionally ” illuminating the area without excessive heat .
She then added the slightly veiling , slightly reflective fabric to accentuate the situation .
Added the name Waterfall .
And that was that !

We have something to fear from fear - mongering itself
I do n't want to exaggerate the importance of the death threats being made against congressmen who voted for health - care reform .
Nuts are nuts .
But there is a danger to the sort of rhetoric the GOP has used over the past few months .
When Rep. Devin Nunes begs his colleagues to say " no to socialism , no to totalitarianism and no to this bill " ; when Glenn Beck says the bill " is the end of America as you know it " ; when Sarah Palin says the bill has " death panels " -- that stuff matters .
I remember listening to the debate the night the House passed the Senate bill and the reconciliation fixes .
There are a lot of critiques I could imagine folks on the right making of the legislation .
" Regulations to define a minimum insurance benefit will impede innovation in low - deductible plans . "
" Congress does n't have the will to stick to the cost savings , and until they prove able to do so , we can't pass a new health - care entitlement . "
" The health - care system is broken , and adding a new benefit does n't make sense outside the context of radical reform , as it will just create a new set of stakeholders who will resist the necessary changes . "
But totalitarianism ?
Death panels ?
The end of America as we know it ?
These critiques are n't just wrong in their description of a cautious , compromised reform that uses private insurers and spends only 4 percent of what we spend on health care in an average year .
They 're shocking in terms of what the speakers believe their colleagues and representatives are willing to do to the American people .
Nunes , for instance , has served with Democrats for decades .
He might believe them too willing to tax society 's most - productive members to fund social benefits .
But does he really believe them friends of totalitarianism ?
And the stuff on talk radio , of course , was worse .
So take the universe of people who really respect right - wing politicians and listen to right - wing media .
Most of them will hear this stuff and turn against the bill .
Some will hear this stuff and really be afraid of the bill .
And then a small group will hear this stuff and believe it and wonder whether they need to do something more significant to stop this bill from becoming law .
And then a couple will actually follow through .
And one will cut the gas lines leading to house of Rep.
Tom Perriello 's brother after seeing a tea partyer post the address online .
Few of us are on a mountain with this stuff , of course .
Many condemned me for saying that Joe Lieberman was willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands to settle an old grudge with liberals when he threatened to blow up the bill if the Medicare buy - in was n't removed .
I 'll stand by the math of the comment , and the analysis of Lieberman 's motivations , but I certainly wish I had phrased it somewhat more delicately .
The word " cause " was ill - advised .
Still , that was n't the tone of this blog over the past couple of months , nor of most outlets .
Some politicians and media figures , however , have been in the business of ratcheting up opposition by making people afraid .
But you can't count on people to simply cower when they 're afraid , or write letters to the editor .
Sometimes , they fight .
It 's a dangerous emotion , and high as the stakes are , public figures need to be a lot more careful manipulating it .

People suffer and die because the government " protects " us .
It should protect us less and respect our liberty more .
The most basic questions are : Who owns you , and who should control what you put into your body ?
In what sense are you free if you can't decide what medicines you will take ?
This will be the subject of my Fox Business program tonight .
We 'll hear from people like Bruce Tower .
Tower has prostate cancer .
He wanted to take a drug that showed promise against his cancer , but the Food and Drug Administration would not allow it .
One bureaucrat told him the government was protecting him from dangerous side effects .
Tower 's outraged response was : " Side effects — who cares ?
Every treatment I 've had I 've suffered from side effects .
If I 'm terminal , it should be my option to endure any side effects . "
Of course it should be his option .
Why , in our " free " country , do Americans meekly stand aside and let the state limit our choices , even when we are dying ?
Dr. Alan Chow invented a retinal implant that helps some blind people see ( optobionics.com ) .
Demonstrating that took seven years and cost $ 50 million dollars of FDA - approved tests .
But now the FDA wants still more tests .
That third stage will take another three years and cost $ 100 million .
But Chow does n't have $ 100 million .
He can't raise the money from investors because the implant only helps some blind people .
Potential investors fear there are too few customers to justify their $ 100 million risk .
So Stephen Lonegan , who has a degenerative eye disease that might be helped by the implant , can't have it .
Instead , he will go blind .
The bureaucrats say their restrictions are for his own safety .
" There 's nothing safe about going blind , " he says .
" I do n't want to be made safe by the FDA .
I want it to be up to me to go to Dr. Chow to make the decision myself . "
But it 's not up to Lonegan and his doctor .
It 's up to the autocrats of the Nanny State .
Tonight , I will show my confrontation with Terry Toigo of the FDA about that .
She calmly and quietly explained that such restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of the government 's safety review process until I shouted : " Why are you even involved ?
Let people try things ! "
She replied , " We do n't think that 's the best system for patients , to enable people to just take whatever they want with little information available about a drug . "
So people suffer and die when they might have lived longer , more comfortable lives .
The FDA 's intrusion on our freedom is supplemented by another agent of the Nanny State .
The Drug Enforcement Agency's war on drug dealers has led them to watch pain - management doctors like hawks .
Drugs like Vicodin and OxyContin provide wonderful pain relief .
But because they are also taken by " recreational " drug users , doctors go to jail for prescribing quantities that the DEA considers " inappropriate . "
As a result , pain specialists are scared into underprescribing painkillers .
Sick people suffer horrible pain needlessly .
Think I exaggerate ?
Check out the website of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons ( AAPS ) .
It warns doctors not to go into pain management .
" Drug agents now set medical standards . …
There could be years of harassment and legal fees , " says the AAPS .
Today , even nursing - home patients , hardly candidates for drug gangs , do n't get pain relief they need .
The DEA told us that good doctors have nothing to worry about .
But Siobhan Reynolds , who started the Pain Relief Network ( painreliefnetwork.org ) after her late husband was unable to get sufficient pain medicine , says the DEA 's cherry - picked medical experts persuade juries that they should jail any doctor who administers higher doses of pain relief than the DEA 's zealots think appropriate .
News of those jail terms spreads .
Doctors learn to be stingy with pain meds .
All drugs involve risk .
In a free country , it should be up to individuals , once we 're adults , to make our own choices about those risks .
Patrick
Henry did n't say , " Give me absolute safety , or give me death . "
He said " liberty . "
That is what America is supposed to be about .

or “ Refactoring a tiny web app in 2 hours ”
Last fall I wrote a little web app ( less than 500 lines ) that ran on the wsgi_ref server that comes with Python .
Yes , I know wsgi_ref is n’t exactly intended for production apps , but I had my reasons .
First of all , it was a very bare - bones report extractor / generator aimed at fewer than half a dozen users and I did n’t want to mess with any third party libraries , installation , configuration , etc .
Also , after using wsgi_ref in some examples in The Quick Python Book , I was curious as to how useful it might be in a real situation .
It worked okay , and the people concerned were quite happy with their new web - based report extraction system .
Of course , as often happens , the more I thought about it ( and maintained the code ) , the less happy I was .
For one thing , the code was a little ugly … well , as I think about it , given it ’s small size , it was a LOT ugly .
URL ’s had be mapped to code explicitly , and the the whole thing was no where near as modular nor as readable as it should have been .
So as I thought about refactoring the app , I decided to see how much work it would be to swap wsgi_ref for CherryPy .
I ’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for CherryPy – I used it for my very first web app some 7 or 8 years ago , and at PyCon 2009 my sprint time was spent on the very early stages of converting it to Python 3.x .
And as it happened my thoughts of refactoring pretty much coincided with Bob Brewer ’s talk about “ The Zen of CherryPy ” at PyCon 2010 .
I recommend watching the video of his talk when you have the chance , but I ’ll give you the first two points – “ Common tasks should be fast and easy ” and “ Doing nothing should be faster and easier ” .
That matched my app perfectly , since , as Yogi might have said , 90 % of my app was doing common tasks , and the other 90 % was doing nothing .
So I was looking for three things : first , how easy is it to port an app from the wsgi_ref server to a server like Cherry Py ?
and second , would it help me improve my code ?
and finally , does CherryPy follow the “ Zen ” as Bob presented it ?
Or to put all three in another way , is it worth the effort to use a server package like Cherry Py for such a tiny web app ?
Shortly after lunch on Friday ( March 19 ) I grabbed CherryPy and installed it on our vTiger server .
Following the tutorial , I shortly had a little demo app working .
The next step was to move my main web code into a class .
After that , each one of the if statements explicitly mapping a URL was recast as an appropriately named method .
Fortunately , I was smart enough to put the code that actually queries the database and massages the data into the desired report into a separate module , so it remained untouched .
After adjusting some parameters and making sure things were correctly exposed , the main report URL ’s were working fine .
I had one entry form , and its HTML template needed a few tweaks .
Reading the values from the form post ( a common task ) was dead easy – they just became parameters to the form action method .
I also needed to change the response headers in one method to send a PDF instead of HTML , and that was a simple dictionary access of cherrypy .
response .
Again , a common task , easily done .
Finally , I needed to adjust the port number and make a couple of other minor changes to the configuration – a quick call to cherrypy.config.update took care of that .
As to things like sessions , authentication , compression , etc , I did n’t want them , so I did n’t do anything .
Doing nothing to do nothing works for me .
As to the answers to my questions , let me put it this way – my code is now much more modular and readable , and I got the whole refactoring done in time to make a three o’clock appointment .
CherryPy .
Definitely worth it .

California officials Thursday abruptly halted a controversial effort to slash the carbon footprint of automobile air conditioning .
“ Cool car ” rules would have required a clear reflective glaze on vehicle windows as a way to block excessive sunlight and heat .
They were adopted in June by the state ’s Air Resources Board and were in the process of being finalized .
Air conditioning lowers vehicle efficiency , increasing emissions from gasoline that contribute to global warming .
But law enforcement officials had expressed concerns that the coating , a spray of microscopic metal particles which block infrared rays , would interfere with the electronic monitoring of ankle bracelets on paroled felons .
Wireless phone companies said the new standard could degrade cellphone signals including 911 calls .
And toll road operators said the glaze could make it difficult to use the " EZ Pass " systems enabling traffic to move quickly through toll booths .
" Stakeholders raised several new issues involving performance of electronic devices as they may affect public safety , " James N. Goldstene , the board ’s executive officer , announced .
" After listening to this input and accounting for the legal deadline to finalize the rule , today we are announcing that the AB 32 ’ cool cars ’ rule - making will cease . "
AB 32 , California ’s sweeping 2006 climate law , requires the state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 15 % over the next decade .
The cool cars rule , to be phased in between 2012 and 2016 , was designed to block of 60 % of the sun 's energy entering the interior of a car .
Once finalized , the rule would have slashed 700,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 , the equivalent of taking 140,000 cars off the road .
Scientists say that carbon dioxide emissions are trapping heat in earth 's atmosphere , which will lead to dangerous climate change .
Spokesman Stanley
Young said the board would now pursue “ a performance - based approach , ” meaning that auto manufacturers would have to meet a standard for a specific drop in the interior temperature of vehicles , “ but they are free to draw on any technology to achieve it .
This could be through advanced windows that keep the sun ’s heat out , but also heat - reflecting paints , different upholstery , or even fans that circulate air and keep the car cool while it is standing in the sun . ”

Does a Facebook - specific antivirus application sound like a good idea ?
Maybe not .
One of our analysts saw this particular application claiming to be an antivirus wreak havoc on his Friends list .
Of course , there is no such thing .
Once installed on one Friend 's account , this application tags 20 Friend into a picture such as the one below :
If a Friend looking through the photos then clicks on the app's ( apparently randomly generated ) link , they 'll see this :
If you have a lot of friends , you might end up with a series of albums like this :
You can find more information about this , including instructions on how to remove the tags on the photos , at FacebookInsider .
Updated to add : Examples include Antivirus in Focebook and F'acebook antivirus .
Notice the misspelling of Facebook in both names .

Scribbling about TV shows is n't an abysmal task by any standards , but it does have its downsides , namely those weeks where the programme you 're reviewing is so profoundly dispiriting it leaves you praying for climate change to hurry up and frazzle us all .
This is one of those weeks .
The Guide insisted I watch Jersey Shore ( Sun , 9 pm , MTV ) .
Swear to God , they 're trying to drive me to suicide .
On the face of it , Jersey Shore is a reality show in which some tanned , whooping idiots live in a beach house for a month : a splice of Big Brother and Ibiza Uncovered featuring a uniformly unlikable bunch of infuriating , loud , over - confident pillocks .
So far , so standard .
What 's eye - opening is that the entire cast appears to be drawn from one minority group – namely Italian - Americans .
I did n't know much about Italian - Americans before watching Jersey Shore .
Now I feel as if I was born hating them ; as if despising Italian - Americans is my moral duty .
It 's not my fault , really it 's not .
Blame the producers , who seem to have constructed Jersey Shore by following a step - by - step guide to besmirching an entire ethnic group .
Step one : identify the stereotype ( in this case , the notion that working - class Italian - Americans are shallow sex- crazed thugs ) .
Step two : collect the clearest embodiments of said stereotype you can find ( consequently all the men in Jersey Shore are dopey , muscled , hollering titty - chasers : the girls are bolshy , spray - tanned , micro- skirted man-eaters ) .
Step three : let them refer to themselves by using a slang term broadly perceived as an ethnic slur ( in this case , the word " guido " , a pejorative nickname which roughly means " dim macho Italian - American lunk " ) .
Step four : group them together in a house decorated with Italian flags and Scarface posters .
Step five : give them booze , film them behaving like shallow sex - crazed thugs , calling each other " guido " , etc .
Step six : there is no step six .
Job 's done .
Go home and count the proceeds .
Unsurprisingly , Jersey Shore caused a bit of a stink when it was screened in the US .
Various advertisers , including Domino's Pizza and Dell Computers , pulled their commercials following the debut episode .
New York Post TV critic Linda Stasi ( herself an Italian - American ) accused the show of " furthering the popular TV notion that Italian - Americans are gel - haired , thuggish ignoramuses with fake tans , no manners , no diction , no taste , no education , no sexual discretion , no hairdressers ( for sure ) , no real knowledge of Italian culture and no ambition beyond expanding steroid - and silicone - enhanced bodies into sizes best suited for floating over Macy's on Thanksgiving . "
In summary : Jersey Shore is n't very nice .
A farmyard animal could produce this show , and probably did .
In fact , the sole skill the makers have demonstrated is the small degree of cunning involved in selecting Italian - Americans in the first place .
Run the step - by - step guide again with a different ethinc group and it's altogether more incendiary .
But perhaps the whole ethnic slant , explosive though it is , is a red herring .
The group Jersey Shore is truly adept at demonising – like countless dumb " party time " docusoaps before it – is the young .
Some of the young audience will tune in ; the vast majority will ignore it .
On TV , you currently have more chance of spotting a pair of morbidly obese conjoined twins on a log flume than of seeing one articulate , intelligent teenager exploring any subject other than sex or tattoos in any depth whatsoever .
Little wonder they 're abandoning ship .
The bhut jalokia , or ghost chili , has a Scoville heat measurement of 1 million units — compare to jalapenos , which top out around 8000 units .
Prior to 2003 , it was just a myth , lacking even photographic evidence .
Now , it's in the Guinness Book and will soon be the key ingredient in tear - gas hand grenades used by the Indian military .
Apparently , it also has an appealing citrus flavor , followed by a horrible burning sensation .
For a quick look at what jolokia hath wrought , fast forward to about six minutes into this video .
There 's much less running about screaming than I would have guessed , but the man ends up looking very physically ill — pale , sweaty and generally like he just came down with a bad case of flu .

Earlier this week we announced a reorganization of Creative Commons open education projects .
The objective of this reorganization is to maximize CC ’s impact by focusing our activities in support of the Open Educational Resources ( OER ) movement where we have unique leverage and expertise — developing and explaining the legal and technical infrastructure required to make “ open ” work .
Today ’s post lays out the details of our structure going forward and highlights some of our open education projects and goals for 2010 .
Apologies for the length of this post ( and that of the previous announcement ) , but there ’s much to cover .
If you just want to hear about new developments as they happen please bookmark or subscribe to the Open Educational Resources tag on this blog or follow us on Facebook , Identi.ca , or Twitter .
Brand and Websites
The ccLearn ( sometimes written CC Learn ) brand and website are going away .
Over the past year we ’ve realized two things that fed into this decision .
First , the Creative Commons brand is very strong and we need to leverage it wherever we can , including in education and science .
While the ccLearn brand has gained recognition among those in the open education community we ’ve directly engaged with , we want our impact and visibility to scale far beyond those we talk to directly .
Second , separate branding led to a separate website for our open education activities , which essentially meant nobody saw them — last quarter alone the main CC site had 400x more visitors than the ccLearn site .
It will take some time to migrate and rebrand all relevant content , but the net effect is that going forward you can expect to see much more OER - related content and news on the CC home page , main site , and wiki .
This is a big win for the open education movement — many more people will learn about OER , and for CC as well — OER may be the single most compelling use of our tools , and one that any member of the public can understand right away .
Free access to materials for learning , worldwide — of course !
Resources and Funding
Creative Commons is increasing , not decreasing , its resource commitment to open education projects .
The reorganization results in the departure of one staff , but the addition of direct open education project responsibility to several of our most senior staff , including our CEO , Creative Director , CTO , GC , and VP .
It ’s fair to ask what these people will not be doing now that they have significant new responsibilities .
In brief , we get some efficiency gains through less internal communications overhead due to the reorganization and some replication of efforts that both core and ccLearn have pursued in the past .
Additionally , we ’re doing less pure outreach and outreach - related travel .
This is worth an entire post in itself , but the short version is that direct outreach by CC staff now constitutes drops in the ocean of the burgeoning commons movement , so we ’re focusing on relationships where an official CC representative is required and implementation could have a major impact .
We plan to leverage education experts in our worldwide affiliate network — who are better positioned and more knowledgeable than staff at times — to do more of the direct outreach on behalf of CC .
And finally , we ’ll be making some support hires to free up more senior staff time for education project management and strategy .
We also think that making OER part of CC ’s core messaging and focusing more of our project energy on supporting OER makes CC more attractive to donors — see brand above .
Team
Following are staff with direct open education responsibilities .
All are listed on our organization chart ( pdf ) , which you can always find linked from our people page .
Note that all are completely integrated into the organization and that several others have ( and always had ) supporting roles for OER through as a matter of course in their work running CC ’s operations , supporting affiliates , developing software , etc .
Joi Ito , CEO .
Joi sets the overall direction of the organization , including our OER strategy .
He will be greatly increasing the visibility of CC ’s open education projects this year with the public and funders , including via keynoting conferences , writing , and personal appearances .
He also has responsibility for leveraging the extensive education expertise of our board of directors and bringing external expertise to a new CC advisory board comprised in part of education experts .
Joi will also play a key role in helping CC and OER grow in regions such as the Middle East and Africa — for those in the San Francisco , please come to our salon on February 16 to hear Joi speak on this topic .

Projects
Following is a sampling of open education projects CC is working on this year .
Legal
Licensing and copyright for OER , including its relationship to minors .
Especially as OER becomes more prevalent in K - 12 , consideration must be given to the licensing of works created by minors .
Our goal is to provide materials which allow parents , teachers , and learners to use and contribute to OER with confidence by following common - sense best practices , keeping parents and teachers involved .
Explanations of all elements of our core legal tools for an education audience .
A Continuing Legal Education course module for lawyers on copyright and open licensing that addresses education - specific issues .
Development of education use cases to inform the future development of our licenses and public domain tools .
Further exploration of copyright exceptions & limitations ( including fair use ) and OER production .
Technology
R&D on metadata , discoverability , provenance for OER — a mouthful , but some of the key challenges opportunities for increased OER adoption and impact .
opportunities for increased OER adoption and impact .
Publications on known best practices for OER metadata .
Continued development and support of DiscoverEd , pushing ahead the state of the art for OER search .
Consulting on implementations of CC tools on key OER platforms .
Convening further in - person and online summits and code sprints concerning OER , discoverability and CC tools .
Social , Media , Policy
A new introductory video focusing on CC and OER .
A new and continuously updated slide deck for anyone to use and modify for presentation on CC and OER .
Further interviews and case studies highlighting the best and brightest implementations and implementers of CC for OER .
Analysis of lessons learned from Open Access policy and possible translation to OER policy .
Metrics regarding CC and OER adoption .
Further analysis of the reasons for heterogeneous copyright policies in online education and a new push for CC adoption and interoperability .
Materials for teaching about CC in curricula where open licensing and remix are instructive , e.g. , journalism and arts education .
As with staffing resources above , it ’s fair to ask what projects we wo n’t be doing , given that we ’ve said we ’re focusing our support for open education on projects in which our core legal and technical expertise come to bear .
Here are some examples of areas related to open education that we ’ve considered or been lobbied to consider involvement in that are outside of our core expertise and therefore out of scope : advising on health privacy and education ; translation , formats , and content management systems beyond their support for open licensing and discoverability ; direct advocacy and political movement building ; advising on pedagogy .
This is not a complete list by any means — there is much demand for expertise within the burgeoning open education movement .
We believe that by focusing on legal and technology projects and explanations that further adoption of CC and OER we will make great progress on the in - scope projects above and more in 2010 , setting up 2011 to be a breakthrough year for the open education movement .
Onward !
By now you may have seen the update on our new PlayStation 3 motion controller , via our live video stream at GDC .
In case you missed it , let me introduce you to ‘ PlayStation Move ’ .
We first showed the ‘ Move ’ controller prototype at E3 in 2009 and we ’re now ready with the final design , along with an early look at just a few of the upcoming games …
Take a look at our trailer below , which aims to explain PlayStation Move in more detail :
[ viddler id=15e79e42&w=545&h=349&playertype=simple ]
Our launch games are designed to appeal to all PlayStation 3 fans .
We ’ve got our own take on social games such as ‘ Sports Champions ’ and ‘ Move Party ’ ( both working titles ) as well as keeping our more serious gamers in mind with DUKES and EA ’s Tiger Woods 2010 .
Many of our existing franchises such as SOCOM will also be enhanced with PlayStation Move functionality – because of Move ’s low performance impact on the PS3 system we ’re able to add this to our existing games without compromising graphical quality or gameplay .
The PlayStation Move experience will offer our players a fun , high definition and immersive gaming experience .
As you know , we ’ve got a lot of experience working with motion and camera - based control systems , having created the original EyeToy for PlayStation 2 back in 2003 .
This experience has really helped make sure our new control system is incredibly accurate and responsive .
PlayStation development teams are working hard to create a strong and exciting line - up of games – you ’ll be hearing more about new titles in the coming months but for now , here is a list of the games we ’ve announced so far :
Dukes —
Brawl your way to the top in this brutal bare - knuckle boxing game .
Move Party — Chaotic multiplayer where you never know what will happen next !
Sports Champions —
The greatest athletes in the world are ready , are you ?
TV Superstars —
Be a contestant in five TV game shows to prove that you are the biggest star .
Slider — Kung - fu action – on an office chair !?!
The Shoot —
Take out the bad guys but make sure the movie director likes your style !
More news both from first and third party publishers to follow in the near future …
You will be able to get involved with PlayStation Move in several ways :
Camera + controller ( including a “ starter disc ” with a range of demos for games releasing later in the year )
A single controller for people who already have a PlayStation Eye camera
A full console pack which includes PS3 , dualshock3 , Move controller + camera
Finally some of our biggest games will be available with a Move controller included
We ’ve also announced the Subcontroller this week , an additional peripheral for use with more hardcore titles like SOCOM , which benefit from analogue stick input .
Move is one of our big priorities for PlayStation 3 in Europe this year so look out for our ads and product updates .
I look forward to hearing your feedback and responses to the announcement of PlayStation Move in America this week .
Watch out for interviews with Move developers from GDC here on PlayStation .

Just in case anyone needed confirmation that the DOL data is just a little , how should we say it , cooked , here comes Gallup with their March 15 undermployment number , which just hit a 2010 , and series , high of 20 % .
This is obviously worse compared to both the beginning of the year ( 19.5 % ) and February ( 19.8 % ) .
Unlike the Dept of Labor 's arcane voodoo which lately is based more on executive confidential memos and snowfall observations , Gallup 's underemployment measure is based on more than 20,000 phone interviews collected over a 30 - day period and reported daily .
Furthermore " Gallup 's results are not seasonally adjusted and tend to be a precursor of government reports by approximately two weeks . "
We wonder if the abnormally hot March weather will used as an excuse for a deterioraiton in the most recent NFP numbers .
A summary of underemployment trends as per Gallup :
A profiling of the two components of the Underemployment index indicate that while Gallup 's unemployment rate declined marginally from February and was at 10.3 % , the percentage of those emplpoyed part time and seeking full time work surged to 9.7 % .
Here is how Gallup interprets this data :
Focus on Underemployment , Not Unemployment
Even with historic healthcare legislation under consideration , Congress passed and the president signed a new jobs creation bill on March 18 .
No doubt , national attention will shortly shift to unemployment and anticipation of the government 's April 2 report of the March unemployment rate .
In this regard , Gallup 's mid-March unemployment rate is likely indicative of the not - seasonally adjusted unemployment rate the government will release in April , as is Gallup 's broader underemployment rate .
The danger associated with focusing on unemployment is reflected by the recent statement of Morgan Stanley economists suggesting that the U.S. may add as many as 300,000 jobs in March owing to an improvement in the weather , economic growth , and the government 's hiring of temporary census workers .
If anything close to this number of new jobs is announced by the government in early April , there is likely to be an enthusiastic , possibly even celebratory , response .
Government officials are liable to tout the continued benefits of last year 's stimulus and the future benefits of the new jobs bill .
Many Wall Streeters will likely argue that the surge in jobs is simply another confirmation of the strength of the overall economic recovery .
However , before policymakers celebrate too much , they should note Gallup 's recent findings involving its new , more inclusive measure of underemployment .
To be sure , there are some benefits associated with the unemployed getting part - time jobs , no matter the source .
For example , Gallup 's self - reported spending data show that part - time workers who want full - time work spent on average 24 % more per day ( $ 51 ) during the past 30 days than did the unemployed ( $ 41 ) .
While this represents an improvement and is good for the economy , it is not nearly as good as the 85 % higher daily spending of those having full - time jobs ( $ 76 ) .
It is also often suggested that a growth in part - time jobs may indicate future growth in full - time work -- that companies hire part - time workers before committing to hiring new full - time employees .
While this is sometimes the case , it may not be so at this point in the U.S. economy : Gallup data show that one in three part - time employees who are wanting full - time work are currently " hopeful " about finding a full - time job in the next 30 days -- not much of an endorsement of the idea that today 's new part - time work will progress to full - time jobs .
Regardless of how one interprets the shifts taking place between part - time and full - time jobs , it is important that policymakers focus on the broader goal of reducing underemployment , not just unemployment .
Part - time , temporary jobs like those associated with census - taking are far better than no job and may reduce the unemployment rate , but they do not represent the kind of job creation needed for a sustainable economic recovery .
We can't wait to see how much extra liquidity the Fed will be required to pump into the market to compensate for a possible microdip in markets should this bad data get the 15 seconds of fame it so wrongfully deserves .

I ’m reading the documentation for Windows Phone development .
Here ’s what it says :
A set of tools will help the developer to submit and certify their applications for the Windows Phone Marketplace .
Applications are submitted in a .XAP file format , which is essentially one compressed file that contains all the files that are needed by the application .
Developers can track their submission status and then receive a notification once the certification is complete .
After an application is certified , it can then be submitted for publishing on the Windows Phone Marketplace .
Developers can set pricing and select the markets in which they wish to publish the application .
Application updates can go through the certification and publishing process again in order to fix bugs , add new functionality , or provide whole new versions .
Windows Phone Marketplace and Billing
The Windows Phone Marketplace provides the one place where developers can make their applications available for purchase by consumers .
Both Mobile Operator and credit card billing are supported , making it as easy as possible for consumers to pay for the program .

Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has admitted a " poor choice of words " when it comes to gays and lesbians .
Mr Abbott has come under fire recently for comments regarding homosexuality , saying he felt " threatened " by homosexuals and that homosexuality " challenges orthodox notions of the right order of things " .
In the pink ... Tony Abbott helped promote The McGrath Foundation Ironman event , in Manly yesterday .
But speaking today on Joy 94.9 , a Melbourne gay and lesbian radio station , Mr Abbott seemed to soften his stance , admitting that his comments were a " poor choice of words " .
While he reiterated Coalition policy that marriage should remain between a man and a woman , he declared the Liberal Party 's support for a federal anti-discrimination law that would include protection for gays and lesbians .
Scientists have grown real , living human bones in the lab for the first time , completely from scratch , and ready to be inserted inside human flesh .
Or given to my dog , as a delicious treat .

Dr. Gordana Vunjak - Novakovic — Columbia University professor of biomedical engineering — achieved the feat for the first time using stem cells and molds generated from three - dimensional scans .
They are still testing them with animals , but theoretically this means that doctors would be able to replace any bone — no matter how small and intricate — within a decade .
The implications are huge , especially as the population keeps getting older across the globe .
Built - to - order bones are organisms will extend human lives even further and , more importantly , reduce diseases dramatically .
[ New York Times ]
Noted security researcher Ross Anderson and colleagues have published a paper showing how " Chip - and - PIN " ( the European system for verifying credit - and debit - card transactions ) has been thoroughly broken and cannot be considered secure any longer .
I remember hearing rumbles that this attack was possible even as Chip - and - PIN was being rolled out across Europe , but that did n't stop the banks from pushing ahead with it , spending a fortune in the process .
The flaw is that when you put a card into a terminal , a negotiation takes place about how the cardholder should be authenticated : using a PIN , using a signature or not at all .
This particular subprotocol is not authenticated , so you can trick the card into thinking it 's doing a chip - and - signature transaction while the terminal thinks it 's chip - and - PIN .
The upshot is that you can buy stuff using a stolen card and a PIN of 0000 ( or anything you want ) .
We did so , on camera , using various journalists ' cards .
The transactions went through fine and the receipts say " Verified by PIN " .
It 's no surprise to us or bankers that this attack works offline ( when the merchant cannot contact the bank ) — in fact Steven blogged about it here last August .
But the real shocker is that it works online too : even when the bank authorisation system has all the transaction data sent back to it for verification .
The reason why it works can be quite subtle and convoluted : bank authorisation systems are complex beasts , including cryptographic checks , account checks , database checks , and interfaces with fraud detection systems which might apply a points - scoring system to the output of all the above .
In theory all the data you need to spot the wedge attack will be present , but in practice ?
And most of all , how can you spot it if you 're not even looking ?
The banks did n't even realise they needed to check .
Ancient ' X - Woman ' discovered as man 's early ancestors are pictured together for the first time
A mysterious species of ancient human has been discovered in a cave in southern Siberia .
Nicknamed X - Woman , scientists say the human lived alongside our ancestors tens of thousands of years ago .
The discovery , which could rewrite mankind 's family tree , was made after analysis of DNA from a fossilised finger bone .
Back in the beginning : Living 6.8 million years ago this is Sahelanthropus tchadensis .
Parts of its jaw bone and teeth were found nine years ago in the Djurab desert , Chad , and from this scientists created this model head
This young woman lived between 100,000 and 90,000 years ago .
Her skull and mandible were found in a cave in Israel in 1969 along with the remains of 20 others .
The size of their skulls was higher than that of the average person today
Experts believe the finger belonged to a child who died 48,000 to 30,000 years ago .
It was thought only two species of early humans lived at that time - the ancestors of modern man and the Neanderthals , who died out soon afterwards .
But the DNA evidence published in the journal Nature reveals a third species .
The latest study was based on an analysis of ' mitochondrial ' DNA - a genetic code passed from mothers to children .
Researcher Dr Svante Pääbo said the code was different from that of Neanderthals and modern humans and was ' a new creature that 's not been on our radar screens so far ' .
The scientists are unable to say what X - Woman looked like and are even unsure if the finger belonged to a male of female , but Dr Pääbo said they named her X - Woman ' because its mitochondrial and we want to take a feminist tack on this ' .
The discovery of the ' X - Woman ' comes as scientists revealed images of what man looked like millions of years ago .
Gathering bone fragments from across the globe , paleoanthropologists used sophisticated research methods to form the 27 model heads , which are on show at the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt , Germany .
The exhibition goes back seven million years to sahelanthropus tchadensis and traces the numerous stages of man culminating with modern - day homo sapiens .
Each of the heads is used to tell its story : where they lived ; what they ate ; and what killed them .
It shows how researchers today use satellite image analysis and computer tomography .
There is little doubt that Africa is the cradle of humanity and this is where the most ancient of the remains were unearthed .
But clues to other pre-human species have been found in the Middle East and Far East .
Only a few thousand fossils of pre-human species have ever been discovered and entire sub -species are sometimes known only from a single jaw or fragmentary skull .
This skull was fashioned from a skull and jaw found in the remains of 17 pre-humans ( nine adults , three youths and five children ) which were discovered in the Afar Region of Ethiopia in 1975 .
They are believed to have lived 3.2 million years ago Meet ' Mrs Ples ' who was unearthed in Sterkfontein , South Africa in 1947 .
Her whole skull was found and it is believed she lived 2.5 million years ago .
Sediment traces found on the inside of her skull indicate to scientists that she died by falling into a chalk pit
The skull of this male adult was found on the western shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1985 .
He is believed to have lived in 2.5 million years ago .
The shape of the mouth indicates that he had a strong bite and that he could chew sinewy plants
This species of sub - human - Homo rudolfensis - was found in Koobi Fora , Kenya , in 1972 .
The adult male is believed to have lived about 1.8 million years ago .
He used stone axes ate meat and plants and lived on the wooded edge of Lake Turkana in Eastern Africa
Researchers shaped this skull on the basis of this discovery of ' Zinj ' in 1959 .
The adult male lived 1.8 million years ago in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanzania .
He would have fed himself on seeds , plants and roots which he dug out with bones
The near - complete skeleton of ' Turkana Boy ' , a male adolescent aged about 13 , was found in Nariokotome , Kenya , in 1984 .
He lived 1.6 million years ago .
His teeth and skull bear a close resemblance to discoveries in Asia of homo erectus
Experts are often forced to resort to educated guesswork to fill in the gaps in research to come up with images of human ancestors .
Each new discovery means paleoanthropologists have to rethink the origins of man 's ancestors .
The previously held concept of primitive man - characterised by a large brain and the ability to manufacture tools - has had to be changed by researchers .
European natives of primitive man , homo heidelbergensis , are believed to have been able to make perfect javelins from wood 400,000 years ago and are also thought to have had the ability to plan for the future .
Neanderthals are also now thought to have had far more culture and craft skills than earlier research indicated .
Discovered in Java , Indonesea , this skull belonging to ' Sangiran 17 ' is believed to have belonged to an adult male who probably lived around 800,000 years ago .
He was found by an Indonesian farmer hacking away in a field .
Sangiran is believed to have used fire
The discovery of this adult male in Sima de los Huesos , Spain , in 1993 points to an early stage in the evolution of neanderthal man due to the shape of his face .
' Miquelon ' was around 1.75 m tall and lived about 500,000 to 350,000 years ago .
His remains were found with that of 31 others which led researchers to believe this was a burial site

REVOLUTIONS have unpredictable outcomes .
Who is going to end up in power is rarely obvious at the start .
That is as true in biology as it is in politics .
Like political revolutions , though , biological ones often follow a predictable course .
The old order is destroyed .
There is a period of confusion .
Then a new ecosystem emerges that looks surprisingly like the old one , but with different actors .
This cycle has happened five times in the history of modern life .
The most famous occasion was 65 m years ago , when the dinosaurs were wiped out and the mammals emerged victorious from the wreckage .
A bigger mass extinction , at the end of the Permian period 251 m years ago , killed 70 % of the world 's land vertebrates ( and 96 % of all marine animals ) and paved the way for the age of reptiles .
Exactly which sort of reptile would come out on top , however , was not something that was decided until later — 201.4 m years ago , to be precise .
This was towards the end of the Triassic period .
Then , the ranks of aetosaurs , phytosaurs , shuvosaurs and many other uncrocodile - like relatives of the crocodiles were suddenly thinned , and a previously obscure group came to the fore .
The result , once natural selection had done its work over the course of millions of years , was the now familiar cast of Allosaurus , Diplodocus , Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex .
Another one bites the dust
The dinosaurs were done for , as everybody knows , by a collision with an asteroid .
The Permian was curtailed by massive volcanism .
But what exactly happened towards the end of the Triassic has been much debated .
A study just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , by Jessica Whiteside of Brown University in Rhode Island and her colleagues , pretty well nails it down .
It was the geological chaos that created the North Atlantic Ocean .
Dr Whiteside used fossil evidence sandwiched between layers of lava from some of the earliest eruptions that accompanied the rift .
Specifically , she located two sites in what is now eastern North America where a series of giant lakes had formed on the layers of cooled lava and plant matter had accumulated at the bottom of the lakes .
Using detailed chemical analysis of waxy molecules extracted from the fossil plants , she examined the carbon isotopes they contained .
Non-radioactive carbon comes in two forms : 12C and the heavier ( and much rarer form ) 13C .
The ratio varies in the atmosphere , depending on where carbon - rich gases , mainly carbon dioxide and methane , are coming from .
Dr Whiteside found the ratio yawed around like a drunken sailor as the continents split apart and the lava started pouring out .
First , the level of 13C plummeted .
Then it shot up again , a long way over the recent historical average , before settling down .
Crucially , the period of plummeting coincides with a phenomenon called the late Triassic fern spike .
This marks precisely — to within a few thousand years — the point of mass extinction on the land .
What is believed to have happened is that something killed all the forests and with them the animals that depended on them .
Freed from the competition for light ( because the shade from the trees had gone ) , ferns flourished ( their spores are ubiquitous in the rocks ) .
Previous work has suggested that the oceans also became acidic at this time .
Shelled creatures , whose calcium - carbonate - rich armour tends to dissolve in acid , suddenly became rare .
Put it all together and the probable course of events was this .
The initial volcanism as North America split from Europe released carbon dioxide from deep inside the Earth .
That produced a greenhouse effect which , in turn , melted seabed structures known as methane clathrates , which trap that gas in ice .
This caused a massive release of 12C - rich methane into the atmosphere , explaining the initial drop in 13C concentrations .
The methane , being a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , exacerbated things , while the carbon dioxide acidified the oceans , killing most of the animal shellmakers and fertilising the photosynthesis of planktonic plants .
The subsequent plankton bloom sucked up the 12C and the isotope ratio veered off in the opposite direction .
The greenhouse warming and the acid rain also did for the forests and many of the reptiles .
Only once things had settled down could the survivors regroup .
New species of trees took over .
The forests grew back .
And a bunch of hitherto not - so - terrible lizards began their long march .

‘ Belonging ’ is a pertinent trope in Africa and beyond .
However , in many parts of Africa belonging is not only understood in national terms but also , and most importantly , as belonging to a place or a group ; e.g. a village , a region , a clan or an ethnic group .
In the context of democratisation processes , belonging gained salience in political discourse , and in many countries has been coupled with the notion of autochthony as a criterion for privileged access to natural and state resources ( Bayart et al. 2001 ) .
Drawing on the example of the Mbororo ( pastoral Fulbe ) in Cameroon , I argue that national citizenship alone does not necessarily enable individuals or groups to realise their political or land rights .
Only as regional citizens and accepted members of a community are they entitled to participate in the joint management of the region ’s political and natural resources ( Pelican 2008 ) .
Moreover , certain population groups may feel entitled to more than average citizenship rights , claiming preferential treatment as minorities or , as in the case of the Mbororo , as an ‘ indigenous people ’ ( Pelican 2009 ; see also Kymlicka 2004 ) .
Thus struggles over citizenship in Africa may well go beyond claims for equal rights for nationals .
The Mbororo belong to the ethnic category of Fulbe whose members are dispersed over the Sahel and Savannah belt from West to East Africa .
In Cameroon they are represented in many parts of the country , where they generally constitute a regional minority .
In the Northwest Region , for example , they account for roughly 10 % of the population , the majority of whom are farming peoples here subsumed under the category of Grassfields groups .
The Mbororo may be regarded as a prime example of a stranger population .
They are a minority , thought to have emerged from somewhere else in Africa .
Having settled in the region in the 19th and 20th century , they are considered ‘ late - comers ’ by their long - established neighbours .
Furthermore , they are seen as religiously and culturally different .
Finally , as cattle pastoralists they are perceived as ‘ nomads ’ , i.e. people constantly on the move and with no permanent home .
Due to their late arrival in the region and their mobile lifestyle , Mbororo citizenship has been an issue of contention .
During the colonial period , they were classified as ‘ strangers ’ and subordinated to ‘ native ’ Grassfields authorities .
Subsequently , under the regime of Cameroon ’s first President Ahmadou Ahidjo , they qualified as Cameroonian citizens .
However , on account of their Muslim identity and Fulbe ethnicity , they were subsumed under the cultural category of ‘ northerners ’ .
Consequently , Mbororo who were born and grew up in the Northwest Region still counted as ‘ strangers ’ to the area with limited rights to the region ’s natural and state resources .
A wind of change set in with Cameroon ’s democratization in the 1990s and the integration of autochthony discourses in national politics .
As argued by Geschiere & Nyamnjoh ( 2000 ) , the introduction of a multi-party system raised significant problems regarding criteria of electoral entitlement and eligibility .
Taking into account the high degree of internal mobility and labour migration that characterised Cameroon ’s economy since the pre-colonial period , a number of conflicting interpretations of citizenship and belonging emerged .
The interpretation endorsed by the government defined belonging in terms of ‘ roots ’ and ‘ origins ’ .
Political priority was given to ‘ autochtones ’ and ‘ indigenous minorities ’ , meaning members of local ethnic groups .
‘ Strangers ’ or ‘ allogí¨nes ’ were instructed to vote or stand as candidates in their home area , since they were thought to represent primarily the interests of their group of origin .
At the same time , the Cameroonian government encouraged the formation of ethnic and regional elite associations as vehicles of political representation .
This novel political avenue was also explored by young , mostly educated Mbororo who founded the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association ( MBOSCUDA ) .
The organisation challenged the widespread perception of the Mbororo as a stranger population and claimed recognition of their national and regional citizenship rights .
Equivalent to their neighbours , the Mbororo should not just be seen as Cameroonians , but as members of specific communities .
Formally , this was achieved by indicating individuals ’ actual birth place ( instead of an imaginary place in northern Cameroon ) in the new computerised identity cards .
Practically , it required negotiations with regional and local authorities to promote the integration of Mbororo representatives in decision making processes .
Concurrently , MBOSCUDA reckoned that reversing the historical marginalisation of the Mbororo required more than average citizenship rights .
Benefiting from international contacts with development and human rights institutions , the organisation succeeded in claiming international recognition of the Mbororo as an ‘ indigenous people ’ .
While the Cameroonian government does not acknowledge the international concept of ‘ indigenous peoples ’ , it has recognised the Mbororo as a ‘ marginalised population group ’ in need of national integration and concerted development efforts .
Thus , in their struggle for citizenship the Mbororo – represented by MBOSCUDA – have gone beyond confirming their Cameroonian nationality , and have successfully claimed regional citizenship as well as minority status .

The man led the girl to a secluded spot in the grounds of an old factory Detectives investigating a sex attack on a 13 - year - old girl in Wirral hope a BBC Crimewatch appeal will help them catch her attacker .
The schoolgirl was attacked after being led away from a bus stop in Moreton Cross and taken into the grounds of the old Cadbury factory on 19 June 2008 .
Police said there were several people at the bus stop who saw the man who " dribbled profusely " .
A reconstruction of the events was broadcast on Thursday night .
The incident happened at about 1730 BST on Pasture Road and detectives believe there were a number of people in the area who have not come forward .
' Sexual predator ' Det Insp Mark Watson said : " The man we believe responsible is a dangerous man who was so brazen that he felt confident enough to take advantage of an innocent young girl in a populated area at a busy time of day .
" Despite enduring a terrible ordeal at the hands of this man , the victim remembers three distinctive things about her attacker that may help in identifying him .
" The first is that he was wearing a gold watch on his wrist , the second is a green tattoo on his left hand which she believes may have been a frog , and third , the offender dribbled saliva profusely during the attack . "
Mr Watson described the man as a " sexual predator " .
He told his victim that he was called Les and was from Liverpool .
The man is described as white , aged between 30 and 40 , and slobbered when he spoke .
He was of average build , with short greying hair , a wrinkled , stubbly face and was wearing a blue tracksuit and training shoes .

Sony has sold 31 million Jackson albums since his death last June
The estate of Michael Jackson has agreed the biggest recording deal in history , worth more than $ 200 m ( £ 133 m ) , with Sony Music , US reports say .
The deal reportedly involves 10 album projects over seven years - including one of previously unreleased material .
The singer died at his Los Angeles home in June , aged 50 .
He was due to stage a series of comeback concerts in Britain .
Michael Jackson 's death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the use of the anaesthetic Propofol .
Massive debts
The contract with Sony could be worth up to $ 250 m if certain conditions are met , the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday , citing sources close to the deal .
It reflects sales of Jackson 's music and memorabilia - which have sky - rocketed in the months since his death , making the late star one of the biggest - earning acts of last year , says the BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani in Los Angeles .
Sony has sold about 31 million copies of Jackson 's albums worldwide since his death on 25 June , the report said .
His estate may soon be able to pay off some of the huge debts he left behind , our correspondent adds .
According to US media , Jackson also left behind dozens of new songs , which may be released , along with revamped packages of old hits .
More details are expected in an official announcement later on Tuesday , but the contract is reported to include the soundtrack to the recent film , This Is It .
The footage showed Jackson rehearsing for his comeback tour just days before his death from an overdose of an anaesthetic .
His doctor , Conrad Murray , who told police he had prescribed Propofol for insomnia , has pleaded not guilty to a charge of manslaughter .
He has always maintained that he neither prescribed nor administered anything that should have killed the singer .

" Did they really agree to reimburse nearly $ 2,000 for a bondage - themed nightclub ? " group president Penny Nance asked in a statement .
" Why would a staffer believe that this is acceptable , and has this kind of thing been approved in the past ? "
Much of the most lavish spending by the major political parties is associated with fund - raisers , which often target wealthy people .
TRENTON -- Gov. Chris Christie Tuesday will propose slashing aid to public schools by $ 820 million as part of a state budget that will also make major cuts in aid to towns and colleges , officials familiar with the plan said today .
The word of a pending big loss in aid spurred school district officials today to say they ’re making plans for layoffs and program cuts .
" Every district is preparing for the worst , " said John Rodecker , superintendent of the nearly 10,000 - student Perth Amboy School District .
" We are anticipating layoffs .
To what extent depends on what the bottom line is this week . "
The Republican governor will propose making across - the - board cuts of up to 5 percent of each district ’s budget — a move administration officials believe will spur a new court battle over how New Jersey funds its public schools , said four state officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of Christie ’s speech .
Christie ’s $ 29.3 billion budget will also call for suspending property tax rebate checks until they are converted into credits by next spring .
The proposal includes a constitutional amendment limiting annual property tax increases to 2.5 percent , while skipping a $ 3 billion payment to the struggling state pension system .
Christie ruled out raising taxes to solve the $ 11 billion deficit , despite some Democrats ’ calls to restore a one - time income tax surcharge on the state ’s wealthiest residents .
The overall reduction of about $ 820 million in school aid could be at odds with New Jersey ’s school funding formula , which distributes state aid based on enrollment , with extra money going to districts with high concentrations of students who are poor , have special needs or limited English skills .
That formula , which survived a Supreme Court challenge last spring , replaced the longstanding " Abbott " system that sent the bulk of the aid to 31 poor urban districts .
The cuts to schools come on top of $ 475 million that Christie sliced from school aid in the current fiscal year .
Those cuts were based on districts ’ excess surplus .
In Perth Amboy , a 5 percent total budget reduction would mean about $ 9.5 million , coming on the heels of a $ 15 million loss in excess surplus funds .
Elizabeth Mayor J. Christian
Bollwage said the cuts would mean 40 to 50 students per classroom , possible closings of schools and the elimination of classroom aides in many urban districts .
" This budget clearly becomes a class budget , " said Bollwage , a Democrat .
" Chris Christie is clearly targeting a segment of the population that is not the New Jersey that he comes from . "
Christie has called for shared sacrifice and promised to give towns and school districts the " tools " to cope with state - aid cuts , including changes to collective bargaining for police , fire and teacher contracts , to the pensions and benefits for current public employees , and to the civil service system .
His budget would slice municipal aid by $ 445 million and aid to public colleges by $ 175 million , the officials said .
It also counts on $ 50 million in savings from privatizing unspecified government functions , and would raise $ 45 million through a hospital provider tax to generate $ 45 million in federal funding .
He will also propose to raise money through higher fees , such as business filing fees , though specifics were still sketchy , said two Democrats briefed on the plan .
State spending on direct services , a quarter of the budget , would also be barred from increasing by more than 2.5 percent each year .
Christie and the Democrat - controlled Legislature must agree on a budget by July 1 .

Wondering what kind of Doctor Matt Smith will be , with his first season of Doctor Who still a month away ?
The answer , according to the man himself , is " very doof " and " a bit mad . "
But let 's let him explain ...

Talking to the British Guardian newspaper , Smith described his Doctor :
He 's a little reckless .
He 'll walk into a room and have a million things to do .
And , as opposed to knowing exactly how to get out , he 'll take it up to the precipice : do n't know , do n't know , do n't know , and boom , there 's the idea .
And it 's a bit mad and reckless .
It 's very doof , doof , doof .
And he 's got a companion who I think is the hardest to handle .
And she 's quite mad .
But the Doctor 's quite mad as well ...
I think it 's impossible to escape that [ melancholy side ] with the Doctor .
He 's lost so many people and devastated so much … bad or good , he 's brought whole empires down .
He 's seen a lot , and that 's part of his personality .
But that 's also what gives him such joy and effervescence .

Is it just me , or is that David Tennant 's Doctor , at least up until the last year of specials ?
I can understand not wanting to mess with a winning formula , but I did expect something slightly different ...
The new season of Doctor Who premieres April 3rd in the UK , April 17th in the US .

Meet Matt Smith : Star of the new Doctor Who [ Guardian.co.uk ]
- video encodings still in process -
There 's a pesky ghost in a ruffled rainbow shirt and he just wo n't leave us alone .
His name is Jimi Hendrix and since his death nearly 40 years ago , he 's gone from rock paragon to boomer nostalgia mascot to video game avatar -- and he 's sounded pretty great the entire time .
And while the iconic guitarist 's tie - dyed influence on American music has refused to fade , Tuesday marks a new wave of Hendrixophilia : the release of " Valleys of Neptune , " a splendid collection of recordings , most from his final days with the Jimi Hendrix Experience .
It 's a warning shot .
" Valleys " will be released on Tuesday , alongside other remastered original Hendrix albums .
Reports say that the late guitarist 's estate is preparing a forthcoming anthology , too .
Meantime , blogs continue to churn with rumors of a Rock Band video game that will give players the opportunity to channel their idol -- a notion that feels well suited to Hendrix 's pioneering sense of techno - spiritualism .
Sound familiar ?
The entire campaign echoes the neo-Beatlemania of 2009 : Repackage a legendary artist by offering products to different generations at various price points and hope the dollars roll in .
" Valleys of Neptune " kicks things off with 12 unreleased Hendrix recordings , most from 1969 .
And yes , in the age of file - sharing , " unreleased " is a relative term , but these versions should sound familiar only to the savviest of bootleg aficionados .
But with this new release comes plenty of old - fashioned mythologizing .
On the album cover , our hero 's portrait is superimposed over a billowing cloud of stardust as if to suggest that this is n't merely an album , but a transmission from some cosmic afterlife .
That 's a tough myth to debunk .
The disc 's big revelation is its title track , with guitar chords skipping and skidding across the beat , Hendrix bellowing about his alien origins , " Mercury liquid and emeralds shining , showing me where I came from .
" Some of Hendrix 's best work evoked a limitless galaxy , a theme that 's propelled some of America 's most adventurous black musicians -- from Sun Ra to Funkadelic to OutKast .
But the man also knew when to stay earthbound , and does just that with another unreleased tune , " Ships Passing Through the Night . "
It 's a rolling , robust blues , his guitar swathed in an underwater warble that never blurs his human touch .
" Hear My Train a Comin ' " unloads a similar bag of thrills , the guitarist wailing away while his rhythm section lurches along behind him .
And that 's really the draw of these recordings in 2010 .
They sound like three dudes playing together in a room .
Except when they are n't .
A few of these takes ( " Mr. Bad Luck , " " Lover Man , " " Crying Blue Rain " ) were touched up by original Experience members Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell in 1987 .
It is n't a travesty , considering that Hendrix never shied from studio trickery .
Having pushed so many envelopes in the realm of technology and timbre , one gets the sense that he would have loved Auto - Tune if he were still making music today .
Here 's some more potential heresy : Hendrix 's brisk , instrumental read of Cream 's " Sunshine of Your Love " bests the original , with guitars sand - blasting away at the version forever calcified in our hive mind .
Hendrix almost bests himself , too , with a sprawling eight - minute version of " Red House .
"
Why does this stuff still sound so good ?
Hendrix can no longer shock us with kaleidoscopic garb or onstage bravado , but his music still manages to violate our expectations with a subtlety that feels like magic .
He remains strangely virtuosic , his playing full of sweet micro-imperfections .
His fingers tease the tempo .
He pulls notes back , rushes others forward , coaxing now - familiar noises from his Stratocaster as if it were a series of miraculous accidents .
You can hear the music happening -- a distinct , 21st - century pleasure that feels both quaint and mysterious .
JIMI HENDRIX LOST TRACKS KEPT SECRETJimi Hendrix 's stepsister has defended her decision to keep the rock legend 's latest release , Valleys of Neptune , a closely guarded secret - fearing Internet leaks .
Janie Hendrix , the president / CEO of Experience Hendrix , admits she only ever played rough cuts of songs her famous brother recorded in 1969 but never released in the confines of her car - because she worried about the tracks falling into pirates ' hands .
Hendrix , who also helped produce the album of lost tracks with her brother 's longtime technician Eddie Kramer , tells Celebrity Access.com 's Larry LeBlanc , " I let my kids hear it ( album ) .
My youngest is a techie .
He asked , ' Mum , can I download it on my computer ? ' " I said , ' No ' . ( He said ) , ' Mum , you do n't trust me . '
' It 's not that I do n't trust you but , if you want to listen to it , you ride with me in my car , and we will listen to it .
'" The album will be the first release as part of a new deal between Experience Hendrix and Universal Music Publishing Group , and Janie Hendrix can't wait for fans to hear it : " Valleys of Neptune is an incredible album .
It sounds as if it was recorded this year .
It 's fresh .
It 's new .
It 's exciting .
It does n't sound as if it was recorded in the '60s .
It sounds as if Jimi here with us today and creating music still .
" The album hits stores and the Internet next week .
REVIEW : “ VALLEYS OF NEPTUNE , ” JIMI HENDRIXFor a guy who only released three or four albums in his lifetime , Jimi Hendrix is certainly more prolific in death .
No less than 10 different albums of new studio material have emerged in the 40 years since Hendrix ’s death , and today we see the release of the 11th such album , Valleys of Neptune .
It ’s part of a joint effort by the Hendrix estate and Sony , cataloging and reissuing everything that Hendrix recorded .
Valleys of Neptune contains seven previously unreleased studio tracks and five new recordings of some well known songs .
A lot of this stuff was recorded in 1969 after the release of Electric Ladyland using a variety of back - up musicians .
The original Experience ( Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass ) play on many of the cuts , including “ Fire ” and “ Red House , ” cut for Hendrix ’s 1967 debut Are You Experienced ?
There are also a couple of excellent cover tunes , including an Elmore James blues , “ Bleeding Heart , ” originally released on 1972 ’s War Heroes but included here as an alternate , extended version .
The fireworks really go off on Cream ’s “ Sunshine Of Your Love , ” played as an instrumental with Jimi ’s guitar pyrotechnics taking center stage .
One of the great “ lost ” Hendrix tracks , “ Valleys of Neptune , ” shows up here with a remix that makes it sparkle .
Mitchell drums on this one , but they ’re joined by Hendrix ’s long - time bassist Billy Cox from the Band of Gypsys – it ’s a nice signature tune for Hendrix , with typically spacey lyrics and breathtaking guitar runs , easily the best of the unreleased material .
As an album , Valleys of Neptune is naturally not very cohesive : the majority of this material sounds like rehearsals obviously never intended to show up on a commercial release , or at least unpolished early takes .
Even so , you can hear the obvious craftsmanship that went into making music back then , a trait sorely lacking on many releases by today ’s top rock practitioners .
The Hendrix people promise there ’s a lot more left in the vault , and I wonder what the quality of that material may be .
At any rate : this is Hendrix , man .
If you ’ve ever wondered about this guy ’s legend , Valleys of Neptune may not be the place to start exploring .
But if you ’re in the mood for some good , old - fashioned psychedelic rock , put it on and fire up a fatty – this music will certainly take you on a little trip .
From last September ,
finds that for the first time in polling history going back to the 1930s , fewer than half of Americans ( 48 % ) approve of labor unions ( see chart below ) :
And a majority of Americans ( 51 % ) now think that labor unions " mostly hurt " the U.S. economy compared to a new low of 39 % who say that labor unions " mostly help " the U.S. economy .
More recently ,
finds that :
" Favorable views of labor unions have plummeted since 2007 , amid growing public skepticism about unions ' purpose and power .
Currently , 41 % say they have a favorable opinion of labor unions while about as many ( 42 % ) express an unfavorable opinion ( see graph below ) .
In January 2007 , a clear majority ( 58 % ) had a favorable view of unions while just 31 % had an unfavorable impression . "

I watched a third period Friday that could make you love junior hockey and hate the shootout at the same time .
A sold - out crowd of 6,488 at Harbour Station in Saint John , N.B. Most trying to cheer the Saint John Sea Dogs back from a 3 - 2 deficit against their biggest rival , but with healthy support for the Moncton Wildcats , who play 80 minutes away .
So many future NHLers , some shifts had the feel of watching a Top Prospects Game .
Phenom forward Kirill Kabanov of the Wildcats would deke around a defender at one end .
His Russian counterpart Stanislav Galiev of the Sea Dogs would come right back down and deke two .
And Wildcats defenseman Brandon Gormley of Murray River , P.E.I. , a higher - ranked 2010 NHL draft prospect than both of them , would swoop in to break up the rush .
The next shift it would be Galiev outmuscling Gormley , Gormley unloading a point shot , or Kabanov trying another shoulder - shake worthy of a wide receiver .
That ’s without even mentioning the 12 players in this game already drafted by NHL teams , or 2011 - eligible prospect Zack Phillips , who had strangers high - fiving each other when he made it 3 - 3 midway through the third .
Or that the Sea Dogs killed a five - minute power play when captain Mike Thomas was ejected for charging .
WHAT’S WRONG WITH A TIE ?
All of that and more added up to a back - and - forth barnburner between rivals .
But history will record it as a 4 - 3 “ win ” for the Wildcats thanks to the abomination of the shootout .
Some nights junior hockey teams play forgettable games before half - empty buildings on Tuesdays after getting back from six - day bus trips .
Some nights there are yawners between mismatched teams where the outcome is decided in the first period .
This was , as they say , “ a playoff atmosphere , ” with subplots of trash talk and coaching matchups , more entertaining than some NHL games .
It would have been a perfect night to let both teams walk away with a point .
Of course the shootout is entertaining .
Fans get excited to watch it .
But I hate it .
Not only does the system ( two points to the “ winner , ” one to the “ loser ” ) create an unbalanced point economy by making some games worth three points and others two , it also has an unbalanced effect on the emotional tenor of the teams .
After the game I just described , the Wildcats were in a celebratory mood in the dressing room , while the Sea Dogs could n’t get out of there fast enough with their loser point .
No shootout would have meant – GASP – a tie !
One point each is not exactly what either team wanted , but it would have left them feeling like they played hard for something .
DO WE ALWAYS NEED A WINNER ?
Why is it we need to declare a “ winner ” for every regular - season game , even if it ’s by fraudulent means ?
Is it something about our consumerist society , that we ca n’t live with ambiguity ?
Do we need to leave the rink with a “ product , ” i.e. a winner , even if we have to manufacture it ?
And what have we done to the excitement of the penalty shot ?
I did n’t even mention there was a penalty shot in this game .
That used to be something people would go home talking about .
Now you can watch four shootouts on SportsCentre every morning .
Does anyone remember that the 3 - 3 tie between the Montreal Canadians and the Soviet Red Army in 1975 is considered an all - time great game in hockey history ?
I had an old coach who used to say a tie was like kissing your sister .
But is n’t it nice to kiss your sister , once in a while ?

After the complete breakdown of civilization , the best place to live is going to be in a tanker , hitched to the back of a truck .
Designer Aristide Antonas has figured out exactly how to convert a truck into a home .
Advertisement
A futurist art and architectural project , Antonas ' images of the " KEG Apartments " suggest ways to convert emptied - out fuel tanks into cozy homes with giant beds , dogs nestled on rugs , and tall windows .
And the best part is that you can always be moving ahead of the zombie hordes - especially once you 've fitted out your truck to run on zombie guts .
( OK , I 'll admit that Antonas does n't explicitly talk about zombie guts in his project description . )

Of course , just because you live in a tanker does n't mean you can't settle down .

According to Antonas :
The keg wagons can be detached from their cars and can form more stable units for a certain period .
A big circular window can be introduced in the vehicle 's cylinder towards the car 's side with the use of an enforced circular frame .
This will give the form of a window open to the driver 's section or to any chosen view if the keg stops in a particular way .
The circular window can also serve as a projection screen surface if a special tissue is unfolded .

My favorite images from Antonas ' collection highlight the way KEGs will evolve back into houses .
The image up top shows the KEG in a lovely , bucolic setting - like a vacation home or a house at the edge of a farm .
And below you can see what looks more like a post - apocalyptic community of KEGs , some still truck - ready and some in a more sedentary state .

RE : Job performance
Hello Collin ,
Just wanted to let you know you 're up for review .
Some of your co-workers , who shall remain anonymous , have filed several complaints that you 're proving to be a disruption at work .
Is there any particular reason you scream " Uhh " at the top of your lungs for the duration of your time at work each day ?
If you 're confused about your action items , there are procedures for dealing with that as we discussed at last week 's staff meeting .
There 's no need to be disruptive by voicing your confusion for 8 hours straight .
Please see me tomorrow .
Thanks ,

Access to the innermost security zone during the G20 weekend will be controlled by a 3 - metre - high fence and five levels of security screening , a summit official said Tuesday .
These were among the few details shared with more than 100 property managers and company representatives who attended Tuesday morning ’s “ G20 summit preparedness workshop , ” hosted by the Building Owners and Managers Association ( BOMA ) .
BOMA represents more than 700 commercial real estate companies in the GTA , and workshop attendees included everyone from Ryerson University representatives to financial district property managers , all anxious to know how they can prepare for June 26 and 27 , when the world descends upon their neighbourhood .
Speaking at the workshop was Const .
Ed Boltuc , a Toronto police officer and community liaison with the Integrated Security Unit , the RCMP - led team tasked with overseeing security for the back - to - back G8 and G20 summits .
Security efforts are already promising to be bigger than anything Canada has seen before , and in Toronto , many residents and businesses have expressed concern .
On Tuesday , Boltuc reassured workshop participants that G20 organizers are striving to minimize the summit ’s footprint .
But when describing the scale of the impending security efforts , Boltuc did n’t mince words .
“ The Olympics that you saw recently in Vancouver was actually the largest security event ever to take place here in Canada .
The G20/G8 surpasses that completely , ” Boltuc said .
“ There ’s going to be a massive — absolutely massive — presence of police and security on the ground like you ’ve never seen before . ”
Boltuc explained that two fenced security perimeters will encircle the summit site , which is the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on Front St. W. Exact security boundaries still are n’t being disclosed — and probably wo n’t be until about two weeks prior to the summit — but Boltuc did say RCMP will oversee the innermost layer , which will wrap tightly around the convention centre and nearby hotels housing visiting heads of state .
This inner security zone will be strictly controlled during the summit weekend and blocked off with an “ unscalable ” fence rising at least 3 metres , Boltuc said .
Anyone requiring access will have to pass a “ five - tier system of security , ” he added .
The outer layer will be protected by Toronto police , Boltuc said .
While speculation had placed the boundaries at Queen St. to the north , Yonge St. to the east , Lake Shore Blvd .
W. to the south and Spadina Ave. to the west , Boltuc said the area wo n’t be quite that large .
Fences will start going up about two weeks before the summit , Boltuc said , although ISU officials hope to keep the gates open as long as possible .
Barring extenuating circumstances , the outer security should be accessible to vehicles and pedestrians up until the “ 11th hour , ” which is to say sometime in the evening of June 25 , he said .
But once the gates slam shut , workers and residents requiring access to the outer security zone will need to be registered or accredited .
The process for doing that was still being finalized as of Tuesday , but the summit office will probably begin accrediting people in early April , Boltuc said .
“ Registration may be as simple as giving your name , a place you work and a place you live , ” he said , adding that accredited individuals will probably be given a card which they ’ll show at the gates along with photo ID .
Accreditation will be voluntary but anyone choosing to forgo the process will face “ delays ” at the gates , Boltuc said .
Property managers or businesses anxious to know whether they fall within the perimeter can also call the summit office , he added , although boundary lines will not be disclosed .
Boltuc said Union Station wo n’t be shut down during the summit weekend , although it ’s likely foot traffic will be diverted .
Also remaining open will be the Rogers Centre , which is hosting ex-Blue Jay Roy Halladay ’s highly anticipated return to Toronto , and the Air Canada Centre , which will be the concert venue for violinist André Rieu ’s “ Celebration of Music Tour ” on June 26 .

The Gardiner Expressway will also remain open , Boltuc said , but commuters can expect traffic delays as motorcades travel from Pearson International Airport to the convention centre area .
While Boltuc played down rumours that there could be as many as 30 motorcades on June 26 , he said security officials will probably maintain about a kilometer of buffer space around VIP vehicles as they make their way down the highway .
Boltuc emphasized that security details are still in flux — and some details may never be released for security reasons — but he assured BOMA members that information would be communicated in a timely way through various channels , including community meetings and email .
Twitter will also be used to disseminate information , including details on motorcade departure and arrival times , he said .
Seventy percent more companies reported spam and malicious infections arrived via social networks in 2009 vs. 2008 .
By the end of last year , 72 % of companies expressed concern that their employees ' use of popular social sites could result in a security breach .
And 60 % of companies now consider Facebook to be the riskiest social network out there .
Those findings , released Monday , come from a survey of 500 companies worldwide conducted by security firm Sophos .
They help quantify the rising tide of spam and malicious infections proliferating on Facebook , Twitter , MySpace , Bebo and other such social networks .
As the planet ' s largest social network , Facebook might naturally be expected to emerge as the No. 1 target of cybercriminals , says Graham Cluley , a senior analyst at Sophos .
But he says Facebook has exacerbated matters by asking its members to embrace a new , more granular privacy setting .
Cluley demonstrates in this video how the new setting , in effect , authorizes Facebook to expose more of its member - generated content to everyone on the Internet .
Facebook 's new privacy setting gives the company leeway to submit more content to Google , Microsoft Bing and Yahoo Search so the search services can incorporate more Facebook content into real - time search results , much as they 've begun doing with Twitter microblog postings , says Cluley .
However , the wider release of Facebook members ' data " inevitably means more information will be made available to cybercriminals who want to target you or you company for an attack , " says Cluley .
Facebook continues to defend its new privacy setting as flexible and easy to change .
But privacy advocates continue to criticize the move .
And last week the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada launched an investigation into a citizen 's complaint about the new settings .
Meanwhile , Sophos ' new survey includes extensive analysis about how Facebook , Twitter and other social networks have become like a candy store for data thieves .
The fast - morphing Koobface social network worm is a case in point :
Most notably , the notorious Koobface worm family became more diverse and sophisticated in 2009 .
The sophistication of Koobface is such that it is capable of registering a Facebook account , activating the account by confirming an email sent to a Gmail address , befriending random strangers on the site , joining random Facebook groups , and posting messages on the walls of Facebook friends ( often claiming to link to sexy videos laced with malware ) .
Furthermore , it includes code to avoid drawing attention to itself by restricting how many new Facebook friends it makes each day .
Koobface 's attack vectors broadened , targeting a wide range of sites other than the one that gave it its name ( i.e. , Facebook ) .
Social networking sites , including MySpace and Bebo , were added to the worm 's arsenal in 2008 ; Tagged and Friendster joined the roster in early 2009 ; and most recently the code was extended to include Twitter in a growing battery of attacks .
It is likely we will see more malware following in the footsteps of Koobface , creating Web 2.0 botnets with the intention of stealing data , displaying fake anti-virus alerts and generating income for hacking gangs .

Web analytics firm Quantcast has recently published some usage statistics for operating systems , broken out into geographical regions .
The company 's data shows that 10.9 percent of online users in North America are using Mac OS X , an increase of nearly 30 percent over the past year .
Unlike determining market share by units sold , Qauntcast measures OS share by comparing the operating system of users via the company 's " audience measurement services , " similar to statistics gathered by Net Applications .
Such usage patterns can give us a rough idea of the installed base of an OS among end users .
While Net Applications ' data shows that Mac OS X has a global share of around 5 percent , Quantcast 's data is broken down into geographical regions .
Unsurprisingly , Mac OS
X is doing exceptionally well in its home turf of North America .
Though Windows still has a commanding share — 86.8 percent — it has been steadily declining while Mac OS X has been steadily increasing .
( The same is true globally , though , according to Net Applications . )
Around the world , Apple is also doing well in Oceania , with 8.6 percent market share , and Europe , with 4.7 percent .
Though Europe lags Apple 's global performance a bit , it 's worth noting the company has recently broken into the top five PC vendors in both the UK and France recently , even as the market in Western Europe has been relatively flat .
We expect Apple to gain some share in this region in 2010 .
Mac OS
X only accounts for about 2.5 percent of users in Asia .
The two most populous countries in the world , China and India , have an even lower percentage overall — 1.9 and 1.2 percent , respectively .
Japan is likely responsible for the majority of Mac OS X share in that region .
Unsurprisingly , Apple is barely a blip on the radar in South America and Africa where the company effectively prices itself out of emerging markets .
We doubt even the iPad could help Apple in these markets , which are still dominated by Windows according to Quantcast 's data .
One interesting trend is that Snow Leopard has shot up to nearly 30 percent of the installed base of Mac OS X , though Leopard still has a little over half the base .
Tiger has dropped to less than 20 percent of the overall base — expect more and more developers to drop support for 10.4 this year if they have n't already .
Another interesting trend that Quantcast identified is a huge increase in mobile browsing .
Though mobile operating systems only account for about 1.3 percent of users in North America , the increase is 123.8 percent over the past year .
That growth is largely due to Apple 's iPhone and its Mobile Safari browser .

Land art is at the heart of history and the human experience , from primitive cave drawings to ancient stone henges .
In modern times , increased artistic freedom coupled with technical and conceptual innovations have liberated land artists to create ever more amazing works of natural sculpture and earth architecture .
Some of these are mind - boggling in scale while other smaller works are astonishing for the amount of thought , effort and material that went into their making .
Some land artists prefer to use natural material to represent real forms found in nature while others prefer artificial geometric patterns .
Some bend and twist their material palette to fit a preconceived vision of a piece while others take what they find and augment , enhance or interpret it through their work .
Whatever their approaches , these eighteen earth artists have accomplished amazing things with mother nature .

“ My point is that now that vulnerability is out there all over China for anybody to take advantage of , ” he said .
But specialists in the field of network science , which explores the stability of networks like power grids and the Internet , said that was not the case .
Image Larry M. Wortzel , a military strategist , recently drew attention to the paper .

“ Neither the authors of this article , nor any other prior article , has had information on the identity of the power grid components represented as nodes of the network , ” Reka Albert , a University of Pennsylvania physicist who has conducted similar studies , said in an e-mail interview .
“ Thus no practical scenarios of an attack on the real power grid can be derived from such work . ”
The issue of Mr. Wang ’s paper aside , experts in computer security say there are genuine reasons for American officials to be wary of China , and they generally tend to dismiss disclaimers by China that it has neither the expertise nor the intention to carry out the kind of attacks that bombard American government and computer systems by the thousands every week .
The trouble is that it is so easy to mask the true source of a computer network attack that any retaliation is fraught with uncertainty .
This is why a war of words , like the high - pitched one going on these past months between the United States and China , holds special peril , said John Arquilla , director of the Information Operations Center at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , Calif .
“ What we know from network science is that dense communications across many different links and many different kinds of links can have effects that are highly unpredictable , ” Mr. Arquilla said .
Cyberwarfare is in some ways “ analogous to the way people think about biological weapons — that once you set loose such a weapon it may be very hard to control where it goes , ” he added .

Current thread :
Incident proves once again that detailed images of genitals are visible – and these are the people who will be leering over your naked children
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , March 24 , 2010
Outrage was growing today over the abuse of naked airport body scanners after it was revealed that a Heathrow worker perved over a naked image of a female colleague after she passed through one of the devices , before commenting , “ I love those gigantic tits ” .
Jo Margetson , 29 , reported John Laker , 25 , to the police after she had entered the x-ray machine by mistake and Laker took the image before making lewd comments .
One of the most important aspects of this story which the media has completely failed to mention is the fact that , despite a barrage of propaganda on behalf of the government claiming that the images produced do not show sensitive areas of the body in detail , the fact that Laker was clearly able to distinguish Margetson ’s breasts proves once again that the scanners do show crisp details of genitals and other sensitive body parts .
As we have exhaustively emphasized , the body scanners do allow airport workers to see intricate details of your body – penis length , breast size , implants , piercings , including crystal clear naked shots of your children .
The fact that authorities initially lied and denied this was the case as part of the agenda to hastily install scanners after the staged Christmas bombing incident was clearly a case of mass public deception and one of the primary reasons why the scanners need to be removed now .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Action for Rights of Children warned that the scanners broke child porn laws in the UK after their widespread introduction , but the government refused to make an exception and now force all Brits who are asked to go through the scanners without the alternative option of a pat down .
If travelers refuse then they are barred from flying , another complete violation of the basic human right to mobility .
“ I ca n’t bear to think about the body scanner thing , ” Margetson told the Sun last night , “ ” I ’m totally traumatised .
I ’ve spoken to the police about it .
I ’m in too much of a state to go to work . ”
Laker was given a formal warning for harassment by police and faces the sack .
“ When privacy - invading machines are installed at our airports , abuses like this are inevitable , ” said Barrister Alex Deane , director of Big Brother Watch .
“ We are disturbed to hear of this case , which will lead to greater calls for these scanners to be banned . ”
“ For every official caught ogling like this , there are plenty more eyeing up law - abiding travellers .
These expensive machines are totally disproportionate . ”
Heathrow Airport worker Jo Margetson .
As we reported last month , Indian film star Shahrukh Khan claimed that Heathrow staff printed out and circulated an image of him taken by the naked body scanner .
Heathrow denied the claim but Khan did not make a retraction and had no motive for inventing the story .
Airport security staff workers are among the least trustworthy people to operate these machines .
These individuals are routinely caught abusing their authority for their own ego trip or sexual perversion .
As the video below illustrates , the fact that naked body scanner machines in the U.S. are manned by TSA thugs who are routinely caught abusing their power in treating the public like prison inmates only heightens the danger posed by the use abuse of the new devices .
People in the United States need to lobby for states to pass laws nullifying use of the body scanners as a threat to privacy , health , and a total violation of human dignity , a virtual strip search that would n’t even have stopped the Christmas day bomber who was allowed to board the plane as a result of a U.S. State Department directive .
Idaho is leading the revolt , by passing a law that limits the use of the x-ray scanning devices in airports and government buildings and also forces Homeland Security to disprove health concerns .
— — — — — — — — — —— — — —————-
We are joining the hundreds of other Americans who have filed complaints in protesting naked body scanners as an affront to privacy , dignity , and a health risk , by launching our naked body scanner contest in an effort to focus public attention on how we must stop these machines now before they are installed in the streets and become another tool of control and oppression as part of the prison planet being constructed around us .
Not only have authorities in Europe promised to roll out mobile body scanners on the streets to mass scan crowds of people , but Homeland Security has even gone a step further , developing Orwellian mind - reading devices that are set to be installed as part of unconstitutional checkpoints at public events .
We are offering our biggest prize fund ever of $ 15,000 for the entries that most successfully highlight the true agenda behind naked body scanners and where this is all heading unless we put our foot down now and help to build momentum behind public pressure to remove the scanners from airports .

The strike is over pay and conditions .
National Secretary of the Full - time Firefighters John Kidd said staff are not being replaced , which is having a huge impact on services .
He said the Dublin fire service lost 108 officers last year and they were only replaced by 30 officers .
Mr Kidd said training was a very important aspect of the job and that there is currently no training in Dublin .
He said the situation had reached crisis point .
Lyrics : 99 Luftballons ( 99 Red Balloons ) - Nena
The English version had mixed success on the charts across the world , perhaps due to the conversion / translation .
The original German lyric version made it to number 2 in the United States ( and 28th most popular for the year ) while the English release hit number one in the UK ( and came in 15th most popular for the year ) .
In some markets , the single was double - sided with the English lyrics on one side and the German version on the other .
Below are both sets of lyrics : note that this is not 1980 - 89's translation , it is simply how the 99 Luftballons lyrics were released in both languages by Nena ( the song was never released as a direct translation ) .
However comparing the German lyrics to the English version shows that while the overall meaning was generally kept the same , a lot of the imagery was lost .
Many English speakers still prefer the German version since the English version is a little less rythmic and appears to be forced .

As a side note , the band Goldfinger released 99 Luftballons on its 1997 EP , ' Darrin 's Coconut Ass , ' but it was saved for the album ' Stomping Ground ' ( released 2000 ) .

99 Luftballons has been covered by other artists and featured in some TVs shows such as Scrubs .

99 Luftballons Lyrics
Hast Du etwas Zeit für mich
Dann singe ich ein Lied fuer Dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst Du vielleicht grad ' an mich
Dann singe ich ein Lied fuer Dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt
99 Red Balloons Lyrics
You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we 've got .
Set them free at the break of dawn
' Til one by one , they were gone .
Back at base , bugs in the software
Flash the message , Something 's out there .
Floating in the summer sky .
99 red balloons go by .
99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man fuer UFOs aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
Eine Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben , wenn es so war
Dabei war da am Horizont
Nur 99 Luftballons
99 red balloons .
floating in the summer sky .
Panic bells , it 's red alert .
There 's something here from somewhere else .
The war machine springs to life .
Opens up one eager eye .
Focusing it on the sky .
Where 99 red balloons go by .
99 Duesenjaeger
Jeder war ein grosser Krieger
Hielten sich fuer Captain Kirk
Das gab ein grosses Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fuehlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf 99 Luftballons
99 Decision Street .
99 ministers meet .
To worry , worry , super - scurry .
Call the troops out in a hurry .
This is what we 've waited for .
This is it boys , this is war .
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by .
99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich fuer schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen : Krieg und wollten Macht
Mann , wer haette das gedacht
Dass es einmal soweit kommt
Wegen 99 Luftballons
99 Knights of the air
Ride super - high - tech jet fighters
Everyone 's a superhero .
Everyone 's a Captain Kirk .
With orders to identify .
To clarify and classify .
Scramble in the summer sky .
As 99 red balloons go by .
99 Jahre Krieg
Liessen keinen Platz fuer Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt es nicht mehr
Und auch keine Duesenflieger
Heute zieh ich meine Runden
Seh die Welt in Truemmern liegen
Hab ' nen Luftballon gefunden
Denk ' an Dich und lass ' ihn fliegen
99 dreams I have had .
In every one a red balloon .
It 's all over and I 'm standing pretty .
In this dust that was a city .
If I could find a souvenier .
Just to prove the world was here .
And here is a red balloon
I think of you and let it go .

rachel : I have the goldfinger version of 99 red balloons ... they sing the 4th german verse of the song and I was just wondering what it meant !!
can any one help ?
80 - 89 : 4th verse roughly translated :
99 war ministers
Matches and petrol cans
Thought that they were smart
Already smelled oily loot ( greasy cash ? )
Shouted war and wanted power
Man , who would have thought
That one day it would come to this
Because of 99 balloons
Rudelyn : I love this song , eglish and german !!!
I alsso like it when Goldfinger sings it !
Ya'll rockkkk hehe I 'm so retarded

You folks are right , the Englische version of 99 Balloons is a great song by itself but it does n't quite match the visual impact of the Deutscher version .
I lived in DE when this first came out and it and the video took Europe by sturm .
There 's something really primal ?
about a sexy german Babe walking amongst burning rubble while singing about total destruction , the great War of all time , and other Teutonick imagery , it was just great ... tschuss

Thank you for the explanation of the disparity between the German and English lyrics .
Until the Late ' 80s the only version that I had heard was the German .
It was n't until I got the US release CD that I realized that the lyrics did n't jive between versions .
But , at least now I know why .

Better bag it and take it with you .

Metal Gear Solid 3 was released on November 17th , 2004 .
It 's pretty much the best game ever because you can throw snakes at the faces of guys and they wrassle with 'em .
We 're playing the re-release of MGS3 that uses a much better camera system and has extra crap .
We 'll be playing that crap too .
The MGS games have a lot of cutscenes , although this game is a little bit better with the spacing of them , except at the beginning .
Videos will be labeled as being either cutscene or gameplay videos , so that those who want to skip the cutscenes will know which videos to watch .
Make note that the gameplay videos will still have cutscenes , they 're just not incredibly long like the cutscene videos .
There are also a lot of radio conversations that are kind of amusing , so those will normally be their own videos .
Since stealth can sometimes be boring and / or there are a lot of options in MGS3 , certain maps will be played several times in different ways .
MGS3 is the first game in the MGS series , chronologically .
Even if you know nothing about MGS , the story stands very well on its own .

Lang Lang , the celebrity pianist ; Christoph Eschenbach , the conductor ; and the Schleswig - Holstein Festival Orchestra are taking the stage at Carnegie Hall on Sunday night in a concert trumpeted as a fund - raiser for the earthquake - ravaged Haiti .
But what ticket buyers may not realize is that far more of their dollars will go toward concert - hall rent and marketing than to anyone in Haiti , with the biggest chunks going to stagehands and newspaper advertisements .
Even if the event ’s nearly $ 200,000 worth of tickets sell out , less than $ 8,000 from the sales will go to the cause .
The concert , though , is expected to raise some money , thanks mainly to a $ 50,000 subsidy by the Montblanc company and $ 10,000 by CAMI Music , the concert ’s presenter and Mr. Lang ’s management agency .
Montblanc had promised to help pay for the concert well before it was transformed into a benefit , a decision made at Mr. Lang ’s request .
The performers , including Mr. Lang , are waiving their fees .
Officials of Unicef , the actual aid recipient , say that no matter how much money is earned , keeping Haiti in the public ’s consciousness after the earthquake headlines have faded is invaluable .

Scientists at the University of Copenhagen have discovered that Vitamin D is crucial to activating our immune defenses and that without sufficient intake of the vitamin , the killer cells of the immune system - T cells - will not be able to react to and fight off serious infections in the body .
For T cells to detect and kill foreign pathogens such as clumps of bacteria or viruses , the cells must first be ' triggered ' into action and ' transform ' from inactive and harmless immune cells into killer cells that are primed to seek out and destroy all traces of a foreign pathogen .
The researchers found that the T cells rely on vitamin D in order to activate and they would remain dormant , ' naďve ' to the possibility of threat if vitamin D is lacking in the blood .
Chemical Reaction that Enables Activation
In order for the specialized immune cells ( T cells ) to protect the body from dangerous viruses or bacteria , the T cells must first be exposed to traces of the foreign pathogen .
This occurs when they are presented by other immune cells in the body ( known as macrophages ) with suspicious ' cell fragments ' or ' traces ' of the pathogen .
The T cells then bind to the fragment and divide and multiply into hundreds of identical cells that are all focused on the same pathogen type .
The sequence of chemical changes that the T cells undergo enables them to both be ' sensitized to ' and able to deliver a targeted immune response .
Professor Carsten Geisler from the Department of International Health , Immunology and Microbiology explains that " when a T cell is exposed to a foreign pathogen , it extends a signaling device or ' antenna ' known as a vitamin D receptor , with which it searches for vitamin D .
This means that the T cell must have vitamin D or activation of the cell will cease .
If the T cells cannot find enough vitamin D in the blood , they wo n't even begin to mobilize . "
T cells that are successfully activated transform into one of two types of immune cell .
They either become killer cells that will attack and destroy all cells carrying traces of a foreign pathogen or they become helper cells that assist the immune system in acquiring " memory " .
The helper cells send messages to the immune system , passing on knowledge about the pathogen so that the immune system can recognize and remember it at their next encounter .
T cells form part of the adaptive immune system , which means that they function by teaching the immune system to recognize and adapt to constantly changing threats .
When the naďve T cell recognizes foreign molecules with its T cell receptor ( TCR ) it sends activation signals ( 1 ) to the VDR gene .
The VDR gene now starts the production of VDR ( 2 ) .
VDR binds vitamin D in the T cell ( 3 ) and becomes activated .
Vitamin D bound to activated VDR goes back into the cell nucleus and activates the gene for PLC - gamma1 ( 5 ) .
PLC - gamma1 is produced ( 6 ) and the T cells can get started .

Activating and Deactivating the Immune System
For the research team , identifying the role of vitamin D in the activation of T cells has been a major breakthrough .
" Scientists have known for a long time that vitamin D is important for calcium absorption and the vitamin has also been implicated in diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis , but what we did n't realize is how crucial vitamin D is for actually activating the immune system - which we know now . "
The discovery , the scientists believe , provides much needed information about the immune system and will help them regulate the immune response .
This is important not only in fighting disease but also in dealing with anti-immune reactions of the body and the rejection of transplanted organs .
Active T cells multiply at an explosive rate and can create an inflammatory environment with serious consequences for the body .
After organ transplants , e.g. T cells can attack the donor organ as a " foreign invader " .
In autoimmune disease , hypersensitive T cells mistake fragments of the body 's own cells for foreign pathogens , leading to the body launching an attack upon itself .
The research team was also able to track the biochemical sequence of the transformation of an inactive T cell to an active cell , and thus would be able to intervene at several points to modulate the immune response .
Inactive or ' naďve ' T cells crucially contain neither the vitamin D receptor nor a specific molecule ( PLC - gamma1 ) that would enable the cell to deliver an antigen specific response .
The findings , continues Professor Geisler " could help us to combat infectious diseases and global epidemics .
They will be of particular use when developing new vaccines , which work precisely on the basis of both training our immune systems to react and suppressing the body 's natural defenses in situations where this is important - as is the case with organ transplants and autoimmune disease . "
Most Vitamin
D is produced as a natural byproduct of the skin 's exposure to sunlight .
It can also be found in fish liver oil , eggs and fatty fish such as salmon , herring and mackerel or taken as a dietary supplement .
No definitive studies have been carried out for the optimal daily dosage of vitamin D but as a large proportion of the population have very low concentrations of vitamin D in the blood , a number of experts recommend between 25 - 50 mg micrograms a day .

Celebrity Apprentice : The Five Dumbest Things Rod Blagojevich Said , Week 3
By Marcus Gilmer in Miscellaneous on Mar 29 , 2010 2:20 PM
Former governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich is stretching his 15 minutes of infamy with an appearance on Celebrity Apprentice .
Throughout his run , we 'll be tracking the dumbest things our former governor spouts on national television .
In this week 's episode , the celebrities had to create a four - page advertorial for identity theft prevention software .
This led to many things including Blago pissing off Darryl Strawberry for his continued pandering to the citizens of New York City , revealing he can't use a computer , and making the worst analogy we 've ever heard .
Olympian - and this week 's project manager - Michael Johnson said , with more than a hint of disbelief , of Rod : " It 's difficult trying to find a task for him and try to find something for him to do because there 's not much that he can do .
And there 's got to be something there because he got to be governor of Illinois .
You do n't just fall up there . "
Johnson called Rod the team 's weakest link and once again Rod was selected to face the firing squad .
But , once again , Blago dodged a bullet - Darryl was sent packing by request - and lived to apprentice another week .
A quick lesson for those , like the New York Times , that grossly misreported the ACORN ' Pimp ' Hoax ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/8/2010 , 1:54 pm PT
Much more soon on Rightwing propagandist Andrew Breitbart and James O'Keefe 's quickly unraveling ACORN " Pimp " Hoax , just how much of a hoax it really was , how the media and Democrats shamefully failed their due diligence in reporting and / or acting on it , and coverage of a lot of new commentary on it all that has been coming in rapidly from the Left , Right , and Other over the last week or so .
Until then --- and as we still wait for Breitbart and O'Keefe to release the unedited versions of the videos which they 've charged for six months demonstrate serious crimes they apparently do n't want to show us , and while we continue to wait for the embarrassingly discredited hard rightwing L.A. County District Attorney Patrick Frey , who blogs pseudonymously as " Patterico " both at his own site and in comments at The BRAD BLOG and at Breitbart 's websites , to explain how it is that as a Deputy D.A. he 's authenticated the " unedited audio " that he claims proves some form of criminality by ACORN that neither the Brooklyn D.A. nor the former MA Attorney General [ PDF ] nor the Congressional Research Service have been able to find --- here is a short , instructive video worth a quick look .
It 's from 2007 and demonstrates just how simple it is to edit raw video in order to show something other than what actually occurred ...
The lessons above are worth keeping in mind given last week 's Brookyn D.A. finding that the O'Keefe / Giles / Breitbart Brooklyn video shows " no criminality , " and that , as reported in Rupert Murdoch 's own New York Post was " a ' heavily edited " splice job " where the low - level ACORN Housing employee 's " seemingly crime - encouraging answers were taken out of context so as to appear more sinister , " and as the New York Daily News similarly reported a NY law enforcement official last week confirming that O'Keefe and Giles " edited the tape to meet their agenda . "
Meanwhile , the " paper of record , " the New York Times , which grossly misreported the story time and again , is , as The BRAD BLOG originally reported , and as Katrina Vanden Heuvel at The Nation reminds us today , still standing by its damaging and inaccurate coverage of the entire ACORN " Pimp " Hoax .
As mentioned , much more coming soon ...

my friend took this when he went up on the glacier this weekend to see the volcano in action
Humberto Hernández , a boat captain , said that people ran “ screaming in all directions ” when the earthquake hit , leaving their belongings behind as they rushed for the hills .

The sea swallowed houses and boats in Tubul , Chile .

The New York Times
“ It was like an apocalypse that night , just like that movie ‘ 2012 , ’ ” said Mr. Hernández , 34 .
About a half - hour later , the waves roared through the town , smashing fishing boats into homes along the beach .
The surge of water picked up one blue house and left it about 500 yards away , where it still rests .
Juan Carlos Sombelo , a fisherman , said he never made it out of his house by the beach and was carried by a wave for about a kilometer , but survived by hanging onto rocks and other debris as the waves receded .
“ I just told myself , ‘ Pull yourself up , pull yourself up , ’ ” Mr. Sombelo said , with bruises on his arms and legs and a gash on his right temple .
“ I was as good as dead , but the water had carried me so far inside that I made it . ”
On Tuesday , the streets of Tubul seemed as if a bulldozer had run through them , mangling homes and splitting them into hundreds of pieces .
Rubble was stacked more than six feet high .
Cats and dogs lay dead alongside roads , flies buzzing over them .
People staggered deliriously through the streets , their throats parched from the powerful summer heat and their energy levels at a low ebb .
“ This was my house , ” said Claudia Álvarez , 42 , pointing to twisted rubble that looked more like a junk pile .
She roamed the town in a ripped dress , begging for help to get to nearby Arauco , another town ravaged by the quake and ensuing tsunami , so she could search for her husband .
In both coastal towns , there was no electricity , telephone service , working cellphone networks or drinkable water .
The towns barely had fuel to operate cars , and the scant food was running out quickly .
Still , so many lives had been spared in the violent flood of water that some residents had hope that the sea had not turned against them .
Hull City 's manager , Phil Brown , has apologised for the " unsavoury " public bust - up between Jimmy Bullard and Nick Barmby this week .
Reports emerged claiming the two Hull players were involved in an altercation on a " warm - down " outing near the Humber Bridge following the 5 - 1 defeat by Everton on Sunday .
The set - to was apparently witnessed by a large party from the Women 's Institute and Brown , who insists the matter has been dealt with " in house " , is keen to put the incident behind them .
He said : " I 'd like to apologise to the Women 's Institute , I did n't realise there was a rally going on there and there was apparently 50 - 100 women going on a march across the Humber Bridge and the incident was unsavoury , it was unfortunate .
" It happens on the training ground on a regular basis , under the control of the club , but it seems to have got out this time .
The players have settled their differences now , it was back to normal on Tuesday and they are getting on with the job in hand , which is obviously the challenge of 10 games in the Premier League .
" These things do happen .
I 'm not condoning that kind of behaviour but it's an emotive game , it 's a passionate game .
Emotions do run high and certainly then the pressure is cranked up – which it is , we are coming to the business end of the season .
" It 's a sign that they care .
Nick Barmby has obviously got himself involved with Jimmy Bullard .
They are big players where we are concerned and I 'm looking forward to the response of the group and of the two players in question .
" We 'll get on with it and deal with it .
At the end of the day it has made headlines , because outside of the confines of the training ground we were n't expecting it to be swept under the carpet .
We 're big boys , we stand by our behaviour and have shaken hands and will get on with it . "
He added : " There are no fractures within the squad .
This squad is united . "
The veteran Hull midfielder George Boateng added : " I 'm sorry because I missed it , I was n't there .
I would have paid to watch it ! "
Bill Gates donates millions to help end O.D.D .
( NaturalNews ) ()
Taking aim at the growing spread of ( O.D.D. ) -- a mental disease striking both children and adults -- Massachusetts health authorities have joined with the state legislature to make O.D.D. vaccine mandatory across the state beginning this Thursday .
O.D.D. is a serious health disorder that causes people to act in defiance of authority figures .
Symptoms of O.D.D. include disobeying public school teachers , refusing to take vaccine shots and engaging in home schooling activities .
The American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) has called O.D.D. a " modern pandemic " that has destroyed the lives of tens of millions of Americans who currently lack treatment .
Drug maker Merck launched its FDA - approved O.D.D. vaccine late last year , and clinical trials funded by Merck have scientifically shown that the vaccine works to quell disobedience in over 65 % of those given the shots .
The vaccines contain an unusually large dose of , a vaccine adjuvant that helps magnify the effects of the vaccine on the human nervous system .
Some critics are extremely angry about the vaccine , claiming it causes brain damage , but as was pointed out by a Merck spokesperson , those critics are themselves suffering from O.D.D. and need more treatment .
One of the more obvious symptoms of O.D.D. is any expression of opposition to vaccines .
Citizens who notice their neighbors displaying any symptoms of O.D.D. are encouraged to call the national O.D.D. reporting hotline : 1-800-ODD-HELPThe move by the Mass . legislature to make O.D.D. vaccines mandatory is designed to bring treatment to millions of O.D.D. sufferers who currently receive no treatment .
" These people need help , " said State Senator Jack McClane .
" It is our moral responsibility to make sure that every child in Massachusetts receives this vaccine for their own good .
" Parents who resist having their children vaccinated are , of course , suffering from O.D.D. themselves and will also receive mandatory treatment .
" We will have law enforcement officials standing by , ready to go door to door to administer this medicine to all the children across the state who need treatment , " McClane added .
Software entrepreneur Bill Gates has reportedly donated $ 265 million to the state to aid in the purchase and injection of O.D.D. vaccines .
In an email statement sent to the Associated Press , Gates explained that Massachusetts " could serve as a model for success " and that if the O.D.D. vaccine program were successful there , he planned to support its nationwide expansion to help treat all Americans with O.D.D. vaccines .
Parents are also finding huge benefits from the O.D.D. vaccines .
Twenty - seven year old Linda Johanson , who took part in the 7 - day clinical trial that proved the vaccines were both safe and effective , told the Associated Press that the vaccine " ... made my child far easier to handle as a parent .
He no longer spoke out against me or had his own ideas .
He simply did what I told him , and now our household feels like family again .
" Public school teachers are also supporting O.D.D. vaccination programs , claiming the vaccines make children " more obedient " in classrooms .
Academic performance appears to be somewhat reduced in those who receive the vaccines , but this loss of intellectual capacity is " a small price to pay for obedience , " say teachers .
The stock price of Merck surged by nearly $ 2 a share on today 's news that the vaccine would be made mandatory in Massachusetts .

Craig Stellmacher at TheUptake.org caught Bachmann ’s bill - killing rally .
Bachmann says “ some have called Obama the first post - American president ” about 90 seconds in .
Watch her eyes for prolonged blinking as she gets really crazy :
Word - salad garnished with nontroversy : “ Obama … Pelosi … Reid … They do n’t represent us …right now . ”
Because there was no election in 2008 , or because elections do not have consequences ?
Congress has , in fact , voted on the bills and will now hold further votes on them in perfect legal order .
The Constitution does , in fact , allow Congress to levy taxes ( “ mandate ” ) and appoint enforcement officers ( IRS ) , and such laws are , in fact , binding .
Either the representative from Minnesota lacks a basic understanding of civics , or she ’s encouraging sedition .
The “ post - American president ” line invokes John Bolton .
Having ripped the words from their context , “ some ” is a cowardly little word here that lets her invoke all the birther - deather - Van Jones nonsense without having to .
But what I find most offensive is the statement that health care reform
will be the first post - modern legislation where words mean absolutely nothing .
When it comes from the lips of a Christian fundamentalist , the term “ post - modern ” rarely refers to aesthetic movements .
Rather , it has come to mean “ secularism ” ( or “ secular humanism ” as they used to call it in the 1980s ) .
It is a sophistry , a straw - man argument appearing exclusively in the mental construct of the paranoid universe .
And it is an abuse of the English language so foul as to curdle my rhetorical blood .
H/t to The Uptake ; Craig Stellmacher is teh awesome .
Soon Oceania will have always been in favor of merely tinkering at the edges of Eastasia
Ramesh Ponnuru :
Understandably , Cornyn does n’t want to touch the most popular element of Obamacare , the ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions .
But unless it ’s modified substantially , the individual mandate has to stay too — and therefore so do the subsidies and the minimum - benefits regs .
Without perhaps realizing it , Cornyn has come out for tinkering at the edges of Obamacare .
This is the problem the Dems faced ( well , one of them ) , just in reverse : namely , what you want is uncontroversial and small - seeming .
But in order to ask for that one thing , you have to ask for all this other heavy - duty stuff .
Now , in reverse , the Reps ca n’t object to the heavy - duty stuff without getting pinned to the charge that they want to do really gratuitously , pettily awful stuff .
I predict that Cornyn is ahead of the curve .
Soon it will have been the common wisdom all along .
Basically for the reasons Ponnuru outlines .
There will never be a moment when any large number of Republicans announce they ’ve changed their minds , of course .
( In 1994 and even until 2006 the individual mandate was moderate – then in 2009 and especially in early 2010 it was radical from the get - go – then in late 2010 it continued on , moderate as ever . )
I hereby lay my bet as to when the flip will take place : immediately after 2010 primary season .
During the primaries , Republicans will be strongly and vocally in favor of total repeal , a unified front against being primaried from the right .
Then , after the primaries , all that will fade , like a dream upon waking .
Blogs and the conservative commentariat will be slightly slower but will catch up before the 2010 general .
By 2012 the apocalyptic rhetoric will have faded so far from memory that Mitt Romney will be able to run as a Republican , without having to run from himself .
Of course someone will point this out , but it wo n’t matter that much .
Heat of the moment stuff .
Ancient history .
Of course I could be wrong .
What do you think ?
Government plans designed to bring the National DNA Database in line with human rights legislation have been criticised today by an influential group of MPs as not going far enough .
The Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said that DNA profiles from those not convicted of a crime should only be retained for three years .
After defeat at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg over a year ago , the government proposed police should store innocent people 's DNA data for six years .
In December the UK 's human rights watchdog warned the planned period could still be illegal .
Currently DNA profiles from every person arrested are held indefinitely , except at the discretion of chief constables .
" We are not convinced that retaining for six years the DNA profiles of people not convicted of any crime would result in more cases being cleared up — let alone more convictions obtained — than retaining them for three years , " the Committee said .
Estimates provided by the genetic ethics group GeneWatch , based on data released by the Home Office , said that as few as 0.3 per cent of crimes are solved , or partially solved , by matching a crime scene sample to a profile on the National DNA Database .
The Committee said there is no reliable data on what proportion of those useful profiles belong to someone never convicted of a crime .
The Home Office has faced calls from Liberty and other campaigners to delete such data entirely .
The Committee rejected this option , however , judging that the benefit to public safety of retention for three years outweighed the impact on individual privacy .
The suggested compromise could offer the government a way to satisfy the House of Lords , where opposition to six - year retention is stronger than in the Commons .
Both are due to vote on the Crime and Security Bill , which would make the change , before the election .
Also today , the Committee backed ministers ' plans to expand the role of the National DNA Database Strategy Board .
It will be made responsible for considering applications nationwide , although local chief constables will retain a veto .
" The Home Secretary cited an example of where DNA data should not be retained — that of someone arrested for shoplifting when trying to exchange goods for which she was carrying the receipt , " the Committee said , adding it would expect profiles to be deleted " in a far wider range of cases " . ®
What if much of what you think you know is wrong ?

Ever wonder how Jimi Hendrix would cover Lady Gaga ?
The day is approaching when you should be able to find out .
Musicians ’ opportunities to sell their recordings may be drying up due to cultural shifts brought on by changing technology , but other aspects of technology are creating a promising new market for music : the licensing of the musical style or personality of recording artists .
The concept goes well beyond basing the avatars in guitar - based videogames on famous performers , although the idea is similar .
Using complex software , North Carolina ’s Zenph Sound Innovations models the musical performances of musicians from Thelonius Monk to Rachmaninoff , based on how they played in occasionally old , scratchy recordings .
Using that model , the company creates new recordings as they would be played by deceased musicians , if they were around to record with today ’s equipment , to critical acclaim .
And that ’s just for starters .
Venture capital firm Intersouth Partners led a $ 10.7 - million round of Series A funding in the company in November , a move that saw former Intersouth venture capital partner Kip Frey take over as the company ’s CEO .
He told us on Monday that Zenph has ramped up to 15 employees in preparation for new releases in its series of re-recordings .
Zenph also plans explore a variety of new markets , including licensing clear versions of muddy recordings to films and software that could eventually let musicians jam with virtual versions of famous musicians .
Picture an Eric Clapton plug - in that reinterprets your solo to sound like it was played by “ Old Slowhand ” himself .
Zenph ’s specially designed robotic pianos take high - resolution MIDI files created by software that simulates the style of classical and jazz performers from days gone by and them into sound by literally depressing the keys using between 12 and 24 high - resolution MIDI attributes .
So far , the company offers new albums by legends including Art Tatum , Sergei Rachmaninoff and Glenn Gould , and up next is jazz pianist Oscar Peterson .
These robotic pianos have wowed crowds in “ live ” settings at Carnegie Hall , Steinway Hall and on the Live from Lincoln Center show , with their note - for - note renditions of performances of the past .
Zenph plans to take them on three tours later this year .
Its engineers have nearly completed work on a playerless double bass , and plans to work on the saxophone model next , with the ultimate goal of creating every instrument in a typical jazz band — then guitar , and so on .
However , due to the complexity of playing those instruments , Zenph plans to simulate them being played in software and reproduce the sound with speakers ( updated ) .
Hear virtual Sergei Rachmaninoff play a composition by the real Rachmaninoff ( 1873 – 1943 ) :
As things stand now , Zenph ’s technology looks at actual old recordings to find out how a performer played a certain song , and is not capable of figuring out how a musician would play a new part .
“ We hope — but we ca n’t demonstrate today — that after we ’ve done several re-performances of a given artist , we will understand enough about that individual ’s musical style to be able to suggest how that style might manifest itself in the performance of a work that the artist never actually performed , ” said Frey , clarifying that today Zenph ’s software only reproduces performances , it does n’t create them .
Of course , causing a musician ’s musical style to inhabit a device would require a new type of licensing deal .
If Courtney Love blew her gasket when Kurt Cobain started rapping in Guitar Hero , just think how she would react to a virtual version of her ex-husband playing on albums without the proper permission .
Once Zenph secures the necessary rights to make these re-recordings through one - off licensing deals with an artist , or his or her representatives or estate , it creates a new sound - recording copyright , which wo n’t expire for decades .
This creates the opportunity to license perfect - sounding recordings from the past for use in films and television shows .
A scene featuring Thelonius Monk playing in a club , for instance , could feature newly recorded music reconstructed from a hissy live recording using Zenph ’s existing technology .
Taking these pianos on tour , on the other hand , is no small feat .
“ The problem is moving the pianos around , ” said Frey , “ it ’s not like you can just go grab any piano in any city . ”
His long - term vision for Zenph involves solving one aspect of that problem by modeling instruments virtually , so that computers can generate music in the style of a variety of musicians all on their own , without expensive hardware .
This would allow amateur musicians to play along with virtual versions of famous performers , and let fans choose which performer plays a certain part and even what mood they should be in as they play .
“ It introduces a whole bunch of interesting intellectual - property issues , but eventually , you ought to be able to , in essence , cast your own band , ” said Frey .
“ You should be able to write a piece of music and for the drum piece , have Keith Moon , and for the guitar piece , you can have Eric Clapton — that is a derivation of understanding each of those artists ’ styles as a digital signature .
That ’s further down the road , but initially , you ’re going to have the ability for artist to create music and have the listener manipulate how they want to hear it — [ for example ] sadder . ”
Clearly , the licensing of musical personalities has the potential to create a new revenue stream for artists and their estates , but because there ’s no compulsory license for this sort of thing — and there should n’t be , because artists or their estates should have control over what their personalities do — each deal must be negotiated individually .
But if Zenph and other companies succeed in the quest to create virtual musical personalities , the market will likely create licensing mechanisms that allow a wide range of artists and labels to license their personalities to interactive music formats , potentially resulting in wrangling over music licensing .
The problem has philosophical overtones :
If a machine has to license a certain performer ’s style , why does n’t a human ?
Licensing the style or personality of performers would open a strange can of worms , even if the intent is just to fairly compensate those involved .
“ The idea of extending copyright in general I ’m not much in favor of , but the idea of extending copyright to style is incredibly distasteful to me , ” said Eric Singer , creator of the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots , or LEMUR .
“ It basically means that the entire history of music , where people have listened to other musicians and been influenced by their style is basically up for grabs .
Whether a brain is doing it or a computer is doing it , how are they going to make that distinction ? ”
Whatever licensing is involved , it would involve a new right that falls outside of current copyright law ( updated ) .
Frey clarified , “ Copyright protection is reserved solely for original works of authorship that are fixed in tangible mediums of expression , such as books or recordings .
From a legal perspective , there is no way that whatever rights might be relevant to this hypothetical notion about artistic style would fit within the logical framework of copyright , and Zenph would never propose that copyright be extended in this direction . ”
( We should also make clear that Zenph negotiates deals with artists or their estates for each re-recording and would be required to do so in the future , so it should not be seen as subverting copyright law or hijacking artists ’ performances . )
For governing the use of artists ’ personalities , perhaps the “ right of publicity , ” which governs how a person ’s likeness and persona can be used , would be the place to start .
However it happens , the laws will need to catch up in the years to come , because virtual musicians are already real , and they ’re only getting realer .

Silicon Valley does n't just produce innovative web companies — it 's also a mecca for the green tech boom .
Bloom Energy , which launches officially on Wednesday , has built a refrigerator - sized box that can power your whole house .
Bloom Energy has actually been operating for eight years , raising $ 400 million in funding from VCs including Kleiner Perkins ( investors in Netscape , Amazon , Google and others ) .
Its " Bloom Box " houses fuel cells that run on oxygen plus natural gas , landfill gas , bio - gas or even solar power .
The company 's first customer was Google , which has been powering a datacenter on 4 Bloom Boxes for 18 months .
Google 's boxes run on natural gas .
eBay is also a customer — the company has five Bloom Boxes in San Jose , which it says have saved $ 100,000 in energy costs more than nine months .
The Bloom Box got its first TV appearance on CBS ' 60 Minutes tonight , which will no doubt drive interest in the launch .
Look out for more news on Wednesday .
What do you think ?
Could Bloom Boxes power the future ?
Since the day the first Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) data were released , in 2003 , all manner of cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) anomalies have been reported ; there ’s been the cold spot that might be a window into a parallel universe , the “ Axis of Evil ” , pawprints of local interstellar neutral hydrogen , and much , much more .
But do the WMAP data really , truly , absolutely contain evidence of anomalies , things that just do not fit within the six - parameters - and - a - model the WMAP team recently reported ?
In a word , no .
Every second year since 2003 the WMAP science team has published a set of papers on their analyses of the cumulative data , and their findings ( with the mission due to end later this year , their next set will , sadly , be their last ) .
With time and experience – not to mention inputs from the thousands of other researchers who have picked over the data – the team has not only amassed a lot more data , but has also come to understand how WMAP operates far better .
As a consequence , not only are the published results – such as limits on the nature of dark energy , and the number of different kinds of neutrinos – more stringent and robust , but the team has also become very au fait with the various anomalies reported .
For the first time , the team has examined these anomalies , in detail , and has concluded that the answer to the question , in their words , “ are there potential deviations from ?
CDM within the context of the allowed parameter ranges of the existing WMAP observations ? ” is “ no ” .
The reported anomalies the team examined are many – two prominent cold spots , strength of the quadrupole , lack of large angular scale CMB power , alignment of the quadrupole and octupole components , hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry , to name but a handful – but the reasons for the apparent anomalies are few .
“ Human eyes and brains are excellent at detecting visual patterns , but poor at assessing probabilities .
Features seen in the WMAP maps , such as the large Cold Spot I near the Galactic center region , can stand out as unusual .
However , the likelihood of such features can not be discerned by visual inspection of our particular realization of the universe , ” they write , and “ Monte Carlo simulations are an invaluable way to determine the expected deviations within the ?CDM model .
Claims of anomalies without Monte Carlo simulations are necessarily weak claims ” .
An amusing example : Stephen Hawking ’s initials ( “ SH ” ) can be clearly seen in the WMAP sky map .
“ The “ S ” and “ H ” are in roughly the same font size and style , and both letters are aligned neatly along a line of fixed Galactic latitude , ” the team says ; “ A calculation would show that the probability of this particular occurrence is vanishingly small .
Yet , there is no case to made for a non-standard cosmology despite this extraordinarily low probability event , ” they dryly note .
Many of the reports of WMAP CMB anomalies would likely make for good teaching material , as they illustrate well the many traps that you can so easily fall into when doing after - the - fact ( a posteriori ) statistical analyses .
Or , as the team puts it in regard to the Stephen Hawking initials : “ It is clear that the combined selection of looking for initials , these particular initials , and their alignment and location are all a posteriori choices .
For a rich data set , as is the case with WMAP , there are a lot of data and a lot of ways of analyzing the data . ”
And what happens when you have a lot of data ?
Low probability events are guaranteed to occur !
“ For example , it is not unexpected to find a 2 ?
feature when analyzing a rich data set in a number of different ways .
However , to assess whether a particular 2 ?
feature is interesting , one is often tempted to narrow in on it to isolate its behavior .
That process involves a posteriori choices that amplify the apparent significance of the feature . ”
So , does the team conclude that all this anomaly hunting is a waste of effort ?
Absolutely not !
I ’ll quote from the team ’s own conclusion : “ The search for oddities in the data is essential for testing the model .
The success of the model makes these searches even more important .
A detection of any highly significant a posteriori feature could become a serious challenge for the model .
The less significant features discussed in this paper provided the motivation for considering alternative models and developing new analysis of WMAP ( and soon Planck ) data .
The oddities have triggered proposed new observations that can further test the models .
It is often difficult to assess the statistical claims .
It may well be that an oddity could be found that motivates a new theory , which then could be tested as a hypothesis against ?
CDM .
The data support these comparisons .
Of course , other cosmological measurements must also play a role in testing new hypotheses .
No CMB anomaly reported to date has caused the scientific community to adopt a new standard model of cosmology , but claimed anomalies have been used to provoke thought and to search for improved theories . ”

The U.S. Department of Energy admits that « a chance exists that we may experience a decline » of world liquid fuels production between 2011 and 2015 « if the investment is not there » , according to an exclusive interview with Glen Sweetnam , main official expert on oil market in the Obama administration .
This warning on oil output issued by Obama ’s energy administration comes at a time when world demand for oil is on the rise again , and investments in many drilling projects have been frozen in the aftermath of the tumbling of crude prices and of the financial crisis .
Glen Sweetnam , director of the International , Economic and Greenhouse Gas division of the Energy Information Administration at the Department of Energy ( DoE ) , does not say that investments will not be « there » .
Yet the answer to the issue of knowing when , where and in which quantities additional sources of oil should be put on - stream remains widely « unidentified » in the eyes of the most prominent official analyst on energy inside the Obama administration .
The DoE dismisses the « peak oil » theory , which assumes that world crude oil production should irreversibly decrease in a nearby future , in want of suffisant fresh oil reserves yet to be exploited .
The Obama administration of Energy supports the alternative hypothesis of an « undulating plateau ». Lauren Mayne , responsible for liquid fuel prospects at the DoE , explains : «
Once maximum world oil production is reached , that level will be approximately maintained for several years thereafter , creating an undulating plateau .
After this plateau period , production will experience a decline . »
Glen Sweetnam , who heads the publication of DoEs annual International Energy Outlook , agrees that what he identifies as a possible decline of liquid fuels production between 2011 and 2015 could be the first stage of the « undulating plateau » pattern , which will start « once maximum world oil production is reached » :
M. Auzanneau – After 2011 and until 2015 , do you acknowledge that if adequate investment is not there , a chance exists that we may experience a first stage of decline in the « undulating plateau » you describe ?
GLEN SWEETNAM
– I agree , if the investment is not there , a chance exists that we may experience a decline .
If we do , I would expect investment in new capacity to increase if there is still demand for oil .
Glen Sweetnam acknowledges the possibility of a close - by and unexpected fall of world liquid fuels production in an email interview , after several requests of details about a round - table of oil economists that Mr Sweetnam held on April 7 , 2009 in Washington , DC .
The DoE April 2009 round - table , untitled « Meeting the Growing Demand for Liquid ( fuels ) « , was semi-public .
Yet it remained unnoticed and unjustly , as it put forward forecasts that are far more pessimistic than any analysis the DoE has ever delivered .
Page 8 of the presentation document of the round - table , a graph shows that the DoE is expecting a decline of the total of all known sources of liquid fuels supplies after 2011 .
The graph labels as « unidentified » the additional supply projects needed to fill in a gap that is expected to grow after 2011 between rising demand and decline of known sources of supply that the DoE supposes will start that year .
The declining production foreseen by the DoE concerns the total of existing sources of liquid fuels plus the new production projects that are supposed to come on - stream before 2012 .
The DoE predicts that the decline of identified sources of supply will be steady and sharp : – 2 percent a year , from 87 million barrels per day ( Mbpd ) in 2011 to just 80 Mbpd in 2015 .
At that time , the world demand for oil and other liquid fuels should have climbed up to 90 Mbpd , according to the presentation document .
« Unidentified » additional liquid fuels projects would therefore have to fill in a 10 Mbpd gap between supplies and demand within less than 5 years .
10 Mbpd is almost the equivalent of the oil production of Saudi Arabia , world top producer with 10.8 Mbpd .
After the oil demand went through an air pocket in 2009 , it is to rise afresh this year , according to the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , which advises the OECD countries .
Now set at 86.5 million barrels per day , the world consumption is already slightly higher than in 2008 , when the financial crisis stroke .
All the growth of the demand is now coming from non-OECD countries .
This growth should continue at a firm pace in developing economies over the next years , says the IEA .
According to the presentation and the transcript of DoEs April 2009 round - table , many oil producing regions should see their extractions diminish before 2015 .
Non-OPEC conventional oil extractions ( more than half of the world crude oil production today ) should already be in decline , from 46.9 Mbpd in 2008 to 44.8 Mbpd in 2011 , shows the graph page 8 of the DoE round - table presentation .
Total non-OPEC liquid fuel production has been stable since 2008 , says the IEA in Paris .
But the IEA does not provide figures dealing with just conventional crude oil extractions .
In 2005 , in the French newspaper Le Monde , the IEA chief economist Fatih Birol predicted that non-OPEC oil production would decline « soon after 2010 » .
Till 2015 , among the top 15 oil producing countries , only 6 will manage to significantly increase their liquid fuel production , shows the graph page 9 of the DoE round - table presentation .
7 of the 15 biggest producers are supposed to evolve towards substantial reductions of their outputs over a period starting in 2007 and ending in 2015 : Russia (- 0.15 Mbpd ) , China (- 0.2 ) , Iran (- 0.4 ) , Mexico (- 0.9 ) , the United Arab Emirates (- 0.3 ) , Venezuela (- 0.25 ) and Norway (- 0.7 ) .
Iraq ’s and Koweit ’s supplies should remain practically flat .
The U.S DoE expects that the largest increase of production will need to come from within the United States : a 1.8 Mbpd boost over 8 years ( from 2007 to 2015 ) that would equal to more than a quarter of the present U.S oil production .
Since the early 70’s , U.S oil production has been steadily plummeting .
This huge U.S liquid fuel production increase should be achieved through what Glen Sweetnam described as « the ethanol ramp - up » during the round - table , according to its transcript .
This « ethanol ramp - up » , initiated during the Bush administration , may stand for even more than the 1.8 Mbpd increasing expected by the DoE , as U.S crude oil extractions have been decreasing for four decades , and because there are no fresh oil reserves of significant scale coming on - stream in Alaska or elsewhere in the ‘ Lower 50s ’ .
One -quarter of all the grain crops grown in the United States already ends up as biofuel , according to an analysis of 2009 figures from the US Department of Agriculture published by the Earth Policy Institute , a Washington ecologist think - tank .
Will investments in new and « unidentified » oil projects be able to compensate for the decline of the existing sources of supply , in order to fill in within less than 5 years ( between now and 2015 ) the 10 Mbpd gap between demand and identified supplies that the DoE foresees ?
It takes at least 7 years to get any new oil project running , acknowledges the DoE .
During the Spring 2009 conference , Glen Sweetnam said that the recent discoveries of ultra - deep oil off the shores of Brazil were « sort of the bright spot for now ( … ) till we get to the Arctic » .
OPEC Secretary General Abdalla Salem El - Badri warned in February 2009 that out of the 135 projects due to come on - stream in the next few years , OPEC members have put 35 projects on hold to after 2013 , as the « current prices threaten the very sustainability of planned investment ».
By 2007 , despite huge profits , the top 5 international oil companies were spending a mere 6 percent of their free cash on exploration , compared to 34 percent on share buybacks , according to a Rice University study cited by TheNew York Times .
Back in 1994 , those top oil companies were spending 15 percent of their free cash on exploration .
Many experts assume that this shift in strategy is forced by a lack of access to new oil reserves , while the world keeps clamoring for more oil .
The prospects of the Washington Department of Energy on oil now sound far more pessimistic than the kind of analysis the DoE used to release not so long ago .
In 2004 , under the Bush administration , the DoE published a study in which oil production was supposed to be able to rise strongly at least until 2037 .
In 2008 , Glen Sweetnam published for the DoE a long term base case scenario in which the « undulating plateau » was not to be reached until 2030 , and would last until 2090 before world oil production would enter its final fall .
But Mr Sweetnam ’s 2008 study also presented a « more unfavorable above ground factors » scenario under which the undulating plateau occurs during the present decade .
Glen Sweetnam , who is supervising in Washington the preparation of the next annual International energy outlook , now seems to wonder whether his « more unfavorable » scenario is n’t the right one , when he contemplates , in his interview with me , a decline of world liquid fuels production starting in 2011 .
Such a sense of uncertainty cast by the Department of Energy is unseen .
The DoE usualy stands among the most optimistic sources regarding the issue of depletion of world oil reserves .
Glen Sweetnam ’s warning comes after a long set of warnings dealing with possible troubles ahead on the supply side of the world oil market .
Those warnings have been emitted over the last years through a range of sound sources such as The Wall Street Journal , The Houston Chronicle ( main daily newspaper of the world capital of crude oil trade ) , the CEO of Brazilian oil company Petrobras , a former n°2 of Saudi national oil company Aramco , an International Energy Agency ‘ whistleblower ’ , the chief economist of the IEA himself , the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil & Energy Security , or legendary - wildcatter - turned - renewable - tycoon T. Boone Pickens .

Social media and various commercials insist that “ we ’re all in this together ” and that if we just bake enough sourdoughs and go on enough therapeutic walks , we ’ll all be okay .
But the truth is that this pandemic has sucked .
It has sucked for you , it has sucked for me , and it has sucked for Stevie Nicks , who as always , …
All aspects of President Obama 's Chicago - style tactics are on display as he cajoles , bullies and bribes the House to pass his health care proposals despite the overwhelming public rejection with which they have been met .
To some , he offers bribes .
Rep. Jim Matheson , endangered species -- a Utah Democrat -- succeeded in getting his brother Scott appointed to a federal judgeship .
Matheson voted against Obamacare when it first passed the House .
With his new - found winnings in his pocket , he now professes to be undecided .
He faces a clear conflict between his district and his conscience on the one hand and the bribe to his brother on the other .
The conscience will probably lose .
Matheson supports his party 91 percent of the time according to The Washington Post even though John McCain got 58 percent of the vote in his district in 2008 .
But Matheson got re-elected -- by professing independence from the Democratic Party 's liberal line -- with 63 percent of the vote , so he probably figures he can sneak in a vote for health care and still con his district into re-electing him .
After all , he 's not heavy .
He 's my brother .
Even as Matheson basks in the glow of presidential bribery , Eric Massa , a renegade Democrat from the Southern Tier of New York state faces his wrath .
Massa 's sin was to vote against Obamacare .
So Pelosi and the ethically challenged House Ethics Committee are investigating him for " verbally abusing " a male member of his staff .
In this age of more serious offenses , using " salty language " to express his displeasure with staff work would not seem to rank high on the list of indictable offenses .
If it were , Lyndon Johnson would have been impeached .
But Massa is being hung out to dry as an example to other would - be independent - minded Democrats .
The attacks on him have gotten so bad that Massa has announced his retirement after only one term in office .
But there is a reward waiting for House members who ignore the wishes and interests of their constituents and vote for Obama 's health care proposals .
Alan Mollohan has had a pesky FBI investigation hanging over his head for a few years .
Now , presto , right before the health care vote , it went away .
The Justice Department , headed by Attorney General Eric Holder , announced that the FBI was closing the inquiry .
Mollohan 's sin ?
He pushed for earmarks for nonprofit enterprises in his district and then went into a real estate deal in Florida with the head of the company under financial terms that were distinctly favorable to the congressman .
But Mollohan toes the party line and is now getting his unjust reward .
With health care reform coming up for a vote in the next few days , such tactics send a message to the House , where Nancy Pelosi is having trouble lining up her votes : Obama will do anything -- anything at all -- to pass this bill .
For those of us without judgeships or the FBI at our disposal , we can only call and write the swing congressmen ( go to dickmorris.com for a list and their phone numbers ) or donate to the League of American Voters to step up its fierce media offensive in their districts to urge them to vote no .

Editor ’s note :
This commentary is by George Plumb , a long - time volunteer environmental activist and currently serves as executive director of Vermonters for Sustainable Population .
With the U.S. population having grown by over 100 million since 1970 and Vermont ’s population by 200,000 , the impact on the environment has been profound .
We are now facing major destruction of the earth ’s ecosystems , and we have clearly exceeded the carrying capacity to sustain future generations .

You 'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox .
This is so well - documented that I wo n’t go into the details .
Instead , I think a very important part of this discussion , and what is often missing , is what constant growth is doing to our quality of life .
For me it has had a dramatic impact , and I suspect it has for many others as well , particularly those who have lived in Vermont for more than a few years .
I moved to Washington , Vermont , in 1968 .
At that time , Washington was a very rural community .
There were several dairy farms , with each farm having no more than 50 milking cows .
And the farms were economically fairly well off .
The farmer across the valley even had his own little airport known as the Carrier Airport that still shows on Vermont atlases .
Everyone knew everyone else , and communities were tight - knit .
Since we have moved here the changes are almost unbelievable .
• There are only a couple of dairy farms left and the cows that used to sometimes break out of the fenced pastures and wander onto our land are … no more .
• The one - third mile long road which we live on had only two buildings , our late 1800s farm house and a barn .
It now has six homes with a total of 13 buildings .
The same thing has happened to just about every road in Vermont .
We used to look out across the valley and see just a few other buildings .
Now the hillside is dotted with structures .
Sense of real ruralness … no more .
• People no longer know everyone else in town and hardly know their neighbors .
Attendance at town meeting is no larger than it used to be and probably less .
Most of the community organizations that used to exist are gone .
Tight - knit community … no more .
VTDigger is underwritten by :
• The night sky used to be totally dark , and we enjoyed seeing the magic of the northern polar lights .
Now there is a big glow of light pollution from the sprawl in Central Vermont .
Aurora borealis … . no more .
• There was a wide variety of birds including barn swallows , cat birds , red wing black birds , kill deer , ruffed grouse , whip - poor - will , woodcock and many others .
In their place there are turkeys .
The joy of so many beautiful birds … no more .
• None of the land around us was posted and there were no other buildings for long distances .
Now much of it is posted and homes and camps are located on the fragmented parcels .
Enjoying really long walks and sharing the woods … no more .
But it is not just the surrounding land that has changed ; it is all of the Vermont land .
The beautiful views driving from Washington to Barre have been greatly diminished or disappeared entirely as home after home has gone up in the fields , on the banks of rivers , and on the hillsides .
A low traffic volume intersection of route 110 and 302 became so heavily trafficked , and with so many resulting accidents , that there is now a round - about there that feels urban .
The unfortunate thing about all these losses is that people who came along later do n’t know what they are missing .
If you have never heard a whip - poor - will , seen the northern lights , or enjoyed that beautiful view , how can you miss it and how can you know that your quality of life , at least in some aspects , would be enhanced if they were still there ?
Vermont was a literal paradise when we moved here .
It is a paradise that we are losing because of the obsession with growth that is in fact diminishing our quality of life as well as harming the environment .
Yes , we have gained some positive things like more and better restaurants , cultural arts and more diversified employment opportunities .
Call me - old fashioned if you will …. which I readily agree to in some respects …. but I ’ll take the Vermont paradise that existed before Vermont and the U.S. grew so dramatically in population size .

February is the second annual Global Population Speak Out month as promoted by the Population Institute based in Washington , D.C.
And speak out we certainly should be doing as we environmentalists did so strongly beginning back during the first Earth Day in 1970 when population growth was high on the agenda of the environmental movement .
However environmentalists retreated from talking about population growth as told in the PBS program , To The Contrary with Bonnie Erbé .
The show tells how the environmental movement dropped population from its agenda and how population growth is affecting the U.S. environment .
Watching this is a great way to learn why this incredibly important environmental issue is no longer covered by mainstream U.S. media or discussed by most environmentalists as an issue .

If there ’s a silver lining to what ’s happened over the last several months with healthcare reform , the Citizens United decision , the loss of the Massachusetts Senate seat , and discussions about the need to reform the filibuster , that silver lining is this : it ’s ripped the mask off of the real problem we ’ve been struggling with .
It ’s made it obvious that we are suffering from the degree to which our government institutions have been captured by corporations .
We are dealing with a problem in which too many elected officials on both sides of the aisle serve the interests of those corporations more than the people they ’re supposed to be representing .
Too many of our Representatives , too many of our Senators , and too many of the people in the White House act based on what ’s best for multinational corporations and their CEOs , not the American people .
Want proof ?
Well , an obvious case is the public option .
It ’s supported by a large majority of the American public .
It reduces the deficit .
It provides an additional choice for the American people , who are struggling with healthcare markets dominated by one or two insurers who are generally colluding to keep prices and profits high .
It ’s an incredibly populist and popular policy .
And yet there were those in the House who fought against it tooth and nail , and Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman did it in for the Senate version of the bill - in order to protect insurance companies .
Apparently , for them , insurance company profits and CEO bonuses are more important than functioning markets or the well - being of the vast majority of American families and small businesses .
[ I ]t 's useful to distinguish between two separate categories of problems we face .
The first are the human , economic and ecological disasters that demand immediate action : a grossly inefficient healthcare sector , millions un - or underinsured , 10 percent unemployment , a planet that 's warming , soaring personal bankruptcies , 12 million immigrants working in legal limbo , the list goes on .
But the deeper problem , the ultimate cause of many of the first - order problems , is the perverse maldistribution of power in the country : too much in too few hands .
It did n't happen overnight , of course , and the devolution has been analyzed and decried by a host of writers and thinkers in these very pages [ of The Nation ] .
It 's also not the first time .
Indeed , the story of the American Republic is the never - ending task of redistributing power that always seems to collect and pool and re-form , a cycle in which we break up the power trusts , only to find them reassembling , Terminator 2 - like , and requiring yet another dose of the founders ' revolutionary fervor to be broken up again .
The central and unique paradox of our politics at this moment , however , is that our institutions are so broken , the government so sclerotic and dysfunctional , that in almost all cases , from financial bailouts to health insurance mandates , the easiest means of addressing the first set of problems is to take steps that exacerbate the second .

My dad called this morning to catch up on life .
As the hub of the extended family , he calls around to his children and his siblings roughly once a week and tells everyone what ’s going on with everyone else .
He and I talk politics some , but we tread carefully : he ’s an old school Nebraska Republican who watches Fox News , and I ’m a progressive politician who blogs on DailyKos .
There ’s some space between our political views .
This morning we chatted a bit about healthcare reform and about Ben Nelson .
And while we were talking , I realized that he was just as frustrated with the gridlock in DC and the corporate capture of government as I was .
The only difference was that he believed the Democrats were the cause of the problem .
When I pointed out not all Democrats were – but his Senator , Ben Nelson , was – he and I both laughed .
And then we moved the conversation onto my siblings and their latest news .
There 's a word for a governing philosophy that fuses the power of government and large corporations as a means of providing services and keeping the wheels of industry greased , and it's a word that has begun to pop up among critics of everything from the TARP bailout to healthcare to cap and trade : corporatism .
Since corporatism often merges the worst parts of Big Government and Big Business , it 's an ideal target for both the left and right .
....
But the corporatism on display in Washington is itself a symptom of a broader social illness that I noted above , a democracy that is pitched precariously on the tipping point of oligarchy .
In an oligarchy , the only way to get change is to convince the oligarchs that it is in their interest -- and increasingly , that 's the only kind of change we can get .

Next week , there ’s going to be a test in Congress .
A real litmus test about whose side various Representatives and Senators are on .
It ’s a stunningly straightforward bill – only two pages long – that would simply remove the antitrust exemption for health insurers .
It would keep insurers from being able to collude and price fix , requiring them to compete in the marketplace for business .
Unlike nearly everything else that ’s been done in the last year , this bill is completely uncompromised – no deals have been cut to water down the bill in favor of health insurance companies .
It is an unambiguously populist bill , and a clean cut against corporatism .
It ’s building off of work that key progressives in the House , including Reps.
DeFazio , Slaughter , and DeGette , have been teeing up for years .
Yesterday , Reps. Tom Perriello and Betsy Markey , the lead sponsors of the bill , had a press conference in the snow in DC .
And the insurance industry was scared enough to show up and start passing out information indicating that if they had to compete with each other and stop colluding , that would somehow result in insurance prices going up .
I kid you not .
So here ’s the deal : we need to watch the bill , and see who ’s on which side .
And then , I think , we need to make a really big deal of it .
Because this is the first unambiguous litmus test we ’ve had , and it ’s so straightforward that even my Republican dad will agree .
Vote against this bill , and it means you ’re in the pocket of the insurance companies .

Yes , friends : an American culture that says it really , really cares about its children needs to pay close attention now .
We already overcategorize these same children ; we overstimulate them and then we overmedicate them in so many disturbing ways .
But now we are about to cross a whole new boundary , because researchers have learned that tiny tots are actually able to make “ consumer choices ” much earlier than was ever before thought possible : they are neurologically ready to shop ’ til they drop even at the tender age of three .
According to the new study , jointly conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin , “ children use brand cues to determine what food products will be exciting or which toys will be the most enjoyable , and values associated with items ( like food choices ) are formed as young as three years old . ”
As well : “ The most commonly recognized brand was McDonald ’s , followed closely by other brands of fast food , soda , and toys . ”
The press release from the University of Michigan ’s School of Kinesiology touted the contribution to the research of one Dr. Bettina Cornwell , identified as Professor of Sport Marketing at the school .
Efforts to speak to Dr. Cornwell were unavailing .
Her publicist told me that she had been “ swamped ” with interview requests and was about to embark on travel .
We should also note that the Professor of Sport Marketing did not actually say to ravenous marketers , “ Folks , we just struck some serious gold here !
Y’all come and get it !! ”
But I do think it is fair to conclude that her message is , shall we say , a mixed one .
I mean , how do you really improve on this statement for sending a mixed signal ( and this is Dr. Cornwell speaking in the press release ) : “ I think the outcomes of our study help paint the picture that young children really do understand the power of branding and advertising and highlights ( sic ) the need for lawmakers to continue to monitor and regulate advertising to children . ”
Does Prof.
Cornwell seriously think — or do we — that advertisers who come upon her research will say to themselves , “ Interesting — but it would be so wrong to pitch to those little ones ” ?
Or that government will ever catch up with the marketers , once they ’ve tapped into the neuronal passageways of the preschool set ?
Children as Economic Droids or Children as Light Bearers : Could We Please Decide ?
I did n’t hesitate when the editors asked me what I saw as the religious angle in this story .
“ Wordsworth ! ” I fairly shouted back .
Here is William Wordsworth in his justly celebrated “ Intimations of Immortality ” ode ( and readers who , like me , once memorized these lines should feel free to recite them aloud ) :
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting :
The Soul that rises with us , our life ’s Star ,
Hath had elsewhere its setting ,
And cometh from afar :
Not in entire forgetfulness ,
And not in utter nakedness ,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God , who is our home :
Heaven lies about us in our infancy !
Shades of the prison - house begin to close
Upon the growing Boy ,
But
He beholds the light , and whence it flows ,
He sees it in his joy ;
The Youth , who daily farther from the east
Must travel , still is Nature ’s Priest ,
And by the vision splendid
Is on his way attended ;
At length the Man perceives it die away ,
And fade into the light of common day .
Wordsworth has much more to say about those clouds of glory we are born with in his psychologically astute Prelude .
But here in “ Intimations ” we are given the essence in a perfect verse stanza : as infants we bring into this life some major bits of heaven ; in our very young childhood the we still behold celestial light , even though the prison house is starting to close in ; even in our adolescence we still remain Nature ’s “ priest ” ; it is only in our adulthood that the beatific vision of what life really is gets swept away by the cares and trivialities of our so - called maturity .
In another poem , Wordsworth elaborates on our loss of the God - given powers we once possessed :
The world is too much with us ; late and soon ,
Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers :
Little we see in Nature that is ours ;
We have given our hearts away , a sordid boon !
I have always thought of Wordsworth , along with his slightly older contemporary , William Blake , as an essential truthteller in respect to what Blake calls innocence and experience .
Both defended old folkways and ancient wisdom .
Both rebelled against the malign effects of brutal industrialization and its concomitant regimentation .
One imagines that neither would approve of testing very young children ’s receptivity to national brands of fast food or soda .
And neither would Jesus of Nazareth , who apparently adored and revered young children — and who reserved some rather choice words for those who would seek to exploit them :
If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me , it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea .
( Matthew 18.6 ; cf. Luke 17:2 , Mark 9:42 )
Cement socks for the child exploiters , says Jesus .
McDonald ’s ( and the rest of us ) : Listen up !
I was surprised that the Canadians did n't dominate .
I was surprised that Nash was Canada 's best forward .
I was surprised that Pronger played so well .
I was surprised to see the Canadians trap in the third .
I was n't surprised to see Babcock not mention it was a strategy driven from the bench .
I was surprised that Seabrook took so many shifts .
I was surprised that Crosby did n't get a shot on that third period breakaway .
I was surprised Crosby was on the bench in the last minute of regulation .
I was surprised that Getzlaf was n't .
I was n't surprised when Crosby had the defining moment .
A fantastic ending , both for the hockey tournament and for the Games .
The first Olympic Games I remember is Calgary 1988 .
That year Canada won five medals , none of them gold .
It was the second most medals they 'd ever won and far from the embarrassment it 's made out to be .
Before my lifetime Canadians did n't win at the Olympics .
It just did n't happen .
And now , well now - twenty - two years later , one generation - they have more gold medals at a winter Games than any other nation in history .
Before Canada that record was shared between the United States and the Soviet Union ( Edit : edm_euler pointed out that I AM WRONG on this point ( except I 'm actually wrong ) and that it 's actually Norway and the Soviet Union ... kind of wrecks the narrative ... damn you euler !!! ) .
You know , super - powers .
And now it 's Canada's .
Bonkers .
And a big part of it are those ' 88 Olympians who got this country rolling in the right direction ; it 's been steady climbing ever since .
And it makes that hockey gold that much more sweet .
They played for themselves and for their team and for their country but in the most tangible of ways , that gold was their contribution to the larger team .
It was for Bilodeau , McIvor , Humphries and Moyse as much as it was for Yzerman , Nicholson and Lowe .
It was for Rochette , Montgomery , Hamelin and St - Gelais ; for Martin , Hebert , Morris and Kennedy ; for Kershaw , Babikov , Grey and Harvey ; for Clara Hughes and on it goes .
I do n't know if the hockey players ever feel disconnected from the rest of the Olympic team but with this accomplishment , this one that could only be shared , I can't see them feeling that way now .
Yes , it was a hockey game , and a great one .
But it was part of something bigger than just the hockey tournament .
This one was truly - and distinctly - an Olympic victory .
Some play - by - play and other minutiae on the game itself after the jump .
As usual I 've got the lines for you here .
It feels a bit weird doing this when you know the team is n't ever going to play another game together but it 's kind of fun to do , so here you are .
The legend is up first in case you still do n't know the jersey numbers .

End of Game
I 'm glad that I decided to track the play - by - play for this game because there were all kinds of interesting things happening , especially as the game was coming to a close .
On defence , Brent Seabrook did eventually get cut .
I liked this decision because it allowed the Canadians to run three distinct pairs from then on and I also thought Seabrook was the weakest Canadian defender in the tournament .
I know that some were impressed , but I was n't one of them .
Chances against just seemed to follow him around .
If anything , I was surprised he hung on as long as he did .
Other than that , the Canadians pretty much ran three pairs to the end with Niedermayer and Weber being the go - to guys at the end .
And what an emotional whirlwind for those two , on the ice for both the US tying goal and Crosby 's winner .
At forward , there were a couple of things I wanted to look at from earlier on .
First , Bergeron kept his job as " DZ faceoff man " for most of the game , getting a few opportunities in the first , second and first half of the third .
The other place that Bergeron saw some time was the PK .
Over the last few games the Canadians have basically run with three pairings : Bergeron - Morrow , Toews - Richards and Marleau - Nash having dropped Staal and others from any substantial PK duty .
Solid choices all around given the make - up of the team .
But when Toews hit the box , they abandoned these regular pairs completely and they just played mix - and - match with the five regular guys available .
I know I sure felt a lot less confident on that one and Gabe Desjardins has shown there 's a real ( and negative ) effect when regular penalty killers take penalties .
Skipping ahead in the game , it was interesting to see which forwards got cut because the coaches decided not to gas an entire line but still took nine forwards for the close .
Of course , Bergeron was done .
But they also gassed Heatley , Iginla and Perry .
The lines they ended up with were Getzlaf - Thornton - Marleau , Nash - Toews - Richards and Morrow - Crosby - Staal .
Two brand new combinations for what I have to think is only marginal gain if all of the six guys they moved are going strong .
Why take out Iginla for Morrow ?
I do n't much get it to be honest , especially since they had to have someone flip wings to accommodate .
Just silly in my opinion .
And that theme continued when they put Getzlaf with Nash and Toews for their first shift of the tournament with less than a minute to go in the gold medal game .
And for the defensive presence of Ryan Getzlaf .
That just seems ...
I do n't know ... dumb .
Anyway , the Americans tied it up and it was off to overtime where Iginlas squeezed back into the lineup and contributed on the winning goal ( nice job Iggy ! ) .
The only things that surprised me here were the pairs of Staal - Richards and Heatley - Getzlaf .
The Heatley - Getzlaf group seemed destined to do something stupid and the Staal - Richards pairing just did n't seem as good as the others .
The other pairings were Iginla - Crosby , Thornton - Marleau ( who I desperately wanted to see score ) and Nash - Toews which all felt solid .
Seems odd to me that they would go with more than four pairs and that the fourth would receive more than spot duty .
But hey , it worked out .
Yeppers , the whole thing worked out !
Way to go Canada !
AUSTRALIAN of the Year Pat McGorry has backed calls for a Senate inquiry into Scientology , saying its views on mental health are putting lives at risk .
" They are the deniers of the realities of mental illness , which I find incredibly irresponsible and dangerous , " he told ABC Radio on Wednesday .
The renowned mental health expert has joined psychiatry boss Louise Newman and the Brain and Mind Institute 's Ian Hickie in urging senators to vote for an inquiry .
The Senate is expected to vote on the issue , brought forward by independent Senator Nick Xenophon , by the end of next week .
Professor McGorry met Senator Xenophon yesterday to lend his voice to the cause .
" I 'm concerned that any restriction or any discouragement of access to mental health care will cost lives and result in unnecessary disability for people , " he said .
" The whole mental health field would support this call for an inquiry and it 's something that 's overdue in my opinion . "
So far , only the Australian Greens have committed to voting for the inquiry and it needs more support if it is to get up .
Senator Xenophon said Scientology had nothing to fear from a transparent inquiry where it would be given the right of reply .
He said he would not abandon any victims of Scientology , adding he could be a " completely stubborn bastard " when it came to pursuing important issues .
The church 's Australian vice - president Cyrus Brooks has rejected the support of the mental health experts .
" That 's the wrong way for them to go there .
They 're going into the field of religion and they 're in the field of mental health , " he said .

" The Hollywood Reporter reports that more than 20,000 individual movie torrent downloaders have been sued in the past few weeks in Washington , DC , federal court for copyright infringement , and another lawsuit targeting 30,000 more torrent downloaders on five more films is forthcoming in what could be a test run that opens up the floodgates to massive litigation against the millions of individuals who use BitTorrent to download movies .
The US Copyright Group , a company owned by intellectual property lawyers , is using a new proprietary technology by German - based Guardaley IT that allows for real - time monitoring of movie downloads on torrents .
According to Thomas Dunlap , a lawyer at the firm , the program captures IP addresses based on the time stamp that a download has occurred and then checks against a spreadsheet to make sure the downloading content is the copyright protected film and not a misnamed film or trailer .
' We 're creating a revenue stream and monetizing the equivalent of an alternative distribution channel , ' says Jeffrey Weaver , another lawyer at the firm . "

" The difference between the MPAA 's past approach and the new one being offered by the US Copyright Group is that the MPAA took a less targeted approach going after a smaller sampling of infringers in a single suit for multiple films , to send a message .
In contrast , the US Copyright Group is using the new monitoring technology to go after tens of thousands of infringers at a time on a contingency basis in hopes of coming up with the right cost - benefit incentive to pursue individual pirates . "
BOSTON – Before her son died of cancer in 2008 , Lorraine E. Kerz , of Greenfield , promised him she would work to legalize the drug that she said helped him deal with anxiety and the side effects of chemotherapy .
Her son , Silas R. Bennett , used marijuana as a medicine to ease severe nausea and pain before he died at age 29 from cancer , she said .
Kerz , 53 , is pushing for approval of a medical marijuana bill .
“ It ’s time for our state legislators to step up and pass something for people who are ill and need it , ” said Kerz , who does not use marijuana .
“ People with qualifying illnesses should be able to benefit . ”
Under the bill , people with certain medical conditions , including cancer , glaucoma and AIDS , would register with the state Department of Public Health and would be allowed to use and possess marijuana if recommended by a doctor .
Each patient would have an identification card and would be limited to possessing up to 4 ounces of cannabis and 12 plants .
The state would be authorized to permit and regulate a limited number of nonprofit centers that could grow marijuana and provide it to certified patients .
The bill , sponsored by Rep. Frank I. Smizik , D - Brookline , is unlikely to pass this year , judging by a vote taken on Tuesday .
The Committee on Public Health voted for a further study , which usually indicates the bill is dead for this year .
Technically , however , the bill is still alive .
Rep. Jeffrey D. Sanchez , D - Boston , the co-chair of the Public Health Committee , said the bill would expand a state bureaucracy and needs more thought .
Sanchez said medical marijuana is a complicated issue .
“ We ’re going to look at it , ” Sanchez said .
“ I did n’t feel we could act favorably . ”
Another committee member , Rep. Donald F. Humason , R - Westfield , said he is not convinced that a medical marijuana law would be a panacea for people with certain illnesses .
Humason noted that a new law decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana in Massachusetts .
The law , which took effect in January of last year , replaces criminal penalties for possessing an ounce or less of marijuana with a civil fine of $ 100 , about the same as getting a traffic ticket .
Sixty - five percent of voters approved the ballot law on Nov. 4 .
“ There ’s some sense that ’s enough for the time being , ” Humason said .
An advocate for the medical marijuana bill , Marcy M. Duda , 49 , of Ware , said legislators are wrong for putting the bill into a study .
Duda , a retired home health aide and mother of four , said she uses marijuana with a vaporizer to inhale the drug .
She said marijuana helps her cope with surgery for aneurysms , headaches and depression .
“ It helps for everything , ” she said .
She said prescriptions such as OxyContin made her sick .
Former Gov. William F. Weld actually signed a medical marijuana law that took effect in 1992 and was later amended .
The law authorized a state certification program for people to use marijuana as a medication for certain conditions , but the law depended on the federal government supplying the marijuana through the National Institute of Drug Abuse , which grows marijuana in Mississippi for research purposes .
The federal government rejected supply requests from the state , said Matthew J. Allen , an organizer for the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance in Boston .
Fourteen other states have laws that give seriously ill patients safe and legal access to marijuana for medical reasons , including Rhode Island , Maine and Vermont , Allen said .
SANA'A
Hundreds of women clad in black `niqabs ’ demonstrated in front of parliament in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on 23 March .
Some were waving banners with the words : “ Yes to the Sharia [ Islamic legal ] rights of Muslim women ” , while others raised the Koran above their heads .
“ It is against Islam to set a minimum age for marriage , ” said Zeinab al - Sunaidar , 27 , a secretary from Iman University .
“ A girl can get married when she ’s an adult - for some girls that is when they are 15 and for others when they are nine . ”
The debate on early marriages has polarized Yemeni society .
Some cite religious texts as a justification not to set a minimum age .
Others say Islam does not advocate child marriages and that the negatives of children getting married far outweigh the positives .
What is the current legal age of marriage ?
Prior to the unification of Yemen in 1990 , the law set the minimum age of marriage at 16 in South Yemen and 15 in the north .
After unification , the law was set at 15 .
In 1999 , the civil status law was amended and the minimum age was abolished .
However , according to Shada Mohammed Nasser , an attorney at the Supreme Court who has worked on several child bride cases , the law stipulates that a girl should not sleep with her husband until she is mature .
“ But the law is not enforced , ” said Nasser , citing the case of 12 - year - old Sally al - Sabahi , who was married at the age of 10 and was divorced on 27 March .

Astronomers have finally gotten a firmer grip on how supermassive black holes in the centers of most galaxies gobble up gas from their surroundings .
In a new study , two astronomers neatly explain how stars drag swirling gases toward a galaxy ’s center , bringing them close enough that the black holes can suck them in like water down a bathtub drain .
Although supermassive black holes wield an enormous tug on their immediate surroundings , astronomers have been uncertain how these astrophysical beasts manage to pull in the large amounts of gas they absorb from their host galaxies .
A key problem is that gas swirling rapidly around a black hole has enormous angular momentum , which creates a centrifugal force that can slow or halt the material from edging toward the abyss .
Generally , black holes easily swallow up gas that approaches to less than a third of a light - year from the galactic center , because the black hole ’s own magnetic field acts like a brake , slowing down the rotational motion of the gas and causing it to fall in .
At much larger distances – about 30 to 300 light - years from the center – disturbances from collisions with other galaxies and the gravitational interactions of matter within the galaxy can drive gas toward the central black hole .
But that still leaves a critical gap at intermediate distances between about one light - year and 30 light - years from the center , where nothing seems to reduce the rotational motion and centrifugal force of gas enough that the black hole can pull it in .
That ’s where new simulations by Philip Hopkins and Eliot Quataert , both of the University of California , Berkeley , come into play .
Their computer models show that at intermediate distances from a supermassive black hole , gas and stars form separate , lopsided disks that are off - center with respect to the black hole .
The two disks are tilted with respect to one another , the astronomers say in a paper posted online Feb.
5 at arXiv.org , allowing the stars to exert a drag on the gas that slows its swirling motion and brings it closer to the black hole .
The new work is purely theoretical .
However , the researchers note that observers have found evidence that the centers of several galaxies known to house supermassive black holes , notably the Milky Way ’s sister galaxy Andromeda , sport lopsided disks of elderly stars .
The off - center features in Andromeda have puzzled researchers for more than a decade .
Hopkins and Quataert now suggest that these old , off - center disks are the fossils of the stellar disks generated by their models .
In their youth , such disks helped drive gas into black holes , they say .
The new study “ is interesting in that it may explain such oddball [ stellar disks ] by a common mechanism which has larger implications , such as fueling supermassive black holes , ” says Tod Lauer of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson .
“ The fun part of their work , ” he adds , is that it unifies “ the very large - scale black hole energetics and fueling with the small scale . ”
Off - center stellar disks are difficult to observe because they lie relatively close to the brilliant fireworks generated by supermassive black holes .
But searching for such disks could become a new strategy for hunting supermassive black holes in galaxies not known to house them , Hopkins says .

“ Do they understand what this is doing to their own party ? ”
The question has been asked a hundred times by readers , family members , and friends — all of whom are dumbfounded that the DNC seems so willing to destroy itself over health care .
Why , when every political cliché suggests that self - preservation is job one , are congressional Dems ready to sacrifice themselves on the ObamaCare altar ?
Clearly , the prevailing wisdom says they know exactly how bad things are going to get , so why do it ?
The question was answered the other night , when a rambling , wild - eyed Nancy Pelosi appeared on the Rachel Maddow show .
As I listened to the speaker , I was reminded of the early portion of “ The Grapes of Wrath , ” where a family of destitute pickers was being told of the wonders awaiting them in California .
“ Think of an economy , ” Pelosi said , “ where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance — or that people could start a business and be entrepreneurial and take risk , but not job loss because of a child with asthma or someone in the family is bipolar . ”
Maddow maintained her air of jovial superiority , happily calling the Speaker ’s description , “ The pro-health care reform stance , one of the best , put as well as I think I ’ve heard anybody put it . ”
I could point out that , if that ’s the best anybody ’s managed to “ put it , ” it ’s little wonder Nancy ca n’t find the votes .
Her health care pledge is the same empty promise that her party has been making , about literally everything , since they began selling us Obama in the early days of 2008 .
He was going to change America .
He would create a friendlier , happier , more prosperous country .
Things were going to be different .
We ’d have peace throughout a world in which our stature had been restored .
Hope was coming .
Change was coming .
In Tom Joad terms , the oranges were supposed to fall right off the trees and into our baskets .
Once we got to the California of an Obama election , there ’d be work and respect for everyone , while the horrible dustbowl of the Bush administration would be left behind .
Obama ’s rookie season showed the world that , while he ’s a fantastic hype - machine , his throne was built on a mountain of promises he had no intention of keeping .
Most of them , like his “ sweeping tax cuts , ” were made in direct opposition to his own intentions .
Over the course of the year , it became increasingly clear that people were not getting what they ’d expected from an Obama presidency .
The more obvious the lies became , the deeper the sense of betrayal grew .
Obama ’s decision to force health care on the American people is now widely recognized as the willful , hubristic stance of a narcissistic man whose ego controls his office .
It ’s overwhelmingly opposed , and the more Congress tries to push the plan , the worse Democrat poll numbers get .
Now they ’re faced with an election year nightmare , and an unavoidable November bloodbath .
To get back to the point , “ Do they understand what this is doing to their own party ? ”
I used to think they did .
I was of the opinion that they knew how bad it was going to be , but did n’t care .
Their mission was to tear the country apart , and nothing , not even their own party , was beyond sacrifice .
Now , I know I was wrong .
Democrats have no idea how much damage they ’re doing to themselves because they honestly believe that they ’ll be able to rein - in the PR monster they ’ve created .
Make no mistake , their goal is to shred the Constitution , tear down the country , and “ rebuild it from its foundations ” as a Mecca for socialist statists .
They have no intention of allowing the American people to interfere with the plan .
If they believed it was necessary , they might , temporarily , sacrifice some of their power to achieve the goal .
They just do n’t think they ’ll have to .
They honestly believe that once health care is passed , the “ great unwashed ” will fall back in line and gleefully suck up whatever slop they ’re fed .
When the dust settles , Pelosi , Reed , and Obama think they ’ll have enough skill to spin this into a success story — to make you take your medicine , and like it .
They ’ll buy the American people , as they have so many times before , with another round of glorious promises .
It ’s a miscalculation of monumental proportions .
What they fail to comprehend is that there ’s not enough spin in the world to turn this mess around .
There ’s no promise they can make that the people can trust and , as a result , even their ardent supporters are abandoning them .
It ’s a lesson they should have learned from their failures throughout the last year .
They should have learned it again from the Scott Brown election .
They have n’t .
Just like the migrant pickers , who made the trek to California only to be rewarded with shantytowns and beatings , the nation has come to see the Obama administration as a trap .
The “ rabble ” is fed up .

Why Do Dogs Howl at ' Law & Order ' Song ?
Owners post YouTube videos of dogs howling to " Law & Order " theme song .
Feb. 25 , 2010  --
Eight - year - old Knuckles may not be the most talented pooch , but there is one the thing the Jack Russell Terrier can do without fail .
Whenever he hears the " Law & Order " theme song , his ears perk up and he starts to whimper , then he lifts up his head and chimes right in , singing along to the music with a full - blown wail .
" He 's not the brightest dog in the world , but he has this one talent , " said his owner , Daniel Serna of Los Angeles .
" It 's just a funny thing he 'll do and he 'll do it for a room full of people . "
Serna said he noticed it right after he brought Knuckles home years ago .
" The first time he saw the show , he started howling along to it and we just started busting up , " he said .
About a year ago , Serna and his wife posted a video of one of his dog 's performances to YouTube .
That video , " Knuckles The Dog Singing to Law and Order , " has nearly 10,000 views .
Asked if he was aware of Knuckles ' budding Internet fame , Serna was astonished .
" No… Really ? " he asked .
" Oh , my God .
That 's great . "
But it turns out Knuckles ' performance is n't so unique , and in fact , it may be nothing more than an involuntary reaction -- and the next YouTube phenomenon .
Could Howling Dogs Be Next Internet Sensation ?
Much like the recent fascination with the piano - playing cat , a crop of YouTube videos featuring dogs howling along with the " Law & Order " theme song has gained popularity online .
A YouTube search for " Law & Order + dog " generates at least several dozen videos of " singing " dogs like Knuckles .
Serna said that when he and his wife posted the video of Knuckles they had no idea that they had company , and some of the videos were posted as many as three years ago .
But as blogs picked up on the unusual doggie dance over the last few days , more owners posted videos of their crooning canines .
A video called " Logan The Poodle Sings to Law & Order Theme " has attracted 36,359 views , and another , " Tug 's reaction to Law & Order intro , " has more than 19,000 views .
The videos show dogs of every size whining , whimpering and wailing as the " Law & Order " theme song pipes through in the background .
More recent videos feature owners trying to see what happens when they play the song for their own dogs .
But why do some hounds howl when they hear this particular theme song ?
Veterinary neurologist Susan Wagner said that , though she was n't familiar with formal research on the topic , it likely has to do with the higher - register notes in the distinctive theme song .
" Cats and dogs generally do n't like hearing high - pitched sounds , " she said , adding that dogs often howl to sirens and other higher - toned sounds .
Dogs , Cats Don't Like High - Pitched Sounds
Wagner recently co-authored a book titled " Through a Dog 's Ears , " which explores sounds that can improve dogs ' health and well - being .
Her research behind it showed that lower tones and simple music calm canines .
" Different types of music affect dogs from a behavioral standpoint , " she said .
Classical music arrangements , for example , especially those with lower tones , slower tempos and less complexity , reduce anxiety , she said .
The higher - pitched , upbeat and complex " Law & Order " theme song could have the opposite effect .
" That would be my hypothesis , " said Wagner .
Though the research has n't been conducted , she said , based on the reverse finding regarding the lower tones , it seems likely .
But , she added , " I 'd hate to do that to them . "
For his part , the creator of the " Law & Order " theme song , Mike Post , said he never expected dogs would be " humming along with my tunes . "
" I can't believe it .
This is the craziest thing I 've ever seen in my life ! "
Post told the New York Post .
" They 're not running away from it , they 're singing along with it , " he continued .
" If somebody notices my music and appreciates it , I 'm happy -- and if those are very happy canines , I 'm happy . "
Failing US financial institutions must face the credible threat of government closure if reforms are to succeed , a key adviser to President Barack Obama said Tuesday .
Paul Volcker , a former Federal Reserve chairman , said reforms being discussed by Congress hit on the “ essential elements ” of financial reform , but that a strong government arbitrator must emerge with the power to wind down firms .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There is a clear need for a so - called resolution authority , ” Volcker told members of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , a Washington - based think tank .
Volcker said that massive government bailouts of insurance giant AIG and other non-bank firms had raised expectations of a government safety net , which could deaden fear of failure and create a so - called “ moral hazard . ”
“ There is an expectation that very large and complicated financial institutions will not be allowed to fail , ” Volcker said .
“ Unless that conviction is shaken , the natural result is that risk taking will be encouraged and in fact subsidized … and we may be headed full speed into the next crisis some years ahead .
“ That seems to me to be the core challenge of financial reform . ”

While Volcker said the government should have the power to step in to bolster banks if needed , “ ultimately the failing firm should be liquidated or merged .
In all … it is a death sentence , not a rescue at the hospital . ”
Obama is pushing Congress to pass sweeping reforms of the financial sector , as he taps into public anger at the role banks played in spurring the worst recession in a generation .
The president on Tuesday again urged lawmakers to forge ahead when they return from recess on April 12 .

“ I look forward to the Senate taking action on this landmark legislation , so we never repeat the mistakes that led to this crisis , ” he said .
“ We must provide sufficient oversight so that reckless speculation or reckless risk taking by a few big players in financial markets will never again threaten the global economy or burden taxpayers . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Volcker has been at the forefront of Obama ’s efforts to provide that oversight , heading an influential economic recovery panel .
The former Fed chairman has advocated stopping banks from holding customers ’ deposits at the same time as making investments for their own gain — so - called proprietary trading .
Curbs on “ prop trading ” had been in effect since the Great Depression .
In 1933 Glass - Steagall Act prohibited commercial banks from underwriting corporate securities , or acting as brokerages .
ADVERTISEMENT
But the rules were overturned in 1999 , during the administration of president Bill Clinton .
In January Obama backed the “ Volcker rule ” against proprietary trading as “ a simple and common - sense reform . ”
Volcker , an octogenarian who headed the Fed from 1979 to 1987 , supported Obama during his Democratic bid for the presidency and subsequently was tapped to head the President ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board , an independent , nonpartisan body created to tackle the worst recession in decades .

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is nearing a deal that would allow it to benefit from a tax refund of as much as $ 1.4 billion , becoming the latest company to tap a little - noticed plank in an economic stimulus bill .
That law let companies apply losses from 2008 or 2009 against taxes paid in the previous five years , instead of the previous two years .
Failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual Inc. is eligible for about $ 2.6 billion in tax refunds , thanks to big losses in 2008 .
Now J.P. Morgan , which took over WaMu 's banking operations in September 2008 , is in discussions with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and bondholders about the refund .
According to people familiar with the talks , an agreement under discussion would let J.P. Morgan claim more than half of the total , to be held in an FDIC receivership as part of a larger settlement with bondholders .
J.P. Morgan could dip into that pot to satisfy certain claims related to WaMu 's collapse .
Many other companies have benefited from the 2009 tax - refund law already .
According to an analysis of securities filings by The Wall Street Journal , more than 250 companies have said they expect to get about $ 12 billion in federal tax refunds under the law .
That is only a partial list .
The Joint Committee on Taxation , a congressional committee , estimated the provision would cost $ 33 billion in its first year .

For as much of a public showman as Steve Jobs is , he is a notoriously private person , and his obsession with privacy clearly seeps into the culture at Apple where unannounced products are never talked about and product leaks are handled with utmost severity .
The latest and greatest product to emerge from Cupertino is the iPad , and naturally , all we know about it is what Apple has publicly disclosed to the public .
You would think that this would be enough to please Steve Jobs , but then again , Steve Jobs is n’t exactly your run of the mill CEO .
Last week , on February 4th , Steve Jobs reportedly visited the offices of both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal , presumably to discuss bringing newspapers and magazines to the iPad .
Rumor has it that Jobs even went out to an “ intimate dinner ” at a restaurant called Pranna with 50 New York Times executives to demo the iPad and discuss in further detail its capabilities .
Comically , Jobs was seen coming into the restaurant wearing what was described as “ a very funny hat – a big top hat kind of thing . ”
Jobs ’ interaction with the staff at the Wall Street Journal , however , was n’t nearly as whimsical .
While at the WSJ newsroom , Alan Murray , the Journal ’s deputy managing editor and executive editor of The WSJ Online , sent out the following tweet using the iPad .
When Steve Jobs got wind of Alan Murray ’s insubordination ( i.e tweeting ) , he reportedly became furious , leading Murray to delete the tweet shortly thereafter .
The tweet is still visible , however , thanks to the magic of Google ’s cache .
And to answer your question , Alan , your tweet looks unbelievably cool .
Valleywag went so far as to ask Murray to comment on what went down with his tweet and Steve Jobs , to which Murray simply replied , “ I would love to talk about this , but can ’t … I will say that Apple ’s general paranoia about news coverage is truly extraordinary – but that ’s not telling you anything you did n’t already know . ”
Paranoia seems to be an apt word choice .
We get that Apple likes to keep a tight lid on things , but stressing out over a harmless tweet is well into the realm of the absurd .
The deal was first announced in July of last year Microsoft 's plans to buy Yahoo's internet search and search advertising businesses have been cleared by both European and US regulators .
The European Commission ruled that the deal " would not significantly impede effective competition " .
Under the deal , Yahoo's website will use Microsoft 's Bing search engine , and the two firms will share the revenues .
Microsoft is seeking to increase its share of the search engine industry , which is dominated by Google .
It and Yahoo first announced the planned tie - up in July of last year .
' Stronger competitor '
In explaining its decision , the Commission said that taken together , Microsoft and Yahoo currently have less than 10 % of the search engine market in Europe , with Google controlling 90 % .
This deal gives Microsoft a bigger slice of the internet advertising business , but it is still miles and miles behind Google
Chris Green of DMG Europe
The Commission said its investigation showed that the deal was expected to " to increase competition in internet search and search advertising by allowing Microsoft to become a stronger competitor to Google " .
In the US , the deal was also backed on Thursday by the Department of Justice .
Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said regulatory approval for the tie - up represented " an exciting milestone " .
" I believe that together , Microsoft and Yahoo will promote more choice , better value and greater innovation to our customers as well as to advertisers and publishers , " he added .
MICROSOFT Annual revenues of $ 58.44bn Annual net profit of $ 14.57bn 93,000 employees Yahoo chief executive Carol Bartz said the two firms would be creating a " breakthrough search alliance " .
However , technology analyst Chris Green of DMG Europe , said Microsoft had little hope of making much of a dent in Google 's search engine dominance .
" This deal gives Microsoft a bigger slice of the internet advertising business , but it is still miles and miles behind Google , " he said .
" Microsoft 's Bing is technically a very good search engine , but no - one uses it , and it does n't currently make a profit .
" The deal with Yahoo should turn it into a not - too - shabby and profitable world number two search engine .
But still no Google . "
Revenue sharing
Under the terms of 10 - year Microsoft - Yahoo agreement , Microsoft 's Bing search engine will power the Yahoo website , while Yahoo will in turn provide the main advertising sales team for Bing .
YAHOO Annual revenues of $ 6.46 bn Annual net profit of $ 598 m 13,900 workers
In exchange , Microsoft will retain 12 % of the search engine revenues generated via Yahoo's website for the first five years of the deal , while paying the remaining 88 % to Yahoo .
Microsoft and Yahoo said they would start to implement the deal " in the coming days " .
They said they would work with advertisers to make the transition as " efficient and seamless as possible " .
In 2008 , Microsoft offered $ 47.5 bn ( £ 30.4 bn ) to buy the whole of Yahoo , but its bid was turned down .

On Democracy Now ! with Amy Goodman , Nation writer Johann Hari discusses his recent article , " The Wrong Kind of Green . "
Hari reveals the misguided agenda of conservation groups who have sided with some of the worst polluters in the world .
The consequences of doing so have left them dismissing real - world solutions to global warming .
Ad Policy
" Why would these groups who are funded to some degree by ordinary good Americans concerned by these great crisis ?
Why would they be behaving this way ? " asks Hari .
" The only explanation that anybody could come up with is that they were taking money from the worst polluters in the world . "
Hari is joined by author of Green Inc. Christine MacDonald , who once worked with Conservation International and is referenced in Hari ’s piece .
From MacDonald ’s experience , she reports that in many ways , conservation groups have become like corporations themselves , siding with corporate giants and supporting their agenda in return for money .

ca. 2800 BC According to Isaac Asimov's Book of Facts ( 1979 ) , an Assyrian clay tablet dating to approximately 2800 BC was unearthed bearing the words " Our earth is degenerate in these latter days .

Bribery and corruption are common . "
This is one of the earliest examples of the perception of moral decay in society being interpreted as a sign of the imminent end .
634 BC Apocalyptic thinking gripped many ancient cultures , including the Romans .
Early in Rome 's history , many Romans feared that the city would be destroyed in the 120th year of its founding .
There was a myth that 12 eagles had revealed to Romulus a mystical number representing the lifetime of Rome , and some early Romans hypothesized that each eagle represented 10 years .
The Roman calendar was counted from the founding of Rome , 1 AUC ( ab urbe condita ) being 753 BC .
Thus 120 AUC is 634 BC . ( Thompson p.19 )
389 BC Some Romans figured that the mystical number revealed to Romulus represented the number of days in a year ( the Great Year concept ) , so they expected Rome to be destroyed around 365 AUC ( 389 BC ) .
( Thompson p.19 )
1st Century Jesus said , " Verily I say unto you , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . "
( Matthew 16:28 ) This implies that the Second Coming would return within the lifetime of his contemporaries , and indeed the Apostles expected Jesus to return before the passing of their generation .
ca. 70 The Essenes , a sect of Jewish ascetics with apocalyptic beliefs , may have seen the Jewish revolt against the Romans in 66 - 70 as the final end - time battle .

2nd Century
The Montanists believed that Christ would come again within their lifetimes and establish a new Jerusalem at Pepuza , in the land of Phrygia .
Montanism was perhaps the first bona fide Christian doomsday cult .
It was founded ca. 156 AD by the tongues - speaking prophet Montanus and two followers , Priscilla and Maximilla .
Despite the failure of Jesus to return , the cult lasted for several centuries .
Tertullian , who once said " I believe it just because it is unbelievable " ( a true skeptic if ever there was one ! ) , was perhaps the most renowned Montanist .

247 Rome celebrated its thousandth anniversary this year .
At the same time , the Roman government dramatically increased its persecution of Christians , so much so that many Christians believed that the End had arrived .

Firmly established already in his early years , he will , after reaching maturity , achieve supreme power . "
( Abanes p.119 )
500 Roman theologian Sextus Julius Africanus ( ca. 160-240 ) claimed that the End would occur 6000 years after the Creation .
He assumed that there were 5531 years between the Creation and the Resurrection , and thus expected the Second Coming to take place no later than 500 AD .
( Kyle p.37 , McIver # 21 )
Hippolytus ( died ca. 236 ) , believing that Christ would return 6000 years after the Creation , anticipated the Parousia in 500 AD .

( Abanes p.283 , McIver # 15 )
Apr 6 , 793 Elipandus , bishop of Toledo , described a brief bout of end - time panic that happened on Easter Eve , 793 .
According to Elipandus , the Spanish monk Beatus of Liébana prophesied the end of the world that day in the presence a crowd of people .
The people , thinking that the world would end that night , became frightened , panicked , and fasted through the night until dawn .
Seeing that the world had not ended and feeling hungry , Hordonius , one of the fasters , quipped , " Let 's eat and drink , so that if we die at least we 'll be fed . "
( Abanes p. 168-169 , Weber p.50 )
800 Sextus Julius Africanus revised the date of Doomsday to 800 AD . ( Kyle p.37 )
Beatus of Liébana wrote in his Commentary on the Apocalypse , which he finished in 786 , that there were only 14 years left until the end of the world .
Thus , the world would end by 800 at the latest .
( Abanes p.168 )
806 Bishop Gregory of Tours calculated the End occurring between 799 and 806 . ( Weber p.48 )

Mar 25 , 970 Lotharingian computists foresaw the End on Friday , March 25 , 970 , when the Annunciation and Good Friday fell on the same day .
They believed that it was on this day that Adam was created , Isaac was sacrificed , the Red Sea was parted , Jesus was conceived , and Jesus was crucified .
Therefore , it naturally followed that the End must occur on this day !
( Source : Center for Millennial Studies )
992 Bernard of Thuringia calculated that the end would come in 992 .
( Randi p.236 )
995 The Feast of the Annunciation and Good Friday also coincided in 992 , prompting some mystics to conclude that the world would end within 3 years of that date .
( Weber p.50 - 51 )
1000 There are many stories of apocalyptic paranoia around the year 1000 .
For example , legend has it that a " panic terror " gripped Europe in the years and months before this date .
However , scholars disagree on which stories are genuine , whether millennial expectations at this time were any greater than usual , or whether ordinary people were even aware of what year it was .
An excellent article on Y1 K apocalyptic expectations can be found at the Center for Millennial Studies .
( Gould , Schwartz , Randi )
1033 After Jesus failed to return in 1000 , some mystics pushed the date of the End to the thousandth anniversary of the Crucifixion .
The writings of the Burgundian monk Radulfus Glaber described a rash of millennial paranoia during the period from 1000 - 1033 .

1306 In 1147 Gerard of Poehlde , believing that Christ 's Millennium began when the emperor Constantine came to power , figured that Satan would become unbound at the end of the thousand - year period and destroy the Church .

ca. 1504 Italian artist Sandro Botticelli wrote a caption in Greek on his painting The Mystical Nativity :
" I Sandro painted this picture at the end of the year 1500 in the troubles of Italy in the half time after the time according to the eleventh chapter of St. John in the second woe of the Apocalypse in the loosing of the devil for three and a half years .
Then he will be chained in the 12th chapter and we shall see him trodden down as in this picture . "
Apparently , he thought he was living during the Tribulation , and that the Millennium would begin in three and a half years or so , which is understandable given the fact that he is known to have been a follower of Girolamo Savonarola .
( Weber p.60 )
Feb 1 , 1524 The End would occur by a flood starting in London on February 1 ( Julian ) , according to calculations some London astrologers made the previous June .
Around 20,000 people abandoned their homes , and a clergyman stockpiled food and water in a fortress he built .
( Sound familiar ?
It 's just like the doomsday cultists and Y2 K nuts of today ! )
As it happened , it did n't even rain in London on that date .
( Randi p.236-237 )
Feb 20 , 1524 A planetary alignment in Pisces was seen as a sign of the Millennium by astrologer Johannes Stoeffler .

Not unlike the Christian Coalition of modern - day America ! ( Kyle p.67 )
1658 In his The Book of Prophecies , Christopher Columbus claimed that the world was created in 5343BC , and would last 7000 years .
Assuming no year zero , that means the end would come in 1658 .
Columbus was influenced by Pierre d'Ailly .

1666 As this date is 1000 ( millennium ) + 666 ( number of the Beast ) and followed a period of war and strife in England , many Londoners feared that 1666 would be the end of the world .
The Great Fire of London in 1666 did not help to alleviate these fears .
( Schwartz p.87 , Kyle p.67 -68 )
Sabbatai Zevi recalculated the coming of the Messiah to 1666 .

Fall 1694
Drawing from theology and astrology , German prophet Johann Jacob Zimmerman determined that the world would end in the fall of 1694 .
Zimmerman gathered a group of pilgrims and made plans to go to America to welcome Jesus back to Earth .
However , he died in February of that year , on the very day of departure .
Johannes Kelpius took over leadership of the cult , which was known as Woman in the Wilderness , and they completed their journey to the New World .
Fall came and went and , needless to say , the cultists were profoundly disappointed at having traveled all the way across the Atlantic just to be stood up by Jesus .

When an actor and a character gel , there is magic on the screen .
Unfortunately , some casting decisions leave us scratching our heads in wonder .
It ’s not necessarily a question of bad acting , although this is the case sometimes .
Here is a list of roles that were too much of a stretch .
10 . Geronimo
1962
Directed by Arnold Laven
Chuck Connors as Geronimo
At 6 ’ 5 ’’ , Chuck Connors had a physical presence and an athletic build .
Audiences knew him from a number of roles in TV westerns .
This time , he was the Apache leader , Geronimo , who tries to keep his people free and out of the reservation .
He has the toughness of a warrior but rubbing something on his face and letting him loose in the dress up box fails to make him an Apache .
He just looks like a longhaired quarterback about to make a touchdown .
He leads with his jaw but he still has piercing blue eyes and he ’s still from Brooklyn .

9. Days of Thunder
1990
Directed by Tony Scott
Nicole Kidman as Dr Claire Lewicki
Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise fell in love on the set of this homage to the exciting world of NASCAR .
Cruise plays a headstrong driver and Kidman is his love interest , who just happens to be a leading brain surgeon .
This begs the question , does n’t she look a little young to be a leading anything , never mind a medical professional ?
There ’s supposed to be the brain of a neurosurgeon under the appalling 1980s perm .
She looks like she ’s thinking about boys or shoes or earrings or something equally frivolous , and it ’s hard to take her seriously .
Would she really be able to save our Tom if he crashed and his brain fell out and she had to operate in an emergency ?
Also , she rides a motorcycle without a helmet , surely a faux pas for a brain surgeon ?
8. Comanche Blanco
1968
Directed by José Briz Mendez
William Shatner as Johnny Moon / Notah
Shatner took a hiatus from being Captain Kirk to play dual roles in this low budget western , filmed in Spain .
Johnny Moon is a cowboy and Notah is his Indian half brother .
They are bitter enemies and Shatner has to fight himself ( he also has to do this in the Star Trek episode Whom Gods Destroy ) .
The dialogue is poor and badly dubbed .
As Johnny , Shatner is perfectly fine , but the Indian with short , blond hair and a bit of war paint is not so convincing .
Notah is like an over the top version of The Shat .
He rides around shirtless and says deep things like the dead will find their place .
Chewing too much peyote could be a contributing factor to this philosophizing .
Thankfully , Shatner tied up his horse and returned to the Enterprise .
It ’s still not as cringe worthy as his cover of Dylan ’s Mr. Tambourine Man , because nothing is .
7. The Conqueror
1956
Directed by Dick Powell
John Wayne as Tem Ujin – later Genghis Khan
We are used to seeing the Duke as a cowboy taking care of the bad guys or as a soldier single - handedly winning the war .
However , this story charts the rise of Tem Ujin , who became Genghis Khan , founder of the Mongol Empire .
Tem Ujin must do battle and try to win his beloved ’s heart .
The dialogue is stilted but the epic battle scenes are well executed .
William Conrad ( Jake and the Fatman ) played Wayne ’s brother .
Wayne said that he played Khan like another gunfighter and the movie was really a western .
Let ’s face it ;
Wayne played everything like it was a western .
That was part of his charm , but when you cast him as a Mongolian warrior , he still looks and sounds like Wayne and he maintains his distinctive drawl .
There was a slight attempt to make Wayne look Asian in that they altered his eyes slightly .
They also gave him a sword and a funny helmet but he ’s a Mongol by way of Iowa .
6. The Greatest Story Ever Told
1965
Directed by George Stevens
John Wayne as a Roman Centurion
Max von Sydow took the role of Christ in this biblical epic .
In an ensemble cast that included Charlton Heston as John the Baptist and Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate , the appearance of Wayne as a centurion in the crucifixion scene is jarring , to say the least .
As Christ suffers on the cross , what should have been a moving scene descends into farce , as the Duke drawls his line , ‘ truly , this man was the son of Gaaard ’ .
5 . The Teahouse of the August Moon
1956
Directed by Daniel Mann
Marlon Brando as Sakini
It is politically incorrect today to cast a Caucasian actor as someone of color , but it used to be common practice ( Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany ’s is just one other example ) .
Along with the ignominy , the choice of Brando to play a Japanese interpreter was a daring one .
One of the finest actors to grace the screen , Brando acts the clown as Sakini in a satirical story about relations between the Japanese and the American forces in the aftermath of WWII .
The film has its amusing moments and Glen Ford is his usual , excellent self but Brando looks like a cartoon character and a grinning doll .
It comes across as oh , so patronizing .
4. Behind Enemy Lines
2001
Directed by John Moore
Owen Wilson as Lt. Chris Burnett
Set in war - torn Bosnia , this is a kick - ass action flick starring Wilson as a Navy flight navigator shot down over enemy territory .
The action is fairly engaging but the attempts at humor are lame and it ’s a hackneyed script .
Gene Hackman plays the commanding officer intent on bringing his boy home to safety .
It is n’t as suspenseful as it should be partly because Wilson is n’t convincing .
He ’s more suited to being a laid back dude than someone fighting for survival .
He always looks like a puppy .
An alternate casting choice would have made it grittier and when is he going to get his nose fixed ?
3 . The Black Shield of Falworth
1954
Directed by Rudolph Maté
Tony Curtis as Myles Falworth
Tony Curtis proved himself to be a great actor when he was allowed to stretch himself in The Boston Strangler and The Sweet Smell of Success , but a kid from the Bronx was never going to pass himself off as an English knight in the time of King Henry IV .
The miscasting makes it an entertaining yarn in fact and Curtis is very watchable .
Highlight of the movie is the famous quote , ‘ yonduh lies duh castle of my fadduh ’ .

2. The World Is Not Enough
1999
Directed by Michael Apted
Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones
Denise Richards is famous for her on and off screen relationships : she paired up with Neve Campbell onscreen in Wild Things and had a volatile off screen marriage to Charlie Sheen .
She also has a long sitcom history , appearing in : Spin City , Melrose Place , Friends , Two and a Half Men , and Seinfeld .
She has appeared in Playboy at least twice and most recently , she had her own reality show .
Not the most serious body of work .
So perhaps that ’s why her portrayal of Doctor Christmas Jones won her a Razzie ( “ the foremost authority on all things that suck on the big screen ” ) for worst supporting actress .
It ’s not surprising that audiences found it difficult to believe Richards in the role of “ tough American nuclear physicist . ”
More surprising ?
The unquestionably attractive Denise Richards and Pierce Brosnan were also nominated for the “ worst screen couple ” Razzie .
While they rush to recapture and disarm a nuclear warhead and disarm it , their lack of onscreen chemistry is anything but explosive .
Yes , we expect Bond films to be campy – that ’s what we like about them .
We also expect the Bond women to be smoking hot and Richards ’ performance in this flick is uncharacteristically cold .
It also does n’t take a brain scientist to figure out that casting Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist is just silly .
1. Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves
1991
Directed by Kevin Reynolds
Kevin Costner as Robin Hood
When Hollywood studios insist on shoehorning in an American actor to star in a quintessentially English film , it is really annoying to the Brits .
OK , Errol Flynn was an Aussie but he was a lot more convincing , plus there is the added insult of Christian Slater as Will Scarlett and Michael McShane as Friar Tuck .
Morgan Freeman was cast too but that man can play anything .
It ’s doubtful that Robin Hood , if he ever existed , was quite so clean cut as Mr. Costner .
He is perfectly groomed despite living rough in the forest .
He makes no attempt at a suitable accent and he does n’t appear to have any sense of impending danger .

John Dennis sits in the back room of Perry 's in Pacific Heights , reflecting aloud over a cup of tea on the personal liberties he believes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stripped from him .
In blazer and jeans , with silver hair and pale blue eyes that match the color of his shirt , Dennis more closely resembles a relaxing yachtsman than a thrower of political brickbats .
Do n't be fooled .
A self - declared " Tea Party " Republican , Dennis is mounting a challenge to Pelosi in the 2010 race for the Eighth Congressional District , representing most of San Francisco .
The Tea Party movement , an insurgency of the right 's radical fringe , was credited with helping buoy the upstart candidacy of U.S. Senator Scott Brown , who pulled off an upset over his Democratic opponent last month in left - leaning Massachusetts .
" I'm a fan of the tea parties , " says Dennis , a real - estate investor who actually participated in the very first tea party — a campaign event for Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul — in December 2007 .
" I like them .
I like what they 're doing .
I love the activism . "
Originally from New Jersey , Dennis is the son of a union - card–carrying longshoreman and Democratic Party activist .
In college , he discovered the tenets of classical libertarianism , and never looked back .
" In 1984 — of all years — I read Ayn Rand , " he says nostalgically .
Today , his federal policy prescriptions more or less hew to those first principles .
He wants to abolish the U.S. Department of Education and the Federal Reserve , and end America 's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It has been firmly established that many Tea Partiers are as crazy as shithouse rats .
A Field Poll released last month showed that 71 percent of those who identify with the movement in California entertain the theory that Barack Obama is a foreign citizen with a forged birth certificate , and thus ineligible for the presidency .
Dennis does n't drink that Kool - Aid , but neither does he apologize for the wild - eyed proclamations of his teabagging brethren .
" Look , I think it 's so simple for the media to brand and categorize people , " he says .
" I think there are raving lunatics on the left , too . "
As a practical matter , he acknowledges that unseating the most powerful woman in Congress will be an uphill struggle .
( Before the general election , Dennis also has to best Dana Walsh , a businesswoman who ran against Pelosi in 2008 , in the Republican primary . )
San Francisco politicos are n't exactly holding their breath for a Republican upset .
" I was shocked by Massachusetts , " San Francisco State political science professor Robert Smith says , " but I would have a heart attack if a Tea Party Republican beat Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco . "

There are a number of things you can do to improve your sleep , and to make sure that you are getting enough of it .
Adequate sleep is important for your health , happiness and for your sanity .
However , some of the tricks you can use to improve your sleep do n’t hold up as well if you are a new parent , trying to get the rest you need while caring for a newborn .
Sometimes you just ca n’t do all of the things you should when it comes to ensuring a whole night of uninterrupted sleep .
In situations that involve newborns , you actually need to come up with different strategies for getting better sleep .
You want to get good rest as a new parent , and here are 5 tips for getting the sleep you need :
Nap when your baby does :
You might have heard this before , but when you are faced with dirty dishes and a number of other chores , it suddenly becomes more tempting to skip the sleep and get something else done .
Do n’t .
When your newborn sleeps , you should , too .
You can clean or return phone calls at some other point , such as right after the baby has been fed and is content to sit in the bouncer chair for half an hour .
Get help :
Enlist the help of the rest of your family to help with keeping the house clean so that you do n’t have to resort to chores when you could be napping while the baby sleeps .
You can also check into the costs of hiring a mother ’s helper or a babysitter to help with household chores , or to watch the baby once or twice a week .
You can also get a little help from older children or a partner by having someone else take care of one or two feedings .
If you breastfeed , you can pump ahead of time .
It does n’t hurt for baby to learn to take feedings from others via bottle .
Do n’t immediately jump up when you hear the baby :
It ’s okay for the baby to cry for a few minutes before you pick him or her up .
Sometimes , after your baby starts sleeping most of the night , he or she will cry a little before re-settling and going back to sleep .
You do n’t need to hurry into the room at every noise .
Usually , it can wait a little bit .
Be up front about your sleep needs :
Talk to your partner about your sleep needs , and your health .
Be up front with how lack of sleep is affecting you , and see if you can work out some way to help you get the rest that you need .
This may include help from your partner on the weekends so that you can sleep a little to recharge , or help with a feeding so that you can nap .
Do n’t take on too much :
When you are caring for a newborn is not the time to add new responsibilities to your plate .
Instead , cut back .
Taking care of yourself and your new baby should be your main concerns .
Additionally , you want to have time with other children that you may have , so taking on new responsibilities could be a real problem .
Instead , learn to say “ no ” so that you can take care of the more pressing necessities in your life .
Having children is both challenging and rewarding .
Adequate sleep and some time for relaxation are necessary if you want to be able to better deal with the challenges so that you can , in the end , take good care of yourself and the rest of your family .

In VA , we hold snap elections 30 days later , whenever an office becomes vacant .
The incumbent in the 37th Senatorial , wingnut Ken Cuccinelli , won his race for Atty Genl in the Republican sweep last November .
That vacancy triggered a special for that seat , which our candidate , Dave Marsden , won narrowly a month ago .
But since he was the incumbent in a Delegate district , the 41st , that was a subset of the Senatorial district , the vacancy created when he moved up set off another special for his old seat .
This sort of cascading election series is typical here in VA , where , together with our practice of staggering state / local elections so that they occur in federal election off - years , means that we have 6 or 7 elections every year , whether we need them or not .
Our candidate , Eileen Filler - Corn , has now won by 42 votes , out of 11,528 cast .
This is within 0.5 % , so the state will pay for a recount , and the other side will probably ask for one , because the legislature has only twelve days left in session , and the recount would probably delay her seating long enough to deny our side Eileen 's vote this session .
Our victory does n't say anything new or unexpected about wider trends , because this one was expected to be close .
In a normal year , we would probably win the district fairly easily .
It was held by a Democrat , narrowly , this past November .
He was the four - year incumbent , but 2009 was a very bad year for us , with many incumbents in not - really - marginal Delegate districts dragged down by the negative coattails of the top of the ticket in the governor 's race .
In this special we just won , we no longer had incumbency advantage , but neither were we burdened with negative coattails .
Turnout is always low in these specials , and that helps the Republicans .
What balanced that out , and saved the seat for our side , was probably the ground game .
The Democratic committee here in Fairfax County is much more active than the other side .
We tend to swarm these specials from all over the county , because members from most of the county are not preoccupied with elections in their own areas , and are free to mob to the affected areas .
I IDed over 500 voters myself , so it 's mathematically possible , if a stretch , to imagine that I personally roped in those 42 votes we won by .

Do you ever have trouble motivating your team ?
They 're a smart and creative group ... sometimes .
When you give directions like , " Get more leads " or " Improve our social media campaigns " or even " Try harder " , you tend to get lackluster results .
You may even end up micromanaging , because no one seems to be on the same page and motivation has gone out the window .
Crack the whip all you want , but until you get on board with Edwin A. Locke 's goal - setting theory , you 'll continue to make this common and entirely fixable management mistake .
According to Locke , you 're not setting clear and specific goals for your team , which is crucial to motivating them .
Locke 's goal - setting theory also states that employees do best when goals represent somewhat of a challenge , which decreases boredom and kicks their internal motivation into high gear .
Learning more about Locke 's goal - setting theory can give you the tools you need to help your team perform their best and elevate your business growth .
Here 's what you need to know .
History of Locke's Goal - Setting Theory
Locke first published his initial thoughts and findings on goal - setting as a means of motivation in an article called " Toward a theory of task motivation and incentives " , which appeared in the May 1968 edition of Organizational Behavior and Human Performance .
Dr. Gary Latham was an early adopter of Locke 's theory , putting into practice among his own team and reaping the benefits .
Locke and Latham collaborated in the late 1980s to further develop the theory of goal - setting and feedback as key motivators for employees .
Ultimately , they co-authored a book published in 1990 called " A Theory of Goal Setting and Task Performance . "
Locke 's goal - setting theory is essential reading for small business owners and managers alike , as it unravels the mystery of motivation .
Since they were first introduced , his theories have experienced widespread application , to the extent where you may feel like many of his findings are obvious .
But at the time , Locke 's theories were groundbreaking .
The fact that most managers follow his method is a testament to its accuracy .
Locke's 5 Principles of Goal - Setting
True to the goal - setting theory itself , Locke and Latham clearly outline the necessary steps for creating a successful goal in the workplace :
Clarity Challenge Commitment Feedback Task Complexity
Here 's exactly how to use each principle to increase the chances of the goal being met :
1. Clarity of the Goal
First , the goal needs to be clear and specific .
Bring your KPIs into the picture for clarity .
What can you track in order to know when the goal has been met ?
Although there are exceptions , if a goal does n't have a trackable statistic , it 's either not clear enough or needs to be broken down into smaller goals .
A time limit helps clarify the goal as well .
For example , if you want to " improve your social media campaign , " do n't just say , " increase our followers " .
Tell your social media marketing team exactly what you want to see and when you want to see it .
For example , you might set goals like :
100 new Facebook followers in the next two weeks
A 5 % increase in Twitter followers over the next month
At least one Instagram post with 1,000 organic engagements in the next month
2. Creating Challenging Goals
Next , Locke 's goal - setting theory states that goals must be somewhat challenging in order to help employees feel intrinsically motivated .
The key is to find a balance .
If it 's not challenging enough , employees might feel bored .
On the other hand , if a goal represents too much of a challenge , employees might give up prematurely .
The level of challenge depends on the employee responsible for completing the goal .
One employee 's perfect challenge is another employee 's pure boredom .
You want your employees to push themselves out of their comfort zones a little bit in order for them to feel personal satisfaction when they complete the goal .
So if you know that getting 100 new Facebook followers in two weeks is no sweat for your team , shorten the deadline .
Or , increase the number of followers you want them to attract .
Although you really want them to try to achieve the goal , Locke states that it 's important that you do n't punish your team for not completing a challenging goal , because doing so is counterproductive and de-motivates your team .
3. Getting Employees to Commit to the Goal
The third principle of goal - setting says that employees need to fully commit to the goal in order to successfully achieve it .
While this does mean that self - discipline is needed to do the work and get things done , this principle primarily refers to personal buy - in .
Locke and Latham 's research indicates that employees are more likely to commit to a goal if they feel some autonomy about creating the goal .
In other words , simply assigning goals to your team members is n't as effective as collaborating with them or allowing them to create the goals themselves .
There will be instances when you need to assign goals for the sake of time or to simplify proceedings , but the more often you involve your employees in the goal - setting process , the more they will trust you and feel committed to assigned goals .
Start by collaborating as much as possible until you feel like employees have a good handle on creating clear and challenging goals .
Then , allow them to create their own goals , which you can review and approve in the initial stages .
4. Providing Feedback During Goal Completion
According to Locke , managers continue to play a crucial role in goal completion even after a clear , challenging goal has been set and the employee is committed .
At this point , the employees carry most of the load .
Locke 's theories support the importance of autonomy in the workplace , which advocates against micromanagement and encourages managers to give employees free rein to carry out goals in a way that makes sense to them .
But , distractions happen .
The manager 's job is to check in often to make sure the goal remains in sight and to provide feedback if it seems like the employee is trailing off course .
Give encouragement to assist with motivation , provide instructions if the employee seems at a loss for what to do next or clarify expectations if roadblocks occur .
Keep your feedback positive and solution - oriented .
Of course , you should also be open to feedback as well .
If the goal turns out to be far too challenging , your team should be comfortable telling you .
That way , you can make adjustments to future goals .
Schedule a regular feedback session to collect comments about goals and tasks , and maintain a high level of trust and respect with your employees so they can come to you with feedback at any time .
5. Evaluating Task Complexity
The fifth and final principle that Locke and Latham deemed crucial for goal - setting and motivation is task complexity .
While a goal needs to be challenging , it can't be impossible , or else the employee 's motivation will eventually sink to an all - time low .
Impossible goals occur when a manager has n't considered whether the employee has all the tools , training and resources to complete it .
For example , let 's say you want your social media team to generate a performance report .
Their job will be far easier if they have access to tools that give statistics about their accounts .
As a manager , it 's your responsibility to provide them with these tools , or else adjust your expectations .
Likewise , you can't expect someone who has n't been trained in creating a performance report to know exactly how to do it .
Nor is it fair to ask someone to take on a 10 - hour task when their 40 - hour workweek is already stuffed to the gills .
Make sure your employees have what they need , including the time , to complete the goal .
The only major thing they should have to do is to push themselves out of their comfort zone a little bit for that motivating sense of personal satisfaction .
Building on Locke's Theory : SMART
Once Locke published his groundbreaking theory in the late 60s , the door opened for other researchers to build on his theory .
One popular goal - setting method called SMART , first introduced in 1981 , may prove useful when tackling the " Clarity " and " Challenging " principles of goal setting .
SMART is an acronym that typically stands for :
Specific
Measurable
Attainable
Realistic
Time - based
As you can see , there 's some overlap between SMART and Locke 's goal - setting principles .
Attainable and realistic goals are challenging but not too challenging , and specific , measurable and time - based goals fall under the principle of clarity .
Some managers use SMART in conjunction with Locke 's principles of goal - setting because the acronym is easy to remember .
However , SMART only covers the first two principles of goal - setting , and all five are needed in order to maximize success .
Building Motivation With Small Wins
Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer also built on Locke 's theories to explore employee motivation .
Their 2011 book called " The Progress Principle " reinforces Locke 's principles of commitment , feedback and task complexity .
The authors ' research shows the importance of avoiding micromanagement and allowing autonomy among employees , which backs up Locke 's own findings .
According to Locke , autonomy seals in an employee 's commitment to a goal , and although feedback from the manager is important , it cannot take the form of micromanagement .
Amabile and Kramer also discuss how crucial it is for employees to have adequate resources to do their job .
But their major contribution to Locke 's research zeroes in on principle number two : challenge .
Amabile and Kramer 's research indicates that setting small , attainable goals is a great way to build up your employees ' confidence and motivation .
Thus , you can build the challenge alongside their motivation .
Starting out with bite - sized goals with relatively quick rewards can have great payoffs later .
Putting It Into Practice
Ready to start using Locke 's goal - setting theory in practice ?
You do n't necessarily need to give your team a slideshow presentation about each principle .
However , because you do want your employees to eventually enjoy autonomy while setting their own goals , you should spend some time explaining the first principle : clarity .
Work together with your employees to establish clear and challenging goals , and check in more often in the beginning to assess whether the challenge level was appropriate .
You also need to make sure you get feedback about the task complexity : do your employees have what they need to achieve these goals ?
Any gaps in your procedures or resources should come to the surface fairly quickly .
Romney is furious about the passage of Romneycare Obamacare .
Massie previews the 2012 race :
This is an unusual strategy but one forced upon him by a ) his actual record and b ) the temper of the Republican party and conservative movement .
All this trouble over one tiny bill he signed when Governor of Massachusetts !
Because Obamcare is , in the view of plenty of sensible observers , merely a souped - up version of the Romneycare Mitt signed into law in Boston - and that he boasted about during the 2008 campaign .
Back then it was a case of " I can fix health care because I 've done it in the Bay State " .
How times change .

If you do n't have a knife sharpening kit and you 're in between taking knives down to the cutlery store to get sharpened , you can put a little bite back into your knife with a coffee mug .
Photo by Rhett Maxwell .
Over at the site DIYLife they highlight a way to sharpen the edge of a knife using a coffee mug :
It 's true , the bottom of most ceramic coffee mugs have a flat , unglazed ring that is the perfect surface for giving that dull knife a quick sharpening .
Just run the blade across the bottom of the mug at a 45 - degree angle , working from the butt up near the knife 's handle to the tip .
Slide the blade downward in one direction , keeping your fingers out of the way as you work .

We 'd definitely stress that this is n't a perfect solution for continually sharpening your knives — if you want to sharpen your own knives the Spyderco Sharpmaker is an awesome at - home solution — but if you need to clean up the edge and buy yourself some more time before a proper sharpening , it 'll do in a pinch .

I stumbled across this YouTube video of former CNN reporter Charles Jaco during the Gulf War .
The rumor that the video was fake has been floating around the internet for some time .
Charles Jaco CNN 1990 Persian Gulf War
The poster on YouTube said , “ Google his name and read the results . ”
There were so many Google hits labeling this video fake , I thought I would save others some time searching for the answers .
At first glance , I thought the video had been faked , but after digging into it , they were really just shooting on the roof of the hotel at night .
What appears to be a studio blue screen is really just the color of the hotel where they were shooting .
Charles Jaco sent an email to several blogs that mentioned the video .
First the facts of the case : our coverage was on the roof of a hotel and military facility near the intersection of the two main runways at the Dhahran Air Base , Western Province , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
The plywood background was erected as a guard against sand and wind storms .
The clowning around on the video is just that .
We used black humor to deflect the tension of covering SCUD missile assaults .
If you look at 1:36 in the video , you can see what appears to be a small satellite dish .
Here is the frame , the bottom edge of the satellite dish is between the crewman ’s hand the wall just above the electrical cord .
Using a satellite dish outside makes sense ; inside a studio using a satellite dish does not make sense .
If there was any question if Jaco was really in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War , I think this video answers that question .
At two minutes in the video , you can tell its being shot outside .

eso1012 — Science Release
APEX Snaps First Close - up of Star Factories in Distant Universe
For the first time , astronomers have made direct measurements of the size and brightness of regions of star - birth in a very distant galaxy , thanks to a chance discovery with the APEX telescope .
The galaxy is so distant , and its light has taken so long to reach us , that we see it as it was 10 billion years ago .
A cosmic “ gravitational lens ” is magnifying the galaxy , giving us a close - up view that would otherwise be impossible .
This lucky break reveals a hectic and vigorous star - forming life for galaxies in the early Universe , with stellar nurseries forming one hundred times faster than in more recent galaxies .
The research is published online today in the journal Nature .
Astronomers were observing a massive galaxy cluster [ 1 ] with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) telescope , using submillimetre wavelengths of light , when they found a new and uniquely bright galaxy , more distant than the cluster and the brightest very distant galaxy ever seen at submillimetre wavelengths .
It is so bright because the cosmic dust grains in the galaxy are glowing after being heated by starlight .
The new galaxy has been given the name SMM J2135 -0102 .
“ We were stunned to find a surprisingly bright object that was n’t at the expected position .
We soon realised it was a previously unknown and more distant galaxy being magnified by the closer galaxy cluster , ” says Carlos De Breuck from ESO , a member of the team .
De Breuck was making the observations at the APEX telescope on the plateau of Chajnantor at an altitude of 5000 m in the Chilean Andes .
The new galaxy SMM J2135-0102 is so bright because of the massive galaxy cluster that lies in the foreground .
The vast mass of this cluster bends the light of the more distant galaxy , acting as a gravitational lens [ 2 ] .
As with a telescope , it magnifies and brightens our view of the distant galaxy .
Thanks to a fortuitous alignment between the cluster and the distant galaxy , the latter is strongly magnified by a factor of 32 .
“ The magnification reveals the galaxy in unprecedented detail , even though it is so distant that its light has taken about 10 billion years to reach us , ” explains Mark Swinbank from Durham University , lead author of the paper reporting the discovery .
“ In follow - up observations with the Submillimeter Array telescope , we ’ve been able to study the clouds where stars are forming in the galaxy with great precision . ”
The magnification means that the star - forming clouds can be picked out in the galaxy , down to a scale of only a few hundred light - years — almost down to the size of giant clouds in our own Milky Way .
To see this level of detail without the help of the gravitational lens would need future telescopes such as ALMA ( the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array ) , which is currently under construction on the same plateau as APEX .
This lucky discovery has therefore given astronomers a unique preview of the science that will be possible in a few years time .
These “ star factories ” are similar in size to those in the Milky Way , but one hundred times more luminous , suggesting that star formation in the early life of these galaxies is a much more vigorous process than typically found in galaxies that lie nearer to us in time and space .
In many ways , the clouds look more similar to the densest cores of star - forming clouds in the nearby Universe .
“ We estimate that SMM J2135 - 0102 is producing stars at a rate that is equivalent to about 250 Suns per year , ” says de Breuck .
“ The star formation in its large dust clouds is unlike that in the nearby Universe , but our observations also suggest that we should be able to use similar underlying physics from the densest stellar nurseries in nearby galaxies to understand star birth in these more distant galaxies . ”
Notes
[ 1 ] Galaxy clusters are among the most massive objects in the Universe kept together by gravity .
They are composed of hundreds to thousands of galaxies , which make up to only about a tenth of their total mass .
The bulk of their mass , which amounts to up to a million billion [ 1015 ] times the mass of our Sun , is composed of hot gas and dark matter .
In this case , the cluster being observed has the designation MACS J2135- 010217 ( or MACS J213512.10-010258.5 ) , and is at a distance of about four billion light - years .
[ 2 ] Gravitational lensing is an effect forecast by Albert Einstein ’s theory of general relativity .
Due to their gigantic mass and their intermediate position between us and very distant galaxies , galaxy clusters act as extremely efficient gravitational lenses , bending the light coming from background galaxies .
Depending on the cluster mass distribution a host of interesting effects are produced , such as magnification , shape distortions , giant arcs , and multiple images of the same source .

The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) telescope is a 12 - metre telescope , located at 5100 m altitude on the arid plateau of Chajnantor in the Chilean Andes .
APEX operates at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths .
This wavelength range is a relatively unexplored frontier in astronomy , requiring advanced detectors and an extremely high and dry observatory site , such as Chajnantor .
APEX , the largest submillimetre - wave telescope operating in the southern hemisphere , is a collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy , the Onsala Space Observatory and ESO .
Operation of APEX at Chajnantor is entrusted to ESO .
APEX is a “ pathfinder ” for ALMA — it is based on a prototype antenna constructed for the ALMA project , it is located on the same plateau and will find many targets that ALMA will be able to study in extreme detail .
ESO , the European Southern Observatory , is the foremost intergovernmental astronomy organisation in Europe and the world ’s most productive astronomical observatory .
It is supported by 14 countries : Austria , Belgium , the Czech Republic , Denmark , France , Finland , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom .
ESO carries out an ambitious programme focused on the design , construction and operation of powerful ground - based observing facilities enabling astronomers to make important scientific discoveries .
ESO also plays a leading role in promoting and organising cooperation in astronomical research .
ESO operates three unique world - class observing sites in Chile : La Silla , Paranal and Chajnantor .
At Paranal , ESO operates the Very Large Telescope , the world ’s most advanced visible - light astronomical observatory and VISTA , the world ’s largest survey telescope .
ESO is the European partner of a revolutionary astronomical telescope ALMA , the largest astronomical project in existence .
ESO is currently planning a 42 - metre European Extremely Large optical / near - infrared Telescope , the E - ELT , which will become “ the world ’s biggest eye on the sky ” .

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The US government ’s refusal to offer a legal rationale for using unmanned drones to kill suspected militants in Pakistan could result in CIA officers facing prosecution for war crimes in foreign courts , a legal expert has told lawmakers .
“ Prominent voices in the international legal community ” were increasingly impatient with Washington ’s silence on the CIA ’s bombing raids in Pakistan and elsewhere , Kenneth Anderson , a law professor at American University , told a congressional panel on Tuesday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lawyers at the US State Department and other government agencies were concerned the administration has “ not settled on what the rationales are ” for the drone strikes , he said .
“ And I believe that at some point that ill serves an administration which is embracing this , ” said Anderson .
The law professor said he believes the drone strikes are legal under international law , based on a country ’s right to self - defense , and urged the US administration to argue its case publicly .
President Barack Obama has spoken about taking the fight to the enemy and denying safe havens to extremists , and US officials privately tout the drone raids against Al - Qaeda and Taliban leaders along the Pakistan border as highly effective .
But the administration declines to discuss the raids openly and has yet to publicly declare the legal justification for hunting down terror suspects in Pakistan and around the world .

“ Now , maybe the answer is :
This is all really terrible and illegal and anybody that does it should go off to The Hague .
But if that ’s the case , then we should not be having the president saying that this is the greatest thing since whatever .
That seems like a bad idea , ” Anderson said .
The congressional hearing broached a sensitive subject that is usually discussed by lawmakers and officials in closed sessions out of public view .
Human rights activists and some legal experts charge the drone strikes in Pakistan , outside of a traditional battlefield , amount to extrajudicial executions .
ADVERTISEMENT
In written testimony , Anderson told the subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee that officials and legal advisers at the CIA or the national security council who create “ target lists ” could face possible charges abroad over the drone war .
“ It is they who would most likely be investigated , indicted , or prosecuted in a foreign court , as , the US should take careful note , has already happened to Israeli officials in connection with operations against Hamas , ” he wrote .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The reticence of the US government on this matter is frankly hard to justify , at this point , ” he added .
The American Civil Liberties Union last week filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit last week demanding the State Department and other agencies disclose the legal basis for carrying out assassinations overseas with unmanned aircraft .
The lawsuit asks for information on when , where and against whom drone strikes can be authorized , according to the ACLU .

Representative John Tierney , chair of the subcommittee on national security , said the drone war raised an array of unanswered questions , including “ if the United States uses unmanned weapons systems , does that require an official declaration of war or an authorization for the use of force ? ”
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump needed to make the first general election debate about his rival , Democrat Joe Biden .
Instead , as he so often does , Trump made it about himself .
The president set the tone from the start for one of the ugliest general election debates in recent memory , badgering Biden and repeatedly interrupting him .
Biden alternated between ignoring the president and growing visibly irritated .
Moderator Chris Wallace admonished and pleaded with Trump to allow his rival to speak .
Trump 's aggressive posture may have appealed to his most passionate supporters — a primetime display of the brashness he has brought to the Oval Office .
But by the end of the 90 - minute contest , it was unclear whether Trump succeeded in making up any ground in trying to expand his coalition or win over persuadable voters , particularly white , educated women and independents who have been turned off in part by the same tone and tenor the president displayed on the debate stage .
“ Trump brought the chaotic nature of his presidency to the debate stage , ” said Alex Conant , a Republican strategist .
“ He needed to knock Biden off his game , but he may have just reminded independent voters why they ’ve turned against him . ”
Indeed , if there were ever a debate that turned voters away from politics altogether , this was it .
Despite an array of complex and substantive issues on the debate agenda — a Supreme Court vacancy , the government 's response to the coronavirus pandemic , the nation 's reckoning over race and police brutality — the candidates ' dramatically different visions for the country were frequently overshadowed by their obvious disdain for each other .
What did break through likely were not the moments Trump was seeking .
The most striking exchange of the night came when he failed to condemn white supremacist groups .
And when prodded by Biden to address the Proud Boys , a male - only group of neo -fascists who describe themselves as “ western chauvinists ” and have been known to incite street violence , the president offered a puzzling response .
“ Proud Boys , stand back and stand by , ” Trump said .
There were also glaring gaps in Trump 's outlines for addressing the future of health care coverage in America and controlling the pandemic , which has killed more than 200,000 people in the U.S. this year .
He also refused to embrace the science of climate change , even as record wildfires rage in the West .
Among Trump 's political challenges throughout this tumultuous year has been leveling a sustained and consistent attack against Biden .
Some Republicans believe he has squandered many of the advantages of incumbency : the money and the months a sitting presidents can spend defining an eventual rival in the eyes of voters .
The result : With five weeks until Election Day and voting already underway in some key states , Trump has consistently trailed Biden in national polls .
Biden also holds a lead in some of the battleground states , although others appear to be significantly closer .
With time running out to change the trajectory of the race , Trump did arrive at the debate armed with an array of attacks on his opponent .
He challenged Biden 's effectiveness during his nearly five decades in Washington and tried to link his more moderate rival to the far - left flank of the Democratic Party .
He launched a barrage of unsubstantiated corruption charges against Biden 's son for work he did in Ukraine , as well as his addiction struggles , and he challenged Biden 's intelligence .
“ Do n’t ever use the word smart with me , " Trump said to the former vice president .
“ There ’s nothing smart about you . ”
Biden slapped back at the president 's attacks over and over using his own searing rhetoric , calling Trump “ a clown , ” “ a racist ” and “ a liar . ”
At one point when Trump kept interrupting , Biden charged , “ Will you shut up , man ? ”
To be sure , the lowbrow debate could hold risks for Biden , too .
His campaign needs strong turnout from young people , Black voters and Latinos — groups with lower turnout rates and in some cases , less enthusiasm for Biden — to turn his solid standing in polling into a victory in November .
There were few chances for Biden to make a cohesive case for why his agenda would have a transformative impact on their lives , in part because of Trump 's repeated interruptions .
Still , the former vice president appeared well aware of the need to look past Trump and speak to those Americans when the opportunity arose .
He labored at times to ignore Trump 's onslaught , instead speaking directly to the camera and the millions of voters watching at home .
He offered an olive branch to a deeply divided nation , vowing to be a president for those who support him and those who do n’t — a contrast to Trump , who has drawn a distinction between coronavirus deaths in blue states and red states .
When Trump tried to raise the unsubstantiated corruption charges against Biden ’s son , the former vice president said the issue was n’t his family or Trump’s .
Turning to the camera once again , he declared , “ It ’s about your family . ”
The president made no real attempts to speak to all Americans , particularly those who have vigorously opposed his presidency and see the prospect of a second term as a threat to the nation ’s democratic systems .
Nor did Trump spend any time reflecting on the Americans who have died this year from the coronavirus , insisting only that the tally would have been much higher if Biden had been president .
The end result appeared to leave few cheering , including some Trump allies , who privately suggested the president was too aggressive .
Publicly , however , some of his ardent supporters insisted Americans got what they wanted from the president .
“ Trump proved again why he is the best counterpuncher in American politics , " said evangelical leader Ralph Reed .
" It 's not always pretty , but it 's effective , and it's why Trump bested Biden tonight . "

OTTAWA — Three days after Canadians belted out “ O Canada ” to celebrate the nation ’s Olympic hockey win , Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives are asking whether the anthem should be changed .
The phrase “ In all thy sons command ” has some women calling for a gender - neutral version , Industry Minister Tony Clement says , citing an email from a constituent .
“ For 50 years ..... I ’ve listened to our anthem and felt excluded by the line , ” Tina Prietz , 60 , of Huntsville , Ont. , wrote to Clement .
“ Yes , you ’ve guessed it , I ’m female . ”
The Conservative government said in Wednesday ’s throne speech it will ask Parliament to examine the original wording of the anthem .
Officials said later a parliamentary committee will study whether the phrase “ In all thy sons command ” should be changed to “ Thou dost in us command , ” which the Prime Minister ’s Office says is the wording from the original version .
Harper aide Andrew MacDougall said the government does not have a view on the change .
Prietz said she was proud to see so many Canadians win gold medals and hear the national anthem during the Olympics , but added some of the words stick in her craw .
“ I would love to see the anthem slightly changed to ‘ In all of us command , ’. ” Prietz said .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff does n’t object to a more “ gender - sensitive ” anthem , but said the government should take serious steps to improve the status of women .
The anthem is based on lyrics penned in 1908 , and slightly altered in the 1980 National Anthem Act .
The original French version survives unaltered .

Django - Selector is a custom url pattern parser for Django whose API is based on Luke Arno ’s Selector for WSGI .
It is designed to simplify the writing and reading of url patterns by providing recipes for frequently used patterns .
Django - Selector ’s parser ignores classic regex based url patterns , so if you require the flexibility of regexes you need n’t jump through registration hoops for a one - off url pattern .
Using these named patterns in your urls .
py clarifies what they are matching as well as how they are matching it :
Here ’s an example of how a urls .py file might look when using django - selector :
from django.contrib import admin from django.conf import settings import dselector admin .
autodiscover ( ) parser = dselector .
Parser ( ) urlpatterns = parser .
patterns ( '' , ( r'admin /(.*) !' , admin . site .
root ) , ) urlpatterns += parser .
patterns ( ' myblog ' , ( r'blog/{page:digits} /' , ' list ' , {} , ' blog - list ' ) , ( r'blog/{slug: slug} / ' , ' detail ' , {} , ' blog - detail ' ) , ( r'archive / {year : year} / ' , ' archive ' , {} , ' blog - year ' ) , ( r'archive / {year : year} /{month : month} / ' , ' archive ' , {} , ' blog - month ' ) , ( r'archive / {year : year}/{month:month} /{day : day} / ' , ' archive ' , {} , ' blog-day ' ) , ( r'comment / post/{content_type:slug}/{id:digits}/' , ' comment_post ' , {} , ' comment - post ' ) , ) if settings .
DEBUG : urlpatterns += parser .
patterns ( ' django.views.static ' , r ( ' media/{path:any} ' , ' serve ' , { ' document_root ' : './ media /' } ) , )
The primary way of denoting url parts with django - selector ’s parser is via the named patterns syntax : {name : pattern} .
This is parsed into a regular expression looking roughly like :
'(? P< name > %s ) ' % ( pattern_definition )
Refer to the List of builtin named patterns for a description of all default patterns .
You may optionally leave out the pattern , which will match against the segment pattern :
( r'archive / {year}/{month:month}/{day}/' , archive , {} , ' blog - day ' )
Beyond these preprocessing steps , django - selector ’s parser .
patterns operates as the standard django.conf.urls.defaults.patterns .

A British teenager who reported a sexually explicit online conversation to authorities may have saved a 5 - year - old North Carolina girl from becoming a rape victim at the hands of her babysitter , according to a police report .
The 17 - year - old U.K. teen , who is not identified in police documents , came forward last week to report instant messages from North Carolina college student James Carroll as " disturbing , " the report states .
According to the teen 's statement , outlined in a probable cause affidavit obtained by ABCNews.com , Carroll , 20 , detailed his intentions of having sex with a young girl he was scheduled to babysit the following weekend .
The British authorities who received the complaint notified the U.S. Department of Justice who then reached out to the Cary Police Department , who on Feb. 25 arrested Carroll at his parents ' home .
The U.K. teen told police that she had been chatting with Carroll for the past three years after they met in an online gaming chat room .
The teen said that the conversations had only recently turned sexual after Carroll requested she send him nude pictures of herself , which she did , according to the affidavit .
The teen also admitted to police , according to the documents , that she had participated in online sex acts via a webcam with Carroll .
But when Carroll started " acting weird , " according to the teen 's statement to police , she became concerned .
" Basically , this guy is telling me he 's going to have sex with an innocent 5 - year - old girl that he babysat last night , " the teen 's statement reads .
" He said he [ was babysitting ] with a friend so he could n't do anything .
However , on Saturday night , he says he will babysit her alone , so he can have sex with her . "
Carroll had allegedly been planning to molest the young girl on Feb. 27 , just two days after authorities arrested him .
Calls made to Carroll 's home were not immediately returned , and when his mother , Brenda Carroll , was approached by ABC News ' Raleigh affiliate WTVD , she had no comment .
It was not immediately known if Carroll had retained an attorney .
British Teen May Have Thwarted Five - Year - Old's Rape
The teen also provided authorities with a copy of her online conversation with Carroll , which graphically details Carroll 's alleged intentions with the young girl .
Authorities confirmed that the screen name believed to be Carroll corresponds to an IP address at Carroll 's Cary , N.C. , home , and Capt .
Michael Williams of the Cary Police Department said a search of the home and three family cars turned up child pornography .
" It was very noble for this [ teen ] to do what she did , " said Williams .
" She did something we ask people to do every day and not very many people come forward with these types of conversations on the Internet .
" She very possibly led to the safety of this 5 - year - old , " he said .
Carroll has been charged with six counts of 2nd degree sex exploitation of a minor .
If convicted on all six charges , Carroll could be sentenced to 12 to 23 years in prison , said Williams .

Weniger Verkehrsunfälle durch Drogen : Freie Fahrt für Kiffer
Nur 0,1 Prozent aller Verkehrsunfälle werden wegen des Konsums illegaler Drogen verursacht .
Die Polizei konzentriert sich daher verstärkt auf Raser und Alkoholtrinker .
BERLIN taz | Die Polizei achtet nicht mehr so stark darauf , bekiffte Autofahrer aus dem Verkehr zu ziehen .
Im vergangenen Jahr wurden bei Kontrollen nur noch rund 2.200 Fahrten unter Drogeneinfluss festgestellt - das sind 18 Prozent weniger als im Jahr zuvor .
Polizeipräsident Dieter Glietsch sagte am Freitag , es komme immer wieder vor , dass die " Überwachungsintensität dem Verkehrsunfallgeschehen angepasst wird " .
Sprich : Weil Drogenkonsum immer seltener die Ursache für Unfälle ist , fahndet die Polizei weniger intensiv nach berauschten Fahrern .
Im vergangenen Jahr wurden laut Polizei in Berlin insgesamt 16.325 Menschen bei Verkehrsunfällen verletzt - 8,5 Prozent weniger als im Jahr zuvor .
Die größten Unfallursachen waren Fehler beim Abbiegen , Missachtung der Vorfahrt , überhöhte Geschwindigkeit und Alkoholeinfluss .
Nur 172 Unfälle - also 0,1 Prozent - führt die Polizei auf den Einfluss verbotener Drogen zurück .
Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr ist die Zahl um 26 Prozent zurückgegangen .
Daher konzentriert sich die Polizei stärker darauf , gefährliche Raser und betrunkene Autofahrer aus dem Verkehr zu ziehen .
Insgesamt starben im vergangenen Jahr 48 Menschen im Straßenverkehr : 19 Fußgänger , 11 Motorradfahrer , 9 Radfahrer und 9 Autoinsassen .
Seit 1950 gab es nicht mehr so wenige Verkehrstote .
Auch im Vergleich steht Berlin gut da : Nirgendwo sonst haben - gemessen an der Einwohnerzahl - weniger Menschen auf der Straße ihr Leben verloren , erläuterte Glietsch .
Besonders gefährdet bei Unfällen sind Radfahrer , da sie schlecht geschützt sind .
Fahrradfahrer verursachten hauptsächlich Unfälle , weil sie nicht sorgsam genug auf die Fahrbahn fuhren , zu schnell unterwegs waren oder die falsche Fahrbahn benutzten .
Sorge bereitet der Polizei , dass es immer mehr Unfälle mit Rentnern gibt .
Im Jahr 2009 waren es 13.300 Unfälle - knapp 500 mehr als im Vorjahr .
Jeder zweite Verkehrstote war älter als 64 Jahre .
Es sei immer wieder zu beobachten , dass ältere Menschen die Fahrbahn überquerten , ohne auf den Verkehr zu achten , sagte Wolfgang Klang , Sachgebietsleiter Verkehr im Polizeipräsidium .
Er wünschte sich :
Wer eine betagte Dame oder einen älteren Herrn scheinbar gedankenverloren am Fahrbahnrand stehen sieht , sollte ruhig mal fragen : " Kann ich Sie über die Straße bringen ? "
Iowa ’s right wing is pushing for a vote on same - sex marriage .
They ’re using a new tactic .
In their decision , the Iowa Supreme Court cited state laws such as the anti-bullying law that includes protections for LGBT students .
So two Republicans in the Iowa House , Jason Schultz and Matt Windschitl , now want to remove protection for LGBT students to pave the way for an anti-same - sex marriage vote .
They have filed the Exclude Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual & Transgender ( LGBT ) Students from Safe Schools Law .
Opponents of equality are showing just how desperate they have become .
If other tactics do n’t work , file a law that tells bullies to beat up LGBT kids .
Simply , incite violence to get their way .
From Instant Tea , the official blog of the It only stands to reason that any state that has gay marriage is going to be filled with wingnuts trying to overturn it , just as it stands equally to reason that any state Supreme Court ruling that protects LGBT students and people in general will be opposed by the same wingnuts who would seek to remove those protections .
Less Elton Johns and George Takeis and more Mathew Shepards !
Huzzah !
Is anyone else waiting for the divine word to come down from on high to herd the Republicans in the showers and break out the Zyklon B or is that a bit much ?
( You can learn a lot by lurking in the political forums on Craigslist . )
I have a confession to make .
I ’m addicted to Chatroulette , the buzz - generating Web site created by a Russian teenager that pairs anonymous strangers with each other in a video chat room .
For me , Chatroulette offers a welcome break from the daily digital footprints I leave across the Web on sites like Twitter , Facebook and Google Buzz , where every comment , tweet and “ like ” is tied back to my real - world identity .
Chatroulette is intended to be comfortably anonymous , and it also has the sheen of nostalgia .
It ’s reminiscent of my earliest encounters with the Internet – firing off messages about schoolwork and television shows in AOL chat rooms and chattering with my World of Warcraft guildmates about their families , jobs and weekend plans .
But now a service called Chatroulette Map , a mash - up of the site with Google Maps , is peeling back some of the anonymity of the users cruising through the site .
Chatroulette Map , which first bubbled up on blogs like Laughing Squid , grabs screenshots of people using the service and , using their IP address and geolocation tools , plots their location on a global map .
( Note : Some images may not be work - safe . )
On one hand , Chatroulette Map offers a riveting snapshot of the people who are trying out the service .
But on the other , it strips away some of the voyeuristic appeal of being able to peer into a random stranger ’s home and life without revealing much information about yourself .
Of course , playing Chatroulette is not without some risk .
My colleague Nick Bilton aptly described it as “ speed - dating tens of thousands of perfect strangers — some clothed , some not . ”
The upside to Chatroulette Map is that some of those users might think twice about getting unclothed , making the service more family friendly and less jarring for its users .
On the other hand , the service raises privacy concerns for people using Chatroulette .
A recent update on Chatroulette Map reads : “ We ’ve decided , at least for the time being , to hide I.P. and host information as some user - identifiable information was found in some entries . ”
I ’ve reached out to the creators of Chatroulette Map for comment and will update if they respond .
Nine people were wounded along a city block in southern Washington , D.C. , Tuesday night after shooters opened fire on a crowd , police said .
Metro Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the shooting prompted a lengthy police chase that ended in the arrest of three people .
Four officers were treated for minor injuries from an accident during the chase .
The victims who were shot near the 5000 block of South Capitol Street included six males and three females , and some were in very serious condition , Lanier said .
A tenth person was shot on nearby Galveston Street , but it was n't clear whether the two shootings were related .
Lanier decline to give more details , saying it was too early in the investigation .
However , she told reporters that , " We 've made a lot of progress to stop gang retaliation and violence and , in the end , if this ends up being some kind of gang retaliation then shame on all of us . "
Hello , welcome to a little thing called 750 Words
★ What is this site about ?
It 's about learning a new habit : Writing .
Every .
Day .
I 've long been inspired by an idea I first learned about in The Artist 's Way called morning pages .
Morning pages are three pages of writing done every day , typically encouraged to be in " long hand " , typically done in the morning , that can be about anything and everything that comes into your head .
It 's about getting it all out of your head , and is not supposed to be edited or censored in any way .
The idea is that if you can get in the habit of writing three pages a day , that it will help clear your mind and get the ideas flowing for the rest of the day .
Unlike many of the other exercises in that book , I found that this one actually worked and was really really useful .
I 've used the exercise as a great way to think out loud without having to worry about half - formed ideas , random tangents , private stuff , and all the other things in our heads that we often filter out before ever voicing them or writing about them .
It 's a daily brain dump .
Over time , I 've found that it's also very helpful as a tool to get thoughts going that have become stuck , or to help get to the bottom of a rotten mood .
750 Words is the online , future - ified , fun - ified translation of this exercise .
Here 's how it works :
★ All online and private
In the past , looking for a spare notebook was probably easier than looking for a computer .
Not anymore .
I do n't know if my hands even work anymore with pen and paper for any task that takes longer than signing a check or credit card receipt .
★ It 's not blogging or status updating
I 've tried writing my 750 words a day on Livejournal , Wordpress , PBWorks , Tumblr , and all of these other sites designed around putting content online .
It has n't worked for me .
I fear that I might accidentally forget to mark daily pages as private .
And it 's just weird having my private brain dumps out on various sites that are designed to be more social .
I do n't need to title my entries , or tag them , or enable comments , or any of that other stuff .
This is writing , and it 's online , but it 's not blogging , or Twittering , or Facebook status updating .
This is between you and you .
★ 3 Pages = 750 words
I looked this up .
250 words per page is considered to be the standard accepted number of words per page .
So , three standard pages are about 750 words .
Of course if 750 words.com had n't been available , I would 've totally found a way to prove that 249 words per page was the accepted standard .
It really just comes down to the fact that this amount of writing feels about right .
You can't just fart out 3 pages without running into your subconscious a little bit ... 750 words takes a bit of effort , and it never fails to get me typing things that I have wanted to articulate without realizing it .
And that 's the point .
Because 750 words is nothing to sneeze at , it 's also nice to have an easy way to know how many words you have to go .
This site of course tracks your word count at all times and lets you know when you 've passed the blessed 750 mark .
And it gives you a nice big screen to write on , automatically scrolls as you write ( like a typewriter ) , and automatically saves your writing as you go .
★ It 's fun
Every month you get a clean slate .
If you write anything at all , you get 1 point .
If you write 750 words or more , you get 2 points .
If you write two , three or more days in a row , you get even more points .
It 's fun to try to stay on streaks and the points are a way to play around with that .
You can also see how others are doing points - wise if you 're at all competitive that way .
How I see it , points can motivate early on , and eventually the joy of writing will kick in and you 'll be writing without any external motivation at all .
★ Learn about yourself in the process
For example , learn about how often you get distracted , and how fast you write .
Every day you write , you 'll get beautiful stats that analyze the feelings , themes , and mindset of your words .
Free -writing , in my opinion , is like a cheap , easy form of therapy that can improve the quality of your life in many ways .
If you 're interested in the connections between free - writing and meditation , read this article : Better than meditation .
★ It 's about writing , and getting into your brain
The rest are just tricks to help get us there .
★ Who made this ?
I did , and my wife Kellianne helps keep it running smoothly .

WASHINGTON — One - third of American adults are obese , according to new U.S. government figures released Wednesday , but the rate of increase seen in recent decades has slowed .
Figures from the National Center for Health Statistics showed 34 % of American adults age 20 and older were obese in 2007 - 08 while 68 % were considered overweight or obese .
In children ages 2 through 19 , 17 % were considered obese while 32 % were considered overweight .
Broadly , the figures are similar to rates seen in 1999 - 2000 .

PASSAGE of the new comprehensive health care reform bill by Congress may not be the “ game changer ” some joyful Democrats are declaring it to be , but it may at least herald a new game for the 2010 midterm elections .
When the president re-engaged on health care four weeks ago  making clear his own priorities , inviting Republicans to a forum at Blair House and relentlessly pressing his case against the villainous insurance companies  the public noticed .
Yet the Republicans were frozen in post -Massachusetts time , still reveling in Scott Brown ’s surprise victory in the Senate race , which they felt was the result of an arrogant Democratic Party trying to jam an unpopular health care plan down the throats of the American people .
The Republicans handed Senator Brown the party ’s weekend radio address on March 13 .
“ Rarely have elected leaders been so intent on defying the public will , ” he warned .
In a similar vein , the House minority leader , John Boehner , said last Saturday that , “ In a democracy , you can only ignore the will of the people for so long and get away with it . ”
Indeed , voters will have their say in November .
But the evidence shows that people were not sitting still as the politicians went into the final battle .
Four of the seven latest major public polls showed an increase in the numbers favoring the health care reform as it was being debated over the last few weeks .
Only one showed it losing ground .
The future of the project rests with the California Coastal Commission , a mighty and aggressively view - preserving state agency that has jurisdiction over most development near the coast ; it is expected to rule on the proposal this summer .

The mountain skirmish features both traditional adversaries — those who would like to live in remote areas and those who would like to preserve them — as well as new and increasingly visible foes : green on green .
On one side are conservationists and the state agencies charged with preserving public spaces , views and access .
On the other , Mr. Evans with his green building plans and U2 environmental credibility , enhanced with the blessing of Mark Massara , an environmental lawyer and former Sierra Club official .
“ Rather than fighting every project , ” Mr. Massara said , “ it ’s a much more prudent exercise to try and inspire other landowners to do things that are not only in the best interest of the environment , but also to protect the homes and enhance the values here . ”
Mr. Evans and his wife , Morleigh Steinberg , bought the five lots in 2006 with the Irish developer Derek Quinlan for $ 9 million .
The designer of the houses , Wallace Cunningham , said his goal was to make them emulate their natural surroundings among the butterflies and rattlesnakes a few miles above the Malibu town center .
He also wants to make them “ biographical , ” and to that end , he stayed with Mr. Evans , his wife and their two children to study how they live in their current Malibu home .
But the conservancy and residents in the canyon below want none of it .
They have complained most loudly about the 20 - foot - wide , 1,600 - foot - long access road , which they argue would be an eyesore and geologically unstable , and the 70,000 cubic yards of dirt required for the project .
Upsetting the ecosystem is also among the worries .
“ This is the biggest and most problematic development we have ever had here , ” said Lawrence Weisdorn , the president of the Serra Canyon Property Owners Association , which represents about 95 homeowners below .
Father Murphy may have molested as many as 200 boys while he worked at the school from 1950 to 1974 , according to the accounts of victims and a social worker hired by the Archdiocese of Milwaukee to interview him .
Mr. Geier said he first tried to tell the priest at his home parish in Madison , where he served as an altar boy , in 1966 when he was just 16 .
But the priest , he said , told him he did not want to hear about it , and to just forget about it .
He told another priest while he was still a teenager , and yet a third priest years later , after he married .
That priest , the Rev. Tom Schroeder , 72 , who led Masses for the deaf in Madison from 1970 to 1992 , said in an interview Friday that he remembered Mr. Geier ’s telling him about Father Murphy .
Father Schroeder said that he told a nun , who told another nun who was a dormitory supervisor at St. John ’s , but that the supervisor did not believe it and nothing ever came of it .
“ I assumed that if enough people told her , she would finally believe it , ” Father Schroeder said .
Internal church correspondence unearthed in a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and given to The New York Times , which made it public it this week , included a letter from the Rev. David Walsh , who served as a chaplain for the deaf in Chicago , saying that teenage students at St. John ’s had told him in the late 1950s about Father Murphy ’s abuse .
Father Walsh said he told Archbishop Albert Gregory Meyer of Milwaukee , who sent Father Murphy on a retreat and then put him back in the school to undo “ the harm he had done . ”
In the 1970s , a group of former students who were in a vocational rehabilitation program in Milwaukee began telling their hearing supervisors about Father Murphy , a sequence of events reported in two articles in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2006 .

Among the supervisors was John Conway , now the deputy administrator of workers ’ compensation for the State of Wisconsin .
Mr. Conway , the students and others collected affidavits from 15 to 20 former students about Father Murphy ’s violations .
They were granted a meeting with Archbishop William E. Cousins .
A hug can be the best motivational tool ever .
In this modern world , where connectivity options are more abundant than they have ever been before , it amazes me how alone we can still become .
People can actually became more isolated from society by utilising social networking , blogging tools and mobile communication apps .
I fear that Sci-Fi may actually be correctly predicting a future in which humanity operates and interacts totally via virtual , computer enhanced means .
An environment where Virtual Reality is the only reality we know .
( think eXistenZ , The Matrix or MindWarp )
To combat this is a very simple thing – We just need to keep up human contact and not be so scared of it .
Yes , it is true these days that you need verbal and written permission , 3 forms of ID and an officially approved government licence to Hug a stranger , but so what ?
Give it a go .
Hug someone and see what happens .
If nothing else , you and the other person will not be alone for a moment .

While we usually limit our focus to the traditional media in Australia , today ’s National Press Club address contained a piece of intellectual dishonesty so egregious that I simply could not let it pass .
Barnaby Joyce was asked where he ’d find 3.2 billion dollars to fund the coalition ’s climate change policy , take a look at his response .
[ youtube ]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNLkCRgHrbA[/youtube]
Do you see what happened there ?
Barnaby tried to pretend that $ 3.2 billion is less than $ 1,400 million .
He actually slipped up at the beginning of his answer and said he had $ 1.4 billion of Labor spending to cut , before reframing it as $ 1,400 million , then went on to say he could find 3.2 out of 1400 .
But he ’s not trying to find $ 3.2 million , out of a possible $ 1,400 million , he ’s trying to find $ 3.2 billion .
This is one of Senator Joyce ’s first major appearances as opposition finance spokesman and he has deliberately tried to fudge some pretty straight forward figures , it does not bode well for the quality of information he ’ll supply during the election campaign .

A Seychelles coastguard vessel has opened fire on Somali pirates holding six of its nationals and 21 Iranians during a daring high - seas military raid in the Indian Ocean .
Seychelles transport and environment minister Joel Morgan says the six Seychellois fishermen are safe , while the Iranians and the pirates were also rescued .
He says six fishermen were captured by Somali pirates south - east of the archipelago 's main island of Mahe over the weekend and transferred to an Iranian dhow that was earlier captured with its crew of 21 .
" We got confirmation of that at approximately 9:00 am yesterday ( local time ) .
We established a rescue mission , " he said .
The coastguard vessel , Topaz , set sail on Sunday with a Somali translator on board and reached the hijacking situation early Monday , as the pirates were 255 nautical miles north - west of Mahe , heading towards Somalia with the Seychellois ship - the Galate - in tow .
Mr Morgan says the pirates ignored the coastguards ' audio calls to release their hostages and likewise did not alter their course when warning shots were fired .
" We took the decision to open fire on the engine compartment .
Ten thousand 12.7 millimetre rounds were fired ... and we continued our harassment operation until we achieved what we wanted , which was to set fire to the engine , " he said .
Mr Morgan says all on board had to jump off the boat .

Mr. Halderman , an Emmy Award - winning producer for CBS News , was arrested on Oct. 1 , after trying to deposit a fake $ 2 million check from a lawyer for Mr. Letterman in a sting operation set up by the district attorney ’s office .

Sitting before Justice Charles Solomon of State Supreme Court in Manhattan , Mr. Halderman said in a calm tone , “ I attempted to extort $ 2 million from David Letterman by threatening to disclose personal and private information about him , whether true or false . ”
Mr. Halderman went on to explain that last Sept. 9 , he gave a sealed envelope to Mr. Letterman ’s driver while he waited in front of Mr. Letterman ’s Manhattan apartment .
The envelope contained several documents , he said , including one titled “ Treatment for a Screenplay . ”
Mr. Shargel had filed a motion to dismiss the case , arguing that Mr. Halderman intended only to write a book or a screenplay about Mr. Letterman ’s affairs .
But before going forward with the project , Mr. Halderman offered to sell Mr. Letterman the rights to the story for $ 2 million , according to the motion .
But in court on Tuesday , Mr. Halderman changed course .
“ This so - called treatment , ” he said , “ was just a thinly veiled threat to ruin Mr. Letterman if he did not pay me a lot of money . ”
Mr. Halderman said he met three times with a lawyer for Mr. Letterman to negotiate the transaction .
“ I knew throughout this time that I was not engaged in a legitimate business transaction with Mr. Letterman and that what I was doing was against New York law , ” he said .
“ I understand that my attempt to extort $ 2 million from Mr. Letterman violated his and his family ’s privacy .
I promise to respect their privacy in the future . ”
Over the last three years , several beauty parlours and hair salons in the Gaza Strip have been the target of explosions and other attacks , which Hamas have blamed on radical Islamist groups who share the ideology of al Qaeda .
One of the natural things you can have in your bathroom is a pumice stone to help you with the removal of dead cells on the skin .
Instead of going with artificial exfoliators , the pumice stone can work miracles removing dead skin cells from the feet .
The abrasive and porous nature of the stone makes it the perfect exfoliator for the feet .
What is a pumice stone ?
A pumice stone is formed when volcanic lava hardens and forms what we now call the pumice stone .
It is a hard volcanic rock that has pores all over .
It is abrasive features that make it ideal for scrubbing against your skin and removing the dead cells .
Whenever there is a volcanic eruption , the hot lava mixes with water and hardens forming the pumice stone .
It is 100 % natural with only a few additions like a holder added to make it easier to use .
There are several types of pumice stones in the market with the differences coming in their sizes and shapes .
The composition is pretty the same with all been formed from hardening lava .
Using a pumice stone as a foot scrubber
If you take a look at your heels , you will probably find a hard callous layer .
This is a layer that requires regular removal to maintain the smooth and beautiful looks of your feet at all times .
The pumice stone can come in any shape , but most are designed in a rectangular shape to nicely fit your hand .
It is well - sized and one you can easily hold and use with ease .
The pumice stone is used when one is taking a shower .
You can always have it stored in your bathroom as it comes with a string for hanging it on the wall .
Make sure your feet are wet and soapy before starting to scrub it with the pumice stone .
You can easily see as the dead skin cells are removed away .
Rinse your feet with water and clean your pumice stone .
You can also soak your feet in warm water before scrubbing it .
You do n’t have to scrub to hard as this is something you can do on a daily basis .
It is important to clean your stone after use to prevent the growth of molds .
Rinse it and hang it on the wall with the rope it comes it .
It is quite simple to use to use and remains one of the best natural options that cost cheaper .
It is also safer and reliable than most artificial feet scrubbers .

MORRISTOWN , Tenn . —
On a quiet street in this little town in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains lives a family of refugees who were granted asylum in the United States because they feared persecution in their home country .
The reason for that fear has rarely , if ever , been the basis of an asylum case .
The parents , Uwe and Hannelore Romeike , want to home - school their five children , ranging in age from 2 to 12 , a practice illegal in their native land , Germany .
Among European countries , Germany is nearly alone in requiring , and enforcing , attendance of children at an officially recognized school .
The school can be private or religious , but it must be a school .
Exceptions can be made for health reasons but not for principled objections .
But the Romeikes , who are devout Christians , said they wanted their children to learn in a different environment .
Mr. Romeike ( pronounced ro -MY - kuh ) , 38 , a soft - spoken piano teacher whose young children greet strangers at the front door with a startlingly grown - up politeness , said the unruly behavior of students that was allowed by many teachers had kept his children from learning .
The stories in German readers , in which devils , witches and disobedient children are often portrayed as heroes , set bad examples , he said .

Who 's in charge ?
Who 's got food ?
The brain region responsible for learning and memory is bigger in social bee queens who may have to address these questions than in solitary queens , report scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who study the tropical sweat bee species , Megalopta genalis in Panama .
Their study is the first comparison of the brain sizes of social and non-social individuals of the same species .
" The idea is that to maintain power and control in groups you need more information , so the bigger the group , the bigger individuals ' brains need to be . " says William Wcislo , Smithsonian staff scientist .
" This is called the ' social brain hypothesis ' also known as the ' Machiavelli hypothesis ' . "
Previous studies compared brain sizes among social and non-social animals .
However , different animal species may be different in so many ways that it's hard to make a direct connection between brain size and sociality .
This study focuses on a single species in which some individuals are social and others are not .
Megalopta bees exhibit a very primitive form of social behavior .
Either a bee lives as a solitary queen , going out from her nest to forage for her own food or she can be a social queen - - a stay - at - home mom .
In that case , one of her daughters goes out to forage for her , so she rarely leaves the nest .
Her daughter 's ovaries do n't develop , and she never leaves her mother to become a queen .
" It was surprising to us that even thought the social queens do n't have bigger brains overall , the fact that the area associated with learning and memory -- the mushroom body -- was more developed in the social queens than in the solitary bees suggesting that social interactions are cognitively challenging , as predicted by the social brain hypothesis , " said Adam Smith , postdoctoral fellow at STRI .
" It 's interesting to see that a characteristic like brain development changes so immediately , even with this simple mother - daughter division of labor . "
This study was done in STRI 's new insect neurobiology laboratory , built to take advantage of diverse tropical insect groups with a variety of brain sizes to understand how brain size and behavior are related .
These results , supported by Panama 's National Secretariat for Science , Technology & Innovation , the Smithsonian Institution 's Scholarly Studies Program , and the F.H. Levinson Fund are published online in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .

Grabenkrampf im eigenen Selbst und eine Nachsilbe die schadet
Blog » Grabenkrampf im eigenen Selbst und eine Nachsilbe die schadet
" Piratinnen sind die piratigsten Piraten " geht wunderbar .
" Piraten sind die piratigsten Piraten " geht überhaupt nicht .
Ich fühle mich als Y - Chromosomträger meiner piratigen Entfaltungsmöglichkeiten sprachlich beraubt und empfinde ein tiefes Verlangen , zu nölen und rumzuzicken .
Oder wie immer sonst man " to rant " ins deutsche übersetzt .
Wir brauchen Schutzräume für Männer deren naturgegebene Aggressivität dazu führt , dass sie von produktiven Diskussionen ausgeschlossen werden ( zwangsläufig , ansonsten ist die Diskussion nicht mehr produktiv ) .
Moment , die sollen mit ihren Aggressionen selbst fertig werden ?
Dann brauchen wir auch keine Schutzräume für Mauerblümchen , denn die können mit ihrer Schüchternheit auch selbst fertig werden .
Kurzum : Sowohl das überwinden von öffentlich dargestelltem Minderwertigkeitsgefühl als auch desselben kompensiert durch Machtstreben ( man redet dann nach Adler von einem Minderwertigkeitskomplex ) benötigt , nein , nicht Emanzipation , denn den Begriff haben mir die Feministen ( ich werd ' euch nicht den Gefallen tun , da nicht das generische Maskulinum zu verwenden ) gründlich versaut , sondern Selbstbestimmung : Die Fähigkeit , sich selbst an die Nase zu fassen , sich selbst nicht als unveränderlich zu sehen und schließlich Mittel und Wege zu finden , sich zu ändern anstatt blöd rumzusitzen und vom Rest der
Welt zu verlangen zu sein wie man 's spontan gerade hätte .
Das tut weh .
Aber , wie Buddha sagte : Schmerz ist obligatorisch , Leid optional .
Fnord .
Hab ' ich etwa " optimal " geschrieben ?
Die Anzahl der Menschen , die einem bei dieser Aufgabe helfen können ist erschreckend gering :
Es gibt genügend Menschen die keine Probleme damit haben die Unzulänglichkeiten anderer herauszustellen ( das gibt ein Überlegenheitsgefühl und man kann sich von den eigenen Unzulänglichkeiten ablenken ) sowie genügend Menschen die keine Probleme damit haben einen in Mitleid zu ertränken ( das lenkt vom eigenen Selbstmitleid ab , gibt einem ein Überlegenheitsgefühl und eine gute Gelegenheit zur ideologischen Indoktrination ) ; Menschen , allerdings , die beim an die Nase fassen und der Erkenntnis der Überwindbarkeit der Nase helfen ohne sich eben genannter Techniken zu bedienen sind im persönlichen Umfeld tendenziell eher rar gesät , und Menschen die einem aktiv beim Überwinden helfen können in der gesamten Gesellschaft rar .
Oh , und dann gibt es noch eine Legion von esoterischen Teebeutelschwingern , über die es eine schöne indische Metapher mit einem Elefanten gibt .
Meine Fresse seine rechte Gehirnhälfte zu erforschen bedeutet nicht die linke abzuschalten , dazu mögen die sich viel zu sehr .
Woran liegt das ?
Daran , dass so wenige der Selbstbestimmung frönen .
Nicht , dass es nicht genügend Menschen gäbe die in der Gesellschaft ihr eigenes Ding drehen , es gibt viel zu wenig Menschen die in ihrem eigenen Selbst ihr eigenes Ding drehen :
So ergibt sich aus der Fremdbestimmung des eigenen Selbst die Fremdbestimmung des eigenen Strebens und Tuns und folgend eine Gesellschaft aufgebaut und systemisch definiert durch das , was Diskordianer affektiv als " Domestizierte Primaten " bezeichnen : Der Homo Sapiens wird nach der Geburt domestiziert ( u.A. stubenrein gemacht , und das ist auch gut so ) ;
Blöderweise wird ihm aber nicht gezeigt wie er diese Domestizierung die zuerst aufgrund seiner Unerfahrenheit in der Anwendung seines eigenen Potentials durchaus angebracht ist _selbst_ durchführen kann , viel wichtiger noch : Selbst selbstbestimmt durchführen soll , denn niemand kann das eigene Leben so gut an die Umstände anpassen wie man selbst : Ansonsten entsteht aus der Fremdbestimmtheit des Individuums die Vergangenheitsfremdbestimmtheit der Gesellschaft .
Es ist nun nicht so , das man das als Kind nicht trotzdem täte , Trotz ist nichtsdestotrotz der objektiven Teilüberlegenheit von Erwachsenen ein fundamentaler Bestandteil der menschlichen Psyche .
Ach wenn ihr euch doch nur erinnern könntet an die Zeiten in denen euch die Blindheit eurer Eltern Rätsel aufgegeben haben , und hätten wir alle ( das schließt zumindest mich definitiv mit ein ) doch nur dem Verständnis dieser Blindheit weniger unseres eigenen Selbst geopfert .
Blöderweise ist dieses Verständnis nun mal notwendig , um die Eltern effektiv und unerwischt auszutricksen ; das nicht zu tun verwandelt Schmerz in Leid allein durch die zeitliche Länge der Kindheit .
Groß und glücklich ist da der , der es schafft einen gröstmöglichen Teil seines Geburtspotential wenig versteckt irgendwo im Kern seines Selbst zu bewahren , denn in der Panik vor dem Schmerz entscheidet man sich allzu leicht für das Leid : Der Unterschied zwischen Augen zu und durch und Zähne zusammenbeißen .
Hat man allerdings sein Potential so versteckt dass es durch den Schmerz geweckt wird bevor man Zeit hat , in Panik zu geraten so … nun , die lange , dunkle Teezeit der Seele .
Wer behauptet den Abgrund gesehen zu haben ohne sich vor Angst sprichwörtlich in die Hosen zu machen ist entweder ein sehr sehr schlechter , oder sehr sehr guter Lügner .
So rutscht die Augen zu und durch - Gesellschaft und jedes fremdbestimmte Individuum nun unbewusst von Leid zu Leid , verzweifelnd tastend nach genügend Schmerz um mal in den Genuss der Katharrsis zu kommen und zumindest einem Teil des Leides zu entfliehen .
Die Personalunion von Sadist und Masochist .
Das ist alles andere als artgerechte Menschenhaltung .
Wir könnten es alle so viel einfacher und schöner haben .
Fragt das nächste Kind .
Subtrahiert Unwissen , behaltet aber die Naivität und greift nicht nach diesem Traum , lebt die Gedanken und Gefühle die er euch gibt hier und jetzt für immer .
Und nun werdet ihr sagen :
Das ist ja alles schön und gut , aber die Gesellschaft ist noch nicht bereit .
Das haben schon andere vor mir behandelt , ich verweise in diesem Zusammenhang gerne auch noch auf die vorgehend erwähnte Nase .
Alles andere als artgerecht ist es auch , wenn mir , dem von beiderlei Geschlecht schon vorgeworfen wurde Gedanken zu lesen und dem es dementsprechend offensichtlich nicht an Empathie fehlt sowie dem sich interpersonelle Probleme in der Art von " Wie schaffe ich es , das mein Chef nicht irgendwann zu zittern anfängt wenn er es nicht schafft mich einzuschüchtern , 's ist nicht gerade optimal wenn er Angst vor mir hat " stellen — es also auch nicht an " männlichem Selbstbewusstsein " fehlt — vorgeworfen wird , ich würde nicht existieren ; es gäbe in der Gesellschaft allerhöchstes Männer die brav und unterwürfig stricken , der Rest sei ein sogenannter Maskulinist .
Ich bewege mich hier gerade auf semantisch granithartem Boden .
Nicht artgerecht ist es , da ihr eure Aussage nicht auf einem Verständnis eurer Selbst , sondern aus Konsequenz einer Ideologie heraus tätigt und mir im Zuge dessen einen Teil meines Selbst in Abrede stellt .
Die Vorstellung des Verlust dessen was ihr im tiefsten inneren selbst kennt und doch negiert ist die reine Form dessen , was ihr Trauer nennt .
Liebe Feministen , ihr habt Recht , die Assoziationen " Maskulin - Selbstsicher - Brutal - Rücksichtslos " und " Feminin - Empathisch - Liebevoll - Einfühlend " grassiert im derzeitigen semantischen Raum den die Sprache umkreist , und wenn man n bisschen genauer schaut findet sich auch " Maskulin - Aufrecht " und " Feminin - Hinterhältig " .
Liebe —
Wüsstet ihr was das ist , bzw .
eher was es nicht ist , dann käme ich nicht in Verlegenheit , das alles hier zu schreiben .
Zurück zum Thema : Sagen " Feministen " " Maskulinist " , so denke ich zuerst " euer Feindbild " , und es kratzt mich nicht die Bohne , denn Feindbilder haben zu viele als dass ich mich darüber noch aufregen könnte .
Analysiere ich die landläufige Semantik von " Maskulin " , so erkenne ich mich wieder — genauso , wie ich mich in der landläufigen Semantik von " Feminin " wiedererkenne .
Ein Teil meiner Identität wird also vom anderen zum Feind erklärt , und da obendrauf kommt noch die Tatsache , dass dem " femininen " Teil von " Feministen " nachgesagt wird , es nicht auf Feindschaften anzulegen .
An diesem Punkt wird das Ganze endgültig lächerlich : Selbstwiderspruch in den eigenen Begriffen garniert mit Nichtbeachtung der selbst propagierten Ideale .
Und Lachen ist artgerecht .
Ich bin wieder im Gleichgewicht .
Und erkenne plötzlich , dass Begriffe die die angebliche Dualität Maskulin - Feminin transzendieren sich nicht nur im Bauch gut anfühlen , sondern gesellschaftspolitisch Sinn machen , denn wären Menschen die Dualität wie die sie darstellen , wir hätten die Emanzipation nie erlebt und ich hätte noch nie ne Freundin gefunden die mir gefällt .
Endlich , wir haben es geschafft !
Das eigentliche Thema : Die Zementierung der Geschlechtsneutralität der Mitgliederbezeichnung der Piratenpartei Deutschland .
" Piratin und Pirat / Piratinnen und Piraten " nein das geht nicht , ich bin kein Pärchen , ich bin ein Individuum , außerdem kein Zwitter .
" Piratinnen - und Piratenvertreterpiratinnen sowie Piratinnen - und Piratenvertreterpiraten " , so schrecklich kann Liquid Democracy sein .
Generisch " Pirat " , weiblich " Piratin " , männlich " Pirat " .
Hat das Problem dass die Existenz von " Piratin " die Neutralität von " Pirat " hin zum spezifischen Begriff für " männlicher Pirat " verschiebt , da es keinen speziellen Begriff für " männlicher Pirat " gibt : " Piratin " festigt die Dualität , die wir gerade wegzementieren wollen .
" Die Piratigen " Hmmm .
Die piratigen Frauen , die piratigen Männer , die piratigen Menschen .
Aber : Die piratige Frau , Der piratige Mann .
Beim Singular wären wir wieder bei " Der piratige " ( implizit Mensch ) , was die gleichen Probleme mit sich bringt wie jedes andere generische Maskulinum .
" Die piratige " ( implizit Person ) bringt die gleichen Probleme mit sich wie jedes andere generische Femininum .
" Das Piratige " ist wohl eher ein Verhalten als ein Mitglied .
Also auch nichts .
Generisch " Pirat " , weiblich " Pirat ( w ) " , männlich " Pirat ( m ) " .
Sehr gut :
Wir haben einen extra Begriff für männliche Piraten also ist immer klar ob geschlechtsneutral oder geschlechtsspezifisch geredet wird .
Wer will kann auch " Pirat ( wm ) " wenn sie hetero oder " Pirat ( ww ) " wenn sie lesbisch ist schreiben .
Das ganze ist perfekt um alles mögliche erweiterbar , und da fällt mir der Geekcode ein .
Ab jetzt bin ich Pirat ( d--s:a->?c++UBSL +++(++++)
P---L+++(++++)E---W+(++) N++o?!kw---o-M--V--PS++PE-Y+PGPt--5++X+R+++(-)
tv-b+DI--D++ Ge*hry+ )
Oder lieber doch nicht .
Lieber eine AG um einen Code zu basteln der a ) nicht so hoffnungslos veraltet und b ) viel viel politischer und piratiger ist .
Verdammt ist das viel

Even without paying its staff , WikiLeaks says it needs $ 200,000 a year
WikiLeaks , a whistleblower website that allows people to publish uncensored information anonymously , has suspended operations owing to financial problems .
Its running costs including staff payments are $ 600,000 ( £ 377,000 ) , but so far this year it has raised just $ 130,000 ( £ 81,000 ) .
WikiLeaks has established a reputation for publishing information that traditional media cannot .
The website claims to be non-profit and relies on donations .
A statement on its front page says it is funded by " human rights campaigners , investigative journalists , technologists and the general public " .
Original documents
WikiLeaks does not accept money from governments or corporations .
A list of names and addresses of people said to belong to the British National Party ( BNP ) was posted on the site in October 2009 .
WikiLeaks also published e-mail exchanges involving US politician Sarah Palin after her account was hacked .
The site claims to have information about corrupt banks , the UN and the Iraq war that it is unable to publish while funds remain low .
While it has won awards for its work from the Economist and Amnesty International , WikiLeaks has also fought more than 100 legal challenges .
" WikiLeaks has established a good name for itself and broken some good stories , " Julian Petley , chair of the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom , told BBC News .
" One of the reasons why WikiLeaks is so useful is that it 's able to put original documents up - unfiltered by comment and editorial . "
Investigative journalist Paul Lashmar said he had been " startled " by the effectiveness of WikiLeaks in publishing suppressed information .
However he thought that the funding issue would not be easily resolved .
" ( Web ) users are n't interested in how the people behind sites make their money , " he said .
" The problem for the self - funding model is that sites like WikiLeaks will not find it easy to attract funding through advertising .
" At some point people who care about free speech will realise that free speech has to be funded , otherwise it 's not free . "

Kucinich in Obama 's crosshairs
Updated 7:14 p.m.
By Michael D. Shear and Peter Slevin
Air Force
One took off from suburban Maryland today at 11:13 a.m. and landed 48 minutes later in Cleveland .
For Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) -- who says he plans to vote no on the president 's health - care bill -- it must have felt like a much longer flight .
Obama invited Kucinich and undecided Rep. Marcia Fudge ( D - Ohio ) to the ultimate pressure cooker as he tries to nail down a majority for his top domestic priority .
What was said at 35,000 feet is anyone 's guess , and Kucinich is -- for once -- not talking .
The president talked one on one with Kucinich aboard Air Force One on the flight , a White House spokesman said .
But Obama 's onetime presidential rival just smiled as he walked across the tarmac upon arrival in his home state .
" I 'm looking forward to hearing what he has to say , " Kucinich said .
A spokesman in his D.C. office said the congressman was politely declining all requests for interviews today .
But there was a public hint of the kind of pressure he is under .
When Obama introduced Kucinich at his rally in Strongsville , in the congressman 's suburban Cleveland district , someone in the audience called out , " Vote yes . "
Obama , not missing a beat , turned to his traveling partner .
" Did you hear that , Dennis ? " he asked .
Near the end of his speech , Obama said he had told Kucinich on the flight : " You know what ?
It 's been such a long time since we made government on the side of ordinary working folks , where we did something for them that relieved some of their struggles . "
Kucinich has said he plans to vote against the health - care legislation because it does not contain a public option .
That unwavering stand has drawn the ire of other liberals , who have accused him of a Ralph Nader - esque approach to politics .
" It 's not perfect , " Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas said of the current health - care legislation in an appearance on MSNBC .
" But it 's a first step , and God knows it 's taken us a long time to even get our toe in the door .
...
If somebody like Kucinich wants to block that , I find that completely reprehensible . "
Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One with Obama and several other lawmakers .
He said Kucinich has been hearing the same message repeatedly .
" All of us -- the governor , the congressional delegation , the president -- are making clear to Dennis that we wo n't have another chance for a decade if this does n't happen , " Brown said , referring to Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland ( D ) , a former member of Congress who was in the audience Monday .
Pressure on Kucinich , who favors a more aggressive health - care overhaul , is also coming from elsewhere , said Brown , a strong backer of the reform effort .
He said his office has been flooded with letters , e-mail and telephone messages from Ohioans who have lost their insurance and want the Democratic - led Congress to act .
" Dennis , " Brown said , " is getting those same calls and letters . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she believes there is already enough evidence to justify moving forward with the impeachment of President Donald Trump over his Ukraine conduct .
The House is due to vote Thursday on a resolution that formalizes the …

By Deanna Spingola
I recently had the pleasure of talking with Dr. James David Manning who has been ministering to the people of Harlem since 1981 .
He is now the Senior Pastor at ATLAH which stands for All the Land Anointed Holy , Manning 's inspired name for Harlem as of September 14 , 1991 .
Dr. Manning heads the Columbia Obama Treason Trial which is scheduled for May 14 - 19 , 2010 at the ATLAH building at 38 West 123rd Street in ATLAH , New York , 10027 .
Unfortunately , the Department of Justice and the Supreme Court have failed in their duties to uphold the Constitution and address the legitimacy and other questionable issues surrounding the White House 's current resident .
So , Dr. Manning , being a longtime resident of the Columbia University area , the school that Obama allegedly attended , began an intense investigation into Obama 's educational background and discovered some profound discrepancies .
According to Dr. Manning , Obama ( born in 1961 ) enrolled at the very pricey Occidental College in Los Angeles , California in 1979 and was recruited there in 1980 by the CIA which has made it a practice since its inception to recruit college students .
He was , by his own admission , a " C " student , a dope smoker and a member of the Marxist Club at Occidental , a co-educational liberal arts college .
In 1981 , Obama allegedly transferred from Occidental to Columbia University .
It is atypical for a student to begin their education in one four - year school and then transfer to another school .
Columbia University requires that incoming students pass certain academic requirements which Obama apparently lacked .
However , Columbia had a foreign student program and the CIA has major connections and influence with Columbia and the nation 's other educational facilities .
The CIA needed Muslims or others who were fluent in Farsi and who could easily blend into the Muslim environment in the Middle East .
The CIA persuaded Columbia University to extend their foreign student program to Obama , now a Columbia student , so that he might travel to Pakistan and enroll in the universities around Karachi in addition to the Patrice Lumumba School in Moscow . [ 1 ]
The school , one of Russia 's most prestigious universities was founded on February 5 , 1960 as The Peoples ' Friendship University of Russia ( PFUR ) .
It was renamed the Patrice Lumumba School on February 22 , 1961 .
On February 5 , 1992 the university re-adopted its former name .
According to their web site , " The main aim was to give young people from Asia , Africa and Latin America , especially from poor families , an opportunity to get University education and to become highly qualified specialists .
The students were admitted through non-governmental organizations , governmental establishments , and the USSR embassies and consulates . " [ 2 ]
Obama , as an undercover agent , was the lead agent in the arms and money supply for the CIA - trained Taliban Army against the Soviet Army war machine .
His actions were integral to the Taliban 's success in their opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
Obama , it is publicly acknowledged , went to Pakistan in 1981 .
There is no way of knowing how often Obama traveled between Pakistan and Russia .
According to Dr. Manning , Obama was an interpreter for the CIA during the war in Afghanistan .
When Obama completed his CIA operations in the mid 1980s and returned to the U.S. he persuaded the State Department to maneuver his entrance into Harvard Law School ; since the CIA , the U.S. president 's personal agency for black operations throughout the world , also has connections to federal and state politicians , they managed to arrange Obama 's entrance to yet another elite school in 1988 .
Percy Ellis Sutton , a civil - rights activist and lawyer , was the Manhattan Borough President from 1966 to 1977 .
He was an intelligence officer with the Tuskegee Airmen , the name of a group of African American pilots who were part of the 332nd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II .
Sutton entered Harlem politics and became a leader of the Harlem Clubhouse , known as the " Gang of Four " which has controlled Democratic politics in Harlem for at least fifty years .
His Clubhouse allies were New York City Mayor David Dinkins , U.S. Representative Charles Rangel , and New York Secretary of State Basil Paterson , father of the currently beleaguered David Paterson who replaced Spitzer as New York Governor in 2008 .
Percy Sutton wrote a letter to Harvard officials requesting that they admit Obama as a student after a hiatus of five years ( from 1983 when he allegedly left Columbia to 1988 ) .
Despite a five - year absence from the rigors of college activity he was accepted at Harvard where he excelled and on February 5 , 1990 , was elected president of the venerable celebrated , the highest student position at Harvard Law School , a term that lasts for one year . [ 3 ]
After graduation he could have worked in any leading law firm except that he lacked the proper citizenship qualifications which would have come to light during the interview and normal background checks pursued by major law firms .
Moreover , his academic deficiencies at Occidental College would have disqualified him from the top law firms .
Furthermore , he was a CIA operative in the Middle East during the time that he was supposed to be attending Columbia University .
So despite his Harvard achievements , Obama became a Saul Alinsky - style community organizer in South Chicago which alleviated the necessity of providing a legitimate background check . [ 4 ]
In 1990 , Obama accepted a job with Davis , Miner , Barnhill & Galland , a law firm which represented civil rights cases but also represented Rezmar Corp. owned by Chicago slumlord , Tony Rezko .
The law firm helped Rezmar Corp .
get more than $ 43 million in government funding .
As early as 1995 , Rezko started contributing to Obama for his political aspirations .
In 2003 , Rezko was a fundraiser for Obama 's Senatorial campaign as part of a group that raised over $ 14 million .
In 2006 , Rezko was found guilty of sixteen out of twenty - four charges filed against him .
Barack Obama had been employed for a short summer stint as an associate with Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP , the same law firm that Harvard graduate Michelle Robinson worked for from 1988 to 1991 .
She became his trainer and supervisor and , as such , may have handled any background information .
Michelle Robinson , through the efforts of Valerie Jarrett , then - deputy chief of staff for Mayor Richard Daley , became an assistant to the mayor .
Robinson later became an " economic development coordinator . "
Obama married the politically connected Michelle Robinson in October 1992 in the Trinity United Church of Christ .
This gave him citizenship and credibility . [ 5 ]
In 1993 , according to the Records at the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois , Michelle Obama , as an attorney , was " voluntarily inactive and not authorized to practice law " per her request .
After she gave up her law license , Michelle Obama worked for the University of Chicago Medical Center where she received a very generous annual salary of $ 317,000 . [ 6 ]
Dr. Manning , an African American , has called Obama a " good House Negro " and a " long - legged Mack daddy , " and an " emissary of the devil . "
When Dr. Manning gave an interview on Fox News , he said , " We also have to talk about his character . "
Dr. Manning has also questioned Obama 's eligibility to serve as U.S. President due to the fact that Obama has not complied with numerous requests by to reveal his birth records .
In fact , Obama has spent thousands of dollars in an attempt to conceal those records .
Dr. Manning , using information from hired investigators declares that Obama never attended Columbia University .
He asserts the following : 1) " Columbia University will not divulge whether the " alleged " diploma issued was in the name of Barry Soetoro or Barack Hussein Obama .
No public record exists regarding the diploma .
" 2 ) " Obama alleges he attended Columbia in 1982 , 1983 .
But , the investigators have been UNABLE to turn up a single shred of written documentation for the years 1981 , 1982 , 1983 , 1984 that show where Obama appeared on a school roster , register , faculty memo , bulletin board , school awards , dean 's list ; where Obama 's name appeared in a yearbook , club record , fraternity record , extra curricular activity member roster , student newspaper , student radio or TV activity ; where Obama appeared in any records as a worker , employee , laborer in or about Columbia University ; where Obama enrolled in any sports activity or program .
" 3 ) " As a graduating senior in 1983 he does not appear in any Political Science ( his major ) or Graduating Class yearbook or invitation records .
" 4 ) " There is absolutely no documentation of any kind to show Obama attended , lived , worked or played at Columbia University during the investigated 4 years .
" 5 ) " Interviewed professors , college employees , students ( who were at Columbia during the years in question ) have failed to turn up a single person that can remember Obama .
This is irrefutable evidence .
Think about your own situation if Obama had attended your college ?
A " now - famous " person went to your school ?
Many would be able to say , " Of course I remember . "
At Columbia , not a single person has been able to say he or she remembers Obama . " [ 7 ]
Obama 's background would have been relatively insignificant if he had n't been chosen as a presidential candidate by the bankers .
But , with funding from George Soros and other international bankers who wish to establish global governance , he ran for office .
Obviously there would be records that revealed some very personal details of his life .
Passport records are particularly revealing .
John O. Brennan , Obama 's top terrorism and intelligence adviser is the owner of The Analysis Corp. , the firm that was cited in March 2008 for penetrating the files of presidential candidates Barack Obama , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and John McCain in the State Department 's passport office .
Investigators maintain that the target of this illegal activity was Obama 's passport file for the sole purpose of cleansing the records of information that would jeopardize Obama 's candidacy .
The breach of the passport records of the other candidates was to create confusion .
Brennan was , at the time , an unpaid advisor working with Obama 's campaign .
Passport files include an applicant 's name , gender , social security number , date and place of birth , and passport number .
Additional information may include birth certificates , naturalization certificates , or oaths of allegiance for U.S. - born persons who adopted the citizenship of a foreign country as minors .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee oversees the State Department .
Joseph Biden , now Obama 's Vice President , was the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the breach . [ 8 ]
The State Department passport records were scrubbed to erase any mention of Obama 's CIA activities and his personal information .
The State Department employee , Lt. Quarle Harris , Jr. who had access and apparently scrubbed the records , was killed . [ 9 ]
Harris decided to cooperate with the FBI who was investigating the break - in .
His body was discovered in his parked car ; he had been shot in the head , execution style . [ 10 ]
The Indonesian passport , issued in the name of Barry Soetoro , was used to travel to Pakistan to assist the Afghan Mujahideen during the U.S. buildup . [ 11 ]
The CIA is not an intelligence - gathering agency .
The Truman Administration authorized " psychological warfare " by the newly established National Security Council in NSC 4 - A of December 1947 which allowed covert operations during peacetime .
This document made the CIA Director responsible for psychological warfare and placed it under the exclusive direction of the Executive Branch .
The CIA has unvouchered funds which allow the agency to operate without exposure or Congressional oversight . [ 12 ]
With pressure from the Departments of State and Defense , a new NSC directive , NSC 10/2 was issued on June 18 , 1948 .
This new directive stipulated that the CIA could conduct " covert " and " psychological " operations both of which were sponsored by the U.S. Government against foreign states or groups .
However , these activities should be " planned and executed in such a way as to provide plausible deniability if revealed .
Approved CIA clandestine activities , according to the directive , include " propaganda ; ; preventive direct action , including sabotage , demolition and evacuation measures ; subversion against hostile states , including assistance to underground resistance movements , guerrillas and refugee liberation groups , and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world .
Such operations should not include armed conflict bymilitary forces , espionage , counter - espionage , and cover and deception for military operations . " [ 13 ]
During the 2008 presidential change - promising campaign Obama avoided detailed questions about his alleged years at Columbia by saying that he was very anti-social and totally uninvolved with the academic community .
Further , he claimed that he lived off campus .
For someone who loves the limelight and never misses an opportunity to engage in rhetoric , it is an enigma that he would isolate himself from typical college activities unless , of course , that is simply justification to account for his absence during the time that he was supposed to be attending Columbia .
Okay , if Obama was a CIA operative who , with political connections , super funding and media puffing , made it to the White House  is he still a CIA operative bent on destroying what is left of the economy of the U.S. ?
The CIA was established by Harry Truman , a 33rd Degree Freemason , to implement global governance .
Freemasonry is a front group for the satanical organization , the Illuminati whose objectives are world governance .
In mid February 2010 , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs alerted the reporters who regularly cover the White House that certain questions were forbidden including Obama 's job with CIA front company , Business International Corporation ( BIC ) , following his attendance at Columbia University ; Obama 's school records while he attended Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981 , and his records at Columbia . [ 14 ]
Wayne Madsen states that his Kabul sources claim that President Obama has maintained a personal correspondence with a private military company ( PMC ) whose senior personnel includes numerous Afghan Mujahideen - Soviet war veterans who fought with the late Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud who became Afghanistan 's Defense Minister in 1992 and was assassinated on September 9 , 2001 , allegedly by al - Qaeda agents .
The firm is also involved in counter - insurgency operations in Colombia , where Obama is building seven new military bases , and in Iraq .
Henry Kissinger said , " Conflicts across the globe and an international respect for Barack Obama have created the perfect setting for establishment of ' a New World Order . " [ 15 ]
Allegedly , the upper echelon of Freemasonry were infiltrated long ago the Satanic Illuminati whose objective is world dominance through one - world governance .
There are claims that Barack Obama is a 32nd degree Prince Hall Freemason .
Certainly , Prince Hall Freemasons , Jesse Jackson and Charles Rangel , supported his presidency . [ 16 ]
Whether he is a Freemason or not , he might indeed be the chosen vessel of the New World Order proponents unless the citizens call a halt to the scheme .
However , there is no doubt that he is a Zionist asset and , that despite his campaign promises , intends to pursue the same Neo - Con policies in the Middle East as the previous administration , as evidenced by his speech before the 2008 AIPAC Policy Conference where he was introduced by his friend , Lee Rosenberg , a fellow Chicago resident .

When Steve Jobs received his liver transplant , he was considered " the sickest person on the waiting list . "
Now he 's speaking out about the faults in California 's current organ donor system which left 400 people dying in wait last year alone :
" I was fortunate , " he said because he had the ability to fly cross country in the four - hour window needed to transplant a healthy organ .
" Last year , 400 other Californians died waiting .
I could have died . "
He called current system " an obscure process " with " no one asking the simple question : Will you donate your organs ? "
Of his current health , the whippet - thin Jobs told other transplant survivors who attended the Friday news conference , " I 'm feeling fine .
I almost died .
It 's been a pretty good last few months . "

Steve made these remarks during an event announcing the introduction of the United State 's first living organ donor registry in California earlier today .
Let 's hope that changes things for the better .
[ Business Insider ]
Update :
For those who wrote in requesting information about the organ donation process , this site is a good resource .

These are the moments a City Hall reporter lives for :
My girlfriend and I were having dinner at a downtown restaurant recently , and we could n't help but overhear the couples in the next booth kvetching about Chicago 's parking meter lease deal .
" Boy , the city really blew that one , " said one of the guys .
" They really did , " said one of the women .
" And it 's all on Mayor Daley . "
While the private company now running the meter system has jacked up rates to maximize its profits , she went on , the city has already spent most of the $ 1.2 billion it received in the deal — money that was supposed to last for the next 74 years .
" I never thought I 'd see the day when Daley was vulnerable , " she concluded .
" But he is . "
And she 's not the only one who sees it .
Despite the myths propagated by his administration — and received as fact by many news outlets , including , most recently , the New Yorker — Daley is not overseeing a smoothly running , contented city .
( See Ben Joravsky 's column in this issue for more on that . )
Every day I hear CTA riders bitching about the decline of rapid transit , which Daley appointees have overseen for the last two decades .
At community policing meetings people talk about daily gunfire down the block from their homes ; cops , meanwhile , quietly rage about how the police department has cut hundreds of officers from its ranks in the last couple years .
Aldermen have been fretting aloud about the vacant homes and empty storefronts pockmarking their neighborhoods , and they say they 're inundated with calls from constituents wanting to know why the city is n't doing more to get rid of squatters and drug dealers .
Then there are all the complaints about potholes , poorly maintained parks , and struggling schools .
Community activists wonder why the city has doled out hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate subsidies when it can't find the money to maintain basic city services .
And scores of people around town are , like my fellow diners , irked that the city sold its street parking system to an investment bank .
Voter anger waxes and wanes , but in Chicago this time around Mayor Daley is a primary target .
Last fall a Tribune poll found that just 35 percent of Chicagoans approved of his performance — his lowest rating since he was elected in 1989 .
And the poll was conducted before Chicago lost its bid for the 2016 Olympics , before Daley decided we 'd use the parking meter " rainy day fund " to plug holes in the 2010 budget , before one of his chief City Council allies , Isaac Carothers , pleaded guilty to bribery and tax evasion , and before one of his erstwhile critics , Toni Preckwinkle , won the Democratic primary for county board president by promising reform ( though she was wily enough to seek his endorsement ) .
With just a year before the next municipal election , Daley seems to be in trouble — so much so that some have predicted he wo n't even run .
Many observers have speculated that what may push him off the fence is the health of his wife , Maggie , who has been battling cancer .
There 's no doubt his stock has fallen .
But Daley is n't just any politician .
I predict his poll numbers and popularity on the street will have little bearing on whether he runs again — and even less on whether he can win .
For starters , he 's not the type who would give up his throne to live out his days on the golf course .
And it 's not as though he has n't dealt with PR nightmares before — he 's waded through scandals that would eat other pols alive , over things like his friendships with contractors who won millions of dollars in city business by fraudulently claiming their firms were led by minorities and women ; the millions of taxpayer dollars paid to trucking companies that bribed their way into contracts and then did no work ; and illegal patronage hiring by some of his top aides .
By now Daley knows what to do : find a fall guy , rant about him on camera , give him the ax , declare the problem solved , and return to his aggressive downtown flower - planting campaign .
Nobody wants bad press , but Daley seems to like a fight .
More to the point , he likes a win , as much as Michael Jordan ever did .
And he 's not interested in eking one out — he likes to win big .
He gets annoyed when even a handful of aldermen vote against something he 's pushing .
He likes to be dismissed as inarticulate , provincial , or weak — and then to outmaneuver his critics again so he can gloat a bit .
In 2006 , when Daley was preoccupied with that federal investigation into patronage hiring in his administration , mayoral irritant Joe Moore got the City Council to pass a ban on foie gras .
Two years later the mayor refused to let Moore speak ( and the alderman 's mike conveniently cut out ) as mayoral allies used a parliamentary trick to overturn the ban without a moment 's debate .
Afterward the mayor paraded around City Hall wearing the smug smile of a 14 - year - old bully .
Who can imagine that guy delivering a " You wo n't have Richie to kick around any more " speech ?
So far Daley has offered only the vaguest answers to questions about his plans .
" I do n't know why you already put me in the grave , " he told reporters last fall when someone dared to ask if he would run for reelection .
Most took his response to mean that he should n't be counted out .
I took it to mean he 'll quit when he 's dead .
The way I see it , Daley is more Ahab than Nixon .
He 's operating on his own logic , and he's not going to change his course for anybody , even if it takes the ship down .
Maybe I 've got it wrong .
But I 've talked about Daley 's future with dozens of elected officials , campaign manager types , and other political insiders — some loyal to the mayor and others seething with resentment toward him .
Every one of them has told me the same thing , often down to the word : " All indications are that he 's going to run again . "
The question , then , is whether anyone who can conceivably win is going to run against him .
[ See Mick Dumke 's companion piece , Mayoral Material ?
Ten to watch , even as they demur . ]
No one can beat Daley if no one tries to .
It 's obvious , but in this town the obvious needs to be stated .
Daley has n't had a serious challenge since warding off Roland Burris in 1995 , and even supporters acknowledge that this has n't been good for the city .
There 's little reason to expect any change from Daley if he keeps getting more than 70 percent of the vote .
When Daley first took office , the city was racially divided after years of coordinated white opposition to the first black mayor , Harold Washington .
But Washington died on the job in 1987 , and in the special election two years later Daley campaigned as a healer , locked up the white vote , and slipped past his African - American opponents , beating interim mayor Eugene Sawyer in the primary and Alderman Tim Evans in the general .
( Municipal elections were divided into a primary and general election then — the primary was eliminated in 1995 . )
Daley won 54 percent of the vote in both contests .
That 's his worst performance to date .
Even his most formidable foes got it worse — Daley beat county commissioner ( and future congressman ) Danny Davis 63 to 31 percent in the 1991 primary and Congressman Bobby Rush 69 to 27 percent in 1999 .
If black opponents have faltered against him , white and Latino opponents have stayed away altogether .
Other than a few fringe candidates in the 1990s , Daley has n't faced a white challenger since former mayor Jane Byrne ran against him in the 1991 primary .
He 's never faced a Latino .
In those elections , though , the conditions favored the incumbent .
The local economy was thriving : the city was raking in the tax dollars , and the mayor had plenty of resources to spread around .
Favored contractors got rich as new police stations and libraries were built in black and Latino areas that had once vehemently opposed Daley .
Churches got city support for social services and affordable housing construction , and pretty foliage was planted in street medians .
Even as neighborhoods that used to rely on manufacturing and mill jobs continued to crumble , the Loop was bright , prosperous , and full of energy .
Progressive types did n't want to admit it , but lots of people thought Daley did a fine job of shepherding the city into the postindustrial era .
But the mayor had sticks as well as carrots — namely the armies of old - school patronage workers at his disposal .
Anyone who stood in his way — or in his allies ' way — had to face the prospect of being mowed down at election time .
In 2003 incumbent 12th Ward alderman Ray Frias dropped his reelection bid after concluding he could n't beat a challenger backed by the Hispanic Democratic Organization , a force of hundreds of city workers commanded by top Daley allies .
Daley 's margins soared as he consolidated power .
But at the same time , voter participation plummeted .
In 1989 , 934,049 people voted in the first round of balloting for mayor ; in 2007 just 456,765 did .
Daley got 324,519 of those votes , or 71 percent .
In 1989 he 'd received 486,586 votes to constitute his winning 54 percent .
To remain in power , Daley did n't have to be popular .
He just had to be less uninspiring than his foes .
Still , the last election could 've been different .
In the middle of the night on March 31 , 2003 , without notifying the FAA or any pilots or aircraft owners , Daley unilaterally ordered crews to bulldoze the runway at Meigs Field , the small airport on Northerly Island .
He claimed this sudden move would diminish the threat of an airborne terrorist attack , though many remembered that in 1994 he 'd unsuccessfully tried to turn the space into a park .
Critics called him a tyrant ; legal fees and fines levied by the federal government cost the city about $ 500,000 .
The mayor shrugged it off , and for the most part the public followed suit .
By the following September Northerly Island was a park .
The next rounds of scrutiny were n't as easy to dismiss .
Starting in 2004 U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald zeroed in on the Hired Truck program and then on illegal patronage hiring , the hallowed tradition of trading jobs for campaign support that created armies like the HDO .
Before the feds were done , dozens of people had been convicted on fraud and other charges — among them Robert Sorich , the mayor 's patronage chief and family friend from the Bridgeport neighborhood , where they both grew up .
Federal investigators interviewed Daley — in the presence of his private attorney — but he was never charged with wrongdoing .
The mayor looked vulnerable , and Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. took note .
Junior began issuing statements , giving speeches , and granting interviews blasting City Hall corruption .
He traveled around the city meeting people and speaking to neighborhood groups , raised some money , and even set up a campaign organization — then abruptly opted out of a mayoral challenge , saying the Democrats ' new majority in the U.S.
House meant he could do more good in Washington .
People close to his campaign also said he was discouraged by the results of polls he 'd conducted showing he probably would n't win .
He was probably right .
The supposedly weakened Daley raised $ 6.4 million in the eight months leading up to the election , spent $ 4.7 million of it , and went on to crush two lackluster opponents , circuit court clerk Dorothy Brown and political activist William " Dock " Walls .
I for one do n't think Jackson should be condemned for not wanting to be a political martyr .
Yet I 'm not sure he realized how much he might have changed the dynamics of the Daley era , even in losing .

The aircraft was returning from an operation in Afghanistan
A US Navy plane with four crew members on board has crashed into the Arabian Sea , the US Fifth Fleet said .
It said in a statement that the E - 2C Hawkeye aircraft experienced mechanical malfunctions , forcing the crew to perform a controlled bail - out .
Three of the four crew were later recovered and a search is now under way for the fourth crew member .
An investigation has been launched into the incident .
The crew was stationed on the USS Dwight D Eisenhower .
The aircraft had crashed into the sea at about 1400 local time ( 1000 GMT ) on Wednesday , the statement said .
It said the plane " was returning from conducting operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom " in Afghanistan when the problems had occurred .
The identities of the crew are being withheld pending notification of next - of - kin .
A federally funded ticketing blitz in the state of Virginia landed a total of 6996 traffic tickets this weekend .
The blitz , dubbed “ Operation Air , Land & Speed ” coincided with frantic efforts by state officials to close a $ 2.2 billion budget deficit .
Supervisors ordered state troopers to saturate Interstates 81 and 95 to issue as many tickets as humanly possible over the space of two days .
“ The safety of Virginia ’s highways begins the minute a vehicle is put in ‘ drive , ' ” Virginia State Police Superintendent W. Steven Flaherty said in a statement .
“ Those split second decisions to choose not to drive drunk , to choose to wear a seat belt and to choose not to speed or drive aggressively really do make a difference in preventing and / or surviving a crash . ”
Officers had no trouble delivering the requested number of speeding tickets with a total of 3536 ordinary speeding citations written .
In addition , another 717 “ reckless driving ” tickets were filed , although these most often are simple speeding tickets that happen to carry a fine of up to $ 2500 .
Driving as little as 10 to 15 MPH over the limit can qualify for this enhanced punishment .
On the other end of the scale , some 310 tickets were handed to drivers who either forgot to wear their seatbelts or made a choice not to do so .
Activists with the National Motorists Association pointed out that enforcement efforts may have concentrated on areas where speed limits are expected to rise to 70 MPH following Governor Bob McDonnell ’s signature on legislation raising the state ’s maximum speed limit ( view law ) .
This would mean a significant number of tickets were issued for conduct that will be perfectly legal in a matter of months .
The group also indicated that state police tactics may run afoul of state law .
“ All officers making arrests incident to the enforcement of this title shall be paid fixed salaries for their services and shall have no interest in , nor be permitted by law to accept the benefit of , any fine or fee resulting from the arrest or conviction of an offender against any provision of this title , ” Virginia Code Section 46.2 - 102 states .
Under the federal grant application process , state officials explained that they would pay officers overtime — at least one - and - a - half times their normal salary — to participate .
This special reward for ticketing operation participants appears to violate the spirit of state law .
Since 2006 , a total of twenty - three ticketing blitzes have taken place , generating 120,977 traffic tickets .

Advertisement Europeans are not getting as wide a choice of browser as they may think , claims a web designer .
From 1 March , European users of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer began seeing pop-up screens asking them if they wanted to try a different browser .
The choice was offered to settle an anti-trust case the European Commission brought against Microsoft .
But some say almost half the browsers on offer are clones of IE that only give people an illusion of choice .
Display choice
When the browser choice page popped - up for web designer Richard Quick , he decided to try out some of the lesser known programs on offer .
While installing and using them he noticed that many were based around a core technology , known as a rendering engine , built and maintained by Microsoft .
The firm 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) uses the Trident engine .
IE and four of the other less well - known browsers , Avant , Maxthon , Slim and Green Browser , all use it too .
Another , Sleipnir , uses Trident as a default and can also use the Gecko rendering engine .
" The aspect of a browser that decides what bit to put where on the page , that 's the rendering engine , " said Mr Quick .
While he acknowledged that most people were likely to pick one of the popular programs shown on the first browser choice page - which include Apple 's Safari , Google 's Chrome , Mozilla 's Firefox and Opera - his complaint is that those who pick a new one were not getting as much choice as they thought .
BROWSER ENGINES Trident : Internet Explorer , Avant , Maxthon , Slim , Green Browser , Sleipnir Webkit : Chrome , Safari Gecko : Firefox , Flock , K-meleon , Sleipnir Presto : Opera
Of the 12 browsers on offer , five use the Trident rendering engine , three use Mozilla 's Gecko , two use WebKit , and one uses Opera 's Presto .
Sleipnir can use either Trident or Gecko .
This meant , he said , that almost half of the browsers being offered were IE or something very similar .
" If you choose IE you will get pages rendered the IE way , " he said .
" But if you choose these browsers you will get the pages rendered the IE way too . "
Mr Quick said he had sent a complaint about the choices to the European Commission .
A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on Mr Quick 's findings but directed the BBC towards public documents which set out how the choice of browsers was made .
Clause 10 of this said : " Nothing in the design and implementation of the Choice Screen and the presentation of competing web browsers will express a bias for Internet Explorer . "
Microsoft is also not allowed to feature any browser " which is based on Internet Explorer 's rendering engine and the development or distribution of which is funded in whole or in substantial part by Microsoft . "
The browser choices , it said , is based on the 12 most widely used browsers that run on Windows 7 measured by an agreed methodology .
Smart browsers
Another web designer Paul Boag said few web designers were fans of the Trident rendering engine .
" From a web designers point of view , its all to do with support for the World Wide Web Consortium specifications , " he said .
These specifications dictate how the different elements of a webpage should be displayed .
Mr Boag said Chrome , Safari , Firefox and Opera did the best job of adhering to the W3C specifications .
" Internet Explorer is somewhere down the list , " he said .
This meant , he said , that many of the things it was easy to do in other browsers , such as create shadows on the page , required far more lines of code or workarounds in IE .
There is currently a vocal campaign to extinguish the older IE version 6 .
Mr Boag said this had largely come about because its rendering engine was so out of date and hard to use .
Many web designers were now pushing a technology called " progressive enhancement " said Mr Boag .
This tunes a webpage to the software that people use to view it , he said .
" It gives the less intelligent browser something much more basic and gives the better browser something better on top , " he said .
If it was widely adopted , he said , it could mean that users of IE or browsers that use the same rendering engine see only the most basic elements of a page .
Others with more sophisticated browsers will get the full experience .

AMES , Iowa - Schools are typically on guard against students who bully by inflicting repeated violence on other students .
But technology has given rise to a relatively new form of bullying which inflicts emotional harm in a stealth manner , working through Web sites , chat rooms , e-mail , cell phones and instant messaging .
And according to a new national study by Iowa State University researchers , one out of every two lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender ( LGBT ) and allied youths are regular victims of " cyberbullying , " which causes psychological and emotional distress to victims -- producing thoughts of suicide in some who are repeatedly victimized .
In the online survey of 444 junior high , high school and college students between the ages of 11 and 22 -- including 350 self - identified non-heterosexual subjects -- 54 percent of the LGBT and allied youth reported being victims of cyberbullying in the 30 days prior to the survey .
Cyberbullying includes attacks such as electronic distribution of humiliating photos , dissemination of false or private information , or targeting victims in cruel online polls .
Cyberbullying stimulates suicidal thoughts
Among the non-heterosexual respondents , 45 percent reported feeling depressed as a result of being cyberbullied , 38 percent felt embarrassed , and 28 percent felt anxious about attending school .
More than a quarter ( 26 percent ) had suicidal thoughts .
" There 's a saying that we 've now changed to read , ' Sticks and stones can break my bones , but words can kill , ' " said Warren Blumenfeld , an Iowa State assistant professor of curriculum and instruction and the study 's lead author .
" And especially at this age -- pre-adolescence through adolescence -- this is a time when peer influences are paramount in a young person 's life .
If one is ostracized and attacked , that can have devastating consequences -- not only physically , but on their emotional health for the rest of their lives . "
Co-authored by Robyn Cooper , a research and evaluation scientist at ISU 's Research Institute for Studies in Education ( RISE ) , the study is being published in this month 's special LGBT - themed issue of the International Journal of Critical Pedagogy , which is being released on Monday , March 15 .
The results underscore the helplessness felt by victims of cyberbullying .
Forty percent of the non-heterosexual respondents indicated that their parents would n't believe them if they were being bullied online , while 55 percent reported that their parents could n't do anything to stop it .
Fifty seven percent also indicated that they did n't think a school official could do anything to stop it .
" They feared that there might be more retribution by ' tattling , ' " said Blumenfeld , who was bullied as a teen for being gay .
" One of the things we found is that the LGBT students really want to make a difference , " said Cooper , who authored her doctoral dissertation on minority stress and the well - being of sexual minority college students .
" They want their stories told .
They want people to know what they 're going through , but they do n't want the repercussions of being bullied .
So being able to respond to this survey was very helpful . "
One in four of the LGBT and allied students responded that they needed to learn how to deal with cyberbullying by themselves .
More than half also feared telling their parents about the cyberbullying because they might restrict their use of technology , which Blumenfeld says is often the " lifeline to the outside world " for many young LGBT students who have been ostracized by their peers at school .
A need for greater peer support
The ISU study also proposes strategies for cyberbullying prevention .
Eighty percent of the survey 's respondents indicated that their peers should do more to stop it .
" One of the strategies coming out of this study - since respondents expect and want their peers to step in more - is that we should find ways on our campuses to empower young people to speak up and act as allies , " Blumenfeld said .
" In bullying circles , it 's empowering the bystander to become the upstander to help eliminate the problem . "
Blumenfeld and Cooper recommend developing social norms programming at schools that focus on peer influences that correct misperceived societal norms .
The ISU researchers plan to author additional papers on their analysis from this survey .
They also have submitted a new grant proposal to extend their research to a larger national sample that would include face - to - face interviews and focus groups .

It got a brief mention on some of the cable channels , but the only major TV network that carried live coverage of this healthcare reform rally in D.C. yesterday was Fox - and then , only to ridicule it :
The reason ?
AHIP , the health insurance lobbying organization , was meeting in ( where else ? ) the Ritz - Carlton .
A coalition of groups led by unions including SEIU , AFSCME , UFCW and Health Care for American Now declared the meeting site a " corporate crime scene " and attempted to make a citizens ' arrest :
In a reverse twist on the old protestors ' tactic of getting arrested to make a point , union leaders and other backers of President Obama 's healthcare plan issued " citizen 's arrest " warrants for health insurance executives Tuesday – accusing them of exploiting consumers .
The " warrants , " delivered to police during a demonstration outside an insurance industry meeting at a Washington hotel , were an attempt to dramatize protestors ' call for insurance reform – and to build public support for the Democrats ' healthcare legislation .
The demonstration , which drew several thousand protestors from as far away as Illinois and California , was organized by groups that for more than a year have pushed Congress to create a government - run insurance plan to compete with private insurers as part of national healthcare overhaul .
While that policy objective , known as the public option , is not part of the healthcare legislation pending in Congress , the groups are nonetheless mounting a multi-million dollar campaign to promote the bill .
The effort will continue in coming weeks , with more demonstrations , paid advertising and other events , including a hearing to take place Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
Boy , there was a time when you could n't turn on the TV without seeing someone about Tea Party rallies .
I guess the only way you can get on TV these days is to be on the side of the insurance companies .

Indigenous tribes say the Belo Monte dam poses a threat to their way of life Brazil 's government has granted an environmental licence for the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam in the Amazon rainforest .
Environmental groups say the Belo Monte dam will cause devastation in a large area of the rainforest and threaten the survival of indigenous groups .
However , the government says whoever is awarded the project will have to pay $ 800 m to protect the environment .
The initial approval was a key step before investors could submit bids .
Resignations
The proposal to build a hydro-electric dam on the Xingu river , a tributary of the Amazon in the northern state of Para , has long been a source of controversy .
The initial project was abandoned in the 1990s amid widespread protests both in Brazil and around the world .
The government says the scheme has been modified to take account of fears that it would threaten the way of life of the indigenous peoples who live in the area .
Brazilian Environment Minister Carlos
Minc revealed that those who win the bidding process to build and operate Belo Monte will have to pay millions of dollars to protect the environment and meet 40 other conditions .
However , critics say diverting the flow of the Xingu river will still lead to devastation in a large area of the rainforest and damage fish stocks .
They say the lives of up to 40,000 people could be affected as 500 sq km of land would be flooded .
When it is completed , Belo Monte would be third largest hydro- electric dam in the world , after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu , which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay .
It is expected to provide electricity to 23 million Brazilian homes .
With Brazil 's economy continuing to show signs of growth , ministers say hydro- electric plants are a vital way to ensure power supplies over the next decade - and at least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region .
Critics say the Belo Monte plant will be hugely inefficient , generating less than 10 % of its capacity during the three to four months of the low - water season .
The project has even caused division and resignations within the government 's own environment agency Ibama , which , after much delay , has now given its initial approval .
Having passed this critical test the dam is now much closer to becoming a reality , but the controversy surrounding it is also unlikely to go away .

The inside of the single - use Peepoo bag is coated with urea crystals , which sterilize solid waste and break it down into fertilizer .
Image credit : Peepoople .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
About 40 percent of the earth ’s population , or 2.6 billion people , do not have access to a toilet , according to United Nations .
The unsanitary conditions have resulted in contaminated drinking water that causes diseases , such as diarrhea , which has become one of the leading causes of death in young children .
While efforts have been made to design inexpensive toilets , Swedish inventor Anders Wilhelmson is taking an even more low - tech approach to the problem .
He has designed the “ Peepoo , ” a biodegradable plastic bag that serves as a single - use toilet for individuals in the developing world .
After the bag is used and buried in the ground , urea crystals coating the bag sterilize the solid human waste and break it down into fertilizer for crops .
Wilhelmson says that his company , Peepoople , can sell the bags for about 2 or 3 cents .
An architect and professor in Stockholm , Wilhelmson was inspired by the current waste disposal methods used in the urban slums in Kenya .
People there simply put their human waste in a plastic bag and fling it away .
The bags are called “ helicopter toilets ” or “ flyaway toilets . ”
Wilhelmson ’s Peepoo bag is basically an environmentally friendly alternative that costs about the same as the ordinary plastic bags .
Plus , the Peepoo is odor - free for 24 hours so that it can temporarily be stored nearby .
Wilhelmson has successfully piloted the bag in Kenya and India last year , and plans to mass - produce the bag this summer .
Wilhelmson hopes that the Peepoo bag could help the United Nations reach its goal to cut the number of people without access to toilets in half by 2015 .
As an article in the New York Times notes , other low - cost toilets are also being introduced in the developing world .
For example , Singapore - based Rigel Technology recently demonstrated a $ 30 toilet that separates solid and liquid waste and turns solid waste into compost .
A low - cost toilet that uses excrement to produce biogas to be used for cooking is being promoted by Sulabh Internation , an Indian nonprofit .
However , Wilhelmson ’s simple and inexpensive sanitizing bag may have the advantage of easy implementation , especially for people living in the most poor and rural areas .

Tom Bissell is a young book author and contributor to The New Yorker and Harper's .
He is also a cocaine addict and Grand Theft Auto enthusiast .
In The Observer this week , he wrote a fascinating piece about the relationship between blow and gaming , and the impact of both on his life .
From The Observer :
In Vegas I had made a friend who shared my sacramental devotion to marijuana , my dilated obsession with gaming and my ballistic impatience to play GTA IV .
When I was walking home from my neighbourhood game store with my reserved copy of GTA IV in hand , I called my friend to tell him .
He let me know that , to celebrate the occasion , he was bringing over some " extra sweetener " .
My friend 's taste in recreational drug abuse vastly exceeded my own , and this extra sweetener turned out to be an alarming quantity of cocaine , a substance with which I had one prior and unexpectedly amiable experience , though I had not seen a frangible white nugget of the stuff since .
While the GTA IV load screen appeared on my television screen , my friend chopped up a dozen lines , reminded me of basic snorting protocol and handed me the straw .
I hesitated before taking the tiny hollow sceptre , but not for too long .
Know this : I was not someone whose life had been marked by the meticulous collection of bad habits .
I chewed tobacco , regularly drank about 10 Diet Cokes a day , and liked marijuana .
Beyond that , my greatest vice was probably reading poetry for pleasure .
The coke sailed up my nasal passage , leaving behind the delicious smell of a hot leather car seat on the way back from the beach .
My previous coke experience had made feeling good an emergency , but this was something else , softer and almost relaxing .
This coke , my friend told me , had not been " stepped on " with any amphetamine , and I pretended to know what that meant .
I felt as intensely focused as a diamond - cutting laser ; Grand Theft Auto IV was ready to go .
My friend and I played it for the next 30 hours straight .
High school seniors must pass national board exams to graduate from high school .
But those same board exams also serve as the rough equivalent of SATs for students applying to most programs in many universities , especially in the humanities .
However , students applying to some universities , especially those with technical programs like engineering , must also take separate entrance exams .
Since admissions are based overwhelmingly on board and entrance exams , testing season has mutated into a period of excruciating pressure for students and their families .
The pressure is so intense that a leading diabetes clinic in New Delhi this month attributed a sharp spike in patients with high blood sugar or elevated blood pressure to rising stress brought on by their children ’s testing season .
Last week , an 18 - year - old student in New Delhi hanged himself from a ceiling fan at home after leaving a suicide note worrying that he had not done well on part of the 12th - grade board exam .
The mania over testing underscores a fundamental disconnect in Indian education : Even as elite Indian students have achieved remarkable success studying overseas , the Indian educational system is widely considered to be failing both the tens of millions of students at the bottom , who drop out before high school , and the smaller pool at the top , who are competing for entrance into universities that are too few and too underfinanced .
Education presents such a stubborn problem , especially access to quality education , that experts warn that the future advantages of India ’s youthful population could become a disadvantage if the government cannot improve the system rapidly enough to provide more students a chance at college .
Of the 186 million students in India , only 12.4 percent are enrolled in higher education , one of the lowest ratios in the world .
Amish communities routinely practice the institution of rumspringa ( from the German herumspringen , to jump around ) .
At 17 , their children ( who until then have been subjected to strict family discipline ) are set free and allowed , solicited even , to go out and experience the ways of the " American " world around them .
They drive cars , listen to pop music , watch TV and get involved in drinking , drugs and wild sex .
After a couple of years , they are expected to decide :
Will they become members of the Amish community , or leave it and turn into ordinary American citizens ?
Far from allowing the youngsters a truly free choice - that is , giving them a chance to decide based on the full knowledge and experience of both sides of the choice - such a solution is a fake choice if there ever was one .
After long years of discipline and fantasizing about the illicit pleasures of the outside world , when the adolescent Amish are thrown into this world unprepared , they cannot but indulge in extremely transgressive behavior , gorging themselves fully on a life of sex , drugs and drinking .
And since they have never had the chance to develop any self - regulation in such a life , the wholly new and permissive situation inexorably backlashes , generating unbearable anxiety .
Thus , it is a safe bet that , after a couple of years , they will return to the seclusion of their community .
Indeed , 90 percent of the children do exactly that .
This is a perfect example of the difficulties that accompany the idea of a " free choice . "
While Amish adolescents are formally given a free choice , the conditions they find themselves in while choosing make the choice " unfree . "
In order for them to have a truly free choice , they would have to be properly informed of and educated about all their options .
However , the only way to do this would be to extract them from the Amish community , which would effectively render them American .
This deadlock also illustrates the problems with the standard liberal attitude toward Muslim women who wear veils :
They can do it if it is their free choice and not an option imposed on them by their husbands or family .
However , the moment women wear a veil as the result of their free choice ( say , in order to realize their own spirituality ) , the meaning of wearing a veil changes completely .
For liberals , it is no longer a sign of their belonging to the Muslim community , but an expression of their idiosyncratic individuality .
The difference is the same as the one between a Chinese farmer eating Chinese food because his village has done so from time immemorial and a citizen of a Western megalopolis deciding to go and have dinner at a local Chinese restaurant .
A choice is thus always a " meta - choice , " a choice that simultaneously defines and is defined by the conditions of the choice itself .
It is only the woman who does not choose to wear a veil who effectively makes a choice .
This is why , in our secular societies of choice , people who maintain a substantial religious belonging are in a subordinate position .
Even if they are allowed to maintain their belief , this belief is " tolerated " as an idiosyncratic personal choice or opinion .
The moment they present it publicly as what it is for them ( a matter of substantial belonging ) , they are deemed " fundamentalist . "
So what does all this have to do with the recent French ( and then Dutch ) vote of " No " to the European Constitution ?
Everything .
The French voters were treated exactly like the Amish youngsters .
They were not given a clear symmetrical choice .
The very terms of the choice privileged the " Yes " vote .
The elite proposed a choice that was effectively no choice at all - people were called to ratify the inevitable , the natural result of enlightened expertise .
The media and political elite presented the choice as one between knowledge and ignorance , between expertise and ideology , between post- political administration and old political passions of the left and the right .
The No was thus dismissed as a short - sighted fearful reaction to the emerging new postindustrial global order , an instinct to stick to and protect the comfortable Welfare State traditions - a gesture of refusal that lacked any positive alternative program .
It is little wonder that the only political parties whose official stance was
No were those at the extremes of the political spectrum : Le Pen 's Front National on the right and the Communists and Trotskyists on the left .
Furthermore , we 've been told , the No was really a No to many other things : Anglo - Saxon neoliberalism , Chirac and the present French government , the influx of immigrant workers from Poland who lower the wages of the French workers , etc .
( And before dismissing this last complaint as racist , one should keep in mind that this influx of immigrant workers is not the consequence of multicultural " tolerance . "
It effectively is part of capital 's strategy to hold in check the demands of workers ! )
However , even if there is an element of truth in all this , the very fact that the No was not sustained by a coherent alternative political vision is the strongest possible condemnation of the political and media elite , a monument to their inability to articulate and translate the people 's longings and dissatisfactions into a political vision .
Instead , in their reaction to the No voters , they treated them as retarded pupils who did not get the lesson of the experts :
Their self - criticism was that of the teacher who admits that he failed to properly educate his pupils .
So while the choice was not the choice between two political options , neither was it the choice between the enlightened vision of a modern Europe , ready to fit the new global order , and old confused political passions .
When commentators described the No as a message of confused fear , they were wrong .
The main fear was the fear that the refusal itself provoked in the new European political elite , the fear that people will no longer easily buy into their " post - political " vision .
For all others , the No is a message and expression of hope - hope that Politics is still alive and possible , that the debate about what the new Europe shall and should be is still open .
This is why those on the left should reject the sneering insinuation by liberals that , in our No , we found ourselves strange bedfellows with neo -Fascists .
What the new populist right and the left share is precisely this : the awareness that Politics proper is still alive .
For in fact , there was a positive choice in the No : the choice of the choice itself , the rejection of the blackmail by the new elite that offered us only the choice to either confirm their expert knowledge or to display our " irrational " immaturity .
The No vote is the positive decision to start a properly Political debate about what kind of Europe we really want .
Late in his life , Freud asked the famous question Was will das Weib ?
( " What does Woman want ? " ) , admitting his perplexity when faced with the enigma of feminine sexuality .
Does n't the imbroglio with the European Constitution bear witness to the same puzzlement : Which Europe do we want ?
To put it bluntly , do we want to live in a world in which the only choice is between the American civilization and the emerging Chinese authoritarian - capitalist one ?
If the answer is no , then the only alternative is Europe .
The Third World cannot generate a strong enough resistance to the ideology of the American Dream .
In the present constellation , only Europe can do so .
The true opposition today is not the one between the United States and the Third World , but the one between the whole of the American global Empire ( and its Third World colonies ) and Europe .
Theodor Adorno claimed that what we are getting in the contemporary " administered world " and its " repressive desublimation " is no longer the old logic of social authority 's repression of the Id ( the individual 's illicit aggressive drives ) .
Rather , we have a perverse pact between the punitive Superego 's legally sanctioned social authority and the Id 's illicit aggressive drives at the expense of the Ego 's rationality .
Today , something structurally similar is going on at the political level .
We have a weird pact between postmodern global capitalism and premodern societies at the expense of modernity proper .
The United States is essentially " at home " in Third World countries , exploiting them ( economically and culturally ) in a true relationship of symbiosis : exporting high tech products and food , importing raw materials and the products of sweatshops , flooding them with U.S. pop culture and appropriating selected " authentic " aboriginal culture and arts .
It is easy for the American multiculturalist global Empire to integrate premodern local traditions .
The foreign body that it cannot effectively assimilate is European modernity .
So although the French and Dutch No is not sustained by a coherent and detailed alternative vision , it at least clears the space for it .
This void demands to be filled with new projects - in contrast to the pro-Constitution stance that effectively precludes thinking , presenting us with an administrative - political fait accompli .
The message of this No to all of us who care for Europe is :
We will not allow anonymous experts whose merchandise is sold to us in a brightly colored , liberal - multiculturalist package to prevent us from thinking .
It is time for us " Europeans " - both citizens and lovers of Europe - to become aware that we have to make a properly Political decision of what we want .
No enlightened administrator will do the job for us .

In The Score , American composers on creating “ classical ” music in the 21st century .
Back in October I was interviewed by Cornelius Dufallo , a fine violinist who recently performed a piece of mine .
He sent me a list of questions , the last being , “ Any advice for young composers ? ”
The question took me by surprise — was n’t I a young composer , too ?
When did I make the transition to not - so - young composer ?
Every day I have moments when I feel like a young composer : I struggle with starting projects , experiment with unfamiliar techniques , and deal with interpersonal challenges .
There are so many times when I feel like I lack a manual in my day - to - day life .
How do I find the time to compose and still take care of all of the boring administrative tasks ?
What ’s the best approach to take with a temperamental musician ?
Can the violinist really play a phrase that fast , or will his fingers turn into a tangle of scorched flesh ?
The occasional impossible aesthetic decision can seem easy in comparison .
Truth is , if I had the answers to all of the questions , my life would be a lot less interesting .
Looking for the answers and keeping an open mind is what keeps it exciting .
When I first moved to New York , a friend and colleague proudly announced to me that he no longer played experimental music .
He was a great improviser who coaxed wild sounds out of his instrument , but he was content with where his work had led him , so he stopped exploring .
I found it both funny and disturbing — here was a guy who was willing to get on stage and work his way through a strange vocabulary of very original sounds .
Why would he give up experimenting ?
It convinced me to keep turning over rocks to see what kind of musical wildlife I could uncover in the dirt , and to avoid getting comfortable with any single approach or style .
Sometimes it means experimenting with a new sound , technique , or combination of instruments , or investigating a way to express myself while writing for a more traditionally trained group of musicians .
I ’ve managed to strike a balance between having enough confidence in my own music to develop my own sound , but enough curiosity and restlessness to continue to change it .
If there ’s a formula to writing music , I have n’t found it , and I hope I never do .
Why would I want to hover between being a greenhorn and seasoned old hand ?
So I can retain the excitement and the willingness to make mistakes that come with youthful enthusiasm , and temper it with the knowledge , skills , and confidence that come with experience .
As the decades pass , there ’s nothing I ’d like more than to be a young composer trapped inside the body of a grand old lady .
So I try to keep these points in mind :
Always consider yourself a young composer .
Throughout your life as a composer there will always be more to learn , more to explore , and more to write .
Take your work seriously , but do n’t take yourself too seriously .
Once you ’ve recovered from the grand aesthetic statement you just made , make sure your music is actually playable .
And , hopefully , readable .
A sense of humor will help you get through difficult times , and could help deflect the fact that the pianist might have to grow a few extra fingers to play that epiphanal earth - shattering chord that you refuse to change .
If you work with electronics , remain calm in the face of computer crashes .
Better to distract the crowd with a joke then to show off your trembling hands when you fumble to re-boot your computer .
A few years ago I staged a site - specific performance of my factory - inspired piece “ EWA7 ” to a packed house at the cavernous Brooklyn Anchorage .
At the climax of the piece , my sampler died , and I suddenly felt like I was being sucked into a sonic vacuum .
I cued my bandmates , Roger Kleier and Jim Pugliese , to keep going , regained my composure , and got my sampler up and running again .
Good save — until the next climactic moment , when it crashed again .
Erin Baiano for The New York Times
It was nerve - wracking , annoying , and a little bit funny , but I managed to keep my cool , supported by two great improvisers who could turn on a dime .
After the concert , an audience member told me his favorite dramatic moment was when the music built to a frenzy , and then the sampler suddenly dropped to nothing .
I chalked it up to a happy accident and worked it into future performances of the piece .
Details count .
I ’ve put a lot of time into developing some very noisy pieces .
Although your ultimate goal may be something that sounds fast and dirty , there is almost always room for improvement as you refine your sounds , your scores , or your techniques .
Be willing to put yourself and your music on the line .
If you do n’t believe in your music , nobody else will .
If you ’re trying something new , be prepared for those lonely times when you may be the only one who believes in your work .
At least you ’ll have yourself — buy yourself a drink and be good company .
Avoid well - worn paths .
The world of “ new music ” is not the esoteric , marginalized place that it used to be .
Now that there are more composers who have actually found some success and made some money , there is a clearer career path .
Avoid that path — you already know where it leads .
The composers you admire did n’t get where they are by imitating others .
Inspiration and influence are a far cry from imitation , so listen , observe , and then dig deeper to find your own music .
Do n’t fear rejection .
Hats off to you if you annoy some of your audience — you may actually be trying something new .
When I ask other musicians “ How was your gig ? ” the answer I hear more and more frequently is “ Everybody loved it ” .
When did that become socially acceptable ?
Is this the result of a culture in which every child gets a trophy ?
New music should n’t be a popularity contest — that ’s why god gave us pop music ( unless the devil did . ) .
If everybody actually did love your concert , appreciate the accolades , but consider how your work did or did n’t challenge yourself and your audience .
Maybe they actually did love it because it was something new , maybe your audience is made up of supportive friends , or maybe that open bar did the trick .
Do n’t assume you know what ’s accessible to the audience and what is n’t .
I have n’t met an audience member yet who praised a concert for its watered down music and rehashed ideas .
In spite of ( and maybe in response to ) the expanding reach of mainstream media , there is a growing audience of people looking for challenging , unfamiliar new music .
It ’s your job to challenge them .
If you chose to study composition , spend your time in school studying what you ca n’t learn in a club or a garage .
If all you really want to do is play in a band , you ’ll learn more playing in a club than you ever would in a classroom .
Plus you ’ll get to drink beer .
If you want to learn skills geared towards notated music , or want to have access to say , a school orchestra , and a teacher that has mastered orchestration , that ’s the time to rack up those tuition bills .
If you ’re interested in electronics , and having access to advanced technical facilities , consider how much you can learn using your own computer and a manual , and get a head start .
You ’ll probably come up with more original ideas if you begin by teaching yourself .
When I was studying music , I found all of the emphasis on putting together a proper score tedious .
Ear training drove me crazy .
When I started playing in bands and improvising , I was ready to kiss all of that goodbye .
I would n’t have dreamed that the music I blasted through with my own band would eventually wind up on paper .
Having the skills to notate my own music meant that my own personal noisy style could be translated to a whole world of musicians who would n’t be able to play it otherwise .
By combining traditional notation with open sections and solos , I could clearly communicate a piece to musicians anywhere in the world without having to be there to lead them through a rehearsal .
Make sure you ’re always doing some work that is yours and yours alone — not composed for the approval of teachers or colleagues .
There ’s a chasm between writing in school and writing in the real world .
Regardless of what you ’re doing in school , you should always write something that ’s not subject to grades .
You may learn a lot comparing what you write for yourself to write for others .
Guidance can be helpful at times , but I have never found authority to inspire creativity .
When I was studying composition at U.S.C. , I would sneak into the Arnold Schoenberg Institute after hours to rehearse .
It gave me access to a stage and a P.A. without having to run my music past my teachers , so I could experiment with my own band and work with other improvisers .
It was a very conservative environment , so it was especially fun to sneak around , another great motivating factor that got me started as a composer / performer / improviser .
Never discount the power of the library .
Scores and recordings hold knowledge that can lead you down paths you may not find elsewhere .
Consider the score your road map , or blueprint , and see how others constructed music .
Remain curious and ask questions .
Musicians are your best resource , and they love to show you what they can ( and ca n ’t ) do .
I always stay in close contact with the musicians for whom I ’m writing , and I ’m never afraid to ask questions .
Ultimately we all learn from a new piece .
A commission is a great excuse to get the process started — the performer will share the techniques that he or she has developed over the years , and get a better piece in the end .
I ’ve been fortunate to work closely on new commissions with Joan Jeanrenaud , Felix Fan , Lisa Moore , David Cossin , Blair McMillen , George Kentros , Marco Cappelli , and many others , all masters of their instruments .
If you ’re just starting out , keep an open mind about commissioning fees — just get the piece written .
Allow yourself to be led down the garden path .
Your mistakes may teach you more than your neatly constructed pieces .
I hear the complaint “ I did n’t get it ” too often .
It ’s music , you do n’t always have to get it .
It ’s not like piloting a jet or performing brain surgery : if you experiment , nobody will die in a terrible accident .
There does n’t always have to be a narrative thread or a familiar reference in music , it ’s one of the few disciplines in which you can lose yourself , and the sensory experience in itself can be something entirely new .
Make music , and make music happen .
The more you write , play , improvise , listen to , and think about music , the better .
If your grand opus is n’t being premiered by the New York Philharmonic , do n’t despair .
Set up a solo gig at a local venue and play your own music .
Build a community of musicians and start your own ensemble , band or collective and learn from each other .
Take advantage of a good - news - bad - news situation : the strict boundaries between musical genres are crumbling , but performance opportunities are decreasing .
Be creative , anything can happen anywhere .
Support live music and try to get to know artists that you admire .
Before I moved to New York , I lived in Los Angeles , where I volunteered at organizations that booked new music and I helped bring in many improvisers and new music luminaries from New York .
It was a great way to get to know people , and learn more about the music .
Seeing my heroes asleep on my couch ( or floor ) destroyed any romantic notions I had about being an active musician in this scene .
By the time I moved to New York , I was already friendly with many of the musicians I admired most .
I ’ve toured the world , taught in universities , played in dives , factories , and concert halls , and recorded three CD ’s under my own name .
All of this experience has made me a better composer , but the really tough artistic challenges have kept it exciting .
I hope each generation brings in a new crop of composers that are ready to annoy the last generation .
And I hope I ’m there in decades to come , as I become a young composer trapped inside the body of a grand old lady , still ready to come out fighting .

It 's a good thing Wall Street bonuses rebounded in 2009 because otherwise the State of New York would be totally screwed .
Yesterday the Comptroller released its survey of the state 's sales tax receipts -- a proxy for consumer spending that shows a trend opposite to Wall Street .
Here 's the top - line view :
Counties across New York State , including New York City , saw one of the sharpest declines in sales tax collections on record , according to a report released by State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli .
The report , which compares 2009 to 2008 collections , found a 5.9 decrease in collections statewide .
Only four counties saw an increase but these numbers were primarily due to administrative and technical adjustments , not better economic performance .
“ This is yet another sign that the Great Recession is having a continuing impact on our communities across New York , ” said DiNapoli .
“ These numbers are sobering .
Fortunately , many local governments have taken sometimes painful budgetary steps to stave off disaster .
It ’s a struggle , but all levels of government have to make every taxpayer dime count . ”
Among the report ’s findings :
Fifty - three of New York ’s 57 counties outside of New York City saw a sales tax decline and many of these counties share sales tax revenues with their municipalities ;
The largest decline occurred in the Lower Hudson Valley , at 8.4 percent ;
In state fiscal year 2009 - 10 , the state ’s sales tax base ( value of all goods and services subject to the sales tax ) shrank by 7.1 percent ;
Among New York ’s counties , Westchester saw the steepest drop at 10.3 percent ;
The Mohawk Valley region saw the smallest downturn at 2.5 percent ;
Only Oneida , Chautauqua , Schuyler and Seneca counties saw increases , but this growth was mostly attributable to factors other than economic growth ; and
According to the New York State Association of Counties , most counties prudently budgeted little or no growth in their sales tax revenues for 2010 .
A few charts exemplify the trouble the state faced :
And here 's a breakdown by notable region :
At the same time , Comptroller DiNapoli warned of a $ 2 billion budget shortfall for the current year .
( CNN ) --
Nine people federal prosecutors say belong to a " Christian warrior " militia were accused Monday of plotting to kill a Michigan law enforcement officer and then attack other police at the funeral .
Six Michigan residents , two residents of Ohio and an Indiana resident were indicted by a federal grand jury in Detroit , Michigan , on charges of seditious conspiracy , attempted use of weapons of mass destruction , teaching the use of explosive materials and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence , U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade and FBI Special Agent in Charge Andrew Arena announced .
All but one of the suspects -- Joshua Matthew Stone , the 21 - year - old son of the militia 's leader -- were in custody by Monday morning and seven of them made their initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald A. Scheer , prosecutors said .
Joshua Stone was arrested late Monday after he walked out of a mobile home in southern Michigan 's Hillsdale County and surrendered without incident , FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold told CNN .
Five other adults and a child were also at the home , she said .
" We were negotiating with him all days from a staging location near a church , " Berchtold said , adding that authorities used a loudspeaker to draw Stone out .
Stone , who will be arraigned Tuesday morning , is the son of David Brian Stone -- leader of what prosecutors say is a Lenawee County " Christian warrior " militia group called the Hutaree .
Read the indictment ( PDF )
The five - count indictment unsealed Monday charges that between August 2008 and the present , the defendants , acting as a Lenawee County , Michigan , militia group , conspired to use force to oppose the authority of the U.S. government .
Attorney General Eric Holder called it " an insidious plan by anti-government extremists . "
The group says on its Web site that Hutaree means " Christian warrior " and proclaims on its home page , " Preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive . "
In the " About Us " section of the Hutaree Web site , the group says , " We believe that one day , as prophecy says , there will be an Anti-Christ .
All Christians must know this and prepare , just as Christ commanded . "
The Southern Poverty Law Center , a nonprofit organization that monitors hate groups and other fringe organizations , lists the Hutaree as a " Patriot " group militia .
" Generally , Patriot groups define themselves as opposed to the ' New World Order , ' engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing or advocate or adhere to extreme anti-government doctrines , " the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report , " Rage on the Right : The Year in Hate and Extremism . "
The Law Center also defines Patriot groups as " militias and other organizations that see the federal government as part of a plot to impose ' one - world government ' on liberty - loving Americans . "
Mention of the Hutaree comes in the Law Center 's list : " Active ' Patriot ' Groups in the United States in 2009 . "
The suspects were identified as militia leader David Brian Stone , 45 ; his wife , Tina Stone , 44 ; his son , Joshua Matthew Stone , 21 , of Clayton , Michigan ; another son , David Brian Stone Jr. , 19 , of Adrian , Michigan ; Joshua Clough , 28 , of Blissfield , Michigan ; Michael Meeks , 40 , of Manchester , Michigan ; Thomas Piatek , 46 , of Whiting , Indiana ; Kristopher Sickles , 27 , of Sandusky , Ohio ; and Jacob Ward , 33 , of Huron , Ohio .
A bond hearing was set for 1 p.m. Wednesday .
A court - appointed counsel will be assigned to the seven suspects who were in court Monday because none of them had lawyers .
According to the indictment , Hutaree members view local , state and federal law enforcement authorities as the enemy and have been preparing to engage them in armed conflict .
The indictment alleges that the Hutaree planned to kill an unidentified law enforcement officer in Michigan and then attack officers and others who would gather for the funeral .
According to the plan , the indictment says , the Hutaree wanted to use improvised explosive devices to attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession .
The indictment says those explosive devices , commonly called IEDs , constitute weapons of mass destruction .
Subsequently , the indictment says , Hutaree leader David Brian Stone obtained information about IEDs over the Internet and e-mailed diagrams to a person he believed could manufacture them .
He then had one of his sons , Joshua Matthew Stone , and others gather materials necessary to manufacture IEDs , the indictment alleges .
According to the indictment , David Brian Stone and David Brian Stone Jr. taught other Hutaree members in June how to make and use explosive devices .
In addition , the grand jury charged all nine defendants with carrying or possessing a firearm during a crime of violence on at least one occasion .
" Because the Hutaree had planned a covert reconnaissance operation for April which had the potential of placing an unsuspecting member of the public at risk , the safety of the public and of the law enforcement community demanded intervention at this time , " U.S. Attorney McQuade said .
The UK Lottery now runs a number of draws during the week National Lottery operator Camelot has been sold to a Canadian teachers ' pension fund for £ 389 m .
The company , currently owned by a consortium that includes Cadbury , has been running the UK's National Lottery since it began in 1994 .
The sale will be looked at by the regulator , the National Lottery Commission .
One of the factors in its decision will be whether or not the national interest will be served by the sale .
Camelot 's proposed buyer , the Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan - known simply as Teachers ' - runs the pension fund for more than a quarter of a million Canadian teachers .
It already has a wide range of investments in the UK , including Birmingham and Bristol airports and a 27 % stake in Northumbrian Water .
The National Lottery Commission 's chief executive , Mark Harris , said : " We will scrutinise the proposal to ensure that the Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan is fit and proper to take over the running of the National Lottery and that the commitments we secured for the National Lottery , players and good causes during the licence competition are safeguarded . "
Patience Wayne Kozun , Teachers ' senior vice - president for public equities , said the company was a long - term investor : " We look forward to partnering with management to realise the full potential of the Camelot business over the remaining licence term and into the future . "
Last year , Camelot was given a 10 - year licence to run the Lottery - its third stint as operator .
Camelot 's chief executive , Dianne Thompson , said of the £ 389 m ( $ 583 m ) sale : " We welcome Teachers ' commitment to The National Lottery 's ongoing success , and look forward to the opportunity of working with them . "
Sales of the game , which raises money for a range of good causes , have been rising recently , despite - or perhaps because of - the economic downturn .
Camelot said part of the reason for its recent success was also due to the growing number of people choosing to play online or via their mobile phones .
The National Lottery Commission will take up to three months to consider the proposal .

When the Supreme Court decided the case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , henceforth allowing corporate soft money to influence U.S. elections , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) cynically opined that it would lead to the election of the “ congressman from Wal - Mart . ”
Turns out , he may be right .
Meet Murray Hill , Inc. , the first corporation to run for Congress in the United States .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Until now , corporations only influenced politics with high - paid lobbyists and backroom deals , ” the company ’s YouTube account declares .
“ But today , thanks to an enlightened supreme court , corporations now have all the rights the founding fathers meant for us .
That ’s why Murray Hill Incorporated is taking democracy ’s next step– running for Congress . ”
Murray Hill , Inc. even has a fan page on Facebook , and a campaign ad .
Watch :
Hill says it plans to file as a Republican for the GOP primary in Maryland ’s eighth congressional district , currently represented by Democrat Chris Van Hollen .
Van Hollen , along with Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) , introduced legislation in February they hope will help blunt the effect of the court ’s decision by restoring some of the restrictions on corporate campaign spending .
Hill reportedly has “ no beef ” with Van Hollen , though the position seems more part of the campaign ’s schtick than anything .
ADVERTISEMENT
The company , a self - titled “ progressive ” messaging firm , was launched in 2005 by one Eric Hensal , who used to work with Group360 , an advocacy organization in Washington , D.C .
Hill said in a statement that its campaign would put people “ second , or even third , ” according to The Washington Post .
“ It ’s a new day , ” Hill ’s ad says .
“ Until now , corporations influenced politics with high paid lobbyists and backroom deals .
However , as much as corporate interests gave to politicians , we could never be absolutely sure they would do our bidding .
But today , thanks to an enlightened Supreme Court , corporations now have all the rights the founding fathers meant for us .
It ’s our democracy : we bought it , we paid for it and we ’re going to keep it . ”

Hill “ wanted to run as a Republican because we feel the Republican Party is more receptive to our basic message that corporations are people , too , ” campaign manager William Klein told the Post .
When the Supreme Court first decided Citizens United , 41 industry leaders signed a letter to Congress urging the end of what they called corporate “ bribery . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Is there a difference between campaign contributions and bribery ? ” said Alan Hassenfeld , chairman of Hasbro , Inc , who co-signed the letter .
“ It is long past the time to stop requiring that our elected officials moonlight as telemarketers raising money for their re-election campaigns rather then devoting all their time to solving the problems before this nation . ”
A blogger with watchdog group The Sunlight Foundation called the decision the “ corporate globalization ” of U.S. elections , cautioning that allowing corporate funds in elections would also make way for undue foreign influence on U.S. politics .
“ It allows corporations to spend all the money they want to buy and sell elected officials through the campaign process , ” Rep. Grayson said of the Citizens United case .
“ It allows them to reward political sellouts , and it allows them to punish elected officials who actually try to do what ’s right for the people . ”

In the old days , police officers wrote traffic tickers primarily to keep people safe and to prevent citizens from breaking the traffic laws .
But in the new Amerika , all of that has changed .
Now traffic tickets are primarily viewed as a revenue raising tool for state and local governments .
For example , a federally funded ticketing blitz in the state of Virginia resulted in a total of 6996 traffic tickets being handed out this past weekend .
This most recent ticketing blitz is part of a campaign code - named “ Operation Air , Land & Speed ” .
Last Saturday and Sunday state troopers were ordered to absolutely saturate Interstate 95 and Interstate 81 and to issue as many traffic tickets as humanly possible during those two days .
Why ?
Well , it turns out that the state of Virginia has a 2.2 billion dollar budget deficit that they are trying to deal with , and so they need to find some quick sources of cash .
You see , state and local governments all over the nation are massively jacking up traffic fines and are starting to write a lot more tickets in an attempt to “ enhance ” their streams of revenue .
In other words , state and local governments across the U.S. are broke and so they need some suckers to prey on .
Not that it was ever a good idea to break the traffic laws .
But now even a minor violation can put a massive hole in your wallet .
For instance , driving as little as 15 miles an hour over the speed limit in Virginia can get you a reckless driving charge that can carry a fine of up to $ 2500 .
So why the hefty fines ?
Well , the law increasing the traffic fines in Virginia clearly admitted why they are so high … .
“ The purpose of the civil remedial fees imposed in this section is to generate revenue . ” ( Virginia Code 46.2-206.1 )
Are you starting to get the picture ?
But this kind of thing is not just happening in Virginia .
“ Sobriety checkpoints ” in the state of California are increasingly bring used as revenue raising operations .
It turns out that these sobriety checkpoints are far more likely to seize cars from unlicensed motorists than they are to catch drunk drivers .
So how profitable are these “ sobriety ” checkpoints ?
Well , research done by the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley with California Watch discovered that impounds at “ sobriety ” checkpoints in 2009 alone generated approximately 40 million dollars in towing fees and police fines .
That is what you call a source of revenue .
In Detroit , even the police admit that the fundamental nature of police work is changing .
Just consider the following quote from from Police Chief Michael Reaves of Utica , Michigan … .
“ When I first started in this job 30 years ago , police work was never about revenue enhancement , but if you ’re a chief now , you have to look at whether your department produces revenues . ”
Sgt. Richard Lyons of Trenton , Michigan is even more blunt about what is happening in his community … .
“ They ’re trying to use police officers to balance the budget on the backs of drivers , and it ’s too bad .
The people we count on to support us and help us when we ’re on the road are the ones who end up paying the bills , and they ’re ticked off about it .
We might as well just go door to door and tell people , ‘ Slide us $ 100 now since your 16 - year - old is going to end up paying us anyway when he starts driving . ’
You ca n’t blame people for getting upset . ”
But some localities are converting to even more automated ways of making money from drivers .
For example , “ red - light cameras ” have become huge revenue raising tools in many areas of the country .
In Los Angeles , revenue from red - light cameras has doubled from $ 200,000 a month in 2007 to $ 400,000 a month at the end of 2009 .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wants cities and counties in his state to take things even farther .
He wants them to install speed sensors on existing red - light cameras .
Speeders caught by these sensors would face fines ranging from $ 225 to $ 325 .
Do n’t all of us wish we could start a business that could make so much money from each customer ?
California state officials believe that these speed sensors would raise more than 300 million dollars for the state of California by the end of 2011 .
All of this is enough to make one want to drive like a grandmother .
Except then they would get you for going too slow .
Seriously .
The reality is that you have to be very , very careful out there now because the nature of driving in America has fundamentally changed .
Whether it is rapidly increasing traffic fines or all of the toll roads going in everywhere , American drivers are increasingly being viewed as a big fat revenue source .
And as the current economic collapse gets even worse , drivers are going to be preyed upon even more by state and local governments .
If you have not already done so , now is the time to change the way that you drive .
Do n’t give state and local governments an excuse to take even more of your hard - earned money from you than they are already .
The Frost / Nixon book by James Reston , Jr. gets a makeover .
When it turned out that Nixon -- " the man who committed the greatest felony in American history " -- was never going to stand trial for his crimes , it fell to journalists to provide the conviction - by - proxy that justice , democracy and the American people so desperately needed .
It is now thirty years after Frost gutted Nixon on national teevee , sparing us ( or so we thought ) yet another , inevitable Nixonian rise from yet another political grave followed by yet another giddy , fascist Conservative wilding through the streets of America .
But far from having learned from our mistakes , we instead repeated them .
On steroids .
And cut with Hulk gamma - irradiated monkey growth hormones .
We got the Bush Regime , arguably the most incompetent , corrupt and outright - treasonous Administration in American history .
A regime so reckless , savage and gleefully bestial that it made the career - Nixon - hating Hunter Thompson actually pine for the good old days of Tricky Dick :
" I miss Nixon .
Compared to these Nazis we have in the White House now , Richard Nixon was a flaming liberal . "
And , like Nixon , it is more than likely that not a single one of the smirking traitors who nearly wrecked this country will ever spend a day in jail .
Instead they remain lodged in our flesh like so many ricin pellets , oozing their poison into our national bloodstream , waddle from one fawning audience to another , worming their way into major media outlets , or dispatching their degenerate children and underlings out into the world the keep their poison pumping .
They soiled our good name , bankrupted the country , shredded the Constitution and kicked the crutches out from under the global economy on their way out the door , and while it is sometimes hard to focus on them through the flames of the world they set on fire , we must .
We must , because if we do not formally , culturally shun them , break with them and come to look back on them forever with horror and shame , they and their imitators and fanboys will fester .
And without cleaning and binding up the deep and ugly wound they slashed across our national soul , their disease will continue to rage and rot us from within .
Which brings us to Sunday .
In four days , one of the principle architects of this depraved Administration will be on teevee .
Pimpin ' a book .
A book which Media Matters has documented is full of lies .
He will be interviewed for approximately 30 minutes by Famous Journalist , Tom Brokaw .
You perhaps see where I 'm going with this ...
Rove , of course , is a known quantity ; a conscienceless thug who would be rotting in prison cell over in the Better Universe .
But we do n't live in the Better Universe .
We live here , which means this is about Tom Brokaw .
If he has any reporter left in him at all , on Sunday he has a chance to do some old - fashioned , journalistic public service flogging .
He has been handed on a platter of the finest Sterling the opportunity to do what none of us out here in the cold , bloggy world will ever even come close to getting a shot at : demanding answers from Karl Rove face - to - face .
To act as an advocate on behalf of the public 's right to know .
To honorably " afflict the comfortable " and restore a small portion of the trust which the Fourth Estate has spend the last few decades frittering away so easily and cheaply ; an cynical erosion of one of the most critical , load - bearing pillars of democracy that reached its nadir during the Age of Bush .
If he has any reporter left in him at all , he can help to lay the Foundations of History on which the judgments of future generations will rest .
If not -- if Tom Brokaw lets this oily little Judas slip through his fingers in the name of the clubby , malignant courtesy that elitist Villager insiders habitually extend to their lodge brothers , then the the best and possibly last opportunity to bring Karl Rove to some kind of public book for his crimes against democracy will have passed .
And like that ...
... he 'll be gone .
Which gives us just a few , short days to email , blog , Twitter and in every other way we know how contact Tom Brokaw and NBC and let them know that " We The People " are tired of having a Freedom of the Press for which so many millions of Americans have fought and died used a puke funnel for everything from the tribulations of drunken celebrities to long - discredited Neocon drivel , but never for anything so genuinely vital to the survival our democracy as holding some of its worst predators to account for their predations .
On your marks .
Get set ...

Renewable energy threatens the planet .
Who knew ?
" Our nation runs the risk of damaging the environment , in the name of saving the environment .
" There are negative consequences from producing energy from the sun , the wind and the earth . "
So , at least , said Lamar Alexander , the Republican senator from Tennessee and a long - time conservationist , during a speech Monday at Resources for the Future .
What ’s he worried about ?
The danger that developing thousands of wind turbines , building solar - thermal power plants which spread across the desert and cultivating acres upon acres of land for biofuels will create “ energy sprawl , ” consuming too much territory and threatening wildlife .
Citing a study by the Nature Conservancy , Alexander warned that “ during the next 20 years , new energy production , especially biofuels and wind power , will consume a land mass larger than the state of Nebraska . ”
What ’s his solution ?
Nuclear power , which produces lots of low - carbon electricity in a way that ’s least likely to harm wildlife and the landscape .
Speaking to an audience of environmentalists at RFF , a respected , nonpartisan think tank , Alexander said , “ I want to ask you to do something that gives many conservationists a stomach ache whenever it is mentioned -- and that is to rethink nuclear power . ”
Even though the U.S. has n’t built a nuclear power plant since 1990 ( and 12 states have laws banning them ) , nukes produce “ 70 percent of our carbon - free electricity , ” far more than wind or solar power , he noted .
Of the world ’s major emitters of greenhouse gases , only the U.S. has no nuclear plants under construction .
If China and India build lots of nuclear plants , at a reasonable cost -- admittedly a big if -- they will not only be able to compete against the U.S. with cheap labor , but with cheap low - carbon power , too .
Interesting , no ?
As I listened to Alexander , he struck me as a Republican who might be willing to work with Democrats to deal with the climate crisis .
( See yesterday ’s blogpost , How Republicans Can Save the Climate Bill . )
After all , as he told the crowd at RFF , he grew up hiking and camping in the Great Smoky Mountains , supported strict emission standards for pollutants from coal plants and believes man-made burning of fossil fuels contributes to global warming .
He opposes the mountaintop - removal method of coal mining and drives a plug - in hybrid .
Waxing lyrical , he said : “ Italy may have its art , India its Taj Mahal , but we have the Great American Outdoors . ”
But his love for the outdoors takes him only so far , it turns out .
When it comes to climate change politics , Alexander sticks closely to the Republican message that a cap - and - trade system to regulate carbon pollution is a tax that will raise energy prices .
Even if Democrats were to endorse to embrace the nuclear option -- Alexander wants to see 100 new nuclear plants built in the next 20 years , backed by as much as $ 100 billion in federal loan guarantees -- he wo n’t support carbon regulation that would raise fuel costs , he told me after his speech .
“ I ’m all for climate legislation , ” Alexander said , “ but an economywide cap - and - trade program is a big mistake . ”
So much for bipartisanship .
Even so , Alexander has called attention to a real problem -- the pressures on land use created by unwise development of wind , solar and biofuels .
The Nature Conservancy report , called Energy Sprawl or Energy Efficiency : Climate Policy Impacts on Natural Habitat for the United States of America , is a scientific , peer - reviewed study that compares the land - use impact of energy options .
It says , among other things , that :
The land - use intensity of different energy production techniques varies over three orders of magnitude , from 1.9–2.8 km2/ TW hr /yr for nuclear power to 788–1000 km2 / TW hr /yr for biodiesel from soy .
In all scenarios , temperate deciduous forests and temperate grasslands will be most impacted by future energy development , although the magnitude of impact by wind , biomass , and coal to different habitat types is policy - specific .
Translating the findings , Alexander said :
The gold standard for land usage is nuclear power .
You can get a million megawatt hours of electricity a year -- that ’s the standard unit the authors chose -- per square mile , using nuclear power .
The second most compact form of renewable energy is geothermal energy .
To generate the same amount of power , coal requires four square miles , taking into account all the land required for mining and extraction .
Solar thermal takes six square miles .
Natural gas takes seven square miles and petroleum 17 .
Photovoltaic cells that turn sunlight directly into electricity require 14 square miles and wind is even more dilute , requiring 28 square miles .
You get the feeling Alexander really does n’t like wind power .
He says that turbines are “ the length of a football field , they are noisy and their flashing lights can be seen for up to 20 miles ” and that if we build enough wind turbines to generate 20 percent of the nation ’s electricity ( 186,000 ) they will kill an estimated 1.4 million birds .
( Maybe , but I ’ve been told that cats kill more birds than wind turbines . )
By contrast , he ’s confident that the nuclear waste problem is solvable and that nuclear plants are safe , citing , among others , Energy Secretary Steven Chu , a lonely pro-nuclear voice on the Obama team .
Chu favors expanding federal loan guarantees for nukes .
What to make of all this ?
First , it ’s worth noting ( and Alexander did ) that The Nature Conservancy did not endorse nukes in its report .
In this blogpost , Rob McDonald , one of the authors , writes that his work has been “ put to rhetorical use ” by many , including Alexander , who assailed renewable energy “ as an unprecedented assault on the American landscape ” in The Wall Street Journal .
That seems a little extreme no ?
They may not like wind turbines on Cape Cod but in much of the Midwest farmers embrace them as a new cash crop .
Second , as McDonald writes :
… climate change is the big threat to America ’s wildlife ( and to our communities ) .
Severe climate change has the potential to imperil many more species than energy sprawl .
So before we fret too much about energy sprawl -- which can be managed by wisely siting renewable power facilities -- we ought to have a strong climate regulation program in place .
Alexander ’s plan for a combination of nukes , electric cars and solar power on rooftops but no economywide carbon rules fails to meet that test .
Third , environmentalists should seriously rethink nuclear power .
As Alexander put it :
My fellow Tennessean Al Gore won a Nobel Prices for arguing that global warming is the inconvenient problem .
If you believe he is right , and if you are also concerned about energy sprawl , then I would suggest that nuclear power is the inconvenient solution .

With Smallville headed to its 10th season , it 's time to ask the question that we 've been wondering since day one :
Why have n't producers tried to make lightning strike a second time , with the most obvious other candidate - Wonder Woman ?
Advertisement
I know :
You all thought I was going to say " Batman , " did n't you ?
But considering that Smallville was the product of a failed pitch for a show called Bruce Wayne - which would 've followed a teenage Bruce on his travels around the world training to become the future Dark Knight - our bat - eared friend has long been considered off - limits for this kind of treatment , sadly ( The pitch , which was apparently loved by television executives , was rumored to have been killed by Warners executives convinced there was still cinematic life left in the character .
Considering that Christopher Nolan came on board soon after this decision , history has pretty much proven them right , but I can't help but wish we 'd gotten Bruce Wayne instead of Smallville .
For the curious amongst you , Smallville actually got its name from one of the potential episodes mentioned in the Wayne pitch , which would 've seen the teenage Wayne visit the small midwestern town and meet a young Clark Kent .
And now you know ) .
However , despite numerous rumors and attempts to the contrary , no such movie boundaries surround Wonder Woman , which makes us wonder ( no pun intended ) , where 's her show ?
It 's not as if Warners have n't given thought to trying to create a second Smallville ; besides the failed Aquaman pilot Mercy Reef , preparatory work was said to be underway for both a Green Arrow spin - off and Robin - centric The Graysons .
But , besides the apparent lunacy of trying to base shows around some of DC Comics , uh , less - charismatic creations ( Seriously , Aquaman ? ) , there 's something about each of these proposed shows that strikes me as a little odd :
They 're all about male characters .
Is the legacy of Buffy The Vampire Slayer so strong that it 's scared the CW off any new genre adventure shows centered around female leads , or is this just laziness ( " Hey , Smallville is all about a guy ... " ) or nerd - stereotyping ( " Only men read comic books ... " ) at work ?
Then again , given the failure of Birds of Prey , you could almost forgive any of those three ways of thinking ; it 's easier , after all , that accepting that Birds failed because it just was n't that good .

A Smallville - esque take on Wonder Woman seems like such a no - brainer that I can't believe it's not been attempted or , at least , discussed before .
Besides the female lead aspect - Hello , Buffy mix of eye candy and positive role model who will kick the ass of any and all characters who present their derrieres for the taking - there 're two other important factors that make it such a good idea .
Firstly , it 's Wonder Woman ; much more iconic than Green Arrow , Aquaman or , arguably , even Robin , but at the same time , enough of a clean slate for most of the public ( whose primary exposure to the character is either licensing , cartoons or , dependent on their age , the Lynda Carter series from the ' 70s ) that she brings a freedom from expectation that Superman or Batman can't .
And secondly , the Wonder Woman mythology is so rich with story potential that it'd take a concerted effort to make a dull show .
Consider :
She 's an innocent pacifist raised on an island removed from reality to be the perfect warrior , discovering civilization - and , of course , men - for the first time .
Even before you bring in her ties to Greek mythology or her superpowers , that 's still a strong enough basis to wrap a series around .

( Of course , Wonder Woman does n't necessarily have a Lex Luthor figure that everyone knows and recognizes as her archetypal nemesis , but that 's not necessarily a problem ; it allows the creators to offer up various big bads for different seasons , or different episodes , without running into the feeling of loss that Smallville felt when Lex was written out ; even Zod , bless his maniacal heart , is a weak replacement . )
Smallville 's tenth year is impressive , but it was looking a bit long in the tooth as it headed into its ninth ; the show can't continue much longer before it makes Clark look as if he 's actively trying to put off getting into the tights and cape that we all desperately want him to assume , even as the CW wants to keep their hit going as long as possible .
The best solution for everyone would be to come up with a replacement that offers the same pop cultural impact and potential , and a Wonder Woman series feels like the most obvious way to make that happen .
So ... why are we still waiting ?
Motor racing veteran Sir Stirling
Moss is in hospital today after breaking both ankles when he fell three floors down a lift shaft .
The 80 - year - old is recovering in a London hospital after surgery on both his feet following the accident at his Mayfair home on Saturday , a statement on his website said .
He also suffered four broken bones in his foot and four chipped vertebrae when the lift door opened at the wrong time and he stepped into the empty shaft .
Sir Stirling was taken to the Royal London Hospital in east London after the accident and yesterday was moved to one closer to his home where he had his operation .
Plates and pins were used to secure the bones in his ankles .
His wife Lady Susie Moss said : " This was a very unfortunate accident , it could have just as easily been another member of the family stepping into where the lift should have been . "

There are universal truths about homeownership , many of which involve structural and mechanical breakdowns and repairs and the inevitable consequences .
Whether you ’re the type who calls a professional to clean the gutters or a take - charge champion of problem - solving , another truth involves probability .
No matter who does the fixing , there ’s a 50/50 chance of something not being right .
Here are 20 epic DIY fails that might give you second thoughts about doing it yourself .
1. Yes , But Also No
https://www.instagram.com/p/CB03dvnAkfQ/
The answer to the question , “ Can I use your bathroom ? ”
The logic and contingencies are baffling .
More questions abound .
We have a couple of possible scenarios .
One , the technician was n’t paying attention .
Two , they had no intention of installing the seat properly and did n’t know what to do with the extra parts .
Lack of a visible flushing mechanism suggests a public restroom .
Moreover , the layout gives off a heavy South East Asian vibe , where , unlike Japan and almost everywhere else in the world , people usually do n’t sit on the toilet seat .
In which case , all bets are off .
Major fail .
2. Puff n’ Stuff vs Air Duct : Puff n’ Stuff Wins by TKO
https://www.instagram.com/p/CBlQXKiDpUc/
Somebody got cute with the spray foam insulation .
That vent was cosmetic anyway , right , Dad ?
A fail if we ever saw one .
3. How Late is Home Depot Open on a Sunday Night ?
In this episode of “ There , I Fixed It ” , we ’ll examine the definition of heartbreak .
Though it might not look like a catastrophe , this weekend warrior has just set his bathroom remodel back by a minimum of 24 hours .
All fail , all day .
4. Should I Call an Electrician or an Exorcist ?
https://www.instagram.com/p/CBdlp8qhkAJ/
Generally speaking , the only thing you want to see coming out of a wall socket is maybe a short spark when you plug in a hair dryer .
Brown liquid is right up there with poisonous gas on the scale of things you do n’t want coming out of an electrical outlet .
This is close to paranormal and a solid fail .
5. Dude Got His Bell Rung
The multi-image story here is this guy was tearing down the privacy fence , which also happened to have a 100 - pound - plus wrought iron bell sitting 12 feet off the ground .
The second image shows the bell on the ground .
The third image shows the damage to dude ’s skull .
Warning : it ’s a bloody fail .
6. Who Has Time to Read ?
Some die - hards think they ’re Walter White in Breaking Bad , a mad scientist with a gift for chemistry .
Caustic chemicals come with warnings and instructions for a reason .
Read them .
What you ’re looking at here is the result of mixing two volatile and incompatible chemicals .
7. When Your Contractor Does n’t Give a F***
https://www.instagram.com/p/CBTQM7PhECd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
Here ’s the dilemma .
They want you to move the wall but you do n’t want to rip up the electrical conduit .
And so , there comes a time in nearly every home improvement project when the contractor says , “ Yeah , that ’s about our only option left .
Let ’s hope the homeowner does n’t notice . ”
8. The World ’s Most Expensive Shelving Bracket
You can see the level down in the lower right - hand corner , so you know this cat was using the tripod as a temporary brace during installation .
Either way , you ’re looking at a top - notch triumph and the definition of “ There , I Fixed It ” .
9. For Every Crack , a Hinge
https://www.instagram.com/p/B_P9p2uhExI/
You have to know there ’s a great story behind this jury - rigged repair .
Fortunately , it ’s not a load - bearing support .
If they ’d filled the cracks in the wood with a little more care , there ’d be something artistic about it .
10 . Home Depot Clown Car Lumber Edition
The home repair version of My Eyes Are Bigger Than My Stomach .
Or , hell no , I ’m not paying $ 35 for delivery !
There ’s no more self - defeating way of destroying the suspension of your car than overloading it with roughly five times the number of 2x8s it could reasonably carry .
Not that passenger cars were designed to haul lumber , obviously .
11 . When Your Wife Insists on the Stainless Steel Drawer Handles
This is the kind of dick move that carpenters chuckle about at the bar .
“ And I told her , look , lady , you do n’t even need knobs on these drawers ! ”
12 . Would It Have Killed Them to Call a Plumber ?
It ’s almost as if the person who installed this said , “ I ’m gonna make it as ugly and impractical as possible ” , and then , set out to achieve this goal with remarkable dedication .
13 . This is What You Get When You Do n’t Hire an Architect
Sure , this is all well and good for the current homeowner .
It ’s their house , let them do what they want with it .
But karma will circle back for them when it ’s time to sell the property .
There is n’t a real estate agent on the planet who ’s gonna be excited about listing this house .
14 . Somewhere , There ’s a Carpenter Crying in His Sleep
This is either a sick joke or the contractor has never removed a wall before .
A textbook example of What Not To Do .
15 . Do n’t Blame the Plumber You Did n’t Hire , Chief
Perhaps we ’re dealing with some forced perspective but this has to be a DIY job .
No self - respecting architect would design this and no professional plumber would agree to install the toilet under the bathroom vanity .
It just would n’t happen .
16 . Genius Idea …Until It Rains
What ’s the worst that could happen here ?
The opposite of what this DIYer was trying to achieve .
17 . The Definition of a “ Temporary Fix ” aka the Ultimate Jury Rig
Duct Tape Fun Fact # 1 : You ca n’t use it with ductwork .
A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory compared duct tape to every other tape on the market .
When it came to sealing ducts , no other tape performed as poorly as duct tape .
One scientist said it failed “ catastrophically ” .
Today , it ’s a major code violation to use it on ducts in the US .
18 . Leaky Roof ?
Problem Solved
Duct Tape Fun Fact # 2 : The NASA and duct tape myth probably got started because of Apollo 13 .
Engineers used duct tape to resolve a potentially life - threatening problem with the ventilation system in the lunar module .
But contrary to popular belief , duct tape was invented during World War II by an ammunition factory worker named Vesta Stoudt , the mother of two Navy sailors , who worried that problems with ammunition box seals would cost soldiers precious time in battle .
19 . Believe It or Not , That Wo n’t Pass Inspection
https://www.instagram.com/p/CCErlSLp0jG/
More Duct Tape Fun Facts # 3 : Avon , Ohio hosts an annual duct tape festival .
The event includes duct tape artwork , a fashion show , and a parade featuring floats and marching formations based on duct tape .
No word on whether the duct tape bondage and fetish communities have a presence , but let ’s hope so .
20 . High Voltage ?
More Like Die Voltage
This is where the inspector says , “ What made you think you could get away with it – and live ? ”

In an interview with POLITICO , Andrew Breitbart ( left ) blasted Rachel Maddow as an intellectually dishonest , left - wing propagandist .
Breitbart blasts Maddow at CPAC
Rachel Maddow has sharply judged the arrested activist filmmaker behind the so - called ACORN pimp videos , and on Thursday , the conservative media entrepreneur who posted the videos fired back .
In an interview with POLITICO on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference , Andrew Breitbart blasted Maddow as an intellectually dishonest , left - wing propagandist who personifies the shortcomings of an antiquated media business model .
Advertisement
Maddow , Breitbart said , drastically distorted the arrest of one of the ACORN filmmakers last month during an unrelated attempted exposé of Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La . ) .
Asked what he would say if he ran into Maddow , an unabashedly liberal MSNBC host who made a surprise appearance at CPAC on Thursday , Breitbart said , “ I hope to see you and give you a lovely hug because you validated my hopes and aspirations and my business model because you ’re so bad at what you do . ”
Breitbart accused Maddow of being “ part of a propaganda campaign to attack the last president ... and make him out to be the worst human being that ever walked the face of the earth .
And , at the same time , you promoted Barack Obama as the greatest thing that ever walked the earth . ”
Plus , he ripped Maddow and other liberal commentators for their treatment of the populist conservative tea party movement and one of its champions , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
“ The left ’s Alinsky tactics — that ’s you Rachel Maddow — of isolating Sarah Palin or her poor children and beating on them , beating on them , beating on them ... [ wo n’t succeed ] with the tea party movement .
... You can call them racists and homophobes .
But those tricks are n’t working anymore , because people are saying , ' This is ridiculous . ’ ”
Alana Russo , a spokesman for Maddow , disputed Breitbart ’s accusations .
“ I 'm not sure what he could possibly be referring to , ” she said .
“ I would defy you to find some instance of Rachel launching an ad hominem attack on Sarah Palin or her kids . ”
On her show , Maddow has been sharply critical of both Palin and the tea party movement – just as Breitbart has repeatedly attacked Obama and Democrats in his media appearances .
Maddow ’s style tends to be more ironic , but can often come off as inflammatory .
On her Feb. 5 show , for example , she suggested that attendees at the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville , which was underway at the time , were wearing “ white hoods . ”
Breitbart , a disciple of hugely influential conservative news aggregator Matt Drudge , has been particularly aggressive in pushing against the coverage by Maddow and others on MSNBC of self - styled activist journalist James O’Keefe .
Breitbart ’s Big Government website posted videos secretly recorded by O’Keefe and his partner , Hannah Giles , who posed as a pimp and a prostitute while soliciting advice from employees of ACORN , the liberal community - organizing group , on how to set up a brothel .
The videos , which resulted in a congressional vote to stop federal funding for the group before a federal judge ordered the funding restored , made stars of O’Keefe and Giles .
And Breitbart , who is paying O’Keefe to produce more videos , has been particularly critical of the media ’s descriptions of the circumstances of O’Keefe ’s arrest last month , along with three other men , after they entered Landrieu ’s New Orleans district office .
Several media outlets falsely reported that O’Keefe and his crew were charged with attempting to wiretap Landrieu ’s phones , and on her show , Maddow , citing another news outlet ’s report , asserted the four were installing “ bugs ” in Landrieu ’s phones and that “ listening devices ... found in a car a couple of blocks away ... could pick [ up ] transmissions from those bugs . ”
She then asked a guest she cited as an expert in “ the manipulation of phone systems for political gain ” whether that “ sound [s ] like the kind of thing that would be part of a political dirty tricks campaign or does this sound like a freelance operation ? ”
According to an FBI affidavit , O’Keefe entered Landrieu ’s office with two other men who were pretending to be telephone repairmen , with the two attempting to manipulate telephones while O’Keefe filmed them on his cell phone camera and a fourth man waited outside .
The four men were charged with entering federal property under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony .
Russo said that Maddow later clarified that the O’Keefe arrest was not a phone taping case , as Maddow said it “ initially seemed to be . ”
She added that Maddow and MSNBC “ reported the story as it broke , citing sources , updating it as new information became available . ”
Breitbart said the media failed in its watchdog function by letting ACORN off easy and instead “ falsely framed James and these other gentlemen .
And , because the mainstream media wanted to destroy James for what he successfully did in the ACORN exposé , they so overreached . ”
Mocking MSNBC and Maddow — who said on her show that O’Keefe “ is a paid contributor to a right - wing Drudge Report spinoff website ” — Breitbart said , “ I being the organizer of the federal break - in of Mary Landrieu ’s office , where I paid millions of dollars to James O’Keefe to break in there .
That was a terrific story , great reporting there , MSNBC . ”
MSNBC did not , in fact , report that Breitbart paid O’Keefe millions of dollars .
Breitbart asserted “ there is more video that is going to come out ” and predicted “ the media that tried to defeat James O’Keefe and to destroy him , in their attempts to do that , they weaponized him and made him a bigger figure than he otherwise would become , and so the next videos that come from him and his cohorts [ are ] going to be that much more devastating . ”
WASHINGTON — Democratic Senator Charles Schumer and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the federal government should require high - technology Social Security cards to make sure employers hire only legal workers .
“ A tamper - proof ID system would dramatically decrease illegal immigration , experts have said , and would reduce the government revenue lost when employers and workers here illegally fail to pay taxes , ’’ the lawmakers wrote in an article on the website of The Washington Post .
They called for use of biometric Social Security cards that would include a unique characteristic of the cardholder , such as a fingerprint .
The proposal is part of what Graham and Schumer termed a “ draft framework ’ ’ for overhauling immigration laws .
The framework includes proposals for a temporary worker program and penalties that would allow illegal immigrants to stay after taking steps such as paying fines and performing community service .
“ America ’s security and economic well - being depend on enacting sensible immigration policies , ’’ they wrote .
President Obama , in a statement , called the senators ’ proposal a “ promising , bipartisan framework which can and should be the basis for moving forward . ’’
Obama met with Schumer and Graham last week to discuss the proposal , the senators wrote .
Obama ’s statement said he would “ do everything in my power to forge a bipartisan consensus ’’ on the issue .
Graham , however , cautioned yesterday that the push for an immigration measure would fail if congressional Democrats succeed in passing the overhaul of the health care system sought by Obama .
House Democratic leaders are seeking to pass the latest version of the legislation tomorrow .
“ The first casualty of the Democratic health care bill will be immigration reform , ’’ he said in a statement .
“ If they do this , it ’s going to poison the well for anything else they would like to achieve this year or thereafter , ’’ Graham told ABC .
A demonstration in Washington in support of overhauling immigration laws is scheduled for tomorrow .
The event ’s sponsors include the National Council of La Raza , the AFL - CIO labor federation , and the Service Employees International Union .
Past bipartisan efforts to revise immigration policy include legislation cosponsored by Senators John McCain of Arizona , the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , and the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat .
Even the support of then - President George W. Bush failed to push the measure forward in Congress in 2007 .
Schumer and Graham would require those already in the United States illegally , an estimated 11 million , to admit they had broken the law , pay fines and back taxes , and perform community service projects .
They also would be required to pass a background check and learn English .

Avatar finally ended its stretch as America 's # 1 movie , but people are continuing to point out sources that James Cameron borrowed from .
It 's become a national pastime , our version of Banshee - catching .
We 've rounded up 16 sources that Cameron allegedly nabbed .

Dances With Wolves
The similarities : A military man " goes native " and takes the side of the natives against his own army .
Is there a case ?
James Cameron came out and admitted it , last summer .
Other similar stories he looked at : At Play In The Fields Of The Lord and The Emerald Forest .
Said Cameron , " I just gathered all this stuff in and then you look at it through the lens of science fiction and it comes out looking very different but is still recognizable in a universal story way . "

Pocahontas
The similarities : Fail Blog has a rundown of the overlaps — mostly they have to do with a guy going native and falling for a native woman , while his comrades want to run the natives out .
Oh , and the native woman is betrothed to a native warrior guy , but she 's not into him .
Is there a case ?
At a very general thematic level , sure .
Advertisement
Call Me Joe
The similarities :
As we wrote back in October , this 1957 novella by Poul Anderson has a lot of common ground with Cameron 's movie :
Like Avatar , Call Me Joe centers on a paraplegic - Ed Anglesey - who telepathically connects with an artificially created life form in order to explore a harsh planet ( in this case , Jupiter ) .
Anglesey , like Avatar 's Jake Sully , revels in the freedom and strength of his artificial created body , battles predators on the surface of Jupiter , and gradually goes native as he spends more time connected to his artificial body .
Advertisement
Is there a case ?
The website Litigation And Trial considered the merits of Anderson 's claim , and noted that you can't copyright an idea — only your expression of the idea .
( As the publishers of the source material for Rear Window found when they tried to sue Steven Spielberg over Disturbia . )
Anderson 's heirs would have to prove that Anderson originated the idea of someone controlling a hybrid alien body with his / her mind .

Roger Dean 's paintings
The similarities :
We ran a gallery of Dean paintings that look awfully similar to Cameron 's vision a while back , and it is definitely striking how much correspondence there is — the floating mountains , the dragons , the weird fauna , the arch - shaped rock formations , etc .
Dean posted a wry comment about it on his site , but has since deleted that blog post .
( It was literally just a link to a google search for " Roger Dean avatar . " )
Is there a case ?
A lot of people seem to think so .
Entertainment Weekly asked Cameron about it , and he laughed it off , saying he might have been influenced by Dean " back in my pot- smoking days . "

Delgo
The similarities :
This was a big meme before Avatar came out , and then people seemed to realize the two animated films did n't have that much in common .
Mostly , they share a certain visual style , and they both have an " emotional but strong " female lead .
Is there a case ?
No , not really .
Battle For Terra
The similarities :
This one 's a bit stronger than Delgo , actually .
In both Avatar and Terra , humans arrive to exploit an alien planet full of cute natives .
One human decides to take the side of the natives , and help them fight against the evil humans .
Both movies have a " tree of life " and similiar structure , although there 's no human - piloting - an - alien - body thing in Terra .
Is there a case ?
Maybe a bit of one .
But as one person points out here , Cameron was working on Avatar long before Terra was even in the pipeline .

The Winds Of Altair by Ben Bova
The similarities : Bova 's novel involves a planet that is uninhabitable to humans , due to its hostile environment .
The humans adapt some of the local animals to do work for them , controlling them remotely via electronic brain implants , so the humans can stay safely on their orbiting ship .
Eventually , they realize that making the planet habitable to humans will require wiping out all the native life forms .
In his regular column for the Naples News , Bova says the similiarities caused " a bit of a storm of protest among the bloggers . "
Is there a case ?
Bova himself says , " To me , Cameron 's film resembles Dances With Wolves more than The Winds of Altair ...
In fact , the basic idea in The Winds of Altair had been explored in earlier science - fiction stories , most notable Poul Anderson 's 1957 novelet , Call Me Joe . "

" Desertion " by Clifford Simak
The similarities : Humans go to Jupiter , where they can only survive in specially altered bodies .
But all of the humans who venture out never return , because they discover a paradise and do n't want to come back to the human world .
Is there a case ?
Not much of one , although Dark Roasted Blend says the " avatar " bodies make it sort of similar .
Their article also points to Ursula K. Le Guin 's " The Word For World Is Forest , " which features a military raid on a tree - city and natives who are deeply connected .
Advertisement
Judgment On Janus by Andre Norton
The similarities :
There are idllyic forest people , the Iftin , who are in touch with their world and live in big trees .
And they bond neurally with their hunting birds , the quarrin .
A human who 's part of a group looking to exploit the planet goes into the forest and gets the " green sickness , " then finds that he 's been transformed into one of the Iftin .
( And it turns out all of the Iftin are transformed humans , the real Iftin having been wiped out long ago . )
Is there a case ?
Not much of one .
Even this CBC article , which starts out saying Avatar " bears a lot of similarities " to Norton 's Janus novels , winds up arguing that the real problem with Avatar was that it did n't steal from Norton enough .

The World of Noon by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky
The similarities : The Guardian reports that Russians are up in arms about the parallels between this ten - book series and Cameron 's film .
They both take place in the 22nd century and feature a planet called Pandora .
The aliens in the Noon books are called the Nave .
Both Pandoras are idyllic forest worlds , although the Noon books feature two humanoid native species , not one .
Is there a case ?
The surviving Strugatsky brother , Boris , shrugs off the similarities .
Which seem mostly to consist of the name of the planet and of the creatures who live there .
Dune
The similarities : Io9's own Garrison Dean and Chris Braak pointed out the similarities in the storyline in this video they did for us a while back .
Is there a case ?
The basic outline is quite similar , although the specifics are actually pretty different .

Timespirits
The similarities : This Marvel / Epic comic from 1985 features a sexy blue cat warrior woman , who looks — and moves — an awful lot like Neytiri , points out Marcus Parcus .
( Tons more awesome images at the link . )
Is there a case ?
Even Marcus writes , " The comic / film parallels do n't seem to extend much past the visuals here ( the story in this particular issue features an extended Jimi Hendrix cameo and other raditudinal oddities ) , but I find them amusing enough . "

The Fire Kind

This comic came out in 2000 A.D. , just before Cameron wrote his first " scriptment " for Avatar .
There 's a lush jungle world , where the blue natives ride on big dragons , and an evil corporation wants to mine the rare mineral Hexacrin .
And the natives have a psychic connection to their entire world .
And there are " weird floating rocks . "
Also , the main character is a human botanist who goes against his own kind to defend the natives .
Is there a case ?
A bit of one .
There 's no " avatar " technology , but a lot of the other stuff is similar .

Dragon Hunters
The similarities : A reader tipped us off to this computer - animated French film , which features a dragon called the " World - Gobbler . "
And there are floating land masses .
Is there a case ?
Not really .
Floating continents are so popular , TVTropes has a huge entry devoted to them .
Floating " islands " play a huge part in Crossgen Comics ' series Meridian .

Robin Hobb's Soldier Son Trilogy
The similarities : Nevare is a soldier from an expanding colonial power , Gernia , until he 's claimed by the primitive forest - dwelling Specks , who split his soul in two and cause him to go native .
He becomes the Specks ' weapon in the fight against Gernian expansion .
Is there a case ?
Not much of one .
Just the " going native " thing .
Fern Gully
The similarities :
This Australian animated film features peace - loving forest folk with special powers , whose magic trees are threatened by humans who want to chop them down .
And one human gets shrunk and joins the fairies on a wild adventure , helping them to save their forest .
There 's also an evil guy played by Tim Curry , who gets released from his tree prison by accident .
This was a big meme a while back , resulting in the trailer mashup you see above .
Is there a case ?
Ummm ... well , there are trees .
And a guy sort of goes native .

Hanako , a robot designed in Japan , has a mouthful of sensors that let her realistically react to the pokings and proddings of dentists in training .
Let me be clear , dentists in training : no robot can loathe you like I do .
While I will begrudgingly admit that the " polish " phase of the dentist check - up is not altogether unpleasurable , one of the things that essentially defines us as humans is our general reluctance to visit the dentist .
Most people will go their entire life without finding themselves in a position more vulnerable than the one they 're in every six months at the dentist — prone , mouth open , with a steel hook clanking around your chompers .

Hanako , the combined effort of three universities and a robotics manufacturer , salivates , sneezes , and shouts her displeasure if the dental student does n't wield that hook gently enough .
The robot has can open and shut her mouth , wiggle her tongue , and roll her eyes to express discomfort .
Do n't get me wrong .
I applaud the effort to give dental students more realistic responses in their training .
But they should know that no robot will ever squirm quite like I do .

March 5 , 2009 REVIEW : Knight Moves by Jamaica Layne
JaneF ReviewsRavenous
Romance
Note :
In order to express my full opinion , I will need to share spoilers .
So beware .
Dear Ms. Layne :
When Ravenous Romance first appeared on my radar , I blogged about it and you were quick to come to inform us readers that this new epress would “ blow the competition out the water from very early on . ”
Given that you were also elevated from writer to editor in a short time , I thought it might be worthwhile to see exactly what was the force behind all the eruption .
Knight Moves is a time traveling story featuring New Jersey toll booth supervisor , Louise Jackson , and the time traveling knight , Lord Verdigris .
For her birthday , Louise Jackson is dragged to Medieval Worlds : Dinner and Tournament by her best friend .
Deciding the wait for the woman ’s bathroom is too long , Louise slips into the men ’s room in hopes of relieving herself quickly .
There she is assailed by the stench of the men ’s room and the sight of the gorgeous man at the urinal :
And the sight of the huge cock the knight is holding in his right hand as he shakes off the last few drops of pee is even more dazzling .
The sight is so dazzling that Loiuse ’s pee dries up and is replaced with moist desire .
I do n’t need to pee any more .
Now I just need to get laid .
The knight gives me a knowing smile , and jiggles his giant cock in my direction .
" You look like a fair maiden in need of a good visit from the codpiece , " he says .
Frankly , I do n’t know of any visual more attractive or seductive than a guy dressed like a knight in a tacky dinner theatre waving his post pee schwizzle stick around .
Louise is clearly a woman of discerning taste .
She also is one who does n’t worry about any kind of hygiene issues because she is not at all concerned when pee shaking man hands grab her and whisk her to the last stall in the bathroom that turns out to be , yes , a time traveling portal .
Oh , if Bill and Ted only knew that the phone booth was n’t the only way to break through the space time continuum .
Louise is barely phased ( or fazed ) by the travel from the filthy men ’s urinal where she was ready to “ take a ride on a knight ’s codpiece ” to the knight ’s castle .
She is ready for the knight of no name “ to fuck [ her ] brains out . ”
I do n’t even know what century I ’m in right now .
And I do n’t care .
All I care about is getting Gorgeous Mystery Knight ’s giant codpiece up my twat in a hurry .
The knight who has yet to wash his hands whisks her upstairs to engage in coitus of a very romantic and sexy nature .
I quote the liberally from the first sex scene to give the proper flavor :
Another couple flicks of my knight ’s supple wrists , and I find myself naked and thrown headfirst over the wooden bench , my ass sticking straight up in the air .
Gorgeous Knight , fully clothed , spreads my butt cheeks wide , whips his giant cock out of his breeches , and takes me from behind . …
We continue to fuck doggy - style over the bench for several minutes .
. . .
I buck up against him hard mid-thrust , tipping him off balance .
Once he ’s lost his footing , I pull myself off his cock – my cunt makes a disappointed queeb sound as we separate …
I come two more times when I spin myself around and around on his cock like a top , and take the last few strokes down from the rear .
Excuse me while I insert a crude joke here .
You are blowing something out of the water , but I ’m not certain it ’s your competition .
Back to the story .
After the aforementioned erotic sex scene ( and by erotic , I mean sex so terrible that even the idea of my parents ’ coupling is preferable to revisiting this ) , we are treated to some post coital love talk :
" Everything you see and feel is real , milady , " my knight says , caressing my bare back with his hands .
" That , I promise you .
If you desire proof , you only need consider the three very real climaxes you just had in your lady - softness . "
My eyes fly wide .
" How did you know I came three times ? "
He grins wider .
" Your lady - softness told me herself when she was wrapped round my codpiece . "
Mystery knight , however , is not entranced by Louise ’s lady softness for long because he soon escorts her to the Hall of Harlots where he keeps the women that he ’s captured from all over the world , through many centuries .
Even though Louise is initially shocked at being stuck in the Hall of Harlots , she is reassured by Lord Verdigris , Master of the Hourglass , that being a whore for him and his knights is really an honor .
She ’ll be well cared for and reside in luxury and in exchange , she just needs to open her legs to whomever desires her to do so .
Update : Someone asked me if there was a plot to the story and there is .
Lord Verdigris is not the nicest guy and Louise , with the help of one particular lover from the Regency period and another knight with vengeance quest against Verdigris , challenge Lord Verdigris ’ hold over the captives of his court .
Louise is a plucky heroine and decides that she ’ll be the very best harlot in the Hall of Harlots despite Lord Verdigris having “ tasted the pleasures of harlots and courtesans from every age in the Known World ’s history , from ancient Greece and Rome to the Renaissance to the farflung future . ”
Somehow , despite Lord Verdigris ’ vast experience and extensive travel , Louise manages to come up with a sexual expertise that Lord Verdigris has never experienced .
Louise becomes a dom for Verdigris and all his knights and becomes the court favorite despite having over seven hundred “ competitors ” based on techniques that she remembered from the Story of O .
Her ability to wield a paddle on the “ Cross of Satisfaction ” is unparalleled and soon , Lord Verdigris is beckoning her :
And " tis time for us to partake of Pleasure ’s fruit again , milady .
My codpiece has desired your lady - softness all day long . "
Which is good , because then we get to find out that he sweats buckets of happy juice :
His erection is enormous – pointing at an almost 90 - degree angle up towards his chin – and his glans is sweating buckets of happy juice .
These are two big secreters .
Her crotch turns to cream ( “ turning my crotch to cream ” ) , she leaves a trail of juice down his chest ( “ I slide down his chest , leaving a trail of my nectar on his skin ” ) , her vulva is liquified ( “ my vulva is sweating a sea of slick salt water ” ) ; her , well , ladysoftness is “ wet , dripping . ”
Besides the overwhelming amount of fluid expulsion there was also the outsized genitals .
His was ten inches and her clit was so large that , well , let me just quote it :
The walls of my vag vibrate and pulse at warp speed , and my labia are so swollen , they pound out a drumbeat as they slap up and down against the length of Lord Verdigris ’ cock .
I ’m not sure what I found most far fetched in this story .
Was it the instant acceptance that Louise had of being swept through the urinal time traveling portal ?
Was it ease at which Louise decides being a whore is something to embrace ?
Was it the ridiculous love scenes that included “ queebs ” , references to “ lady softness ” , “ lady fingers ” , her “ volcanic crotch ” ?
Was it the fact that there was some weird editing glitch wherein Chapter Five included the words “ Page Break ” at the top .
It could have been the fact that her hoo haa was so powerful it could make people immortal .
Perhaps it was the scintillating dialogue that include , “ ‘ Unnnnnnuuuuuhhhhh , ’ I moan , completely losing control .
I come so hard , I see stars . ”
Or perhaps it was the casual declaration of lesbian love that she embraces at the Harlot ’s Hall when she gets her first fisting treatment .
I ’m suddenly beginning to appreciate the saying , " once you ’ve gone lesbo , you never go back . " . . .
Just when I think it ca n’t get any more intense , Mabel plunges her arm into me well past her wrist … .
I ’ve got ladyfingers stuck up both ends .
And I ’m loving it .
She turns her back on the lesbian love when she finds out its all a plot to reduce her position from Lord Verdigris ’ favorite .
Or was it the finale where Lord Verdigris and Louise engage gangsters in Philly in a “ yo momma ” challenge where the dialogue is vaguely insulting to the people of color .
It ’s hard to say .
" As a matter of fact we do , " I say .
" My friend over here " – I point at Lord Verdigris – " is from Philadelphia , and he and I have a bet to settle before we scope out any property for Mr. Trump .
And I ’ve decided that we ’ll settle the bet with a game of Yo’ Mama .
Winner takes all .
I need some street - smart guys to judge the game .
Y’all up for that ? "
The gangbangers laugh , slap hands , and nod .
" Hell , yeah , " says their leader .
" We always got time for a game o’ Yo’ Mama .
Which one o’ y’all gonna start ? " …
Lord Verdigris holds up his hand .
" I require no explanation , Lady Louisa .
We play a version of this game in my own time .
The game " tis as ancient as the Romans . "
The gangbangers stare at him .
" Damn , dat dude talk funny , " one of them says .
" He do n’t sound like he from no Philly , neither , " another says .
If this is not the worst book I ’ve read , it comes close .
I ’m actually not sorry I bought it .
I now know what being blown out of the water feels like and can be prepared the next time someone makes a claim about their work in such a way .
F .
Best regards ,
Jane

In the Mozilla Security blog , the developers of the Firefox browser have described how they intend to fill an ancient privacy loophole .
The " CSS History Hack " triggered recent excitement because it allows web sites to spy on users of social networks .
The problem was first described in a bugzilla entry from 2000 .
The issue is caused by the fact that traditionally web browsers have displayed visited and unvisited links differently .
A web application can use this information to find out what pages a user has visited .
The W3C has responded to this problem by modifying the CSS 2.1 specification to allow browsers to represent all links as unvisited , or to take other measures to ensure the privacy of the user .
For the second case , the Mozilla developers have decided that only certain attributes of the : visited pseudo - class will be accessible .
Attributes that load remote resources such as background - image will be ignored by the browser .
The developers will also adjust the layout engine to position all the links at the same speed so applications cannot use the variation in timing behaviour to determined if a link has been visited .
Finally , if the JavaScript method getComputedStyle is used on a link or its sub-elements , Firefox will return style values as if it were unvisited .
The announced changes will soon be incorporated into the development branch of the Firefox browser and the developers hope the look of most websites will remain unchanged , following its introduction .
( djwm )
The time came to say goodbye to San Ignacio and the amazing adventures it held .
With slightly damp shoes , a spring in my step , and my two backpacks resting on my shoulders I made my way towards the central square .
Once there , I located a Taxi driver I ’d bartered with earlier in the morning , re-confirmed the fare I ’d bartered for earlier ( about 10 dollars ) and then piled my gear into the trunk .
Before long we were lazily cruising across the Belizean country side towards the Guatemalan border .
A new country and new adventure awaited .
The ride itself was fairly brief at about 10 - 15 minutes .
The driver was amiable and shared stories and advice before pulling up to the border station and pointing me in the direction I needed to go .
A few passport stamps and about $ 20 later I ’d paid the exit fees and was waved into the no man ’s land between borders .
There I looked across and into Guatemala and paused briefly a bit confused .
Straight ahead there was a seething mass of currency traders and taxi drivers , a small guard house to block vehicles and ….an open road ?
It took me a solid minute of watching before I realized that the border station was actually set to the side , giving it a somewhat optional feel .
In my general ignorance , I ’d nearly ( and amazingly , very well could have ) walked straight into Guatemala .
Chuckling at the differences between the borders back home and those in Central America , I threaded my way through the crowd , somewhat surprised and unnerved by the large number of Guatemalan security personnel on guard with large , sawed off shotguns resting casually at their waists .
Eventually I identified the right line , paid my 20 GTQ ( less than $ 3 USD ) entrance fee and got my stamp .
From there it was down to the Taxis where , despite what I ’d read in the guide book , I opted to take a quick taxi ride to where the Colectivos ( Collectivos in English ) were .
The Adventure Begins
After talking briefly with a Taxi driver , and telling him where I wanted to go ( less than a mile ) – we agreed on a price of 10 GTQ or about $ 1.25 .
I got in , and we started rolling down the street … slowly .
Before we ’d gone 15 feet , he started trying to pressure me into a $ 40 USD Taxi ride to Flores .
A situation made that much more confusing given his lack of English and my marginal ( at best ) Spanish .
Not completely opposed to the idea but eager to try the Colectivo and not interested in spending $ 40 I countered that I ’d give him $ 20 but was n’t especially interested .
As you can imagine , his response was less than enthusiastic .
Preferring to try and pressure me into it , he slowly made his way down the street , going so far as to head through the intersection and begin towards Flores .
Annoyed , I opted for a classic tactic , I ’ve found to work particularly well with high - pressure sales people who wo n’t take no for an answer : I took my already low $ 20 offer , and dropped it $ 2 every time he countered .
While they may be immune to “ No ” and happy to ignore it .
They tend to be far more susceptible and give up much quicker in the face of ridiculously bad ( and decreasing ) offers .
By the time I reached $ 14 , he pulled over and tried to find someone who spoke English .
On his second try he found someone , who translated .
I re-iterated my stance and without further adieu was dropped off down the street in front of a Colectivo .
Before I ’d had the chance to get out and grab both bags , the larger of the two was scooped up by the Colectivo ’s driver .
As he turned and began to swing it up towards the Colectivo ’s roof , I stopped him with a quick , “ Woah , no no no ! ” .
He paused , allowing me the time to confirm the fare – 35 GTQ or about $ 4 USD and destination : Flores .
That accomplished I smiled , waved , and relaxed as my bag was hoisted onto the van ’s roof rack .
Now , let me preface by saying that I ’ve experienced my fare share of mass transport adventures .
From odd taxi cabs , Croatian Buses teetering along steep cliff faces , and rural Greek buses .
None of those prepared me for Colectivos .
For the uninitiated the Colectivo as I encountered it is , in effect , a van / group taxi .
The one I found had a sliding side door and had been modified to fit as many people as humanly possible .
It had three rows of forward facing seats , in addition to the front bench seat and a Jerry - rigged backward facing bench immediately behind the driver .
Each of the middle two seats had a small fold down extension that allowed passengers into the back seats , without losing any space .
Recall that I ’m 6 ’ 4 ″ and that your average Maya / Mexican / Guatemalan in the region is perhaps 5 ’ 3 ″ .
Now imagine the look on their faces , as I walked up and was pointed towards what I thought was the last available seat in the Colectivo : the fold down chair in the row 2nd from the back .
I paused .
Scratched my head , and then decided that the only way I ’d be able to actually get to / into the chair was to back in , butt first .
The locals all found both my size , and my entrance highly entertaining .
As I sandwiched into the small seat , wondering if it would support my weight , my seatmate – a Mother traveling with her suckling babe – introduced herself , chuckled again softly , and offered a few words of advice .
Before long the folding seat in front of me was flipped up – catching my somewhat unawares , and smacking my knees .
With a groan I realized that my knees would be supporting the chair back for the duration of the trip .
The Colectivo had two operators .
The driver , and then a 2nd individual who rode in the back and was in charge of ticketing and seating .
His approach was simple , but creative .
Cram as many bodies as humanly possible into the vehicle .
Out for room ?
Then open the door or a window and hang out .
As I mentioned previously , I had thought that I was one of the last to board .
Boy - o - boy was I wrong .
As time passed our numbers grew .
From 16 , to 17 .
From 17 to 20 .
From 20 to 22 .
Wide eyed , I did my best to take up as little room as possible , trying to take in the experience and reminding myself that the ride was only 2 hours .
The ticket had only cost $ 4 and that this was a cultural experience .
Finally the door slid closed and we began our trip .
It was hot , muggy , and more than a little smelly .
Luckily I was located next to one of the windows , allowing the opportunity to mingle fresh air with the smell of body sweat , perfume , cologne , and the odd assortment of food ’s several of the other travelers had packed .
We ’d gone some 3 blocks when we paused again .
This time the door slid open , the woman next to me muttered , and 4 more people piled into the vehicle .
The area around the door quickly became standing room only , and after a half hearted attempt , the ticket guy swung his torso up and out the open door , to hold onto the roof rack … and we were off again .
I chuckled at the spectacle of it all as I listened to the tires ground out and rub every time we hit a small bump or pothole .
As we continued along our way we dropped people off in front of farms , or small towns and replaced them with others who we found standing along the roadside .
The roads themselves were an interesting mixture .
At times newly paved , other times so riddled with potholes that it felt more like we were dodging a minefield than driving on a major national highway .
The majority of the road , however , was packed dirt / sand which had been recently grated and was in relatively decent shape .
It ’s truly a testament to the economic state of the region that the major artery connecting northern Guatemala to Belize ( and Mexico in turn ) is little more than a two lane dirt road in many places .
About an hour into the two hour trip – things took a turn for the interesting .
The colectivo had emptied out to a reasonable and dare I say , nearly comfortable , level when we paused and picked up a group of 5 women with children .
While there were fewer people numerically , the size of our average group member had increased significantly between the newly added women and several stocky farmers we ’d picked up previously .
As they boarded , the ticket man directed one towards the sliver thin space between my seatmate and I .
The woman beside me muttered that the man must be out of his mind and I worked to squeeze myself as far towards the window / wall as possible .
It was n’t far enough , which meant that the woman ended up more or less sitting on my left leg .
I let out a quite groan - laugh and could n’t help but think to myself , “ Well boy , you ai n’t in Kansas anymore are ya’ ? ” .
Somehow they managed to get the sliding door closed and we started forward once again .
Unfortunately , most of the women had children with them of suckling age .
As it turns out , one of those children happened to belong to the woman in my lap .
Before long her daughter began to shriek , with eyes and nose running it quickly became apparent that Grandmother would n’t be able to quiet her .
No bother !
We pulled off to the side of the road and the ticket man jumped out .
Scratched his head for a minute and then began a game of musical chairs .
Mom was gone – back up to the front where she could hold her daughter .
Unfortunately for me , the person she switched with ?
A small dude .
It was at about this point in time that the adventure was starting to turn from entertaining cultural experience into …well , something I was ready to be done with .
I opened the window a crack more , leaning as much of my body as I could towards it and the window .
Doing my best to take up as little room as possible .
Then it really took a turn for the ridiculous .
It was like a lunch bell silently had gone off somewhere .
Within the course of 3 minutes – often in the middle of a conversation – three of the mother ’s casually pulled down their tops and offered up their teats to their suckling babies .
On the one hand , I ’m all for a more relaxed , mature and natural approach to breast feeding .
On the other hand – that ’s just not something you run into in the U.S. or most of Europe and when you do , it ’s typically done under the cover of a blanket .
Needless to say , I was in culture shock .
Just what IS the appropriate protocol for riding sandwiched in a small van with 20 some odd people , breasts exposed all over the place , with a dude sitting in your lap , while having a conversation with a breastfeeding woman ?
Frankly , I have n’t the slightest clue .
I laughed at my discomfort , looked out the window , counted the minutes and tried to remind myself – that here , this , was normal .
This was healthy .
This was natural .
Some two hours later we arrived in Flores .
I let out a sigh of relief and light groan as I slowly extricated myself from my seat , before thanking the Colectivo team for one hell of a cultural experience and taking me the extra few blocks out onto the Island of Flores itself .
In retrospect , would I do it again ?
In a heart beat .
Will I be using Colectivos for trips longer than 30 minutes in the future ?
Most definitely not .

Climate Change and the Death of Science
[ Note : the following was written on October 31 and updated November 3 , before the ‘ Climategate ’ CRU email scandal broke , and it is all the more pertinent in the light of those disclosures .
The CRU emails show how science has been perverted into a political movement , and how scientists conspired to serve a ‘ post - normal ’ agenda where truth is trampled – exactly as the proponents of ‘ post - normal ’ science had anticipated .
With the association between ‘ post - normal ’ science developed by Ravetz and its application in climate science by Hulme now widely exposed by this present post , Ravetz and Hulme jointly authored an article , published by the BBC on December 1 , entitled ‘ Show Your Working ’ :
What ‘ ClimateGate ’ means in which they sought to promote post - normal science further by capitalizing on the public disgust at the corruption of ‘ normal ’ science .
This is cynical because normal science was corrupted by covertly introducing post - normal activities in the first place . ]
What has become of science ?
We thought that science was about the pursuit of truth .
Then we became perplexed at how quickly scientists have prostituted themselves in the service of political agendas .
We have seen the unedifying spectacle of scientists refusing to share their data , fiddling their results , and resorting to ad hominem attacks on those who have exposed their work to be fraudulent .
We have seen the Royal Society becoming a shamelessly crude advocacy society .
We have seen President Obama choosing notorious climate alarmists and liars to be his personal advisors .
We have seen the peer review process and journal editors colluding to prevent publication of results that do not serve the politically - correct agenda , and scientists refusing to consider results that demolish their pet theories .
What is going on here ?
What is going on is that science is no longer what we thought it was .
It is now a tool in the hands of socialists , and the smart money is flowing into the pockets of ‘ scientists ’ who will serve their agenda .
Follow the money .
Whilst traditional physics and chemistry departments are closing in British universities , and there is a shortage of science teachers , there is an abundance of cash being poured into departments that will serve socialist ends , and no shortage of acolytes desirous to use this as a route to power .
Once there was modern science , which was hard work ; now we have postmodern science , where the quest for real , absolute truth is outdated , and ‘ science ’ is a wax nose that can be twisted in any direction to underpin the latest lying narrative in the pursuit of power .
Except they did n’t call it ‘ postmodern ’ science because then we might smell a rat .
They called it PNS ( post - normal science ) and hoped we would n’t notice .
It was thus named and explicated by Silvio O. Funtowicz and philosopher Jerome R. Ravetz , who in 1991 wrote the paper A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues , followed in 1992 by The good , the true and the postmodern , and in 1993 by Science for the post - normal age , where they promoted the idea that
… a new type of science – ‘ post - normal ’ – is emerging … in contrast to traditional problem - solving strategies , including core science , applied science , and professional consultancy … Post - normal science can provide a path to the democratization of science , and also a response to the current tendencies to post - modernity .
The ‘ response ’ was n’t to be a reaction against postmodernism , but an embracing of it , and going beyond it .
And it has sinister ramifications .
We had already been warned about Ravetz in the 1987 work Changing Boundaries of the Political , which stated
From the perspective of Anglo - American liberalism it seems easy enough to …point out that the old predictions of the British Marxist J.D. Bernal about the triumph of basic research under socialism have proved hopelessly wrong , and that the demands of J.R. Ravetz of the University of Leeds that science be made instrumental and moral will destroy the enterprise whatever its short - term benefits .
Ravetz , who described himself as a peacenik intellectual , was a political radical who drew on neo -Marxism , and was a stalwart in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) , anti-nuclear lobbies , and the Anti-Concorde Project .
He is well known for arguing that the pursuit of truth in science is an obsolete and dangerous concept .
He declared
… the puzzle - solving approach of ‘ normal science ’ is obsolete .
This is a drastic cultural change for science , which many scientists will find difficult to accept .
But there is no turning back ; we can understand post - normal science as the extension of democracy appropriate to the conditions of our age .
For us , quality is a replacement for truth in our methodology .
We argue that this is quite enough for doing science , and that truth is a category with symbolic importance , which itself is historically and culturally conditioned .
To pursue truth is to make a category mistake , so pursue the nebulous concept of ‘ quality ’ instead .
So much for facts : scientists need to learn how to serve the craft of rhetoric .
Even though it was concealed from those who constructed the models , the purpose of climate models was to provide the power of metaphor to political rhetoric :
… climate change models are a form of “ seduction ” … advocates of the models … recruit possible supporters , and then keep them on board when the inadequacy of the models becomes apparent .
This is what is understood as “ seduction ” ; but it should be observed that the process may well be directed even more to the modelers themselves , to maintain their own sense of worth in the face of disillusioning experience .
… but if they are not predictors , then what on earth are they ?
The models can be rescued only by being explained as having a metaphorical function , designed to teach us about ourselves and our perspectives under the guise of describing or predicting the future states of the planet …
A general recognition of models as metaphors will not come easily .
As metaphors , computer models are too subtle …for easy detection .
And those who created them may well have been prevented … from being aware of their essential character .
In 1990 Ravetz published The Merger of Knowledge with Power , then in 2002 a paper The Challenge beyond Orthodox Science .
Of the book by E.F. Pecci , Science and Human Transformation : Subtle Energies , Intentionality and Consciousness , a book about parapsychology , psychokinesis and extrasensory perception , he says it “ creates a bridge between modern physics and the realm of subtle energies … it opens the way to an expansion of our scientific conceptions to include those other energies that are increasingly important for our comprehension of the world around us . ”
In 2007 , Ravetz , then at the University of Oxford , published a paper Post - Normal Science and the complexity of transitions towards sustainability saying that post - normal science needed to be taken to the next stage .
The theory of Post - Normal Science …needs to be renewed and enriched …
The time is not ripe for a modification of PNS , and so the best move forward is to raise the issue of Sustainability .
For that I sketch a theory of complex systems , with special attention to pathologies and failures .
That provides the foundation for a use of ‘ contradiction ’ as a problem incapable of resolution in its own terms , and also of ‘ characteristic contradiction ’ that drives a system to a crisis .
With those materials it is possible to state the characteristic contradiction of our modern industrial civilisation , and provide a diagram with heuristic power .
Heuristic power is the power to explain ‘ factual novelties ’.
‘ Contradiction ’ and ‘ characteristic contradiction ’ are Marxist speak .
Heard about ‘ sustainability ’ recently ?
You bet !
Ravetz gives the Greens the tools they need to do their dirty work .
He gives them the philosophical blueprint to attack modern industrial civilization .
Now , let ’s be clear : post - normal science is one of the manipulative arts that Machiavelli would have been proud of .
We will take as classic examples and exponents of post - normal science the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , and Mike Hulme , the founding director of this Tyndall Centre , and Professor of Climate Change at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) .
Hulme makes it clear that the IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) is well and truly in the bag .
Stuart Blackman interviewed Hulme back in May , 2009 , and described him as “ one of the UK ’s most distinguished and high - profile climate scientists ” and the Tyndall Centre as “ an organisation so revered by environmentalists that it could be mistaken for the academic wing of the green movement ” .
The Tyndall Centre is deeply infiltrated by those serving the Green agenda , and produces work for advocacy groups such as Greenpeace and the IPCC .
It is funded by the British taxpayer , receiving grants from the three Research Councils NERC , EPSRC and ESRC .
We read today on their website
Situations Vacant : Three Lecturers in Climate Change at Tyndall UEA
These new academic staff appointments at UEA have been created as a result of substantial new investments in the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research .
The posts offer excellent opportunities for continuing , or developing , internationally outstanding research careers .
Notice that these are not lecturers in climate science , but climate change .
We will see below what these lecturers will be expected to espouse and teach .
The fig leaf that this might have been science has now been dropped .
As Mike Hulme has said
[ The ] chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , recently urged the media to focus on the “ scientific rationale for action ” rather than the political aspects of climate … I disagree …
In the end , politics will always trump science …we need better politics , not better science .
So what actually is ‘ Post - Normal Science ’ ?
Dr John Turnpenny of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and School of Environmental Sciences , University of East Anglia , in his paper
What is post - normal science ?
A critical review of its development , definitions and usages ( “ Post Normal Science – perspectives & prospects ” June 26 / 27 , 2009 at Oxford ) , had this to say :
The concept of post - normal science ( PNS ) has been developed as a potential approach to addressing wicked issues …
As such , the ‘ science ’ in PNS is not limited to a conventional understanding of the word …
So let ’s stop calling it science .
For a fuller description of post - normal science we turn to the essay by Eva Kunseler , Towards a new paradigm of Science in scientific policy advising ( headings and italics added ) :
Normal science
[ Normal ]
Science is a logic inductive process leading to theory formulation , while all the way put through critical tests that have been deductively derived from the theory ;
Popper ’s critical rationalist concept of science is an objective progression toward the truth …
The term normal science refers to the routine work of scientists within a paradigm ; slowly accumulating knowledge in accord with established theoretical assumptions …
The paradigm is enlarged and frontiers of knowledge and techniques pushed forward .
The exercise of scholarly activities is defined by the dominance of the Mertonian CUDOS norms of science .
They include :
( C ) ommunalism – the common ownership of scientific discoveries , according to which scientists give up intellectual property rights in exchange for recognition and esteem ;
( U ) niversalism – according to which claims to truth are evaluated in terms of universal or value - free criteria ;
( D) isinterestedness – according to which scientists are rewarded for acting in ways that appear to be selfless ;
( O) rganized ( S ) kepticism – all ideas must be tested and are subject to structured community scrutiny .
Post - normal science
A new concept of science was introduced by Funtowicz and Ravetz during the 1990s … The concept of post - normal science goes beyond the traditional assumptions that science is both certain and value - free …
The exercise of scholarly activities is defined by the dominance of goal orientation where scientific goals are controlled by political or societal actors … Scientists ’ integrity lies not in disinterestedness but in their behaviour as stakeholders .
Normal science made the world believe that scientists should and could provide certain , objective factual information …
The guiding principle of normal science – the goal of achievement of factual knowledge – must be modified to fit the post - normal principle …
For this purpose , post - normal scientists should be capable of establishing extended peer communities and allow for ‘ extended facts ’ from non-scientific experts …
In post - normal science , the maintenance and enhancement of quality , rather than the establishment of factual knowledge , is the key task of scientists …
Involved social actors must agree on the definition of perceptions , narratives , interpretation of models , data and indicators … scientists have to contribute to society by learning as quickly as possible about different perceptions … instead of seeking deep ultimate knowledge .
So this is not science as we know it .
Science has to re-invent itself as a political tool , just as it was under Hitler and Stalin .
Scientists must learn ‘ as quickly as possible ’ what will please the political elite , and serve it up .
As one Richard Fernandez has written :
All in all , the notion of “ post - normal science ” seems like a complete contradiction in terms or a perversion of the standard definition of science as commonly understood .
It appears to be an elaborate and dishonest attempt to pass off the preferences of a single group as some kind of pseudo - science .
There ’s a much simpler term for this dishonest phrase : politics .
Post - normal science is nothing but a cheap and lying term for a political diktat ; for the rule of the self - appointed over everyone else .
Whatever truth “ Global Warming ” may contain it has surely been damaged by its association with this disreputable and vile concept which brazenly casts aside the need for any factual basis and declares in the most unambiguous terms that whatever values it chooses to promote constitutes a truth unimpeachable by reality and a set of values that none dare challenge .
Mike Hulme , founding director of the Tyndall Centre , and Professor of Climate Change at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , prepared climate scenarios and reports for the UK Government ( including the UKCIP98 and UKCIP02 scenarios , and reviewer for UKCP09 ) , the European Commission , UNEP , UNDP , WWF - International and the IPCC , and was co-ordinating Lead Author for the chapter on ‘ Climate scenario development ’ for the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC , as well as a contributing author for several other chapters .
Hulme has been a champion and exponent of post - normal science for some years to serve his own socialist agenda , and this is what he has to say about post - normal science ( some italics added ) :
Philosophers and practitioners of science have identified this particular mode of scientific activity as one that occurs … where values are embedded in the way science is done and spoken .
It has been labelled “ post - normal ” science .
Climate change seems to fall in this category .
Disputes in post - normal science focus …on the process of science – who gets funded , who evaluates quality , who has the ear of policy …
The IPCC is a classic example of a post - normal scientific activity .
Within a capitalist world order , climate change is actually a convenient phenomenon to come along .
The largest academic conference that has yet been devoted to the subject of climate change finished yesterday [ March 12 , 2009 ] in Copenhagen … I attended the Conference , chaired a session …
[ The ] statement drafted by the conference ’s Scientific Writing Team … contained … a set of messages drafted largely before the conference started by the organizing committee …interpreting it for a political audience …
And the conference chair herself , Professor Katherine Richardson , has described the messages as politically - motivated .
All well and good .
The danger of a “ normal ” reading of science is that it assumes science can first find truth , then speak truth to power , and that truth - based policy will then follow … exchanges often reduce to ones about scientific truth rather than about values , perspectives and political preferences .
… ‘ self - evidently ’ dangerous climate change will not emerge from a normal scientific process of truth - seeking … scientists – and politicians – must trade truth for influence .
What matters about climate change is not whether we can predict the future with some desired level of certainty and accuracy .
Climate change is telling the story of an idea and how that idea is changing the way in which our societies think , feel , interpret and act .
And therefore climate change is extending itself well beyond simply the description of change in physical properties in our world …
The function of climate change I suggest , is not as a lower - case environmental phenomenon to be solved …
It really is not about stopping climate chaos .
Instead , we need to see how we can use the idea of climate change – the matrix of ecological functions , power relationships , cultural discourses and materials flows that climate change reveals – to rethink how we take forward our political , social , economic and personal projects over the decades to come .
There is something about this idea that makes it very powerful for lots of different interest groups to latch on to , whether for political reasons , for commercial interests , social interests in the case of NGOs , and a whole lot of new social movements looking for counter culture trends .
Climate change has moved from being a predominantly physical phenomenon to being a social one …
It is circulating anxiously in the worlds of domestic politics and international diplomacy , and with mobilising force in business , law , academia , development , welfare , religion , ethics , art and celebrity .
Climate change also teaches us to rethink what we really want for ourselves … mythical ways of thinking about climate change reflect back to us truths about the human condition …
The idea of climate change should be seen as an intellectual resource around which our collective and personal identifies and projects can form and take shape .
We need to ask not what we can do for climate change , but to ask what climate change can do for us …Because the idea of climate change is so plastic , it can be deployed across many of our human projects and can serve many of our psychological , ethical , and spiritual needs .
… climate change has become an idea that now travels well beyond its origins in the natural sciences … climate change takes on new meanings and serves new purposes … climate change has become “ the mother of all issues ” , the key narrative within which all environmental politics – from global to local – is now framed …
Rather than asking “ how do we solve climate change ? ” we need to turn the question around and ask : “ how does the idea of climate change alter the way we arrive at and achieve our personal aspirations … ? ”
We need to reveal the creative psychological , spiritual and ethical work that climate change can do and is doing for us …we open up a way of resituating culture and the human spirit …
As a resource of the imagination , the idea of climate change can be deployed around our geographical , social and virtual worlds in creative ways … it can inspire new artistic creations in visual , written and dramatised media .
The idea of climate change can provoke new ethical and theological thinking about our relationship with the future … .
We will continue to create and tell new stories about climate change and mobilise these stories in support of our projects .
Whereas a modernist reading of climate may once have regarded it as merely a physical condition for human action , we must now come to terms with climate change operating simultaneously as an overlying , but more fluid , imaginative condition of human existence .
We always said that Climate Change was a belief system , and there you have it .
It has abandoned the pretence of objective science .
As Hulme reveals , it is a postmodern narrative and the IPCC is a “ classic example of a post - normal scientific activity ” .
This is leading to ridiculous situations .
In early November 2009 , a certain Tim Nicholson was granted permission to take his former employer Grainger to a tribunal .
Commenting on this , his lawyer states :
Essentially what the judgment says is that a belief in man-made climate change and the alleged resulting moral imperative is capable of being a philosophical belief and is therefore protected by the 2003 religion or belief regulations .
Nicholson said he had tried to set up a carbon management system for the company , but was unable to work out its carbon footprint because staff had refused to give him the necessary data .
He accused the chief executive , Rupert Dickinson , of showing “ contempt ” for his beliefs by not minimizing carbon emissions .
Commenting on this issue in The Guardian , Andrew Brown , clearly in favour of coercion , writes in an article entitled We ’re doomed without a green religion :
The justification for burning heretics was perfectly simple : dissent threatened the survival of society … not to coerce , itself becomes immoral … Compulsion will be needed but compulsion alone wo n’t do it …
They need to believe in what they are forced to do …and that will also mean its dark side : the pressure of conformism , the force of self - righteousness , huge moral weight attached to practically useless gestures like unplugging phone chargers .
They need , in fact , something that does look a lot like religion …
Should that happen , the denialists , who claim that it is all a religion , will for once be telling the truth …
Mike Hulme has recently published a book entitled Why We Disagree About Climate Change from which some of his quotes above are taken .
I can do no better than quote extracts of the book review by Joseph Bast in American Thinker :
More than a few people will be tempted to buy this book based on the promise , implicit in its title , that it offers an examination of the ideas and motives of both sides in the global warming debate .
But that is not what this book is about .
Rather , it is the musings of a British socialist about how to use the global warming issue as a means of persuading “ the masses ” to give up their economic liberties .
The fact that the author , Mike Hulme , is a scientist who helped write the influential reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and many other influential government agencies makes this book more disturbing than informative .
… socialists like Hulme can frame the global warming issue in such as way as to achieve seemingly unrelated goals such as sustainable development , income redistribution , population control , social justice , and many other items on the liberal / socialist wish - list .
It is troubling to read a prominent scientist who has so clearly lost sight of his cardinal duty — to be skeptical of all theories and always open to new data .
It is particularly troubling when this same scientist endorses lying by others to advance his personal political agenda .
Read this book if you want insight into the mind of a scientist who has surrendered all moral authority to speak truthfully about global warming .
Avoid it if you are looking for a book that explains why we disagree about climate change .
From what Hulme has admitted , the climate change debate is not about truth and physical reality , but a way of making it the “ mother of all issues ” in order to achieve socialist and Marxist aims , including de-capitalizing the West , and bringing about global governance by an elite .
Hulme is delighted to be in the vanguard , and it is paying him handsomely .
Critical to this is capture of the scientific institutions .
Hulme says , we are all actors “ in the unfolding story … alongside the personal gods of the heavens ” .
Climate change is a new lying narrative serving an agenda as old as the hills .
Here is an account of the very first post - normal science experiment , pitting against ultimate truth a lying agenda and narrative with an ‘ extended peer community ’ and ‘ extended facts ’ in the pursuit of power :
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made .
And he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
And the woman said unto the serpent ,
We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :
But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
And the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die : For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .

Made in China now has a fast - growing sibling : Bought by China .
Beijing is using its accumulation of billions of American dollars to step up its investments around the globe .
In the last year , Chinese acquisitions in the U.S. have ranged from a relatively obscure theater in Branson , Mo. , to stakes in such famous brands as Coca - Cola and Johnson & Johnson .
China ’s huge stockpile of dollars stems in part from Americans ’ enormous purchases of relatively inexpensive Chinese manufactured goods and the significantly smaller volume of U.S. exports to the Asian country .
By recycling much of its dollar trove over the years back to the United States with the purchase of U.S. government debt , China has in effect helped Washington finance its deficits .
Now , Beijing is branching out .
The country ’s direct investments overseas rose 6.5 % in 2009 to $ 43.3 billion -- despite a global slump in such investments -- and could jump to $ 60 billion this year , Chinese state media reported last week .
Formal estimates of Chinese investments in the U.S. last year , excluding bond purchases , range from $ 3.9 billion -- a figure put out by New York research firm Dealogic -- to $ 6.4 billion , a number that comes from Derek Scissors , a Heritage Foundation research fellow who tracks China ’s global transactions .
The real number could be even higher , Scissors says .
In any case , the total is up sharply from several years ago , when Chinese investments hardly registered a blip on U.S. financial radar screens .
One goal of the increased investment in the U.S. , led by the government ’s vast sovereign wealth fund , is to buy assets while prices are depressed .
The strategy also seeks higher earnings from Beijing ’s pile of assets denominated in foreign currencies , which is estimated at $ 2.5 trillion and mostly held in low - interest U.S. government securities and other low - risk , dollar - denominated investments .
Chinese officials worry that a weakening dollar will erode the value of these holdings .
A sign that Beijing is acting on that concern came last week when the U.S. government reported that Chinese holdings of Treasury securities slid to $ 894.8 billion in December , down 3.7 % from November and the lowest level since May .
Even at their increased level , Chinese investments last year in U.S. companies and property used up only a speck of Beijing ’s foreign reserves -- and , according to Dealogic , accounted for just 3 % of total foreign investments made in the U.S. last year .
Although the injections of cash from overseas are welcomed by many U.S. companies and communities , the step - up in Chinese purchases comes against a backdrop of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing .
Relations have been strained as the two superpowers have traded tough words over China ’s currency policy , U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and President Obama ’s meeting last month with the Dalai Lama , not to mention disputes over global climate policy and Google ’s bid to challenge government censorship .
“ Now that we ’re getting a protectionist push [ in the U.S. ] , you ’re going to see hostility toward Chinese investments , ” Scissors said .
Chinese government officials have visited Scissors ’ office in Washington , he said , to gauge the potential “ storm of protectionism coming out of Congress ” before the midterm elections in November .
U.S. lawmakers agree that political heat will increase on China to loosen its grip on the value of its currency and open its markets .
“ Absolutely , China ’s going to have to give and make more movement , ” said Rep. Adam Smith ( D - Wash . ) .
Beijing has n’t forgotten what happened in the summer of 2005 when state - controlled oil company CNOOC Ltd. dropped its bid to buy El Segundo - based Unocal Corp .
after intense opposition from lawmakers who cited concerns about U.S. energy and economic security .
Chinese investors retreated from the U.S. market for much of the rest of 2005 and 2006 , focusing instead on securing oil and natural resources in Africa , Australia and elsewhere .
Since then , Chinese investors have increasingly sought service companies .
The largest Chinese investments in the U.S. have come from state - owned firms , primarily a $ 300 - billion fund known as China Investment Corp .
It initially targeted well - known financial companies , spending billions to buy stakes in private equity giant Blackstone Group and investment bank Morgan Stanley .
But after getting burned by the financial crisis that emerged in 2008 , the sovereign wealth fund has been shifting to real estate .
Its investments in the last year have included hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate - related funds managed by Oaktree Capital of Los Angeles , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc .
The move into real estate appeared to be motivated by bargain prices .
“ In the past year , the U.S. real estate market seemed to have hit bottom and signs of recovery were obvious , ” said Mei Xinyu , a researcher at the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing .
China ’s growing investments should be viewed not as an effort to exert influence in the U.S. , Mei said , but rather as an attempt to do some American - style business .
“ There ’s a saying in America , ‘ Business is business , ’ ” he said .
“ People should not politicize business activities . ”
In a filing last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission , China Investment said its stakes in U.S. companies included stock in Apple and Visa , among other global brands .
Its biggest announced transaction in the U.S. in the last year was buying a 15.8 % stake in power company AES Corp. for $ 1.6 billion .
Other Chinese enterprises have invested in such companies as Honolulu - based alternative - energy technology company Hoku Scientific Inc. , auto - parts supplier Delphi Corp .'s automotive - brake business and Solix Biofuels , a Colorado firm working on a way to turn algae into energy , according to Dealogic .
Chinese officials are mindful of the backlash that Japanese investors endured two decades ago when they bought , at the height of Japan ’s real estate boom and ascendance in the global economy , landmark properties in the U.S. , including Rockefeller Center in 1989 and Pebble Beach Golf Course in 1990 .
Private Chinese investors have begun to get into the action but , according to analysts , have generally been involved in small transactions , buying houses for their families and investing in factories and other facilities to be closer to the North American market .
Chinese real estate acquisitions to date have hardly been trophy properties .
In December , a Beijing - based performing arts company took ownership of the White House Theatre -- built to look like it belongs on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington instead of in Branson , a popular tourist destination in the Ozarks .
The China Heaven Creation International Performing Arts Co. paid $ 3.5 million in cash for the property , said Pam Critchfield , a marketing consultant for the theater .
In a deal announced in December , Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels -- part of a big state - owned company that owns hotels and travel operations in China -- formed a 50 - 50 joint venture with Thayer Lodging Group of Annapolis , Md. , to buy Interstate Hotels & Resorts .
Interstate , based in Arlington , Va. , manages 232 properties in the United States and elsewhere .
Interstate valued the transaction at $ 307 million .
Chinese companies have learned that allying with partners tends to draw less attention , said Wenran Jiang , a China expert at the University of Alberta who has studied Chinese investments around the globe .
When multiple parties are involved in a deal , he said , the Chinese buyer ’s stake gets diluted .
“ So you ca n’t report that the Chinese are taking over . ”

March 9 , 2010  --
A Colorado Catholic school 's decision to deny enrollment to a young child with lesbian mothers has divided the religious community with some questioning whether a preschooler should be used to make a political statement .
The child , currently a preschool student at the Sacred Heart of Jesus school in Boulder , would be allowed to finish out the school year , but would not be readmitted for kindergarten in the fall .
The move came after the parents ' sexual orientation drew the attention of the parish priest , the Rev. Bill Breslin , and the Denver archdiocese .
Breslin did not return messages seeking comment , but explained his decision in a lengthy blog posting in which he defended his decision as protecting the child and the parents " from the necessary conflict that their relationship would bring to a clear - seeing and committed Catholic community . "
" It is not about punishing the child for the sins of his or her parents , " he wrote . "
It is simply that the lesbian couple is saying that their relationship is a good one that should be accepted by everyone ; and the Church cannot agree to that . "
The child 's ousting became public after some of the teachers who did n't agree with the decision contacted Boulder Pride , the city 's gay , lesbian , bi-sexual and transgender services organization .
The child 's parents are adamant , executive director Aicilia Lewis said , about not being identified .
" Like any parent , they want to protect their family , " she said .
But some members of the community , including a contingent of heterosexual Catholics , are expressing their anger and frustration on the mothers ' behalf .
A group of protesters converged on the church for Sunday 's Mass , many carrying signs with statements such as " the true heart of Jesus has love for all . "
Even some of Breslin 's own parishioners did n't agree with the decision .
" I just feel the Catholic Church is a church that should be teaching acceptance and tolerance .
I just do n't think this is an example of that , " Juli Aderman - Hagerty told ABC 's Denver affiliate KMGH .
" Father Breslin said it right .
We 're all sinners .
Why discriminate against this end of sinners ? "
But his congregation and the Denver archdiocese has largely stuck behind Breslin .
" People who understand the Catholic teaching will understand why the decision was made , " Fabien Ardila told KMGH after Mass this past Sunday .
Priest Stands Up for Catholic Values Because ' It Seems No One Else Is '
The archdiocese posted a statement on its Web site that read in part , " Parents living in open discord with Catholic teaching in areas of faith and morals unfortunately choose by their actions to disqualify their children from enrollment . "
" To allow children in these circumstances to continue in our school would be a cause of confusion for the student in that what they are being taught in school conflicts with what they experience in the home , " the statement read .
The school is allowed by law to deny enrollment to any child and is not bound by the same anti-discrimination laws upheld at public schools because it is a private religious institution .
A woman who answered the phone at the school said they had no comment on the matter .
Breslin spoke at length on the subject Sunday during a sermon that Boulder Pride board president Dave Ensign attended .
" It was a little hard to hear , " he said .
" You get a little bit raw . "
" I 've been around the block a few times on these issues .
I do n't get too angry , " he said .
" I feel for the people who are involved .
I see a lot of hurt people . "
Instead of reacting with anger or furstration , Boulder Pride has encouraged its supporters and supporters of the lesbian couple and their child to contact the school and the archdiocese .
They held a short - notice meeting last week to allow the community to vent and share ideas and plan to do more in the future .
By Breslin's own blog , which retold Sunday 's sermon , there seems to be no shaking the priest 's faith that he is defending his church by forcing the child to leave the school .
" We need to fight for our Catholic values because here in Boulder it seems , no one else is .
In many ways , I feel quite alone , even though I know I am not alone , " he wrote .
" How long has it been now that we have felt intimidated about our teaching on the sacrament of marriage -- even to the point of feeling that we should apologize for our faith ? " he wrote .
Swarm intelligence is a branch of artificial intelligence that attempts to get computers and robots to mimic the highly efficient behavior of colony insects such as ants and bees .
Ants , for example , use pheromone trails to mark the routes they use to find food .
The more traversed trails develop an accumulation of pheromone that attracts new ants , whereas pheromones deposited on paths less traveled will evaporate over time .
With an eye on the potential that swarm intelligence holds for the development of information technology and robotics , the European Research Council ( ERC ) awarded a $ 2.9 - million ERC Advanced Grant Tuesday to Marco Dorigo to help the research director for the Belgian Funds for Scientific Research ( FNRS ) and co-director of IRIDIA ( the Free University of Brussels 's artificial intelligence lab ) further his work engineering swarm intelligence systems .
Phone systems use a similar approach to routing calls , using bits of information as " virtual pheromones " that reinforce paths through less congested areas of a network , researchers Eric Bonabeau and Guy Théraulaz noted in Scientific American 's February 2008 special issue on robots .
Dorigo and his colleagues have applied this philosophy to the Internet and managed to outperform all other data - traffic routing methods , the authors added .
Dorigo , who has been researching ant colony swarm behavior for more than a decade , will use the ERC funding to develop a universal engineering methodology for the design and implementation of artificial swarm intelligence systems .
" We believe that in the future , swarm intelligence will be an important tool for researchers and engineers interested in solving certain classes of complex problems , " Dorigo wrote in an e-mail to Scientific American .
" To build the foundations of this discipline and to develop an appropriate methodology , we will proceed in parallel both at an abstract level and by tackling a number of challenging problems in selected research domains .
The research domains we have chosen are optimization , robotics , networks and data - mining . "
Swarm intelligence systems promise to provide an alternate way of designing systems that have greater autonomy and self - sufficiency , " relying on direct or indirect interactions among simple individual agents , " according to Bonabeau and Théraulaz .
The difficulty is that researchers still lack a detailed understanding of the inner workings of insect swarms .
Computer scientists have been unable to identify the specific rules by which individuals in a swarm interact , making it difficult for them to develop more advanced software that mimics this behavior , the authors wrote .
As far back as 1991 Dorigo used his knowledge of ant behavior to create mathematical procedures that could be used to solve complex human problems , such as routing trucks , scheduling airlines or guiding military robots , Peter Miller wrote in a July 2007 National Geographic article .
The Italian - born researcher is also the founder of the " swarmanoid " project , whose goal is to design , implement and control a distributed robotic system of small heterogeneous , dynamically connected , autonomous robots .
" The swarmanoid that we intend to build will be comprised of numerous ( about 60 ) autonomous robots of three types : eye - bots , hand - bots and foot - bots , " according to the swarmoid Web site Swarm - Bots .
Foot - bots are used to transport things on the ground , and hand - bots climb walls and manipulate objects , whereas eye - bots fly , providing information to the other units , according to Miller .
Dorigo himself noted in the February 2004 issue of Wired that ants create highways leading to food , organize the distribution of larvae in their anthills , form cemeteries by clustering dead ants , build living bridges to cross gaps in their way , and assign tasks as needed without any centralized control .
This makes these insects an excellent model for algorithms that could be used to program simple devices to achieve complex results , he added .
Hello .
My name is Henry .
I like to change words on things .
I tweet under the pseudonym @tehawesome so that 's why this blog has a silly name .
David Smith believes he has build the world 's smallest working train , and based on the images and video I would n't doubt that claim .
Apparently , it is 35,000 times smaller than the real deal .
Of course , it would have been more legit as a model train if it ran on its own mini engine instead of a rotating external motor , but since nano machines of that caliber are not readily available , I will have to call this build impressive nonetheless .
Probably could use a little moisturizer on those hands though .

Handling downtime :
The capabilities API and testing
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , tech , app- engine , coding , capabilities
After the unfortunate outage the other day , how to handle downtime with your App Engine app is a bit of a hot topic .
So what better time to address proper error handling for situations where App Engine is n't performing at 100 % ?
There 's three major topics to cover here : Handling timeouts from API calls , using the Capabilities API , and testing your app 's support for handling failures .
We 'll go over them in order .
Handling timeouts
At the ' stub ' level , timeouts and other exceptions are communicated by the stub throwing an google .
appengine.runtime.apiproxy_errors.ApplicationError .
ApplicationError instances have an ' application_error ' field , which contains an ID , drawn from google.appengine.runtime.apiproxy_errors , which indicates the cause of the error .
As you can see , DEADLINE_EXCEEDED is 4 .
Other errors of interest are OVER_QUOTA , which will occur if your app runs out of quota for a given API call or capability , and CAPABILITY_DISABLED , which is thrown if the API capability has been explicitly disabled ( more on this later ) .
Each of the various APIs catches ApplicationErrors thrown by their stub , and wraps them in a higher level exception .
The datastore , for example , has a function , _ToDatastoreError that maps different error codes to exceptions from datastore_errors , which results in an ApplicationError ( 4 ) being transformed into a datastore_errors .
Timeout exception .
The urlfetch API , similarly , maps exceptions , with a timeout ( along with some other errors ) being represented as a DownloadError .
The best way to handle timeouts varies from API to API .
The datastore API now automatically retries timed out operations .
If it cannot execute the operation even after multiple timeouts , it will return a db .
Timeout exception ( or a db.
Transaction FailedError if the exception occurred inside a transaction ) .
For an in - depth description of how to handle datastore timeouts and why they happen , I recommend this excellent and well written article .
Memcache , in contrast , generally wo n't return timeout errors on get operations , but will rather fail to return a value .
Set operations return error codes rather than throwing exceptions , in conformance with the memcached API it imitates .
See the memcache docs for details .
Wherever possible , you should handle exceptions on a call - by - call basis , and deal with them appropriately .
Sometimes , however , an exception from a given API call simply means you 're unable to service the user 's request , and have to show them an error page and ask them to try again later .
In such situations , it helps to have a catch - all exception handler , which gets invoked for any exceptions that make it to the top level of your app .
The webapp framework provides just such a facility in the form of the handle_exception method , which gets called with the exception if your handler methods ( get , post , etc ) throw one .
By default , this method calls self.error ( 500 ) , logs the exception , and then prints the stacktrace to the output if debugging is enabled .
Overriding this to present a nicer message to your users is probably a good idea - even better , override the error ( ) method to display appropriate error pages for all the status codes your app can return !
The Capabilities API
While it 's important to have proper exception handling for API calls , that 's not all you can do .
With the Capabilities API , you can proactively query App Engine to check if a given API , capability , or specific method is available .
Documentation , unfortunately , is rather light at the moment , so consult the source for details .
In general , calls to the Capabilities API take a service name - such as ' memcache ' or ' datastore_v3 ' - and optionally either a ' capability ' , such as ' write ' , or a specific method , such as ' put ' .
The API then returns whether or not that entire API , capability , or individual method is available .
For example :
from google.appengine.api import capabilities images_enabled = capabilities .CapabilitySet( 'images ').is_enabled ( ) datastore_write_enabled = capabilities .CapabilitySet(' datastore_v3 ' , capabilities =[ ' write ' ] ).is_enabled ( ) memcache_get_enabled = capabilities .CapabilitySet ( ' memcache ' , methods = [ ' get ' ] ) .is_enabled ( )
We can make use of this to , for example , create some WSGI middleware that automatically returns a friendly error message any time the datastore is entirely disabled ( presuming our app is dependent on the datastore , and sets a flag in the WSGI environment if it 's read - only :
def capability_middleware( application ) : def wsgi_app ( environ , start_response ) : if not capabilities .
CapabilitySet ( ' datastore_v3').is_enabled ( ) : print_error_message( environ , start_response ) else : environ [ ' capabilities.read_only ' ] = capabilities .CapabilitySet(' datastore_v3 ' , capabilities =[ ' write ' ] ).is_enabled ( ) return application ( environ , start_response ) return wsgi_app
Obviously , far more sophisticated handling of disabled capabilities are possible - for example , you can use the ' read_only ' flag the above middleware sets to disable any features of your site that require writing to the datastore , politely informing users that it 's not available , rather than resorting to an error page .
Testing timeouts and capabilities
Once you 've implemented proper error handling , and you 're using the capabilities API , the question inevitably arises :
How do I test this ?
We can do this using hooks - specifically , using a pre-call hook that throws the exception we want to test .
Here 's a class that makes it simple to test for error returns from APIs :
from google.appengine.runtime import apiproxy from google.appengine.runtime import apiproxy_errors class APIErrorHook ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self.error_map = {} # Maps ( api , method ) tuples to error statuses def set_error_code ( self , service , method , code ) : self.error_map [ ( service , method ) ] = code def get_error_code ( self , service , method ) : " " " Returns the error code to return for a service and method , or None . " " " return self.error_map.get ( ( service , method ) , None ) def _error_hook ( self , service , method , request , response ) : error_code = self.get_error_code( service , method ) if error_code : raise apiproxy_errors.ApplicationError( error_code ) def install ( self , apiproxy , unique_name ) : apiproxy.GetPreCallHooks ( ) .
Append( unique_name , self._error_hook )
This should all be fairly straightforward :
Once the hook is installed , calling set_error_code with a service and method name will cause all future invocations to raise an ApplicationError with that code .
Calling set_error_code with None as the code will make the API call operate normally again .
Here 's an example of it in use :
from google.appengine.api import apiproxy_stub_map error_hook = APIErrorHook ( ) error_hook.install(apiproxy_stub_map.apiproxy , ' error_hook ' ) db.get ( a_key ) # Works error_hook.set_error_code('datastore_v3 ' , ' Get ' , apiproxy .
DEADLINE_EXCEEDED ) db.get ( a_key ) #
Throws a db .
Timeout error error_hook.set_error_code('datastore_v3 ' , ' Get ' , None ) db.get ( a_key ) # Works again
That 's all there is to it .
You can easily use this in your unit tests or for manual testing - just remember to install the API hook when you need it .
For testing the Capabilities API , we need a little more sophistication .
The default implementation of the capability service always returns ' ENABLED ' for every call .
Normally , modifying this behaviour would require writing our own capability stub and reaching into the SDK to replace the default one with our implementation .
Fortunately , however , the capabilities API is simple enough that we can instead register a post - call hook that changes the return value to whatever we want it to be .
Here 's an extension of the above class that adds the ability to enable and disable APIs :
class CapabilityHook ( APIErrorHook ) : # Maps ( service , method ) tuples to the capability it depends on _CAPABILITY_MAP = { ( ' datastore_v3 ' , ' Put ' ) : ' write ' , ( ' datastore_v3 ' , ' Delete ' ) : ' write ' , } def __init__ ( self ) : self.disabled_capabilities = set () #
Set of ( service , capability ) tuples that are disabled super ( CapabilityHook , self ) .__init__ ( ) def set_capability_disabled ( self , service , capability , disabled ) : if disabled : self.disabled_capabilities.add(( service , capability ) ) else : self.disabled_capabilities.discard(( service , capability ) ) def get_error_code ( self , service , method ) : if ( service , '* ' ) in self.disabled_capabilities : return apiproxy .
CAPABILITY_DISABLED required_capability = CapabilityHook ._CAPABILITY_MAP.get(( service , method ) , None ) if required_capability and ( service , required_capability ) in self.disabled_capabilities : return apiproxy .
CAPABILITY_DISABLED
return super( CapabilityHook , self ) .get_error_code( service , method ) def _capability_hook ( self , service , method , request , response ) : # Accumulate a mapping of capabilities to enabled - ness capabilities = {} for capability in request.capability_list ( ) : if ( method , capability ) in self.disabled_capabilities : capabilities [ ( method , capability ) ] =
False else : capabilities [ ( method , capability ) ] = True for method in request.call_list ( ) : required_capability = CapabilityHook ._CAPABILITY_MAP.get( method , '*' ) if required_capability in self.disabled_capabilities or ( service , '*' ) in self.disabled_capabilities : capabilities [ ( method , capability ) ] = False else : capabilities.setdefault ( ( method , capability ) , True ) #
Add them to the response response.clear_config ( ) for ( service , capability ) , enabled in capabilities.items ( ) : config = response.add_config( ) config.set_package(service ) config.set_capability( capability ) config.set_status(capabilities.IsEnabledResponse.ENABLED
if enabled else capabilities .
IsEnabledResponse.DISABLED ) # Calculate the summary response config.set_summary_status(capabilities.IsEnabledResponse.ENABLED if False not in capabilities.values ( ) else capabilities .IsEnabledResponse.DISABLED ) def install ( self , apiproxy , unique_name ) : apiproxy.GetPostCallHooks ( ) .
Append( unique_name , self._capability_hook , ' capability_service ') super ( CapabilityHook , self ) .install ( apiproxy , unique_name )
This is substantially more complicated than the previous handler , because it has to implement the intricacies of the capabilities API .
The basic operation is fairly straightforward , however .
The set_capability_disabled method allows you to disable or enable specific capabilities .
To disable or enable an entire service , use set_capability_disabled with a capability name of '*'.
CapabilityHook then extends the get_error_code method to add additional checks :
It returns CAPABILITY_DISABLED if the entire service is disabled , or if the method being requested is mentioned in its _CAPABILITY_MAP with a capability name , and that capability is disabled .
The class also implements a post - call hook for the capability service ; this modifies responses by checking its own internal list of capabilities and assembling a response appropriately .
The summary status is set to ENABLED iff all the individual queried capabilities and methods are themselves enabled .
Here 's a simple example of it in use :
capability_hook = CapabilityHook ( ) capability_hook.install(apiproxy_stub_map.apiproxy , ' error_hook ' ) db.put( some_entity ) # Succeeds db.get ( some_key ) # Succeeds capabilities .CapabilitySet(' datastore_v3 ' , capabilities =[ ' write ' ] ).is_enabled ( ) # Returns True capability_hook.set_capability_disabled ('datastore_v3 ' , ' write ' ) db.put( some_entity ) # Fails , raising datastore_errors .
Error db.get ( some_key ) # Still succeeds capabilities .CapabilitySet(' datastore_v3 ' , capabilities =[ ' write ' ] ).is_enabled ( ) # Returns False
There you go :
How to handle API call errors , how to detect disabled capabilities , and how to test both of them .
Now you 're prepared for the next scheduled maintenance , or the unlikely event of another unplanned outage !

** Guide Updated **
This guide is an evolution from this original guide .
Unless the Kerrighed Team comes up with a substantially different version , this is the only update to this guide I will ever make as the steps are pretty much the same for all svn versions I have tested .
On this version :
-- Added changes for the latest Kerrighed svn 5586
-- Fixed some steps to make them more readable and error free .
-- Added simple MPI example to see how your program interacts with the cluster .
-- Added troubleshooting section for some situations in which the nodes do not receive the image from the controller .
Thank you all for your previous comments and emails .

eth0 -- node2 : 10.11.12.102 ( static IP Address )
--------------------------------------------------------
Debian Lenny with default kernel 2.6.26-2-686
All steps done as root on the controller
==
Step 1 :
-- dhcp server will provide ip addresses to the nodes .
-- tftpd-hpa will deliver the image to the nodes
-- portmap converts RPC ( Remote Procedure Call ) program numbers into port numbers .
NFS uses that to make RPC calls .
-- syslinux is a boot loader for Linux which simplifies first - time installs
-- nfs will be used to export directory structures to the nodes
When installing these packages accept the default settings presented for dhcp3 and TFTP .
#apt - get install dhcp3 - server tftpd - hpa portmap syslinux nfs - kernel - server nfs-common
These packages are for MPI ( see under TESTING below ) .
You can install them on the controller to compile your MPI programs , then move them to any of the nodes and start the program from the node ; or you can create , compile , and execute your MPI programs on any of the nodes .
Either way , you need these packages on the node to execute your MPI code no matter option you choose :
#apt - get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi1 libopenmpi-dev
==
Step 2 :
Identify ethernet interfaces which will be used by the dhcp server .
For this setup , we are setting up " eth0 " as the network card that 's
feeding the nodes of the internal network .
#nano /etc/ default/dhcp3-server
INTERFACES =" eth0 ″
==
Step 3 :
General configuration for the DHCP server .
Make a backup of original configuration file in case you want to use it as a reference later on .
cat /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf >
/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf.bkp
#nano /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf
# General options
option dhcp - max - message - size 2048 ;
use - host - decl - names on ;
deny unknown - clients ;
deny bootp ;
# DNS settings
option domain - name " nibiru_system " ; # any name will do
option domain - name - servers 10.11.12.1 ; # server ’s IP address : dhcp and tftp
# network
subnet 10.11.12.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
option routers 10.11.12.1 ; # server IP as above .
option broadcast - address 10.11.12.255 ; # broadcast address
}
# ip addresses for nodes
group {
filename " pxelinux.0 " ; # PXE bootloader in / var / lib / tftpboot
option root - path " 10.11.12.1:/nfsroot/ kerrighed " ; # bootable system
# the other laptop
host node1 {
fixed - address 10.11.12.101 ; # first node
hardware ethernet 00:0B : DB:1B : E3:89 ;
}
#desktop
host node2 {
fixed - address 10.11.12.102 ;
hardware ethernet 00:16:76:C1:F7:D4 ;
}
server - name " nibiru_headnode " ; #
Any name will do
next - server 10.11.12.1 ; # Server IP where the image is .
For this network it 's the same machine
}
==
Step 4 :
Configure the TFTP server .
#nano /etc / default/tftpd-hpa
RUN_DAEMON =" yes "
OPTIONS= " - l -s /var/lib/tftpboot "
==
Step 5 :
Configure inetd for TFTP server .
nano /etc/inetd.conf
tftp dgram udp wait root /usr / sbin/in.tftpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot
==
Step 6 :
This directory will hold the image for the nodes to boot from .
#mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
==
Step 7 :
Copy PXE bootloader to the TFTP server .
# cp -p /usr/lib/syslinux/pxelinux.0 /var/lib/tftpboot/
==
Step 8 :
Fallback configuration .
If the TFTP client cannot find a PXE bootload configuration
for a specific node , it will use this one .
#nano / var / lib/ tftpboot / pxelinux.cfg / default
LABEL linux
KERNEL vmlinuz-2.6.20-krg
APPEND console=tty 1 root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=10.11.12.1:/nfsroot / kerrighed ip=dhcp rw session_id=1
==
Step 9 :
This step is optional but recommended .
In / var / lib / tftpboot / pxelinux.cfg create separate files for * each * node .
The filename should be the IP address of the node represented in HEX format .
Example : 10 --> A ; 11 -->B ; 12 -->C ; 101 -->65 .
So for 10.11.12.101 it should be 0A0B0C65 .
#nano /var / lib/ tftpboot / pxelinux.cfg/0A0B0C65
LABEL linux
KERNEL vmlinuz-2.6.20-krg
APPEND console=tty 1 root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=10.11.12.1:/nfsroot/ kerrighed ip=10.11.12.101 rw session_id=1
==
Step 10 :
Future node system .
This directory will have the node ’s bootable files , etc .
#mkdir / nfsroot / && mkdir / nfsroot / kerrighed
==
Step 11 :
Tell NFS what to export
#nano /etc / exports
/nfsroot / kerrighed 10.11.12.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no_subtree_check ,async,no_root_squash )
==
Step 12 :
Tell NFS to export above file system
#exportfs - avr
==
Step 13 :
Create bootable system .
some developers reported that they needed the trailing " / " after " kerrighed "
as in : debootstrap -- arch i386 lenny / nfsroot / kerrighed / http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
#apt - get install debootstrap
debootstrap -- arch i386 lenny / nfsroot / kerrighed http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
You should get this output :
I : Retrieving Release
I : Retrieving Packages
I : Validating Packages
I : Resolving dependencies of required packages ...
I : Resolving dependencies of base packages ...
I : Checking component main on http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian...
I : Retrieving libacl1
I : Validating libacl1
[.. ]
I : Configuring tasksel - data ...
I : Configuring tasksel ...
I : Base system installed successfully .
==
Step 14 :
Isolate our node system to configure Kerrighed .
# chroot / nfsroot / kerrighed
==
Step 15 :
Set root password for isolated system
# passwd
Enter new UNIX password : ( nibirucluster )
Retype new UNIX password : ( nibirucluster )
passwd : password updated successfully
==
Step 16 :
Use the / proc directory of the node ’s image as the bootable system ’s / proc directory
mount -t proc none / proc
==
Step 17 :
You might get Perl related errors when installing packages on to the node .
To suppress those errors , type in the console :
nano .
profile
export LC_ALL=C
or
just copy and paste into console :
export LC_ALL=C
==
Step 18 :
Add basic packages needed by the node to communicate with the controller
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/
lenny main non -free contrib
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/
lenny main non -free contrib
deb http://security.debian.org/
lenny / updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/
lenny / updates main
apt - get update
apt - get install automake autoconf libtool pkg- config gawk rsync bzip2 libncurses5 libncurses5 - dev wget lsb - release xmlto patchutils xutils - dev build - essential subversion dhcp3 - common nfs-common nfsbooted openssh - server
You need these packages on the node to compile and execute your MPI code ( see under TESTING below ) .
apt - get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi1 libopenmpi-dev
libopenmpi - dev may not be required if you only want to execute your code on the node .
However , it is needed if you want to compile your program on the node itself .
==
Step 19 :
Preparing mount points
mkdir / config
==
Step 20 :
Set mount points
nano /etc / fstab
# UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM
proc / proc proc defaults 0 0
/ dev/nfs / nfs defaults 0 0
configfs / config configfs defaults 0 0
==
Step 21
Set hosts to lookup
nano /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
10.11.12.1 nibiru_headnode
10.11.12.101 node1
10.11.12.102 node2
==
Step 22 :
Create a symlink to automount the bootable filesystem .
ln - sf /etc/network/if-up.d/mountnfs
/etc/rcS.d/S34mountnfs
==
Step 23 :
Configure network interfaces
nano /etc/network / interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet manual
==
Step 24 :
The username you will be using to connect to the node .
adduser ( clusteruser )
Adding user `clusteruser ' ...
Adding new group `clusteruser ' ( 1000 ) ...
Adding new user `clusteruser ' ( 1000 ) with group `clusteruser ' ...
Creating home directory ` /home / clusteruser ' ...
Copying files from ` /etc / skel ' ...
Enter new UNIX password : ( nodepasswd )
Retype new UNIX password : ( nodepasswd )
passwd : password updated successfully
Changing the user information for clusteruser
Enter the new value , or press ENTER for the default
Full Name [ ] :
Room Number [ ] :
Work Phone [ ] :
Home Phone [ ] :
Other [ ] :
Is the information correct ? [ Y /n ] y
==
Step 25
Get latest svn version 5586 as of this writing .
svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/kerrighed/trunk
/usr/src/kerrighed -r 5586
[.. ]
A /usr / src/ kerrighed / NEWS
A /usr / src/kerrighed/linux_version.sh
U /usr / src/ kerrighed
Checked out revision 5586 .
==
Step 26 :
Kerrighed uses linux 2.6.0 .
Kerrighed ignores any other version .
wget - O /usr / src/linux -2.6.20.tar.bz2
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.20.tar.bz2 && tar jxf /usr / src/linux-2.6.20.tar.bz2 && cd /usr/src/kerrighed && ./autogen.sh && ./ configure && cd kernel && make defconfig
==
Step 27 :
Make sure these settings are in place .
By default , b ) , c ) , d ) are
enabled but it would n’t hurt if you double - check . a ) you have to pick
the network cards of your nodes and make sure they are loadable at boot
time (* not M )
a. Device Drivers ->
Network device support --> Ethernet ( 10 or 100 Mbit )
b. File systems ->
Network File Systems and enabling NFS file system support ,
NFS server support , and Root file system on NFS .
Make sure that the NFSv3 options
are also enabled , and again , make sure they are part of the kernel and not loadable
modules ( asterisks and not Ms ) .
c. To enable the scheduler framework , select “ Cluster support ” -->
“ Kerrighed
support for global scheduling ” -->
“ Run -time configurable scheduler framework ”
( CONFIG_KRG_SCHED_CONFIG ) .
You should also enable the “ Compile components needed
to emulate the old hard - coded scheduler ” option to mimic the legacy scheduler
( CONFIG_KRG_SCHED_COMPAT ) .
This last option will compile scheduler components
( kernel modules ) together with the main Kerrighed module , that can be used to
rebuild the legacy scheduler , as shown below .
d . To let the scheduler framework automatically load components ’ modules ,
select “ Loadable module support ” -->
“ Automatic kernel module loading ”
( CONFIG_KMOD ) .
Otherwise , components ’ modules must be manually loaded
on each node before components that they provide can be configured .
*/
make menuconfig
==
Step 28 :
Kernel compilation with Kerrighed support
cd .. && make kernel && make && make kernel - install && make install && ldconfig
==
Step 29 :
Configuring Kerrighed
nano /etc/kerrighed_nodes
session=1 # Value can be 1 -- 254
nbmin=2 # 2 nodes starting up with the Kerrighed kernel .
10.11.12.101:1:eth0
10.11.12.102:2:eth0
nano /etc / default / kerrighed
# Start kerrighed cluster
ENABLE=true
#ENABLE=false
# Enable / Disable legacy scheduler behaviour
LEGACY_SCHED=true
#LEGACY_SCHED=false
==
Step 30 :
Exit chrooted system
exit
==
Step 31 :
Out of your chrooted system copy bootable kernel .
cp -p /nfsroot/ kerrighed/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-krg /var/lib/tftpboot/
==
Step 32 :
Configure the controller to use eth0 card .
eth0 will be used by the DHCP server to feed the nodes .
ifconfig eth0 10.11.12.1
/etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa start
/etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start
/etc/init.d/ portmap start
/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start
==
Step 33 :
Make sure nodes are connected to the router .
From the controller do :
ssh [ email protected ]
Then from any connected node as " clusteruser " :
krgadm nodes
output :
101:online
102:online
Double - check as root from the node :
tail -f / var / log / messages
node1 kernel : Proc initialisation : done
node1 kernel : EPM initialisation : start
node1 kernel : EPM initialisation : done
node1 kernel : Init Kerrighed distributed services : done
node1 kernel : scheduler initialization succeeded !
node1 kernel : Kerrighed ... loaded !
These commands are helpful .
Do these as a regular node user " clusteruser " .
krgcapset -d +CAN_MIGRATE
krgcapset -k $ $ -d +CAN_MIGRATE
krgcapset -d +USE_REMOTE_MEMORY
krgcapset -k $ $ -- inheritable - effective +CAN_MIGRATE
To monitor your cluster :
top
( toggle 1 to see cpus )
Also :
cat / proc / cpuinfo | grep “ model name ”
cat / proc / meminfo | grep “ MemFree ”
cat / proc/ stat
==
Step 34 :
This is step is needed so you do not have to enter a password when triggering your MPI programs from the node .
If you do not generate a key , you will have to enter the node [ n ] password manually in order to migrate the processes .
You may not need to enter a password when generating the key .
The assumption is that the controller is secure enough from the outside ( no rerouting packets from eth1 -- the other network card . )
Alternatively , if you feel paranoid you may enter a password then tell ssh - agent to remember it .
The password will remembered for that session only .
After you log on to one of the nodes via ssh
ssh - keygen -t dsa ( do n't enter password )
cp /home/ clusteruser/.ssh/id_dsa.pub /home/clusteruser/.ssh/authorized_keys
or
ssh - keygen -t dsa ( do enter password )
cp /home/ clusteruser/.ssh/id_dsa.pub /home/clusteruser/.ssh/authorized_keys
eval `ssh- agent`
ssh -add /home / clusteruser /.ssh /id_dsa ( type in password associated with keys )
==
Step 35 TESTING :
A simple ‘ hello world ' programs that calls the MPI library .
I will create a config file where MPI can lookup information for running jobs on the cluster .
I am creating this config file on the home directory of the cluster user " clusteruser " -- which is the same account we created earlier .
It will be readable to the node so you can create the file as your own user from the controller .
You can also log on to the any of the nodes where you will be triggering your programs from and create the file there using the " clusteruser " account :
In this situation , I opted for Door A
at controller as a regular user -- your regular system username :
nano /nfsroot / kerrighed / home/clusteruser/mpi_file.conf
# Contents of mpi_file.conf .
I 'm listing the nodes of the cluster .
node1
node2
--------START
CODE---------
/*
hello world
This " hello world " program does not deviate much from any other hello world program you have seen before .
The only difference is that it has MPI calls .
*/
#include
#include
#include
int main ( int argc , char * argv[ ] )
{
char * boxname ;
int rank , processes ;
MPI_Init ( &argc , &argv ) ;
MPI_Comm_rank( MPI_COMM_WORLD , &rank ) ;
MPI_Comm_size( MPI_COMM_WORLD , &processes ) ;
boxname = ( char *) calloc ( 100 , sizeof ( char ) ) ;
gethostname ( boxname,100 ) ;
printf ( "
Process : %i
Message : hello cruel world !
Cluster Node : %s

MPI_Finalize ( ) ;
return ( 0 ) ;
}
--------END CODE---------
On the controller compile your program using the MPI library :
mpicc hello_world .c -o hello_world
Put the MPI program in the user 's home directory on one of the nodes .
In this example , I put it in / nfsroot / kerrighed / home / clusteruser :
cp hello_world /nfsroot / kerrighed / home / clusteruser /
open another shell and ssh any of the nodes .
Here I log on to node1 :
ssh [ email protected ]
mpirun - np 2 -- hostfile mpi_file.conf hello_world
output :

" PXE - E32 : TFTP open timeout " error .
It can be either that your network card is not supported or that you have something blocking the way for the TFTP server to distribute the image .
Try booting your node from CD :
cd /tmp
wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/utils/boot/gpxe/gpxe-1.0.0.tar.bz2
bunzip2 gpxe-1.0.0.tar.bz2
tar xvpf gpxe - 1.0.0.tar
cd /tmp/gpxe-1.0.0/src/bin/gpxe.iso
make bin/gpxe.iso
Then burn gpxe.iso to a CD and boot the client off of it .
If still no joy try below .
It might that something is blocking the way to the TFTP server .
On the controller :
in.tftpd -l
tail - 1 /var/log/syslog
recvfrom : Socket operation on non-socket
cannot bind to local socket : Address already in use
solution : you can use the package rcconf to disable dhcp , portmap , nfs server , and tftp - hpa at boot time .
Then start manually each server when needed .
If problem persists try disabling firewall settings
( make a backup of existing rules iptables - save > /root / firewall.rules )
iptables -X
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t nat -X
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -t mangle -X
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
[ to restore after you find out what the problem is use iptables - restore < /root / firewall.rules ]
You can also try this :
netstat - anp | grep 69
udp6 0 0 :::69 :::*
note : this output looks suspicious " udp6 " ?
Connect with any TFTP client from the controller and on a second shell do tail -f / var / log/ syslog
tftp 127.0.0.1
tftp > get pxelinux.0
Transfer timed out
tail -f / var / log/ syslog
in.tftpd [ 2881 ] : received address was not AF_INET , please check your inetd config

H.Res. 185 ( 110th ) was a simple resolution in the United States Congress .
A simple resolution is used for matters that affect just one chamber of Congress , often to change the rules of the chamber to set the manner of debate for a related bill .
It must be agreed to in the chamber in which it was introduced .
It is not voted on in the other chamber and does not have the force of law .
Resolutions numbers restart every two years .
That means there are other resolutions with the number H. Res.
185 . This is the one from the 110th Congress .
This simple resolution was introduced in the 110th Congress , which met from Jan 4 , 2007 to Jan 3 , 2009 .
Legislation not enacted by the end of a Congress is cleared from the books .

( CNN ) -- A South Korean navy ship sank in the Yellow Sea near North Korea late Friday , and the navy shot at an unidentified ship toward the north , according to reports quoting South Korean government officials .
Yon - hap News Agency quoted Navy officials saying Friday that a ship carrying 104 crew members sank off the Seoul - controlled island of Baengnyeong in a flashpoint maritime border area between the Koreas .
The 1,500 - ton Cheonan went down at 9:45 p.m. near the island , but the cause of the incident was not immediately known , the officials said .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak ordered a " quick and thorough " investigation Saturday into what caused the ship to sink , keeping in mind " all possibilities , " his office said , according to Yonhap .
A rescue operation was under way , with the Navy telling Yonhap it had rescued 58 crew members but it feared others may be dead .
The South Korean government issued a statement saying the reason for the incident remains unclear , but it was n't ruling out some sort of military engagement .
An explosion had occurred in the rear of the ship , leaving a large hole in the ship 's underwater hull , officials told Yonhap .
A U.S. State Department spokesman said Friday that there was no evidence North Korea was behind the incident .
" Let 's not jump to conclusions here , " said the spokesman , Philip J. Crowley , when asked about possible North Korean involvement .
" I 'm not aware of any evidence to that effect , but I think the authoritative source here would be the South Korean government . "
Yonhap quoted South Korean naval officials as saying a South Korean vessel fired at a ship toward the north later .
However , South Korean government officials said it is n't certain whether North Korea was involved in the incident .
Yonhap said local residents reported hearing gunfire for about 10 minutes .
As a result of the incident , South Korean government officials held an emergency meeting of ministers handling security - related matters , officials told Yonhap .
South Korea 's Korean Broadcasting System said Navy vessels and helicopters were rescuing crew members , some of whom reportedly jumped into the sea after the blast , the KBS report said .
The official said the Sockcho , another South Korean navy vessel patrolling nearby , fired at unidentified ships north of the area .
U.S. military officials told CNN a South Korean vessel sank .
North Korea has said recently it is bulking up its defenses in response to recent joint South Korean - U.S. military drills , Yonhap reported .
The news agency also quoted South Korean military officials saying North Korea conducted dozens of artillery firing drills Friday .
Of course , just because productivity is mismeasured does n’t mean that genuine innovations can’t improve living standards .
It does mean , however , that Americans are flying blind when it comes to their economy ’s strengths and weaknesses , and consequently drawing the wrong policy lessons .
Above all , if offshoring has been driving much of our supposed productivity gains , then the case for complete free trade begins to erode .
If often such policies simply increase corporate profits at the expense of American workers , with no gains in true productivity , then they do n’t necessarily strengthen the national economy .
In this regard , the case for free trade as a stimulus for innovation weakens , too .
Because productivity gains in part reflect job offshoring , not just the benefits of technology or better business practices , then the American economy has been much less innovative than widely assumed .
How can we actually increase innovation and real productivity ?
Manufacturing , long slighted by free - market extremists , needs to be promoted , not pushed offshore , since it has historically accounted for the bulk of research and development spending and employs the bulk of American science and technology workers  who in turn spur further innovation and real productivity .
Promoting manufacturing will require major changes in tax and trade policies that currently foster offshoring , including implementing provisions to punish currency manipulation by countries like China and help American producers harmed by discriminatory foreign value - added tax systems .
It also means revitalizing government and corporate research and development , which has languished since its heyday in the 1960s .
Much of government policy and business strategy rides on false assumptions about innovation , and although the Obama administration acknowledges the problem , it has done nothing to correct it .
With the economy still in need of government life support and the future of American manufacturing in doubt , relying on faulty productivity data is a formula for disaster .

The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland Cardinal Sean Brady , has welcomed the Pope 's pastoral letter on sexual abuse .
In the letter , Pope Benedict XVI apologised to victims of child sex abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland .
Addressing the victims of abuse , the Pope wrote : " You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry . "
The day before Sunday ’s health care vote , President Obama gave an unscripted talk to House Democrats .
Near the end , he spoke about why his party should pass reform : “ Every once in a while a moment comes where you have a chance to vindicate all those best hopes that you had about yourself , about this country , where you have a chance to make good on those promises that you made ...
And this is the time to make true on that promise .
We are not bound to win , but we are bound to be true .
We are not bound to succeed , but we are bound to let whatever light we have shine . ”
And on the other side , here ’s what Newt Gingrich , the Republican former speaker of the House — a man celebrated by many in his party as an intellectual leader — had to say :
If Democrats pass health reform , “ They will have destroyed their party much as Lyndon Johnson shattered the Democratic Party for 40 years ” by passing civil rights legislation .
I ’d argue that Mr. Gingrich is wrong about that : proposals to guarantee health insurance are often controversial before they go into effect — Ronald Reagan famously argued that Medicare would mean the end of American freedom — but always popular once enacted .
But that ’s not the point I want to make today .
Instead , I want you to consider the contrast : on one side , the closing argument was an appeal to our better angels , urging politicians to do what is right , even if it hurts their careers ; on the other side , callous cynicism .
Think about what it means to condemn health reform by comparing it to the Civil Rights Act .
Who in modern America would say that L.B.J. did the wrong thing by pushing for racial equality ?
( Actually , we know who : the people at the Tea Party protest who hurled racial epithets at Democratic members of Congress on the eve of the vote . )
Har du kanske gjort en tatuering som du ångrar eller som inte alls blev som du tänkt dig ?
Då finns det faktiskt hjälp att få och du måste inte leva med din tatuering livet ut .
För ungefär 20 år sedan fanns inte möjligheten att ångra en tatuering men det finns det idag .
Det kan hända att du tar ett dåligt beslut i ett känslomässigt tillstånd och väljer att tatuera in något som du senare ångrar djupt .
Kanske är det ett namn på en partner som inte längre finns i ditt liv eller helt enkelt bara ett misslyckat konstverk hos en mindre begåvad tatuerare .
Laserteknik
Den teknik som används när du tar bort en tatuering eller hudförändring av något slag är en laserteknik .
Behandlingen är inget som går på en minut utan det krävs oftast flera behandlingar efter varandra för att helt bli av med den .
Oftast blir det dock lite vita skuggor kvar av den ursprungliga tatueringen .
Det finns tyvärr även en del tatueringsfärger idag som är väldigt svåra att få bort även med laser .
Så du ska alltid fundera extra noga över ditt beslut om du är på gång med att tatuera dig .
Tänk på att denna ska sitta på din kropp hela livet och att laserborttagning inte alltid fungerar helt .
Olika tekniker
De tatueringar som är allra lättast att ta bort är oftast de traditionella blåsvarta sådana .
Behandlingen går oftast till så att det först sker en provbehandling för att se hur din hud reagerar på detta för att undvika ovälkomna reaktioner .
Sedan utför man laserbehandlingen i olika steg med sex veckors mellanrum .
Nu för tiden finns det även en speciell behandling för kosmetiska tatueringar som inte görs med laser .
Behandlingen går till så att tatueringen öppnas med en nål och applicerar en speciell kräm på tatueringen .
Efter detta får du sedan en svart skorpa på området och efter det en lätt rodnad , men tatueringen är borta .
Here 's more evidence that " safe " plastics are not as safe as once presumed :
New research published online in The FASEB Journal suggests that exposure to Bisphenol A ( BPA ) during pregnancy leads to epigenetic changes that may cause permanent reproduction problems for female offspring .
BPA , a common component of plastics used to contain food , is a type of estrogen that is ubiquitous in the environment .
" Exposure to BPA may be harmful during pregnancy ; this exposure may permanently affect the fetus , " said Hugh S. Taylor , Ph.D. , co-author of the study from Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven , Connecticut .
" We need to better identify the effects of environmental contaminants on not just crude measures such as birth defects , but also their effect in causing more subtle developmental errors . "
Taylor and colleagues made this discovery by exposing fetal mice to BPA during pregnancy and examining gene expression and DNA in the uteruses of female fetuses .
Results showed that BPA exposure permanently affected the uterus by decreasing regulation of gene expression .
These epigenetic changes caused the mice to over - respond to estrogen throughout adulthood , long after the BPA exposure .
This suggests that early exposure to BPA genetically " programmed " the uterus to be hyper - responsive to estrogen .
Extreme estrogen sensitivity can lead to fertility problems , advanced puberty , altered mammary development and reproductive function , as well as a variety of hormone - related cancers .
BPA has been widely used in plastics and other materials .
Examples include use in water bottles , baby bottles , epoxy resins used to coat food cans , and dental sealants .
" The BPA baby bottle scare may be only the tip of the iceberg . " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" Remember how diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) caused birth defects and cancers in young women whose mothers were given such hormones during pregnancy .
We 'd better watch out for BPA , which seems to carry similar epigenetic risks across the generations . "

Jack Harper 's rambling comments about why gays should n't be allowed to serve in the military .
Now Arizona Republic columnist E.J. Montini writes about legislation under consideration by the Arizona Legislature that would put married couples ahead of single people when it comes to adoption :
Recently , a single heterosexual woman ( she pointed this out in her e-mail ) sent a note to a group of legislators expressing her opposition to HB2148 .
She believes it is a bad idea to make it more difficult for people like her to adopt , adding that while single individuals often step forward to serve as foster parents , this bill would tell them “ they are not good enough to keep ( the children ) permanently . ”
In response she got an e-mail from Sen .
Harper that read : “ I am sorry that the legislation is clumsy , but it accomplishes the goal that we are trying to achieve .
It 's hard to single out gay and lesbian couple [ sic ] with proper wording in statute . ”

Kiwis travelling to the US will be asked to pay a $ US10 ( $ 14 ) fee to help fund a program to boost tourism - as well as the ailing US economy .
The fee will apply to the US " visa waiver " program that is mostly used by tourists and short - stay business travellers from 34 countries , including Australia and New Zealand .
Details of the fee appeared in the Travel Promotion Act , which Barack Obama signed into law late last week .
The new impost is expected to raise about half the funds for a $ US200 million ( $ 285 m , NZ ) global " Come to America " campaign .
This is the first time the US has resorted to a government - sponsored international sales pitch similar to those used by other countries to win a bigger share of global tourism .
The campaign is expected to increase visitor numbers by an estimated 1.6 million travellers , while restoring a more relaxed and welcoming image of America in a security - conscious era .
However , travellers requiring a visa waiver will still be expected to apply before their travel dates to avoid being stopped from entering the US .
A senior vice - president of the US Travel Association , Geoff Freeman , has welcomed the campaign .
" The perception of ' fortress America ' has taken hold , partly because we have n't gone out and told people we want their business , " he said .
" And so we 've had fewer overseas travellers every year since 9/11 . "
There were 2.4 million fewer international tourists visiting the US last year than in 2000 .
Its inability to keep pace with expanding global long - haul tourism is estimated to have cost it $ US500 billion in lost revenues over the past decade .
Studies have suggested the campaign could bring in an extra $ US4 billion in tourism spending a year , creating more than 40,000 jobs and trimming the federal deficit of the US by $ US425 million over 10 years .
The campaign will be administered by a private sector committee which will be overseen by the Department of Commerce in accord with the departments of State and Homeland Security .
The US consulate was still uncertain about a timeframe for the scheme 's implementation , saying a bank had not been found to handle processing of the fee .
'' It has n't been decided yet , '' the country consular co-ordinator , Thurmond Borden , said .
'' I would say it would take three or four months before it takes effect . ''
Almost 650,000 Australians used the program in the 2009 fiscal year - the 10th most frequent users of the scheme in the world .

Chanelle Sasha Jones was found with 22 injuries in Gary Fisher 's car
Mother 's sentence call for killer A 48 - year - old man has been found guilty of murdering his teenage daughter .
Gary Fisher , from Solihull , West Midlands , had denied the murder of Chanelle Sasha Jones , 17 , in a car park in Ceredigion on 2 August last year .
Chanelle Sasha suffered 22 injuries , including one or possibly two stab wounds to her heart .
Fisher , who will be sentenced at Swansea Crown Court at a later date , had chosen not to give evidence in his defence .
The judge , Mr Justice Lloyd Jones , had previously warned him the jury may " draw inferences " from his decision not to give evidence .
The jury took just one hour on Wednesday to convict him of murder .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Speaking to the defendant , the judge said : " By law there is only one sentence for murder and in due course you will be sentenced to imprisonment for life . "
He said that , at a future sentencing hearing , he would set the minimum jail term Fisher will have to serve before being eligible for parole .
The court had been told Fisher , who had admitted manslaughter but claimed it was not murder , stabbed his daughter to death as she sat in the passenger seat of his Ford Fiesta in a Cardigan pub car park .
Fisher had driven around with his daughter 's body for several hours
After stabbing his daughter , Fisher covered her body with a sleeping bag and reclined her seat .
He then drove around for several hours with her body in the car before police used a stinger device to halt the vehicle .
Prosecutor Chris Clee QC previously said that when arrested , Fisher told police he killed his daughter because she had wanted to die after suffering a sex attack , and he planned to " end her suffering " in a suicide pact .
Mr Clee said Fisher told hospital staff he had killed her with a hunting knife .
" He said his daughter told him she wanted to die .
He said he planned it for the last two and a half months , " he said .
" He said , ' I felt she was suffering and I wanted to help her to die ' . "
The court heard Fisher later claimed to police that his daughter had been raped - and she " could n't live with the thought of that " , but police said no complaint had been made to them .
Mr Clee said : " This was n't in any way , shape or form a suicide pact .
It is simply an attempt by him to avoid his responsibility for what he did . "
Lock knife
He said Fisher had rung his sister to confess to killing Sasha , and told one of her cousins what had happened .
The jury was told Fisher had argued with his daughter earlier in the summer because she wanted to be with her boyfriend instead of her father .
He had also given his 15 - year - old son a hunting knife and a lock knife to look after on a visit to see his three children .
Fisher and Chanelle Sasha 's mother , Jayne Jones , met in the West Midlands in 1991 , and had three children together before splitting up .
The family moved to Cardigan but Fisher returned to Birmingham after the relationship broke down .
He made contact with the children five years ago after befriending their grandmother , the jury was told .

NASA Mars Rover Getting Smarter as it Gets Older
PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity , now in its seventh year on Mars , has a new capability to make its own choices about whether to make additional observations of rocks that it spots on arrival at a new location .
Software uploaded this winter is the latest example of NASA taking advantage of the twin Mars rovers ' unanticipated longevity for real Martian test drives of advances made in robotic autonomy for future missions .
Now , Opportunity 's computer can examine images that the rover takes with its wide - angle navigation camera after a drive , and recognize rocks that meet specified criteria , such as rounded shape or light color .
It can then center its narrower - angle panoramic camera on the chosen target and take multiple images through color filters .
" It 's a way to get some bonus science , " said Tara Estlin of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
She is a rover driver , a senior member of JPL's Artificial Intelligence Group and leader of development for this new software system .
The new system is called Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science , or AEGIS .
Without it , follow - up observations depend on first transmitting the post - drive navigation camera images to Earth for ground operators to check for targets of interest to examine on a later day .
Because of time and data - volume constraints , the rover team may opt to drive the rover again before potential targets are identified or before examining targets that are n't highest priority .
The first images taken by a Mars rover choosing its own target show a rock about the size of a football , tan in color and layered in texture .
It appears to be one of the rocks tossed outward onto the surface when an impact dug a nearby crater .
Opportunity pointed its panoramic camera at this unnamed rock after analyzing a wider - angle photo taken by the rover 's navigation camera at the end of a drive on March 4 .
Opportunity decided that this particular rock , out of more than 50 in the navigation camera photo , best met the criteria that researchers had set for a target of interest : large and dark .
" It found exactly the target we would want it to find , " Estlin said .
" This checkout went just as we had planned , thanks to many people 's work , but it 's still amazing to see Opportunity performing a new autonomous activity after more than six years on Mars . "
Opportunity can use the new software at stopping points along a single day 's drive or at the end of the day 's drive .
This enables it to identify and examine targets of interest that might otherwise be missed .
" We spent years developing this capability on research rovers in the Mars Yard here at JPL , " said Estlin .
" Six years ago , we never expected that we would get a chance to use it on Opportunity . "
The developers anticipate that the software will be useful for narrower field - of - view instruments on future rovers .
Other upgrades to software on Opportunity and its twin , Spirit , since the rovers ' first year on Mars have improved other capabilities .
These include choosing a route around obstacles and calculating how far to reach out a rover 's arm to touch a rock .
In 2007 , both rovers gained the know - how to examine sets of sky images to determine which ones show clouds or dust devils , and then to transmit only the selected images .
The newest software upload takes that a step further , enabling Opportunity to make decisions about acquiring new observations .
The AEGIS software lets scientists change the criteria it used for choosing potential targets .
In some environments , rocks that are dark and angular could be higher - priority targets than rocks that are light and rounded , for example .
This new software system has been developed with assistance from NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Project and with funding from the New Millennium Program , the Mars Technology Program , the JPL Interplanetary Network Development Program , and the Intelligent Systems Program .
The New Millennium Program tests advanced technology in space flight .
JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Mars Exploration Rover Project for the NASA Science Mission Directorate , Washington .

Scientists are now discovering that self - control is a precious , finite resource that can be raised and lowered by a number of factors and activities .
Listed below are three prominent studies on the topic , followed by four things you can do to ensure you never find yourself with a depleted supply .
The Sugar Study
Summary :
If your brain runs low on sugar , you start to lose your ability to make good decisions that require self control , e.g. avoiding sweets , folding a bad hand in poker , etc .
Study Excerpt :
New research from a lab at Florida State University reveals that self - control takes fuel – literally .
When we exercise it , resisting temptations to misbehave , our fuel tank is depleted , making subsequent efforts at self - control more difficult .
Link to Original Study : http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/releases/2007/baumeister.cfm
The Wear and Tear Study
Summary :
The more you perform tasks that require self control , the less self - control you ’ll have .
Example from a study : people told to remember a long number for an extended period of time ( hours ) were less likely to resist the temptation to eat bad foods .
Again , this has implications for people like stock traders and poker players who can lose considerably based on a single poor choice .
Study Excerpt :
Self - control , whether used to pass up the office cookie plate or to struggle against temptations like alcohol and tobacco , operates like a renewable energy source rather than a learned skill or an analytical thought process , according to new research .
Individuals had less physical stamina and impulse control and increased difficulty with problem - solving activities after completing a variety of tasks that required some measure of self - control , according to Roy F. Baumeister , Ph.D. , of Florida State University .
Link to Original Study : http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-02/cfta-sci021903.php
The Abstract Thinking Study
Summary : Thinking abstractly about long - term goals can enhance your self control , while thinking more in the moment , or “ concretely ” can lower it .
So if you are struggling with an apple vs. candy bar , it may help to imagine what you want to look like in a year – i.e. fit , good - looking , healthy , etc .
Or imagine running a marathon in six months , and feeling the joy of crossing the finish line .
Study Excerpt :
The results showed that , when participants were thinking concretely , they tended to unconsciously see candy bars in a positive light and apples in a negative light .
But this was reversed when participants were thinking abstractly .
Just as predicted , abstract thinking automatically made people unconsciously think of candy bars as the devil ’s own food .

How to Raise Your Self - Control
Basically , we are starting to understand that rather than being some sort of mystical attribute of the disciplined , self - control is a physical and depletable resource .
In addition , we ’re finding that there are certain things you can avoid doing in order to ensure you have the most available at a given time .
Based on the study findings above ( they are n’t the only ones with similar findings ) , I ’ve come up with four things you can do to improve your own self - control whenever you need it .
Avoid the sugar / insulin roller - coaster .
It causes your sugar to crash , which can reduce your ability to avoid bad decisions .
If you are doing something decision - intensive that requires self control , keep whole foods around , such as fruits , vegetables , and nuts .
Keep a stead stream of high - quality sugar coming in , and avoid artificial foods that will spike your sugar .
Avoid using self control in the time leading up to you needing some .
Anything that requires you to resist temptation depletes your ability to resist temptation in the future ( short term ) .
So if you ’ve been struggling with your diet all day , and not eating junk food , do n’t go sit down and trade stocks .
If you do , you ’re likely to make some poor decisions .
Indulge in something beforehand .
One way to replenish your supply of self - control is to indulge in a tempting activity before doing something important .
The key is to find a way to do this in a non-destructive way–perhaps with video gaming or another virtual activity that simulates indulgence .
Then you can approach your important activity with a refreshed level of discipline .
When facing temptation , think about your long - term goals .
Do n’t let yourself fixate on the now , because the now equates to that donut tasting good .
Instead , focus on how good you ’ll feel when you run your first marathon in 3 months , or when your sport coat fits you like it should .
Think of what you want to be , and how this decision contributes to or takes away from that .

Is There a God ?
Does God exist ?
Here are six straightforward reasons to believe that God is really there .
By Marilyn Adamson
Just once would n't you love for someone to simply show you the evidence for God 's existence ?
No arm - twisting .
No statements of , " You just have to believe . "
Well , here is an attempt to candidly offer some of the reasons which suggest that God exists .
But first consider this .
When it comes to the possibility of God 's existence , the Bible says that there are people who have seen sufficient evidence , but they have suppressed the truth about God.1
On the other hand , for those who want to know God if he is there , he says , " You will seek me and find me ; when you seek me with all your heart , I will be found by you . " 2
Before you look at the facts surrounding his existence , ask yourself , If God does exist , would I want to know him ?
Here then , are some reasons to consider ...
1 . The complexity of our planet points to a deliberate Designer who not only created our universe , but sustains it today .
Many examples showing God 's design could be given , possibly with no end .
But here are a few :
The Earth ...its size is perfect .
The Earth 's size and corresponding gravity holds a thin layer of mostly nitrogen and oxygen gases , only extending about 50 miles above the Earth 's surface .
If Earth were smaller , an atmosphere would be impossible , like the planet Mercury .
If Earth were larger , its atmosphere would contain free hydrogen , like Jupiter .
3
Earth is the only known planet equipped with an atmosphere of the right mixture of gases to sustain plant , animal and human life .
“ If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door , Earth would be about the size of a nickel . ”
4
The Earth is located the right distance from the sun .
Consider the temperature swings we encounter , roughly - 30 degrees to +120 degrees .
If the Earth were any further away from the sun , we would all freeze .
Any closer and we would burn up .
Even a fractional variance in the Earth 's position to the sun would make life on Earth impossible .
The Earth remains this perfect distance from the sun while it rotates around the sun at a speed of nearly 67,000 mph .
It is also rotating on its axis , allowing the entire surface of the Earth to be properly warmed and cooled every day .
And our moon is the perfect size and distance from the Earth for its gravitational pull .
The moon creates important ocean tides and movement so ocean waters do not stagnate , and yet our massive oceans are restrained from spilling over across the continents .
5
Water ... colorless , odorless and without taste , and yet no living thing can survive without it .
Plants , animals and human beings consist mostly of water ( about two - thirds of the human body is water ) .
You 'll see why the characteristics of water are uniquely suited to life :
It has wide margin between its boiling point and freezing point .
Water allows us to live in an environment of fluctuating temperature changes , while keeping our bodies a steady 98.6 degrees .
Water is a universal solvent .
This property of water means that various chemicals , minerals and nutrients can be carried throughout our bodies and into the smallest blood vessels .
6
Water is also chemically neutral .
Without affecting the makeup of the substances it carries , water enables food , medicines and minerals to be absorbed and used by the body .
Water has a unique surface tension .
Water in plants can therefore flow upward against gravity , bringing life - giving water and nutrients to the top of even the tallest trees .
Water freezes from the top down and floats , so fish can live in the winter .
Ninety - seven percent of the Earth 's water is in the oceans .
But on our Earth , there is a system designed which removes salt from the water and then distributes that water throughout the globe .
Evaporation takes the ocean waters , leaving the salt , and forms clouds which are easily moved by the wind to disperse water over the land , for vegetation , animals and people .
It is a system of purification and supply that sustains life on this planet , a system of recycled and reused water .
7
The human brain ... simultaneously processes an amazing amount of information .
Your brain takes in all the colors and objects you see , the temperature around you , the pressure of your feet against the floor , the sounds around you , the dryness of your mouth , even the texture of your keyboard .
Your brain holds and processes all your emotions , thoughts and memories .
At the same time your brain keeps track of the ongoing functions of your body like your breathing pattern , eyelid movement , hunger and movement of the muscles in your hands .
The human brain processes more than a million messages a second .
8
Your brain weighs the importance of all this data , filtering out the relatively unimportant .
This screening function is what allows you to focus and operate effectively in your world .
The brain functions differently than other organs .
There is an intelligence to it , the ability to reason , to produce feelings , to dream and plan , to take action , and relate to other people .
The eye ... can distinguish among seven million colors .
It has automatic focusing and handles an astounding 1.5 million messages -- simultaneously .
9
Evolution focuses on mutations and changes from and within existing organisms .
Yet evolution alone does not fully explain the initial source of the eye or the brain -- the start of living organisms from nonliving matter .
2. Is God real ?
The universe had a start - what caused it ?
Scientists are convinced that our universe began with one enormous explosion of energy and light , which we now call the Big Bang .
This was the singular start to everything that exists : the beginning of the universe , the start of space , and even the initial start of time itself .
Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow , a self - described agnostic , stated , " The seed of everything that has happened in the Universe was planted in that first instant ; every star , every planet and every living creature in the Universe came into being as a result of events that were set in motion in the moment of the cosmic explosion ... The Universe flashed into being , and we cannot find out what caused that to happen .
"
10
Steven Weinberg , a Nobel laureate in Physics , said at the moment of this explosion , " the universe was about a hundred thousands million degrees Centigrade ... and the universe was filled with light .
"
11
The universe has not always existed .
It had a start ... what caused that ?
Scientists have no explanation for the sudden explosion of light and matter .
3. Evidence for God :
The universe operates by uniform laws of nature .
Why does it ?
Much of life may seem uncertain , but look at what we can count on day after day : gravity remains consistent , a hot cup of coffee left on a counter will get cold , the earth rotates in the same 24 hours , and the speed of light does n't change -- on earth or in galaxies far from us .
All of the sciences -- molecular biology , chemistry , physics , astronomy , etc. -- hinge on the consistent laws of nature .
Dr. Emily Baldwin commented , " One of the most important numbers in physics , the proton - electron mass ratio , is the same in a galaxy six billion light years away as it is here on Earth … " 12
How is it that we can identify laws of nature that never change ?
Why is the universe so orderly , so reliable ?
" The greatest scientists have been struck by how strange this is .
There is no logical necessity for a universe that obeys rules , let alone one that abides by the rules of mathematics .
This astonishment springs from the recognition that the universe does n't have to behave this way .
It is easy to imagine a universe in which conditions change unpredictably from instant to instant , or even a universe in which things pop in and out of existence .
"
13
Physicist Paul C. Davies , comments , " … to be a scientist , you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable , immutable , absolute , universal , mathematical laws …
” 14
All of our ability to discover , solve problems , create is made possible by the orderly laws of the universe that never change and can be measured with precision .
Richard Feynman , a Nobel Prize winner for quantum electrodynamics , said , " Why nature is mathematical is a mystery ... The fact that there are rules at all is a kind of miracle .
"

4. A Divine Programmer : The DNA code informs , programs a cell 's behavior .
All instruction , all teaching , all training comes with intent .
Someone who writes an instruction manual does so with purpose .
Did you know that in every cell of our bodies there exists a very detailed instruction code , much like a miniature computer program ?
As you may know , a computer program is made up of ones and zeros , like this : 110010101011000 .
The way they are arranged tell the computer program what to do .
The DNA code in each of our cells is very similar .
It 's made up of four chemicals that scientists abbreviate as A , T , G , and C .
These are arranged in the human cell like this : CGTGTGACTCGCTCCTGAT and so on .
There are three billion of these letters in every human cell !!
Well , just like you can program your phone to beep for specific reasons , DNA instructs the cell .
DNA is a three - billion - lettered program telling the cell to act in a certain way .
It is a full instruction manual .16
Why is this so amazing ?
One has to ask .... how did this information program wind up in each human cell ?
These are not just chemicals .
These are chemicals that instruct , that code in a very detailed way exactly how the person 's body should develop .
Natural , biological causes are completely lacking as an explanation when programmed information is involved .
You cannot find instruction , precise information like this , without someone intentionally constructing it .
5 . We know God exists because he pursues us .
He is constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him .
I was an atheist at one time .
And like many atheists , the issue of people believing in God bothered me greatly .
What is it about atheists that we would spend so much time , attention , and energy refuting something that we do n't believe even exists ?!
What causes us to do that ?
When I was an atheist , I attributed my intentions as caring for those poor , delusional people ... to help them realize their hope was completely ill - founded .
To be honest , I also had another motive .
As I challenged those who believed in God , I was deeply curious to see if they could convince me otherwise .
Part of my quest was to become free from the question of God .
If I could conclusively prove to believers that they were wrong , then the issue is off the table , and I would be free to go about my life .
I did n't realize that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on my mind , was because God was pressing the issue .
I have come to find out that God wants to be known .
He created us with the intention that we would know him .
He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he keeps the question of his existence squarely before us .
It was as if I could n't escape thinking about the possibility of God .
In fact , the day I chose to acknowledge God 's existence , my prayer began with , " Ok , you win . .. "
It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by people believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them .
I am not the only one who has experienced this .
Malcolm Muggeridge , socialist and philosophical author , wrote , " I had a notion that somehow , besides questing , I was being pursued . "
C.S. Lewis said he remembered , " ... night after night , feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work , the steady , unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet .
I gave in , and admitted that God was God , and knelt and prayed : perhaps , that night , the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of England . "
Lewis went on to write a book titled , " Surprised by Joy " as a result of knowing God .
I too had no expectations other than rightfully admitting God 's existence .
Yet over the following several months , I became amazed by his love for me .
6 . Unlike any other revelation of God , Jesus Christ is the clearest , most specific proof of God revealing himself to us .
Why Jesus ?
Look throughout the major world religions and you 'll find that Buddha , Muhammad , Confucius and Moses all identified themselves as teachers or prophets .
None of them ever claimed to be equal to God .
Surprisingly , Jesus did .
That is what sets Jesus apart from all the others .
He said God exists and you 're looking at him .
Though he talked about his Father in heaven , it was not from the position of separation , but of very close union , unique to all humankind .
Jesus said that anyone who had seen Him had seen the Father , anyone who believed in him , believed in the Father .
He said , " I am the light of the world , he who follows me will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life .
" 17 He claimed attributes belonging only to God : to be able to forgive people of their sin , free them from habits of sin , give people a more abundant life and give them eternal life in heaven .
Unlike other teachers who focused people on their words , Jesus pointed people to himself .
He did not say , " follow my words and you will find truth . "
He said , " I am the way , the truth , and the life , no one comes to the Father but through me .
"
18
What proof did Jesus give for claiming to be divine ?
He did what people can't do .
Jesus performed miracles .
He healed people ... blind , crippled , deaf , even raised a couple of people from the dead .
He had power over objects ... created food out of thin air , enough to feed crowds of several thousand people .
He performed miracles over nature ... walked on top of a lake , commanding a raging storm to stop for some friends .
People everywhere followed Jesus , because he constantly met their needs , doing the miraculous .
He said if you do not want to believe what I 'm telling you , you should at least believe in me based on the miracles you 're seeing .
Jesus Christ showed
God to be gentle , loving , aware of our self - centeredness and shortcomings , yet deeply wanting a relationship with us .
Jesus revealed that although he views us as sinners , worthy of his punishment , his love for us ruled and he came up with a different plan .
God himself took on the form of man and accepted the punishment for our sin on our behalf .
Sounds ludicrous ?
Perhaps , but many loving fathers would gladly trade places with their child in a cancer ward if they could .
The Bible says that the reason we would love God is because he first loved us .
Jesus died in our place so we could be forgiven .
Of all the religions known to humanity , only through Jesus will you see God reaching toward humanity , providing a way for us to have a relationship with him .
Jesus proves a divine heart of love , meeting our needs , drawing us to himself .
Because of Jesus ' death and resurrection , he offers us a new life today .
We can be forgiven , fully accepted by God and genuinely loved by God .
He says , " I have loved you with an everlasting love , therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you .
" 20 This is God , in action .
Does God exist ?
If you want to know , investigate Jesus Christ .
We 're told that " God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life .
"
21
God does not force us to believe in him , though he could .
Instead , he has provided sufficient proof of his existence for us to willingly respond to him .
The earth 's perfect distance from the sun , the unique chemical properties of water , the human brain , DNA , the number of people who attest to knowing God , the gnawing in our hearts and minds to determine if God is there , the willingness for God to be known through Jesus Christ .
If you need to know more about Jesus and reasons to believe in him , please see : Beyond Blind Faith .
Personal Evidence for God :
If you want to begin a relationship with God now , you can .
This is your decision , no coercion here .
But if you want to be forgiven by God and come into a relationship with him , you can do so right now by asking him to forgive you and come into your life .
Jesus said , " Behold , I stand at the door [ of your heart ] and knock .
He who hears my voice and opens the door , I will come into him [ or her ] .
" 22 If you want to do this , but are n't sure how to put it into words , this may help : " Jesus , thank you for dying for my sins .
You know my life and that I need to be forgiven .
I ask you to forgive me right now and come into my life .
I want to know you in a real way .
Come into my life now .
Thank you that you wanted a relationship with me .
Amen . "
God views your relationship with him as permanent .
Referring to all those who believe in him , Jesus Christ said of us , " I know them , and they follow me ; and I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish , and no one shall snatch them out of my hand .
"
23
Looking at all these facts , one can conclude that a loving God does exist and can be known in an intimate , personal way .

Michael L. Levy , the United States attorney for Eastern Pennsylvania , said in a statement the case illustrated how terrorists were looking for American recruits who could blend in .
“ It shatters any lingering thought that we can spot a terrorist based on appearance , ” he said .
Ms. LaRose is white , with blond hair and green eyes , according to the law enforcement official , who was not authorized to share details of the case and spoke only on the condition of anonymity .
The official said Ms. LaRose was born in Michigan and later lived in Texas and Montgomery County , Pa .
The indictment said that in mid-2008 , Ms. LaRose , using the aliases JihadJane and Fatima LaRose , began posting on YouTube and other Internet sites messages about her desire to help Muslims .
A MySpace profile for a woman who refers to herself as JihadJane displays pictures of bloodshed and violence in the Middle East scrawled with messages like “ Palestine We Are With You ” and “ Sympathize With Gaza . ”
By early 2009 , the court papers said , she was exchanging e-mail messages with unidentified co-conspirators in Southeast Asia and Europe and expressed a desire to become a martyr for an Islamist cause .
The indictment refers to e-mail messages in which a conspirator , citing how Ms. LaRose ’s appearance and American passport would make it easier for her to operate undetected , allegedly directed her in March 2009 to go to Sweden to help carry out a murder .
She agreed to do so , writing , “ I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying , ” the indictment says .
She and another unnamed American later posted online solicitations for money for that project , the document said .
Ms. LaRose had attracted the government ’s attention by then .
She was questioned by F.B.I. agents on July 17 , 2009 , and falsely told them that she had never solicited money online for terrorism , had never used the alias JihadJane and had never made postings on a terrorist Web site , the court papers say .
Despite drawing the F.B.I. ’s attention , the indictment says Ms. LaRose traveled to Europe in August , joined an online community hosted by the intended Swedish victim in September and performed online searches to track him .
She apparently never attempted to carry out the killing .
The indictment also says Ms. LaRose recruited other people on the Internet to wage or support jihadist attacks .
Mr. Hagan , who turned 69 in jail on Tuesday , was a militant member of the Nation of Islam on Feb. 21 , 1965 , when Malcolm X was shot while giving a speech at the Audubon , in Washington Heights .
Mr. Hagan , then known as Talmadge X . Hayer , was captured by the crowd and shot at and beaten before being rescued by the police .

Two other men , Muhammad Abdul Aziz ( then known as Norman 3X Butler ) and Kahlil Islam ( then Thomas 15X Johnson ) , were also charged with the murder .
They maintained their innocence .
Mr. Hagan did not , testifying at his trial in 1966 that he was responsible for the murder and that his co-defendants were innocent .
All three men were sentenced to 20 years to life .
Mr. Hagan said in a 1977 affidavit that he and several accomplices ( not Mr. Aziz or Mr. Islam ) decided to kill Malcolm X because he was a “ hypocrite ” who had “ gone against the leader of the Nation of Islam , ” Elijah Muhammad .
Mr. Hagan said that after one man shot Malcolm X in the chest with a shotgun , he and another man fired several more rounds at him .
Mr. Aziz was paroled in 1985 , and in 1998 was named by Louis Farrakhan to be chief of security for the Harlem mosque that Malcolm X once headed .
Mr. Islam was paroled in 1987 .
Mr. Hagan , who earned a master ’s degree while in prison , according to a 2008 profile in The New York Post , was placed on work release in 1988 .
In 2008 , he was spending his free days with his wife and children in Sunset Park , Brooklyn , and working in a fast food restaurant .

A few weeks ago , my daughters ( aged 9 and 11 ) convinced me to go dumpster diving out in the alley behind our house in the City of St. Louis .
We ’ve gone dumpster diving a few times over the years .
Based on the prior expeditions , my daughters fully expect that if they look through a few dozen dumpsters , they ’ll find something valuable .
You see , this is America , where people through away perfectly usable toys and games , as well as furniture , appliances and clothing .
And even when you do n’t find usable merchandise , you ’ll see literally tons of single - use paper and plastic being thrown out .
When you see the incredible piles of discarded usable things with your own eyes , it is all - the - more astounding .
Even more surprising , if you ’re looking the highest ratio of usable stuff , look in the dumpsters behind apartment - dwellers rather than the dumpsters behind expensive single - family homes .
Perhaps it sounds disgusting to go dumpster diving .
If so , get over it , because it can be far more than an anthropological field trip–it can be like winning a mini-lottery .
My kids and I have found several extremely nice coats , for instance ( we washed them and gave them away to friends ) .
We once found a working DVD player .
We ’ve taken home shelves and other items of furniture .
We ’ve found dozens of toys , which merely need to be cleaned up to become usable .
As I ’m finding these sorts of things , I keep thinking “ Why would n’t someone take the time to donate this to Good Will of Salvation Army ? ”
When people throw a valuable thing into the landfill , it ’s gone forever –what were they thinking ?
Here ’s what we found on our recent expedition .
First of all , I must digress .
The City of St. Louis provides special separate dumpsters for Yard Waste Only and other dumpsters for general rubbish .
On our recent expedition , I looked into 20 of of those yard - waste - only dumpsters .
About half of them contained non-yard waste .
This astounds me too .
Why would someone screw up this incredibly sensible system for recycling vegetation by throwing plastic , food and paper into a yard waste dumpster ?
And here ’s a typical example of what you often find in a yard - waste - only dumpster :
As I mentioned at the beginning of this post , people throw away massive amounts of single - use paper and plastic .
Probably the biggest single category is cardboard pizza boxes .
In our one - hour expedition , I probably saw 500 used pizza boxes .
But we also saw huge amounts of clearly recyclable goods that were not being recycled .
Hundreds of glass jars , metal cans and plastics and immense amounts of paper , all of it headed for the landfill .
We also saw hundreds of pounds of colorfully - inked food packaging .
All of it carefully designed to catch your eye at the store , and then you toss it into the landfill .
But , it ’s not like you really toss it in–instead , a huge fleet of city trucks carts this packaging far away from the city in order to dump it into the landfill .
It makes me wonder how many toxic chemicals were released into the environment in order to produce all of this food packaging .
We found several toys and many items of clothing that had been saturated in pasta sauce , meat grease or who - knows what kind of fluid .
We decided to keep looking .
What my girls ended up taking home for a quick clean - up was a little toy dog that they found inside of a woman ’s big purse .
You ’ll see his photo below .
My girls named him “ Oscar ” ( after Sesame Street ’s Oscar ) , and he now lives with us .
Rahm wants to be mayor after all .
So says a piece on Obama 's chief of staff in the New York Times Magazine pubbed last Thursday citing information which apparently comes from William Daley , Mayor Richard Daley 's brother and Emanuel 's close friend .
Does he want to run for mayor of Chicago someday ?
Of course .
With House speaker now off the table , Emanuel would like to lead his hometown and openly communicates that to people , including his friend Richard Daley , the incumbent mayor .
Openly communicates ?
Really ?
Emanuel spent January of this year denying it , perhaps most notably as the first guest of the new MSNBC morning program The Rundown .
Back to the Times :
But Emanuel would not run against the mayor , and William Daley told me that he thinks his brother will probably run again next year when his latest term expires .
So if Mayor Daley runs again , Rahm 's looking at a 2015 race for mayor -- unless , morbid as it sounds , Daley follows his father 's path and passes while in office .
As for what William Daley has to say about all this :
After the magazine piece came out online last Thursday , Daley told NBC5 political reporter Mary Ann Ahern that if Rahm wants to be mayor , he needs to " get in line " -- which perhaps implies that Times reporter Peter Baker was supplying his own conjecture about Rahm , or that Rahm said so himself .
Whichever it is , Baker does n't make clear .
For the meantime , Rahm 's got his own inside - the - beltway issues to deal with -- including the near - constant prattling about his relationship with David Axelrod .
But really .
How can you fight with such an adorable lip hamster ?
You just can't .

Former Haryana DGP SPS
Rathore , convicted in the Ruchika molestation case , was injured on Monday when a student of the prestigious NID posing as a journalist stabbed him thrice in the face with a pocket knife outside a local court .
The condition of 68 - year - old Rathore , who had gone to the court in the morning in connection with hearing of his appeal against the six - month sentence imposed on him , was stated to be stable .
The shaken former top cop came back to the court with a walking stick for post - lunch proceedings with bandage on his right cheek amid tight security .
The assailant is said to have a psychological problem suffering from " mood disorder syndrome " .
The assailant identified as 29 - year - old Utsav Sharma , a resident of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and pursuing a post - graduate diploma course in animation and film design at the National Institute of Design ( NID ) in Ahmedabad , has been arrested by the police and was being grilled .
As Rathore stepped out of the district court complex after the morning proceedings and was barely 15 feet away from his waiting car , the assailant who was standing among mediapersons waiting for an interaction lunged forward , caught him by the neck and in a split second stabbed him thrice on his right cheek with a sharp - edged pocket knife .
Rathore was also punched on his face by the youth who posed as a freelance journalist .
The assailant had a still camera with him and pretended to take pictures of the approaching former cop ,
A bleeding Rathore covered the wound on his face with a handkerchief while an escorting policeman pinned the youth down to the ground just near the ex-cop 's car when he tried to run in the midst of a commotion .
The assailant also attempted to attack Rathore on the arm .
" He appears to be psychologically imbalanced .
We are trying to ascertain the motive behind his action , " Chandigarh 's SSP S S Srivastava said .

Sony 's upcoming motion controller finally has a name -- the PlayStation Move -- and it looks like a pair of aircraft traffic wands with glowing blue and pink bulbs on the ends .
The company announced the name during the 2010 Games Developer Conference before proceeding to demonstrate several games and inviting attendees to give the technology a spin for themselves .
The buzzword throughout the presentation : Precision .
From SCE Worldwide Studios President Shuhei Yoshida 's inaugural lines ( " A more precise , immersive , and responsive game experience " ) to SCE Senior Vice President of Marketing Peter Dille 's use of the word over a dozen times thereafter , it sounds like Sony plans to square off against Nintendo and Microsoft by leveraging the Move 's fine motor tracking capabilities .
When it ships this fall , Sony says the Move will sell in three configurations :
A version with just the Move wands for those who already own the requisite PlayStation Eye camera , another option with the Eye , the Move wands , and a game , and a full bundle to include the Eye , Move wands , a game , and the PlayStation 3 console .
The " Eye , Move wands , and game " option should sell for " under $ 100 , " said Dille .
The company then demonstrated several motion - control games , starting with a medieval sword - and - shield beat - em - up .
From right or left hand slashes to shield blocks to a hands - behind - your - back stance that triggers taunts , the Move - - tracked by the Eye - - appeared capable of deftly processing every gesture and angle .
Table tennis was up next , and Sony demonstrated how subtle shifts in wrist rolling or pitching could produce any of the effects a physical paddle would , from harder or softer hits and various types of spin to near court swats and far court slams .
Covering the family angle with a game that looked suspiciously like an EyeToy demo , Move Party used the PlayStation Move to " augment " reality by placing you -- literally , as in a video stream snapped with the Eye - - in micro-arenas with changing motion - related challenges .
First , the demonstrator 's Move wand became a tennis racket ( or as Sony described it , the racket was " augmented onto " the controller ) to swat objects that appeared around her .
Next , the Move became a paint brush and the demonstrator had to color in shapes without going outside the lines before a timer ran out .
At one point , the Move wand even morphed into a portable hand - fan , the demonstrator yawing her wrist to redirect airflow and guide falling baby chicks into nests on either side of the display .
Existing games were also shown using slight Move modifications .
A cooperative - angled demo of LittleBigPlanet allowed one player with a regular PS3 gamepad controlling the onscreen character to play in tandem with a second player , who used one of the Move wands to manipulate the environment and ease progress .
In a surprise move , the company trotted out a complementary product it calls the " sub- controller " ( see pic above ) .
Think Nintendo's nunchuk , because that 's what it is -- an analog thumbstick with buttons you hold in one hand while waving one of the Move wands in the other .
Sony noted you can play " all the way through " SOCOM 4 ( shipping this fall ) using a Move wand and the sub -controller .
Dille called the PlayStation Move Sony's " biggest effort of the year " and noted the company plans a major marketing push , so brace yourself for TV spots , retail promotions , public relations campaigns , billboards , and who knows , probably some stealth - viral stuff rattling around out there too .

The city of Orange may drop its lawsuit against a husband and wife cited for not having enough plants in their frontyard , officials said .
The case against Quan and Angelina Ha could be dropped without fine or penalty , officials said Tuesday hours after the pair was arraigned on charges of violating city ordinances when they removed their lawn to try to save water .
Officials determined the yard met city standards after re-examining the property about noon Tuesday , said Paul Sitkoff , a spokesman for Orange .
A city ordinance requires that 40 % of a front lawn be landscaped with live plants .
" We had two officials go out there and look at the property , and they did make strides in complying with the ordinance , " Sitkoff said .
City officials will meet with the couple later this week to make another assessment , he said .
She shot to fame 20 years ago with her shaved head , chiseled cheeks and haunting rendition of the song “ Nothing Compares 2 U. ”
Then she gained notoriety when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II on American TV , calling him “ the enemy ” and urging people to fight child abuse .
Sinead O’Connor is still singing .
And she ’s still speaking out against abuse -- only now her 1992 stunt on “ Saturday Night Live ” almost seems prescient as the Roman Catholic Church faces a growing catalog of complaints about child sexual and physical assault by priests in her Irish homeland and across Europe .
Such mistreatment was rampant here in Ireland , going back decades .
By 1987 , the Irish church was alarmed enough that it took out an insurance policy against future lawsuits and claims for compensation stemming from sexual - abuse allegations .
This past weekend , Pope Benedict XVI issued a “ pastoral letter ” apologizing to the flock in Ireland for the church ’s past failures .
He did not outline any disciplinary action against the bishops who many here say covered up priestly misdeeds , though on Wednesday he accepted the resignation of Bishop John Magee , who had been accused of failing to report suspected pedophile priests to police .
The pope also pinned no blame on the Vatican itself for a culture of secrecy that critics say it deliberately fostered .
O’Connor , now 43 and a mother of four , spoke to The Times on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bray , south of Dublin , about the abuse scandal .
Do you feel the pope ’s letter was enough ?
It ’s a study in the fine art of lying and actually betraying your own people .
. . .
He starts by saying that he ’s writing with great concern for the people of Ireland .
If he was that concerned , why has it taken him 23 years to write a letter , and why did he or the last pope never get on an airplane and come to meet the victims in any of these countries and apologize ?
The letter sells the Irish [ church ] hierarchy downriver by stating again and again that the Irish hierarchy has somehow acted independently of the Vatican .
. . .
The documents are there to prove that that ’s a lie .
. . .
If you were the boss of a company and some of the employees of your company were known to sexually abuse children , you would fire them instantly .
You would also go instantly to meet the people who had been abused and profusely apologize and offer your help in any way whatsoever to deal with this .
. . .
That has never happened .
As a cardinal , the pope wrote an order in 2001 demanding that abuse cases be dealt with in secret .
But does n’t the directive also mention cooperating with civil authorities ?
That document stated that all matters of abuse were to be sent to him in Rome , where he would decide whether they would be dealt with by Rome or locally by the bishops .
They were to be dealt with exclusively by the church , and they were subject to pontifical secret , which means you can be excommunicated if you breach the secret .
. . .
[ It ’s true that ] it ’s the first time ever that any document coming from the Vatican actually does say to the clergy that they should cooperate with civil authorities .
. . .
What I object to here is , the first time they said that was 2001 .
They knew back in 1987 at least that this was an issue .
. . .
They knew so much that they took out an insurance policy .
So what should the pope do ?
There should be a full criminal investigation of the Catholic hierarchy of any country in which this has been an issue .
There should be a full criminal investigation of the Vatican .
There should be a full criminal investigation of the pope .
The pope should stand down for the fact that he did not act in a Christian fashion to protect children , and for the fact that his organization acted to preserve their business interests decade after decade rather than be concerned about the interests of children , and for showing so much disrespect for Christ , God , the victims , the rest of us , their own clergy .
. . .
The Vatican and the pope need to get on their knees and confess the full truth in the same language they make us use in Mass .
. . .
They need to get on their knees , open everything up , be transparent , tell the truth , ask the people for forgiveness and prayers .
That confession is their only hope of survival into the 21st century .
It ’s a rickety bridge , but it is a bridge .
And personally , I would be willing to bring them across that little bridge into the 21st century and help them .
. . .
If they do n’t do that , they will not survive .
. . .
I hope they do survive , because there ’s a lot that ’s really beautiful about Catholicism .
Even though there are those of us who are fighting it like you would fight an abusive parent , you love the parent still and you want it to be healed .
What about the abuse victims ?
He [ the pope ] says his concern is “ to bring healing to the victims . ”
But he ’s denying them the one thing which might actually bring them healing , which is a full confession from the Vatican .
. . .
You ’re talking about some very broken people .
. . .
Life is very difficult for them .
They ca n’t hold down jobs , ca n’t hold down relationships .
. . .
Life is difficult .
Therapy costs a lot of money .
These people do n’t make much money ; hardly any of them are actually fit to work .
They need the Vatican to cough up some of its billions [ to ] pay for these people to be able to live their lives .
Should Irish bishops resign , as a few have offered ?
Resignation gets them off the hook .
They should be criminally prosecuted .
. . .
If you or I covered up crimes like that , we ’d be slap - bang in jail in five minutes , and rightly so .
There ’s a double standard .
. . .
What should the Irish people do ?
It ’s the good - hearted , sweet Catholic people who go to Mass still despite all of this -- they are the people who have the power in their hands to get the Vatican on its knees and confess .
. . .
How these people can do that is by refusing to go to Mass , boycott them until they actually come to their knees and confess .
. . .
The way we are at the moment , we ’re in a very dysfunctional relationship with an organization that ’s actually abusing us .
And we ca n’t see what ’s being done to us .
We have the mentality of a battered wife who thinks it ’s her fault .
If we had a friend in a similar relationship , we would beg him or her to walk away .
Yet you still consider yourself a Catholic ?
I ’m a Catholic , and I love God. . . .
That ’s why I object to what these people are doing to the religion that I was born into .
. . .
I ’m passionately in love and always have been with what I call the Holy Spirit , which I believe the Catholic Church have held hostage and still do hold hostage .
I think God needs to be rescued from them .
They are not representing Christian values and Christian attitudes .
If they were truly Christian , they would ’ve confessed ages ago , and we would n’t be having to batter the door down and try to get blood from a stone .
henry.chu@latimes.com
( CNN ) -- Conflicting reports emerged Sunday about whether Adam Gadahn , a U.S. - born spokesman for al Qaeda , has been arrested in Pakistan .
A senior Pakistani government official told CNN that Gadahn was arrested Sunday in Karachi , and a second senior Pakistani government official later confirmed the arrest .
But a U.S. intelligence official said there appears to be no validity to the reports that Gadahn was in custody , and other U.S. officials also said they have no indication that Gadahn has been captured .
Reports of the arrest came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising the November massacre at Fort Hood , Texas .
On the video , Gadahn said the U.S. Army major charged with gunning down 13 people " lit a path " for other Muslim service members to follow .
Gadahn , also known as Azzam the American , has routinely posted lengthy videos on Islamist online forums .
In 2006 , he was indicted on charges of treason and providing material support to terrorists .
The U.S. government has offered a $ 1 million reward for information leading to his capture .
Authorities have targeted several key Islamist figures in Karachi , the populous port city and financial capital of Pakistan .
For some time , it has functioned as a hideout for Taliban and al Qaeda sympathizers .
One of the figures , top Taliban leader Agha Jan Motasim , was arrested on Friday .
Motasim 's capture came on the heels of the arrest of the Taliban 's No. 2 figure and overall military commander , Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar .
Last month , Taliban and government sources confirmed that Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud had died .
A government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of a January 14 unmanned drone attack in North Waziristan ; other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi .
A city of 13 million -- with some estimates of 100,000 new arrivals a month -- Karachi as seen an influx of Pashtuns from the tribal border region with Afghanistan .
Many fled there during fighting and offensives in the Northwest Frontier Province and Waziristan , making it a comfortable place for the Taliban to blend in and count on a network of supporters .
" I think its become apparent ... that al Qaeda does n't really have a base of sanctuary inside Afghanistan , at least not one where its leaders feel safe , " CNN 's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson said .
" They 've taken to hiding inside Pakistan . "
Gadahn 's reported presence in Karachi " is an indication of how easily it is for al Qaeda sympathizers and Taliban sympathizers to hide in that city , " Robertson said .
Gadahn , 31 , grew up on a California farm and was home - schooled until 17 .
A year later he moved in with his paternal grandparents , who were secular Jews .
He converted to Islam at the Islamic Society of Orange County , California , but was banned from the mosque two years later after hitting its chairman , Haitham Bundjaki .
In 1997 Gadahn began working for a California charity suspected of having ties to al Qaeda .
He moved to Pakistan in 1998 .
His family has said they last heard from him in 2002 .
In 2004 , the FBI identified him as part of an al Qaeda cell that was planning attacks aimed at disrupting that year 's presidential election in the United States .
In October 2004 , he began appearing in disguise in al Qaeda videos .
Gadahn dropped the disguise in 2006 .
In 2008 , he renounced his U.S. citizenship and destroyed his passport in another al Qaeda video .
In his video message posted online Sunday , Gadahn says Muslims should emulate the alleged Fort Hood shooter .
" I believe that defiant Brother Nidal is the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , " Adam Gadahn says in English in the video .
Maj .
Nidal Hasan , an Army psychiatrist and a U.S. - born citizen , is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder in the November 5 killings .
Hasan is also facing 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder and is eligible for the death penalty .
" The Mujahid brother Nidal Hasan is a pioneer , a trailblazer and a role model who has opened a door , lit a path and shown the way forward for every Muslim who finds himself among the unbelievers and yearns to discharge his duty to Allah and play a part in the defense of Islam and Muslims , " Gadahn says in the video .
Gadahn also cites in Sunday 's video the U.S. and allied buildup in Afghanistan , where the United States is in the process of adding about 30,000 troops .
" It is rapidly becoming clear that this already - hot global battle is about to get even hotter , " he says .
" This is a war which knows no international borders and no single battleground , and that 's why I am calling on every honest and vigilant Muslim in the countries of the Zionist - Crusader alliance in general and America , Britain and Israel in particular to prepare to play his due role in responding to and repelling the aggression of the enemies of Islam . "
In December , Gadahn released a video message in English offering condolences to " unintended Muslim victims " killed in attacks in Afghanistan , Pakistan and elsewhere .
It was a rare example of al Qaeda offering condolences to the families of those killed in the group 's own attacks .
CNN 's Zain Verjee contributed to this report .
256 Bit Arithmetic
Large integer types are very useful .
They are used in cryptography , where the larger the type , the more possibilities , and thus exponentially more security .
Another use is in fixed point arithmetic .
Floating point numbers have intrinsic inaccuracy .
Large bit - depth fixed point arithmetic allows expressions to be evaluated without the risk of truncation or rounding errors .
They also can be the primitive base used in arbitrary precision arithmetic where the larger the integer , the less overhead .
gcc has in - built 128 bit integer types on 64 bit machines .
These can be accessed via __uint128_t for unsigned and __int128_t for signed 128 bit types .
These are useful , because their use exposes the 64×64 bit ⇒ 128 bit multiplication assembly instruction , which would otherwise have to be described as a series of 32×32 bit ⇒ 64 bit multiplications .
Unfortunately , the gcc optimizer does not handle these types very efficiently .
For example the two simple routines typedef __uint128_t u128b ; u128b add128 b( u128b x , u128 b y ) { return x + y ; } u128 b mul128 b( u128b x , u128 b y ) { return x * y ; } compile with maximal optimization into add128b : mov %rbx , - 0x10 ( %rsp ) mov %rdi , %rax mov %rcx , %rbx mov %rdx , %rcx mov %rsi , %rdx mov %rbp , -0x8 ( %rsp ) add %rcx , %rax mov - 0x8 ( %rsp ) , %rbp adc %rbx , %rdx mov - 0x10 ( %rsp ) , %rbx retq mul128b : imul %rdi , %rcx mov %rdx , %rax imul %rdx , %rsi mul %rdi add %rsi , %rcx lea ( %rcx , %rdx , 1 ) , %rdi mov %rdi , %rdx retq with gcc version 4.3
This is absolutely horrible code .
The problem here is that the rdx register is defined as an input register for part of the y variable by the ABI .
It is also defined to be high part of the output .
This confuses the gcc register allocator , and a large number of extra register - register copies are generated .
In addition , this causes stack spills , which makes the code even worse .
Moving to gcc version 4.4 helps a little : add128b : mov %rdx , %rax mov %rcx , %rdx push %rbx add %rdi , %rax adc %rsi , %rdx pop %rbx retq mul128b : imul %rdx , %rsi mov %rdx , %rax imul %rdi , %rcx mul %rdi add %rsi , %rcx lea ( %rcx , %rdx , 1 ) , %rdx retq
This code is noticeably better .
However , it still contains obvious extra instructions .
To get an optimal implementation , we will need to move to assembly language .
Normally , this would best be done via inline gcc asm .
Unfortunately , in this case that does n't work as well as we 'd like .
The problem is that gcc defines the " A " register description as rax and rdx .
We would like to use this combination as an output .
However , we need rdx as an input to match the ABI .
The overlapping register description is an error .
A possible work around is to use the " A " register description as in input / output register .
However , this causes the compiler to want to add an extra initialization of rax .
Another work around is to specify rax and rdx separately , and construct the return 128 bit type from the results .
This does n't work either - with the compiler again creating the extra register - register moves we are trying to avoid .
Thus moving to assembly is the only option .
The result is add128 : mov %rdx , %rax mov %rcx , %rdx add %rdi , %rax adc %rsi , %rdx retq mul128 : imul %rdi , %rcx mov %rdx , %rax imul %rdx , %rsi add %rsi , %rcx mul %rdi add %rcx , %rdx retq Implementing other operations remains an exercise .
So what about the next larger power of two , 256 bit integers ?
Here we must leave the built - in types behind and develop everything from scratch .
For simplicity we will define the structure typedef unsigned long long u64b ; typedef __uint128_t u128b ; typedef struct u256 b u256 b ; struct u256 b { u64b lo ; u64b mid ; u128 b hi ; } ; as the data layout for our 256 bit unsigned integer .
This matches the endianess of the other integers , and also allows easy access to the component 64 bit and 128 bit parts we will use in the following .
Implementing the addition and multiplication operations is relatively easy to do by using the inbuilt 128 bit type to handle the carries .
u256 b add256b( u256 b *x , u256 b *y ) { u128 b lo = ( u128 b ) x-> lo + y-> lo ; u128 b mid = ( u128 b ) x-> mid + y-> mid + ( lo >> 64 ) ; u256 b result = { .lo = lo , . mid = mid , .hi = x -> hi + y-> hi + ( mid >> 64 ) , } ; return result ; } /* Dumb n^2 way */ u256 b mul256 b( u256 b *x , u256 b *y ) { u128 b t1 = ( u128 b ) x-> lo * y-> lo ; u128 b t2 = ( u128 b ) x-> lo * y-> mid ; u128 b t3 = x->lo * y-> hi ; u128 b t4 = ( u128 b ) x-> mid * y-> lo ; u128 b t5 = ( u128 b ) x-> mid * y-> mid ; u64 b t6 = x-> mid * y-> hi ; u128 b t7 = x-> hi * y-> lo ; u64 b t8 = x-> hi * y-> mid ; u64b lo = t1 ; u128 b m1 = ( t1 >> 64 ) + ( u64 b ) t2 ; u64 b m2 = m1 ; u128 b mid = ( u128 b ) m2 + ( u64 b ) t4 ; u128 b hi = ( t2 >> 64 ) + t3 + ( t4 >> 64 ) + t5 + ( ( u128 b ) t6 << 64 ) + t7 + ( ( u128 b ) t8 << 64 ) + ( m1 >> 64 ) + ( mid >> 64 ) ; u256 b result = {lo , mid , hi} ; return result ; } Where we have used , as the comment describes a dumb manual n2 multiplication algorithm .
Expanding the 128 bit multiplications , this contains a total of six double - precision , and four single precision multiplications .
Can we do better ?
There are several multiplication algorithms which are asymptotically better than brute - force n2 multiplication .
The first of these is Karatsuba multiplication .
This replaces four multiplications by three via the trick : (x 1 + t x 2 ) × ( y 1 + t y 2 ) = A + t((x 1 + x 2 ) (y 1 + y 2 ) - A - B ) + B t2 , where A = x 1 y 1 , and B = x 2 y 2 , where x and y are the two numbers to be multiplied , and expanded in terms of a base , t .
This can be done recursively , halving the base at each step , yielding a total of nine multiplications for our problem .
This is one better than the total of ten given above .
However , these multiplications need to all be double precision .
This slows the algorithm down , and the one less multiplication does n't help .
Another method of multiplying high precision numbers is called Toom - Cook multiplication .
This works by noticing that the we are multiplying polynomials in t , the base .
A polynomial can be described by its value at n+1 points , where n is the maximal order .
i.e. if you know the value of a quadratic at three points , then you can derive its functional form .
This means we can use point - wise multiplication to evaluate the polynomial multiplication .
For a multiplication of n×n components ( here we have 4 64 bit components to make up the 256 bit total ) we require 2n - 1 points , and thus 2n - 1 multiplications .
For our problem , this yields 7 multiplications .
Unfortunately , this is n't the whole story .
To go from the point values back to the polynomial expansion form , which will be our wanted result , we need to a few more mathematical operations .
Unfortunately , for the case given here , we need to divide by 6 or 3 .
This is most efficiently done as yet another multiplication , giving a gross total of 8 double - precision multiplications .
Again , this is slower than the dumb brute - force method .
Why are the advanced methods slower ?
The reason is that we are doing a 256 bit × 256 bit ⇒ 256 bit multiplication .
The full result is 512 bits in length .
The more advanced methods calculate this full calculation .
If the brute force method were used , it would require 16 double - precision multiplications .
Only requiring the half - sized result saves us quite a bit .
Can the advanced methods be modified to give the lower bits we require ?
Unfortunately , there is no simple modification of Toom - Cook to do what we want .
In the best case , we might save a single multiplication , but this is n't enough to help .
The Karatsuba algorithm is another story .
Here , it is indeed possible to modify it to lower the number of required multiplications significantly .
Expanding the terms as x = x 1 +tx 2 +t2 x 3 +t3 x 4 , y = y 1 +ty 2 +t2y 3 +t3y 4 , and z = x×y = z 1 +tz 2 +t2z 3 +t3z 4 we can rewrite the multiplication as z 1 = x 1 y 1 z 2 = ( x 1 + x 2 ) (y 1 + y 2 ) - x 1 y 1 - x 2 y 2 z 3 = ( x 1 + x 3 ) (y 1 + y 3 ) - x 1 y 1 - x 3 y 3 + x 2 y 2 z 4 = ( x 2 + x 3 ) (y 2 + y 3 ) - x 2 y 2 - x 3 y 3 +x 1 y 4 +x 4 y 1
If the values calculated multiple times are reused we require a total of 8 multiplies , with five of them double precision , and three single precision .
This is lower than the brute force method , so may just be faster .
Unfortunately , we cannot use the algorithm shown above as is .
The problem is overflow .
The additions cause us to have to multiply 65 bit numbers together .
This can be fixed by using subtractions instead .
Since of a pair of numbers , one must be larger than or equal to another , we can order the subtraction so that the result will always fit in 64 bits .
For one set of orderings we might have : z 1 = x 1 y 1 z 2 = ( x 1 - x 2 ) (y 2 - y 1 ) + x 1 y 1 + x 2 y 2 z 3 = ( x 1 - x 3 ) (y 3 - y 1 ) + x 1 y 1 + x 2 y 2 + x 3 y 3 z 4 = ( x 2 - x 3 ) (y 3 - y 2 ) + x 2 y 2 + x 3 y 3 +x 1 y 4 +x 4 y 1
To do the 65 bit multiply , we need to check the orderings of the terms : u128 b mul65( u64b x1 , u64b x2 , u64 b y1 , u64 b y2 , u64 b * carry ) { * carry = 0 ; if ( x1 > x2 ) { u64 b xx12 = x1 - x2 ; if ( y1 > y2 ) { u64 b yy12 = y1 - y2 ; u128 b xy12 = ( u128 b ) xx12 * yy 12 ; if ( xy12 ) * carry -= 1 ; return - xy 12 ; } else { u64 b yy12 = y2 - y1 ; u128 b xy12 = ( u128 b ) xx12 * yy12 ; return xy12 ; } } else { u64 b xx12 = x2 - x1 ; if ( y1 > y2 ) { u64 b yy12 = y1 - y2 ; u128 b xy12 = ( u128 b ) xx12 * yy12 ; return xy12 ; } else { u64 b yy12 = y2 - y1 ; u128 b xy12 = ( u128 b ) xx12 * yy 12 ; if ( xy12 ) * carry -= 1 ; return - xy 12 ; } } } Note how we also need to return the " carry " which is actually a borrow .
This is required when the result is negative .
We need to return a 192 bit two 's complement integer to get the result correct .
The above is n't quite as efficient as it might be though .
A little optimization yields the simpler : u128 b mul65 b( u64b x1 , u64b x2 , u64 b y1 , u64 b y2 , u64 b * carry ) { u64 b c = 0 ; u64 b t1 = x1 - x2 ; u64 b t2 = y2 - y1 ; u128b result = ( u128 b ) t1 * t2 ; if ( ( x2 > x1 ) && t2 ) { result -= ( u128 b ) t2 << 64 ; c = ~ c ; } if ( ( y1 > y2 ) && t1 ) { result -= ( u128 b ) t1 << 64 ; c = ~ c ; } * carry = c ; return result ; } Unfortunately , gcc is n't all that good at compiling the above .
To get a better result , assembly is required again : mul65 c : mov %rdi , %rax sub %rsi , %rax sbb %rsi , %rsi sub %rdx , %rcx sbb %rdi , %rdi mov %rsi , %r9 and %rcx , %rsi xor %rdi , %r9 and %rax , %rdi mul %rcx # Correct for overflow sub %rsi , %rdx sub %rdi , %rdx # fixup carry mov %rax , %rdi or %rdx , %rdi cmove %rdi , %r9 mov %r9 , ( % r8 ) retq
This uses a relation between signed and unsigned multiplication , together with the " sbb " trick to have a branchless function .
This can be further simplified in the case where the carry ( borrow ) is n't required : mul65d : mov %rdi , %rax sub %rsi , %rax sbb %rsi , %rsi sub %rdx , %rcx sbb %rdi , %rdi and %rcx , %rsi and %rax , %rdi mul %rcx # Correct for overflow sub %rsi , %rdx sub %rdi , %rdx retq Some C code which can use these routines to calculate the 256 bit multiplication via the pseudo - Karatsuba algorithm is : u256 b mul256 c ( u256 b *x , u256 b *y ) { u256 b result ; u64 b x1 = x-> lo ; u64 b x2 = x-> mid ; u64b x3 = x->hi ; u64b x4 = x-> hi >>
64 ; u64 b y1 = y-> lo ; u64 b y2 = y-> mid ; u64 b y3 = y-> hi ; u64 b y4 = y-> hi >>
64 ; u128 b xy11 = ( u128 b ) x1 * y1 ; u128 b xy22 = ( u128 b ) x2 * y2 ; u128 b xy33 = ( u128 b ) x3 * y3 ; u64b xy14 = x1 * y4 + x4 * y1 ; u64b xy23 = ( x3 - x2 ) *( y2 - y 3 ) ; u64b carry ; u128 b t1 = xy11 ; u128 b t2 = mul65c ( x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , &carry ) ; u128 b t3 = mul65d ( x1 , x3 , y1 , y3 ) + xy 11 + xy 22 + xy33 + ( t2 >> 64 ) ; u64 b t4 = xy 14 + xy23 + xy 22 + xy33 + carry ; t2 = ( u64 b ) t2 ; t2 += t1 >> 64 ; t3 += t2 >> 64 ; t2 = ( u64 b ) t2 ; t2 += xy11 ; t3 += t2 >> 64 ; t2 = ( u64 b ) t2 ; t2 += xy22 ; t3 += t2 >> 64 ; result.lo = t1 ; result.mid = t2 ; result . hi = t3 + ( ( u128 b ) t4 << 64 ) ; return result ; }
The normal method takes 10.9 seconds to evaluate 228 multiplications , and the pseudo - Karatsuba algorithm takes 8.8 seconds .
( Using gcc 4.4 , which generates the better code . )
This is approximately the 8/10 speedup predicted .
Now how much faster can we make them go if we use full assembly versions ?
The pseudo - Karatsuba algorithm is rather complex , so is rather long in machine code : mul256 pseudok : mov 0x10 ( %rdx ) , %rax mov %rbp , - 0x8 ( %rsp ) mov ( %rsi ) , %r11 mov ( %rdx ) , %r8 mov %rbx , - 0x10 ( %rsp ) mov 0x18 ( %rdx ) , %rcx mov %r12 , -0x18 ( %rsp ) mov 0x10 ( %rsi ) , %rbx imul %r11 , %rcx #xy13 mov %r11 , %rbp mov %rax , %r10 sub % r8 , %rax sbb %r12 , %r12 sub %rbx , %r11 sbb %r9 , %r9 and %r11 , %r12 and %rax , % r9 sub % r12 , %rcx sub % r9 , %rcx mov 0x8 ( %rdx ) , %r9 mul %r11 mov %rax , %r12 add %rdx , %rcx #xy33 mov %rbx , %rax mul %r10 add %rax , %r12 adc %rax , %rcx add %rdx , %rcx #xy 11 + xy14 mov %rbp , %rax mul % r8 mov %rax , ( %rdi ) mov %rax , %r11 add %rax , %r12 adc %rdx , %rcx mov %r8 , %rax imul 0x18 ( %rsi ) , %rax add %rdx , %r11 adc %rdx , %r12 adc %rax , %rcx # xy23 mov %rbp , %rdx mov 0x8 ( %rsi ) , %rbp mov %r9 , %rax sub %rbp , %rbx sub %r10 , %rax mov %rdx , %rsi imul %rax , %rbx add %rbx , %rcx # xy 22 mov %rbp , %rax mul %r9 add %rax , % r11 adc %rax , %r12 adc %rax , %rcx add %rdx , %r12 adc %rdx , %rcx # xy 12 mov % r8 , %rax sub %r9 , %rax sbb % r8 , % r8 sub %rsi , %rbp sbb %rsi , %rsi mov %r8 , %rbx and %rbp , % r8 xor %rsi , %rbx and %rax , %rsi mul %rbp mov - 0x8 ( %rsp ) , %rbp mov %rax , %r9 sub % r8 , %rdx sub %rsi , %rdx or %rdx , %r9 cmove %r9 , %rbx add %rax , %r11 mov %r11 , 0x8 ( %rdi ) adc %rdx , %r12 mov %r12 , 0x10 ( %rdi ) mov - 0x18 ( %rsp ) , %r12 adc %rbx , %rcx mov %rcx , 0x18 ( %rdi ) mov - 0x10 ( %rsp ) , %rbx retq
The brute force method simplifies much more : mul256 brute : mov ( %rsi ) , %rax mov ( %rdx ) , % r8 mov 0x8 ( %rdx ) , %r9 mov %rbp , - 0x8 ( %rsp ) mov %rax , %rbp mov 0x18 ( %rdx ) , %rcx imul %rbp , %rcx mov 0x10 ( %rdx ) , %r10 mul % r8 mov %rax , ( %rdi ) mov %rdx , %r11 mov %rbp , %rax mul %r10 mov %r12 , - 0x10 ( %rsp ) mov %rax , %r12 add %rdx , %rcx mov %rbp , %rax mul % r9 add %rax , % r11 mov 0x8 ( %rsi ) , %rbp adc %rdx , % r12 adc $ 0 , %rcx imul %rbp , %r10 mov %rbp , %rax mul %r8 add %rax , %r11 mov %rbp , %rax adc %rdx , %r12 adc %r10 , %rcx mov 0x10 ( %rsi ) , %rbp mul % r9 mov %r11 , 0x8 ( %rdi ) imul %rbp , % r9 add %rax , % r12 mov %rbp , %rax adc %rdx , %rcx mov 0x18 ( %rsi ) , %rbp imul % r8 , %rbp add %rbp , %rcx mov - 0x8 ( %rsp ) , %rbp mul %r8 add %rax , %r12 mov %r12 , 0x10 ( %rdi ) mov - 0x10 ( %rsp ) , %r12 adc %r9 , %rcx add %rdx , %rcx mov %rcx , 0x18 ( %rdi ) retq Running the multipliers again for 228 times gives a time of 5.5 seconds for the assembly optimized pseudo - Karatsuba algorithm .
However , doing this for the brute force method yields a time of 4.0 seconds .
Thus the dumb brute force method is faster overall .
Why is this ?
The reason is that the more complex algorithm requires many more additions and subtractions .
The time taken for these adds up , and overwhelms the small advantage in lower number of multiplies .
The end result is code which is more than twice as fast than the original C code .
The reason we can speed it up so much is because even in version 4.4 , gcc does not generate very good code for 128 bit types .
Hopefully version 4.5 will be better .
Finally , the optimal 256 bit adder is : add256 : mov ( %rdx ) , % r8 mov 0x8 ( %rdx ) , % r9 mov 0x10 ( %rdx ) , %rcx mov 0x18 ( %rdx ) , %rax add ( %rsi ) , % r8 adc 0x8 ( %rsi ) , %r9 adc 0x10 ( %rsi ) , %rcx adc 0x18 ( %rsi ) , %rax mov %r8 , ( %rdi ) mov %r9 , 0x8 ( %rdi ) mov %rcx , 0x10 ( %rdi ) mov %rax , 0x18 ( %rdi ) retq

UPDATED : 11:11 p.m.
CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Brady Quinn , who was traded by the Browns Sunday to Denver , admitted in an
that he has no idea why the new regime turned the team over to 35 - year - old Jake Delhomme instead of him .
" It 's really hard to try to figure out what it is , " said Quinn . " [ Mike ]
Holmgren has had a lot of success , and I 'm sure the decisions he 's making he 's got a lot of reasons for them and he 's doing what he wants to with the team .
It 's not really for me to question .
I 'm a Bronco and I could n't be happier heading over to Denver . "
Quinn , the Browns ' first - round pick in 2007 , was traded to the Broncos for backup running back Peyton Hillis , a sixth - round pick in 2011 and a conditional pick in 2012 , based on Quinn 's playing time .
Quinn said he never asked to be dealt or released , even when team president Holmgren made it clear he was actively looking for quarterbacks .
" No , there was no request for a trade , " said Quinn .
" The first I learned about it was when [ General Manager ]
Tom Heckert informed me of it [ Sunday afternoon ] .
But when they signed Jake to the deal that they did [ $ 7 million in 2010 according to a league source ] , the writing was on the wall . "
Quinn , who went 3 - 9 as a Browns starter amid constant turmoil , was asked if he received a fair shot .
He was pulled after 2 1/2 games this season and missed four starts before reclaiming the job in Week 8 .
" It 's not really for me to decide that , " said Quinn .
" I just wish things would 've gone differently in Cleveland .
I hope they have success in the future .
I hope coach Holmgren can get things turned around for them . "
He did n't say he 's going to Denver to win the starting job from incumbent Kyle Orton , who was acquired last off - season from Chicago for Jay Cutler .
The Broncos were rumored to have been interested in Quinn before that trade .
" I 'm just looking to create a role for myself on the team , " said Quinn .
" Anytime you 're in a situation like this , all you can really do is go in there and learn the system , get to know your teammates and coaches .
That 's really my focus right now .
All of those things will take care of themselves in the end . "
Quinn -- whom the Browns surrendered a high second - round pick in 2007 and 2008 's first - rounder to grab him with the 22nd pick in 2007 -- admitted he 's leaving with some sadness .
As a kid growing up in Dublin , he grew up idolizing the Browns and dreamed of leading them to the Super Bowl .
" I really wanted to be the guy to turn things around and turn the tide , but that 's not the situation I 'm faced with this at this point , " he said .
" I think you just have to give yourself a dose of reality .
Things do n't always work out the way you want them to in life .
I know God has a plan for me and obviously those plans are leading me out to Denver right now . "
Quinn 's fondest memory will be of his love affair with the fans .
" I had a wonderful time in Cleveland and I say that because of the fans , " he said .
" They were so welcoming and loyal to me .
Even though I battled through some tough times , the fans stuck with me and I can't thank them enough for all of their support .
" Hopefully they 'll always continue to have that enthusiasm .
It 's a great place to play and a great team and organization to be a part of . "
The Browns plan to make Holmgren available to the media on Monday .
That 's also the day Delhomme is expected to sign his two - year contract and join the team for the start of the off - season program .
" I appreciate everything Brady did for us last year and in his three seasons with the Cleveland Browns , " said coach Eric Mangini in the release .
" He is professional in the way he goes about doing his job and worked extremely hard at every aspect of his game .
I wish him the best of success in Denver . "
Quinn acknowledged it 's great to be wanted .
" One of the biggest things coming out of this is that you 're going to a team that really wants you and came and got you , " he said .
" Hopefully I can continue to learn and grow and get better .
Hopefully having a coach like coach [ Josh ] McDaniels will allow me to do that . "
He said his Lis Franc sprain " is doing great .
It 's really progressed very well .
I 'm just now coming into 100 percent recovery and feeling great .
I look forward to competing and working with the guys in the off - season workouts . "
Orton is not expected to be there this week , in part because he's the NFL Players '
Association representative and is in Hawaii attending the annual meeting .
Quinn also said his confidence has n't been shaken despite a rocky start in Cleveland , one that included a coaching change , a quarterback competition and the exodus of most of the Browns ' top skill players , including Joe Jurevicius , Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow .
" No matter what the situation , I 've always felt confident in my ability and hopefully I 'll have the opportunity to show that in Denver , " he said .
" Sorry it could n't have lasted longer here . "
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
If it ’s true that in politics you are judged by the caliber of your enemies , Yukiya Amano is off to a stellar start .
The 62 - year - old Japanese technocrat has only been at the helm of the U.N. ’s nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , for two months , but he is already exceedingly unpopular with the Iranian regime .
On Feb. 21 , Alaeddin Boroujerdi , the influential head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of Iran ’s legislature , known as the Majles , took the unprecedented step of publicly chastising the newly - installed Mr. Amano .
“ We had announced earlier that the agency ’s director general should avoid linking his reports to political issues , but Mr. Amano ’s reports seem to be moving toward politicization , ” the legislator told reporters .
Mr. Boroujerdi ’s discontent stems from the IAEA ’s latest report on Iran ’s nuclear program , released publicly on Feb. 17 .
The study , the first issued by the agency with Mr. Amano at the helm , provides the IAEA ’s most critical view to date of Iran ’s nuclear endeavor , and of the possible dangers associated with it .
Intelligence amassed by the IAEA , the report says , “ raises concerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile .
These alleged activities consist of a number of projects and subprojects , covering nuclear and missile related aspects , run by military - related organizations . ”
The new IAEA assessment is all the more striking given the distinctly counterproductive role the IAEA has traditionally played in the international debate over Iran ’s atomic effort .
Under the direction of Egyptian diplomat par excellence Mohammed ElBaradei , the organization busied itself with all manner of issues , nuclear and otherwise , while giving short shrift to the strategic logic underpinning the ayatollahs ’ enduring interest in the bomb .
In the process , the organization and its famous head came to be seen as something less than an honest broker in the international effort to prevent the Islamic Republic from going nuclear .
( Depending on how you view it , Mr. ElBaradei ’s confession last year that he thought the Iranian regime may indeed be striving for nuclear weapons status after all was either a true change of heart , a savvy burnishing of his legacy , or an effort to bolster his credentials ahead of a possible bid for the Egyptian presidency . )
All of which makes the IAEA ’s latest critical look at Iran ’s nuclear program all the more devastating for Iran - and helpful to the West .
More than two months after President Obama ’s informal year - end deadline for “ engagement ” with the Iranian regime , momentum is building within the Capital Beltway for serious economic sanctions against Iran .
A wide range of measures - from the sweeping ban on Iran ’s gasoline imports favored by Congress to the more “ targeted ” sanctions against Iranian financial interests and actors embraced by the White House - is now on the table .
The common denominator in all of these , however , is leverage .
Simply put , Washington does not have much .
After three decades of embargo , trade between the U.S. and the Islamic Republic is minimal ; in 2009 , the bilateral trade balance between the United States and Iran stood at less than $ 250 million , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
America ’s coalition partners , by contrast , have much more .
Europe , for example , wields considerable power vis-a - vis the Iranian regime .
Two - way trade between the Islamic Republic and EU states is estimated to have surpassed $ 10 billion last year , and Iran is reliant on Europe for nearly 40 percent of its high technology needs .
Increasingly , moreover , countries there are putting their money where their mouths are , and curtailing their commercial dealings with Iran .
In recent weeks , a spate of European companies - including Italy ’s ENI and Germany ’s Siemens - have begun to rethink future trade with Tehran .
These decisions have been further buttressed by the evolving European position toward the Islamic Republic .
The European Parliament is said to have recently begun lobbying telecommunications firms like Nokia and Siemens to sever economic ties to Tehran entirely over its violations of human rights and censorship practices in the wake of last summer ’s contested presidential election .
The IAEA ’s new , more sober reading of Iran ’s nuclear intentions should serve to reinforce these trends , and help to add new members to the emerging international consensus regarding the need to isolate Iran .
If it does , Mr. Amano ’s tenure as the IAEA ’s director general could already be considered more successful than that of his predecessor .

MANUFACTURERS are split over plans to make parental locks mandatory on digital TVs and set top boxes .
Parental locks let families control access to programs on digital TV based on their classification , such as G , PG or M .
To watch a program above a certain classification requires a PIN .
The Australian Communication and Media Authority says it plans to make the locks a compulsory feature of all digital TV receivers sold in Australia .
" Mandating the inclusion of parental locks in digital receivers will support parents and guardians in protecting their children from inappropriate or harmful content on television , " said ACMA chairman Chris Chapman .
However at least one manufacturer says the new rule is unnecessary .
" I do n't think that this is something that ACMA should regulate , " said Kogan Technologies founder Ruslan Kogan .
" If it 's a feature that people legitimately want , then TV manufacturers will have to ensure that they include it in order to stay competitive . "
Mr Kogan said there was a potential for consumers who do n't want the locks to be penalised by the plan .
" For instance , people without young children will be paying for the research and development costs for this feature even though they will never use it , " he said .
Other manufacturers were more sympathetic .
The Australian Digital Suppliers Industry Forum , which represents digital TV and radio manufacturers , said its members " generally " supported the plan .
" In supporting it we understand it will promote a diversity of broadcasting choices , " said ADSIF spokesperson Tim O'Keefe .
" Most manufacturers that are members of ADSIF already have parental guidance locks included in their products so it 's not an impost . "
However Mr O'Keefe said some companies were seeking time to sell existing products without parental locks before the new rule was enforced .
ADSIF represents most big - name digital TV manufacturers including Sony , Samsung , Panasonic , Toshiba , Sharp and LG .
Many new TVs and set top boxes already come with parental locks .
Mr Kogan said his company 's new range of set top boxes would also include the feature .
ACMA is calling for public and industry comment on how the plan would work and whether there should be any exemptions .
The closing date for comment is April 2 .

El nuevo estudio , publicado en la revista Science , encontró que un asteroide de 10 kilómetros golpeó la Tierra en la península de Yucatán
[ email protected ]
Un grupo de investigadores de México , Estados Unidos , Europa , Canadá y Japón confirmó que un enorme asteroide impactó la península de Yucatán hace 65 millones de años con la fuerza de mil millones de bombas atómicas como la arrojada en Hiroshima y causó la extinción masiva de los dinosaurios .
El panel de 41 científicos , entre los que se halla el mexicano Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi , del Instituto de Geofísica de la UNAM , revisó 20 años de investigación para confirmar la causa de la llamada extinción del cretáceo terciario ( KT ) , que creó un “ medio ambiente infernal ” e hizo desaparecer a más de la mitad de las especies del planeta .
El nuevo estudio , publicado en la revista
Science , encontró que un asteroide de 10 kilómetros de ancho que golpeó la Tierra en Chicxulub , donde se encuentra actualmente la península de Yucatán , hace 65 millones de años .
“ Ahora tenemos una gran confianza en que un asteroide fue la causa de la extinción de KT .
Esto desató incendios de gran escala , terremotos de más de 10 grados en la escala Richter , derrumbes de tierra a nivel continental que crearon tsunamis ” , dijo Joanna Morgan del Imperial College de Londres , una co-autora de la revisión científica .
Morgan dijo que el “ martillazo final del ataúd de los dinosaurios ” se produjo cuando el material que estalló con la explosión voló a la atmósfera , rodeando el planeta y dejándolo en la oscuridad , lo que causó un invierno global y “ mató a muchas especies que no se pudieron adaptar a este medio ambiente infernal ” .
Examinan evidencias
Los científicos que trabajaron en el estudio analizaron el trabajo de paleontólogos , geoquímicos , modeladores climáticos , geofísicos y sedimentólogos que recolectaron evidencia sobre la extinción del KT durante los últimos 20 años .
Urrutia , galardonado con el Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes 2009 , explicó que el artículo de Science aborda tres temas relacionados con el cráter .
En el primero de ellos , de acuerdo con los datos y observaciones acumuladas sobre el impacto , hay evidencia sólida para concluir que Chicxulub es un cráter de 200 kilómetros de diámetro originado por el impacto de un asteroide de 10 kilómetros de diámetro que cayó en la Tierra a una velocidad de entre 20 y 25 kilómetros por segundo , dijo el científico mexicano .
El segundo tema , agregó , es un análisis de las secciones donde está una capa de arcilla e iridio que marca el límite del cretácico - paleógeno , sobre la cual existía controversia científica sobre si correspondía al impacto o no .
En cuanto a la correlación entre el impacto del meteorito y las extinciones , sostuvo que el evento está asociado en 75 % a la desaparición de las especies , incluidas “ especies marinas y terrestres , todos los dinosaurios , los reptiles marinos y los reptiles voladores ” .
Además , “ gran cantidad de especies marinas , desde microorganismos hasta organismos emblemáticos como las amonitas , que son como los nautilus característicos del mesozoico ” , señaló Urrutia .
El investigador mexicano anunció que un grupo internacional de científicos iniciará una nueva exploración en el cráter Chicxulub , que ha sido estudiado desde hace varios años .
Pero esta vez los científicos realizarán perforaciones en la parte central y marina del gigantesco boquete , informó la UNAM en un comunicado .
“ El cráter Chicxulub está una parte en tierra y otra en mar .
De la parte terrestre tenemos más 5 mil muestras , pero ahora queremos explorar la parte marina , que es mucho más profunda ” , explicó Urrutia .
En los últimos años hubo teorías que señalaban que la desaparición del los dinosaurios se debió a la erupción de volcanes , conocidas como las Trampas de Deccan , en India , o al impacto de varios asteroides .

Beer :
When two heads are put together
Ken Grossman , left , and Fritz Maytag have collaborated on a new ale that bears their names .
( Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. )
Every beer begins its existence as a barley soup , but the adage “ too many cooks spoil the broth ” does n’t necessarily apply to brewers .
Collaboration is the hot new trend among America ’s specialty beermakers .
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico , Calif. , just released Fritz and Ken’s
Ale , the first in a series of one - time - only releases to celebrate the brewery 's 30th birthday .
The brew is a joint effort between Sierra Nevada founder and president Ken Grossman and Fritz Maytag , president of San Francisco ’s Anchor Brewing Co .
It ’s an imperial stout , a style neither of these gentlemen has ever tried his hand at .
Fritz and Ken’s
Ale comes in a 750 - mililiter cork - and - wire - cage bottle that retails for $ 10 to $ 15 .
It is ebony - colored , with a clingy , cocoa -colored head that almost reminds you of that old breakfast drink Ovaltine .
It ’s got an aroma full of bittersweet chocolate and leafy hops , and a big , roasty flavor that stops just short of being ashy , with notes of licorice and burnt molasses .
The 9 percent alcohol - by - volume content remains unobtrusive .
Sierra Nevada will follow up in May with Charlie , Fred and Ken ’s Lager , described as an “ Imperial Helles Lager . ”
Imagine a golden bock beer similar to Sierra Nevada 's Glissade Bock , but with considerably more body and alcohol .
Assisting Grossman will be homebrew pioneers Charlie Papazian ( president of the Brewers Association and author of " The Complete Joy of Homebrewing " ) and Fred Eckhardt ( columnist for All About Beer magazine and author of " Treatise on Lager Beers : How to Make Good Beer at Home " ) .
In mid-July , Sierra Nevada will debut Jack and Ken ’s Ale , a joint effort with Jack McAuliffe , who built the first from - the - ground - up microbrewery , New Albion Brewing Co. , in 1977 .
A modern - day Moses , McAuliffe pointed the way but never entered the promised land himself .
His brewery folded in 1983 and he exited the industry .
Jack and Ken ’s Ale , an American - style barleywine , will be his first professional brewing effort in more than a quarter - century .
Meanwhile , Boston Beer Co. chairman Jim Koch has been conferring with the world ’s oldest brewery , Weihenstephan in Freising ( est. 1040 ) , to craft an entirely new style of beer .
The wheat - based brew , yet unnamed , will follow the dictates of Germany ’s Reinheitsgebot ( beer purity law ) , promises Koch .
He describes it as high in alcohol yet champagne - like and light on the palate -- quite different from a traditional German double bock .
Look for its release in November .
Stone Brewing Co. in Escondido , Calif. , is joining forces with two of the East Coast ’s most innovative craft brewers ( Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton , Del. and Victory Brewing Co. in Downingtown , Pa. ) to make Saison du BUFF , an ale spiced with parsley , sage , rosemary and thyme .
" Those herbs really work well together , " says Stone president and chief executive Greg Koch , who helped brew the maiden batch in early March .
Dogfish Head and Victory will do separate versions of the recipe .
( Check here for a release schedule . )
One of the more interesting team - ups first took place in 2001 , when Adam Avery of Avery Brewing Co. in Boulder , Colo. , and Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River Brewing Co. in Santa Rosa , Calif. , discovered that both were making a beer named Salvation .
But there was no overlap in marketing territory , and “ we realized that neither of us had any issue with it , ” says Avery .
So instead of unleashing the lawyers , the two brewers decided to create a new brew by blending their respective beers :
Avery ’s is a hoppy , golden ale , Cilurzo ’s is darker , more in the style of a Belgian dubbel .
( Read here for the full story . )
Batch # 4 of Collaboration Not Litigation was released this past winter .
Not all collaborations pan out well enough to be worth a second batch .
Life and Limb , for example , the strong ale with birch syrup that Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head whipped up last year , drew some brickbats as well as raves on the online rating guide BeerAdvocate.com , with some purchasers finding it a little underwhelming for the price .
“ It takes time after time to refine a recipe , ” says Bill Metzger , who publishes American Brewer magazine and the Brewing News .
“ I ’ll take a beer that ’s tweaked to perfection any day . ”
But he admits that collaborations are “ a great marketing tool and also help with camaraderie . ”
According to industry consultant Bump Williams , the smaller breweries have a knack for working together to grow the craft beer category as a whole , operating on the assumption that a rising tide will float all boats .
Big beermakers such as Anheuser - Busch , Miller and Coors , on the other hand , are constantly “ cutting each other ’s throats to see who can go up half a share point . ”
Can you imagine these corporate behemoths collaborating on a beer ?
Actually , something like that did happen 25 years ago .
Coors , Molson and Germany ’s Kaltenberg Brewery pooled their efforts to formulate a beer called Masters III , which was marketed out of Reston and tested in four cities , including Washington .
The intent was to produce a domestic beer with the fuller body of an import .
According to Philip Van Munching ’s book Beer Blast , the new beer pleased no one .
It was too heavy for Coors drinkers , too light for import fans , and the plug was yanked after nine months .
Basically , the beer was a Michelob / Beck ’s / Heineken clone , not far enough outside the mainstream to justify the hype or extra price .
You can't say that about Fritz and Ken ’s Ale .

SAN FRANCISCO --
On Friday night , more than two dozen Native Americans embarked from here on a spiritual mission to New Zealand , where they will ask their fish to come home to California .
The unusual journey centers on an apology , to be relayed to the fish on the banks of the Rakaia River through a ceremonial dance that tribal leaders say has not been performed in more than 60 years .
The fish in question is the Chinook salmon , native to the Pacific but lately in short supply in the rivers of Northern California , home to the Winnemem Wintu -- a tiny , federally unrecognized and poor tribe supported by some Social Security payments , a couple of retirement plans and the occasional dog sale .
As the Winnemem see it , the tribe 's troubles began in the early 1940s , with the completion of the Shasta Dam , which blocked the Sacramento River and cut off the lower McCloud River , obstructing seasonal salmon runs , and according to the tribe , breaking a covenant with the fish .
" We 're going to atone for allowing them to build that dam , " said Mark Franco , the tribe 's headman .
" We should have fought harder . "
As luck would have it , the U.S. government once bred millions of Chinook eggs from the McCloud and shipped them around the world in hopes of creating new fisheries , including a batch that went to the South Island of New Zealand , where the fish thrived .
And so it is that the Winnemem -- who have used their spiritual powers in the past to try to stop dam construction , heal the sick and sway the votes of Sen.
Dianne Feinstein -- are on an 11,000 - mile vision quest whose itinerary , according to the tribe 's chief , came to her from a higher plane .
" The spirits came into the fire area here , " said the chief , Caleen Sisk - Franco , referring to the tribe 's circular , open - air meeting room .
" And they said , ' You 've got to get it done . ' "
About 30 tribe members live in trailers and small houses on the hilly compound outside Redding , Calif. , which is also home to 10 horses , dozens of dogs bred for sale , and a traditional bark house , which is used for puberty ceremonies .
A murky , frog - filled pond comes and goes depending on rainfall , and bits of obsidian , a volcanic glass , litter the dirt and gravel .
Big chunks of the glass also sit behind the meeting hut used by the tribe 's younger generation to practice making arrowheads .
" They 're not very good at it , " said Franco , who is married to Sisk - Franco .
As smoke from a manzanita log drifted out a hole in the ceiling , Sisk - Franco said the tribe and the salmon were intrinsically linked .
" What happened to the salmon happened to us , " she said .
" The fish have been diminishing in numbers , and so have we . "
The group had to scrape to raise the $ 60,000 for the trip by selling trinkets , soliciting help from richer tribes , and using a Facebook page .
Franco said he had made it clear to the delegation that the trip was not a vacation , but a mission .
" We have a job to do , " he said .
The tribe had hoped to ship their drum , but FedEx wanted $ 600 for that .
So they checked it in at the airport , along with several manzanita logs , a container of sacred water and a collection of ceremonial weapons , including spears and bows and arrows .
" I do n't think they will be too worried , " Franco said of airport security .
" All of that will be under the plane . "
The U.S. States Fish and Wildlife Service denied the tribe permission to take much of its ceremonial regalia -- including hawk , woodpecker and vulture feathers -- though its eagle headgear was approved .
" Win some , lose some , " Franco said .
Such battles are commonplace for the Winnemem , whose population once numbered more than 14,000 .
Their conflicts with the federal government date to 1852 , when Congress refused to ratify a treaty that would have given the tribe and more than a dozen other Indian groups a 35 - square - mile reservation along the McCloud .
Another insult came in 1985 , when the tribe lost its federal recognition from the Bureau of Indian Affairs , something Franco attributes to a clerical error as well as a change in bureau policy .
While the Winnemem hold on to tradition , they have not been shy about using more modern means .
The Francos regularly commute to Sacramento to lobby policy makers at the Capitol .
They also recently donned their regalia to protest a proposal by Feinstein that they felt would loosen restrictions from the Endangered Species
Act to allow more water for farmers south of the capital .
Last year , the tribe also sued the federal government for protection of a variety of sacred sites , and a copy of the lawsuit sits in the fire room where the tribe meets for religious ceremonies .
" We pray for our lawsuit all the time , " Sisk - Franco said .
The trip to New Zealand is not the first time the Winnemem have turned to ancient methods to try to change policy .
In 2004 , while fighting a proposed plan to raise the Shasta Dam 18 feet , the tribe staged a war dance , a four - day , round - the - clock ceremony carried out by their dwindling numbers of warriors .
" We were exhausted , " Franco said .
But in the end , the dam was not raised .
Once in New Zealand , the Winnemem plan to rendezvous with local Maori leaders and stage a four - day ceremony starting on March 28 that will culminate with the rare " nur chonas winyupus , " or middle water salmon dance .
The Francos say they intend to ask local fish and game officials if they can bring back some of New Zealand 's salmon eggs -- once of California stock -- back to the McCloud .
" We have to do more than pray , " Sisk - Franco said .
" We have to follow through . "
“ So far she ’s kept her cards hidden , which I think is smart , ” said Michael Stürmer , the chief correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt .
“ In principle , her tactic is to hold herself in reserve , hold Germany in reserve . ”

Even before Mr. Papandreou arrived in Berlin on Friday , the German economy minister , Rainer Brüderle , had a stark message for him .
“ The German government does not intend to give one cent , ” Mr. Brüderle told reporters here in the capital .
In an interviewpublished Friday in the German daily newspaper The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung before his visit , Mr. Papandreou aimed to calm public sentiment in Germany .
“ We have not asked the German taxpayers to rescue us , to pay for our retirements and vacations , ” Mr. Papandreou said .
“ We are not asking for money .
What we need is the support of the E.U. and our European partners so that we can receive credit from the market at better terms . ”
German news outlets have accused the Greeks of corruption , tax evasion and falsifying budget numbers to join the euro zone .
Greek politicians have asked for reparations for damages inflicted by Nazi occupiers during World War II .
Germany has the most fiscal flexibility among European Union members to help Greece , but public opposition to any assistance has been vehement .
The debate has crystallized broader German misgivings about the European project into a public outcry .
“ It ’s like a mosaic and the Greece crisis is the last stone , ” said Wolfgang Nowak , a former senior adviser to Mrs. Merkel ’s predecessor , Gerhard Schröder , and head of Deutsche Bank ’s International Forum .
“ More and more there is the feeling that French farmers , Polish farmers , Spanish infrastructure , that Europe is not a community but something held together by a German paycheck . ”
While protesters have not taken to the streets of Berlin in large numbers the way that they have in Athens , Mrs. Merkel faces rising dissatisfaction at home .
A new poll on Friday found nearly three - quarters of Germans critical of her government ’s performance since she was re-elected last September .
Geoff Livingston co-founded Zoetica to focus on cause - related work , and released an award - winning book on new media Now is Gone in 2007 .
According to ForeSee Results ' 2010 Social Media Study , YouTube is the second most powerful social network for consumer engagement .
This critical component of the social web remains vital for causes , associations and government organizations .
Non-profits have been engaging with YouTube for years , but it 's still important to have a specific online video strategy .
The following five tips can help organizations maximize their YouTube offering for the most impact .
1. Participate in YouTube 's Nonprofit Program
The YouTube Nonprofit Program provides for extra benefits like branding capabilities , increased uploading capacity , and call - to - action overlays .
Non-profits can use the call - to - action feature to drive sign - ups , donations , website traffic , and any other response in which users take action .
This feature was effectively used by the World Food Programme to raise $ 36,000 on World Food Day with this video .
" In a single weekend , it was viewed over half a million times and raised enough to feed over 140,000 children , " said Pierre Guillaume Wielezynski , Head of Web at the World Food Programme .
" We did this by creating a video that was compelling and [ put ] to use all the bells and whistles offered to non-profit partners :
A call - to - action overlay ad , annotations with an external link to a donation form , Google Checkout , as well as a branded channel that gained more than one compliment from visitors .
" While this dramatic weekend is one we 'll remember at WFP for a long while , the long - term results are interesting , " added Pierre .
" Since then , our video has helped to feed over 650,000 children and we 've drawn a steady crowd to our YouTube channel where we have more great content .
YouTube is an obvious place for us to share our videos — it 's become an outreach tool that is powerful , dynamic , and highly effective for raising both awareness and funds . "
2. Link to Your Cause with Video Annotations
Annotations can be used to add interactive commentary to videos , and for partners in the Nonprofit Program , they can be used to link to external sites .
Video communicators can select when and where annotations appear as embedded content .
Non-profits can embed multiple action items within a video as in the example above from Stillerstrong , or create " Choose - Your - Own Adventure " videos to further involve citizens in their cause , like this example that speaks out against knife crime in the UK .
" Fortunately , because Causecast is a non-profit partner with YouTube , we were able to do ' outbound annotations , ' which are annotations on the video that can bounce out of YouTube to the Stillerstrong / Causecast donation page , " said Brandon Buck , a Video Producer for Causecast .
" Causecast added links to the donation and Stillerstrong gear pages , and provided links for people to tweet about the Stillerstrong site , and post directly to their Facebook , allowing friends to watch the video directly on Facebook ’s news feed .
Causecast was able to quantify that more than 30 % of Stillerstrong.org 's traffic came from the videos directly and their posting on Facebook . "
3. Ca n't Make a Video ?
Find a Volunteer
If your non -profit does n't have the resources to create video , YouTube 's Video Volunteers program will help you find a skilled video - maker .
The effort highlights different specific issues , and the top three videos are featured on the YouTube homepage at the end of each month .
" We had a great video , courtesy of LisaNova , which showcased the ' New Roots ' community farm — a fantastic program we ’re running out of our San Diego office , " said Kate Sands Adams of the International Rescue Committee .
" We were able to get our supporters and Lisa ’s followers involved in trying to get us to the top .
" And whether or not the video made it into the top three volunteer videos on YouTube , the exposure was tremendous , " continued Kate .
" The ' New Roots ' video was viewed over 200,000 times on YouTube , generated thousands of comments and resulted in a marked increase in traffic , both to our website and to our YouTube channel .
It also introduced us to LisaNova ’s followers , on YouTube , on Twitter , and on other social networks –- all of whom could be potential volunteers and supporters for the IRC . "
For this month 's contest , One.org and YouTube are seeking videos to fight global poverty .
" I covered Anna Curran 's CrisisCamp in NYC because video journalism is my way of contributing to the cause , " said New York City - based changeblogger Nicole D'Alonzo .
" CrisisCamp NYC is a great way for Internet - savvy volunteers to aid disaster relief in Haiti .
My video promotes what Anna and her team are working on , and encourages others to get involved . "
4. Optimize for Search
It 's often easy to forget that search drives the social web in so many ways .
YouTube is no different , so savvy non-profits should leverage this .
There are several easy things to do :
Tag videos liberally , title well , and upload consistently to have a better chance of turning up in search results .
Another strategy is to capitalize on current events by uploading content related to terms users might be searching for .
Invisible Children did a great job of this last summer by publishing " Michael Jackson in Uganda , " a video highlighting a local student 's appreciation for the King of Pop .
Even better , a master SEO strategy could yield broad based search results on standard engines like Google , Yahoo and Bing .
" Right now , Google is very big on integrating YouTube videos , " said Jennifer Laycock , editor in chief of Search Engine Guide .
" Run a quick search for ' Michael Jackson ' ' Uganda Music ' or ' Michael Jackson Tribute ' and you 'll see YouTube videos being integrated into the first page of results .
" This gives companies a whole new way to gain a first page ranking for a term , " added Jennifer .
" That said , much like organic search , your videos need to be optimized for the terms you wish to reach .
Right now , the video is simply titled ' Michael Jackson in Uganda . '
The video does n't show up for the term Michael Jackson or Uganda in Google search .
I 'm willing to bet that if they retitled the video ' Michael Jackson Tribute from Uganda ' or something similar , they could trigger a Google inclusion . "
5. Use Measurement Tools to Optimize Performance
Like any online communications effort , measurement can lead to maximum optimization .
Non-profit communicators can find success with YouTube Insight , a version of Google Analytics for videos .
Find out audience demographics , video popularity , traffic sources , and how effectively overlays are performing .
In one incredible example , the White House 's social media department went so far as to publish its video analytics to the public web .
We asked online cause wizard Damien Basile to analyze the White House 's efforts .
" [ The ] YouTube analytics the White House has published openly can teach us all about paying attention to what your viewership demographics want and [ how to give ] them more of it , " said Basile .
" What could be dangerous is just paying attention to what people are watching and not how long they 're actually watching it .
The difference between what draws your audience in and what keeps them there is the difference between having a lot of first time or repeat customers .
" There 's no magic formula for getting it right , " he continued .
" The only way you 'll know you 're getting it right is if your analytics tell you over time .
In conferences people may vote with their feet , but online people vote with their mouse .
Be sure to pay attention to what they 're telling you . "

It was comedy when Pam Halpert mistakenly nursed another new mother ’s baby in a dark hospital room on The Office last night .
In real life , it ’s cause for a lawsuit .
Jennifer Spiegel , a Chicago mother , is suing Evanston Hospital after a nurse mistakenly brought in the wrong day - old baby boy at 4 a.m. back in 2008 .
As The Sun Times reported when the suit was filed last month :
… while no one was injured or sickened , the Chicago couple says the hospital should be held responsible for the mix - up .
They are seeking at least $ 30,000 in damages .
“ And we hope this does n’t happen to anyone else , ” said Jennifer Spiegel , a teacher .
Amy Ferguson , spokeswoman for NorthShore University HealthSystem , said the corporate office had not been notified of the lawsuit and had no comment .
Lawrence Gartner , the former head of pediatrics at the University of Chicago , said he suspects mix - ups like the one alleged here happen from time to time , though lawsuits are rare .
He said it would be unusual if it affected the mother - child bond .
“ In animals , they ’re often very specific — mothers will only accept their own babies , but I do n’t know that humans have any such characteristic , ” said Gartner , who works with the La Leche League , a worldwide breast - feeding support organization .
I know firsthand that Gartner is right ; the same mix - up happened to a friend and her newborn .
A flurry of blood tests followed , but both Moms and babies turned out to be healthy and no legal papers were filed ( even though my friend happens to be a lawyer ) .
On the Web site of The Boston Globe , the writer , editor and mother of five Lylah M. Alphonse ( who also blogs about parenting at The 36 - hour Day ) questioned whether such a mix - up was all that concerning .
“ Awkward ?
Sure .
Awful ?
Possibly , ” she says .
“ But worth suing over ?
I do n’t think so . ”
She reminds us that “ breast - feeding someone else ’s baby used to be considered fairly normal , ” though the wet nurses who did so were peasant women and slaves .
At least one movie star , Salma Hayek , has publicly nursed an infant who was not her own .
And in Michigan , Alphonse notes , a group of 25 mothers joined ranks last year to nurse an infant whose mother died minutes after he was born .
Alphonse is aware that “ the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discourage women from nursing other people ’s children , as does the La Leche League ” for fear of transmission of diseases like H.I.V. , syphilis and hepatitis .
Add to that the security lapse that such a baby mix - up reveals .
But even when baby and “ wet nurse ” are healthy , and the right baby goes home with the right mother , there is still the kind of “ ick ” factor that leads to lawsuits .
And that , Alphonse argues , says more about social rules than nutritional ones .
She writes :
There ’s little fuss over babies who are given breast milk that had been donated to a milk bank — even hospitals bank breast milk for premature or sick infants — which seems to indicate that the issue is n’t about milk vs. formula , but bottle vs. ( another mother ’s ) breast .
Is it the fact that our society still views breasts as sexual objects ?
Or is it about relationships — would it be more acceptable to nurse your niece or nephew instead of a stranger ’s child ?
Sorry , Dads , this one is for the female readers out there ( though feel free to weigh in , if you like ) :
Would you breast - feed someone else ’s baby ?
And , if I might add , have you ever nursed a child who was n’t yours ?
And how would you respond if you learned you had done so accidentally ?
THE creation of saints is " pure Monty Python " and the Family First senator Steve Fielding is more stupid than an earthworm , says the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins .
" I do find it very discouraging , " Dr Dawkins told the 2010 Global Atheist Convention in Melbourne yesterday when asked about the support of the media and the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , for Mary MacKillop , who is to become Australia 's first saint in a ceremony in Rome in October .
" The whole idea of creating saints is pure Monty Python , '' he said .
'' Why do they have to clock up two miracles ?
These are people we are supposed to take seriously . "
Dr Dawkins said he was often criticised for attacking easy targets such as Christian fundamentalists instead of serious theologians such as " Pope Nazi " , a presumed reference to Pope Benedict .
Record setting is something that always captures our attention , whether it be a new lightning quick 0 - 60 time or sales in the most recent quarter .
However , the record that we are alluding to is n’t that kind of record , but more of something you would find in the Guinness Book of World Records .
Even more unsuspecting is the car company that was apart of this new world record .
2011 Alfa Romeo Giulietta spy shots
here ) .
The U.S. return aside , Alfa Romeos are gorgeous cars and the company is about to mark its 100 year anniversary on June 24 , 2010 .
The birthday is the real source of the record setting situation for Alfa Romeo .
As reported by our partners over at MotorAuthority.com , the Allams Alfa Romeo dealer in Epson , UK wanted to celebrate this historic milestone by putting together an event that would make the Guinness Book of World Records .
The event — a parade of Alfa Romeo cars .
The number needed to set the record — 200 cars .
The thing about Alfa Romeo owners is that they are a loyal and proud bunch , so it is n’t a surprise that they set the record .
What is a surprise is that they beat the record by 112 cars .
Now that is impressive .

The first time I heard former Yippie activist Dana Beal mention ibogaine I couldnt have cared less what he was talking about .
I had booked him to speak on political theater and creative resistance … you know , Yippie shit …as one of a dozen speakers featured at an all day Green Party rally we held in Washington Square Park during the 2004 Republican National Convention .
Beal is a shady , self - promoting character with this Bilbo - Baggins - meets - David - Crosby vibe .
Instead of offering something useful to the crowd , he gave a rambling sermon on the miracles of this obscure drug that cured junkies of addiction .
Holding up a collection of papers no doubt meant to imbue his message with gravitas he ranted through a byzantine cosmology of all the evil forces that were arrayed against this miracle substance becoming a mainstream treatment .
I had no idea what ibogaine was nor that Beal was a member of the ibogaine underground ,  an ad - hoc network of doctors , researchers , activists , shamans and lay - providers who believe that this substance is the key to not only treating but unlocking an entirely new paradigm in the understanding of addiction .
This network is underground because ibogaine and the iboga root from which it is made are illegal in the U.S. , designated Schedule 1 with a high potential for abuse or addiction and no known medicinal applications .
Anyone in the underground will tell you that s patently ridiculous , patently ,  they say , because the real root of ibogaine prohibition is not that it causes addiction but that it might cure addiction , sometimes with a single dose , and that sure is bad news for an industry built around a so - called chronic disease .
The numbers are still small .
Of the 26 million estimated addicts in the United States , only a few thousand have tried ibogaine , and there are only a handful of active practitioners around the world who are giving treatments , so few that they all know each other .
But this underground is on the move , growing at a rate of some 30 % a year .
The reason for this is quite simple : The War on Drugs is over , and drugs won .
None of the medically sanctioned forms of addiction treatment have any success rate to speak of , particularly those for hard - core addictions to opiates , alcohol , cocaine and meth .
90 % of all those who enter treatment will use again within five years , and half go right back to active addiction within a year .
Worse , with the ever - increasing amount of drug - related arrests each year , what starts out as a fixable public health issue becomes a lifelong socio-legal handicap .
Ibogaine smashes through all of this orthodoxy .
Since its inception in the 1980s , the ibogaine underground has been building an alternative treatment infrastructure that completely redefines the approach to addiction .
Aside from the novelty , and irony , of a psychedelic drug containing a potentially single - dose cure for drug addiction , ibogaine therapy is also attractive because it redefines success not as abstinence but as a measurable improvement in an addicts quality of life , and this is because ibogaine is not about prohibition or substitution , its about spiritual evolution .
Like other plant medicines , if youll pardon the pun , iboga is about gettin at the roots of the sickness .
Consequently , it is leading a kind of awakening , and it will only be a matter of time before millions begin to seek it out .
Hitting the Reset Button
The story of ibogaine begins with addicts trying to help other addicts , but along the way we find it ’s also about the conflict between natural and Western medicine , and the moral bankruptcy of the pharmaceutical industry , who are interested in developing maintenance drugs , and not cures .
And like any tale of revolution , this story is about the internecine battles , personal perils , and professional pitfalls of trying to change the paradigm .
What sets this movement apart from others is the unanimity of purpose : everyone involved in the underground wants to heal .
Ibogaine works a mysterious voodoo that combines the spiritual and the biochemical .
More than anything else , it challenges the legitimacy of the disease model of addiction , and no one anywhere on the health care food chain wants to hear that , especially if they are profiting from the immiseration caused by drug abuse .
So what is ibogaine ?
The two - volume reference bible Psychedelic Medicine classifies ibogaine as a naturally occurring alkaloid of the Tabernanthe Iboga plant native to West Central Africa .
The iboga root bark contains a powerful psychedelic that has been used as a religious sacrament for centuries .
In the colonial era , iboga served as a vital instrument of psycho-spiritual resistance for the indigenous population against the encroachment of the white man .
Today iboga is used primarily by the Bwiti religion of Gabon in their initiatory rites of passage , like those described by Daniel Pinchbeck in Breaking Open the Head ( credit the Bwiti with the title , it ’s their term for what happens when one takes the drug ) .
During the ritual large amounts of iboga are consumed and the initiates are known to enter visionary states where they meet their deceased tribal elders — what they call  the work of the ancestors — and confront their shadow selves as a means of becoming aware of negative behavior patterns and character traits which cause illness and impede spiritual growth .
The person credited with introducing iboga to the U.S. is the Godfather of the movement , Howard Lotsof , a former heroin addict turned ibogaine evangelist who died last month of liver cancer at the age of 66 .
In 1962 Lotsof stumbled across ibogaines effectiveness with addiction when he found that after one dose he had lost his craving for heroin , and had miraculously leapfrogged the brutal and potentially fatal withdrawal process .
Lotsof tirelessly lobbied public officials and dogged researchers and pharmaceutical companies to investigate his claims about ibogas miraculous properties .
By the 1980s he was lay - administering the alkaloid ibogaine in capsule form to addicts in the Netherlands and was given a U.S. patent .
Lotsof felt ibogaines true significance was in unlocking the mysteries of the neurobiology of addiction .
By virtue of its origin he also believed it could serve as a means of reconnecting shamanic medicine to Western medicine .
Secretly , he and his inner circle harbored fantasies of a revolution in consciousness , and ibogaine was one of their most viable Trojan Horses .
Heres how the miracle works .
The conventional approach to treating opiate addiction is to employ a substitution therapy like methadone or suboxone , maintenance drugs that keep the addict addicted to a less potent , more manageable opiate analog .
This means that the only available treatment does not actually stop the addiction .
So whats the point ?
Ibogaine works , it is believed , by filling in the receptor sites that the opiate molecules once sought , ending the craving for the drug , while at the same time metabolizing in the liver into noribogaine , which is thought to have powerful detoxifying and anti-depressant properties .
The million dollar jackpot is that ibogaine can eliminate the exceedingly painful and dangerous opiate withdrawal process , sometimes in a single dose .
In effect , it has the power to hit the reset button on the brains neurotransmitter mechanism .
Ibogaine has never been popular as a recreational drug regardless of its legal status .
There is not a single recorded case of ibogaine addiction anywhere .
Those who use it do so infrequently , because , like ayahuasca or peyote , it takes a toll on the mind , body and spirit , never mind that most folks do n’t consider vomiting and diarrhea to be particularly social activities .
Only two iboga - related arrests are known to have occurred in the U.S. , and roughly twenty people are on record as having died within 72 hours of taking ibogaine , mostly due to either heart complications or drug contraindications .
This specific focus on the treatment of addiction is what distinguishes the ibogaine underground from other psychedelic subcultures , like the rapidly growing ayahuasca community .
Writing on the ibogaine medical subculture for the Journal of Ethno - Pharmacology , Alper and Lotsof describe the underground as , “ … homes , hotel rooms and private clinics in North America and Europe , [ where ] individuals in increasing numbers are taking ibogaine in what has been termed a vast uncontrolled experiment .
Because a safe and legal alternative is not available in the U.S , the ibogistas have been forced on to more tolerant legal climes in Canada , Mexico , Costa Rica , and Europe in order to avoid becoming de facto criminals .
For those who remain in the states as lay - providers , they role the dice every time they take an addicts life into their hands , but they feel , unequivocally , that the medicine is safe and the risk is worth it .
Alper and Lotsof claim that the ibogaine subculture is not a counterculture because its identity is not defined on the basis of opposition to conventional medicine  and it shares with the conventional medical culture the common goal of providing treatment , which it emulates in the medical model . 
This is partially true , and really more a matter of opinion .
To many , the ibogaine underground is very much a counterculture , and its hard to argue that it is not defined on the basis of its opposition to the disease model of addiction .
Additionally , the medical model they refer to –in which licensed physicians conduct treatments that usually take place in a hospital or clinic — is only one of five elements of the ibogaine underground that make up the full typology of the subculture .
These include evangelizing addicts and lay providers , activists , and ritual / spiritual shamans .
The Addict as Healer
Tijuana is a junkie that is hitting bottom .
Shes dying .
Strung out , desperate , unable to kick , her streets are empty and decaying , her shops are closed .
All across this sprawling border city of more than 1.5 million you see the shaky , splintered shells of abandoned developments .
It s as if everyone just up and vanished .
It s a ghost town , replete with a legion of narcotic zombies shuffling to and fro .
We talk about a drug war in the United States , but south of the border this war is real .
It s a shooting war that has decimated this once thriving city .
In the four years since Felipe Calderon became Mexicos President and sent in the Federales , over 16,000 people have been killed , 7,000 in the last year alone , 1400 of them in Tijuana where three different cartels battle for control .
Tourism and development have evaporated , and Tijuana starves .
The American model of fighting the drug war has failed miserably in Mexico .
As is usually the case , the arrest of several high - profile traffickers has done nothing to impact supply or demand .
The much - maligned $ 1.4 billion Merida Initiative , a kind of Mexican  Plan Columbia ,  has also been a dismal failure .
So Mexico got creative , and decided to try something new .
Despite much wailing and gnashing of teeth from politicians in Washington , the Mexican government finally decriminalized personal drug possession in August of 2009 ( four days later , Argentina did the same , releasing 150 million Latin Americans from the criminalization of their lifestyles ) .
This was done to shift law enforcement priorities away from the users to the cartels , which is good because business is booming .
The streets are filled with junkies shooting up in plain sight as you drive along the Segunda Benito Juarez border highway .
There is much poverty and suffering here , and no one should be surprised that people want to escape .
And if they cant escape across the border , all they have left is to escape into dreamland .
Yet it is here , in the dark center of Mexicos drug war , where a powerful ray of hope shines in the battle against addiction .
Tijuana is home to Pangea Biomedics , more commonly known to those in the underground as the  Ibogaine Association ,  one of only a handful of ibogaine treatment centers in the entire world .
Pangeas facilities are located in an enormous home inside a secure gated community that s situated in the Costacoronado hills high above La Playas de Tijuana .
Yeah , it s true , Tijuana is dangerous , and you cant take too many precautions these days .
But Pangeas owner Clare Wilkins swears theyve never felt anything but welcome and blessed in their relationship with their host city .
Born in South Africa and raised in Los Angeles , Clare first learned of ibogaine at age 30 .
She had been addicted to opiates since she was 15 , half her short life , and she was entering her eighth year on methadone .
Her sister Sarah , another former opiate addict who is now Pangeas chef and nutritionist , gave her a copy of  Tripping on Iboga ,  Daniel Pinchbecks 1999 Salon.com article .
It took Clare a few years to build up both the courage and the cash to afford the $ 3500 treatment fee , but in 2005 she eventually made her way down to Tijuana to the Ibogaine Association , which was then owned by a man named Martin Polanco .
Polanco was a fixture in the ibogaine underground for many years , particularly in Mexico .
He is credited with breaking open many heads , including Rocky Caravelli , the owner of the  Awakening in the Dream ibogaine therapy house in Puerto Vallarta .
Pinchbeck did his second journey with iboga at Polancos , where he met Randy Hencken of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( MAPS ) , who had just started overseeing a MAPS ibogaine program and would later collaborate with Polanco on a study , only to have things go terribly wrong .
MAPS tapped Valerie Mojieko to design the study and sent her down to undergo the treatment .
Unbeknownst to her , Polanco was developing a bad reputation for being a provider who gave poor - quality treatments .
Consequently , Mojieko had a very stressful and unpleasant experience , at one point believing she was having major heart complications .
Her bad trip was made worse by the language barrier of Polancos staff and , ironically , their lack of training in how to care for people having difficult psychedelic experiences , a major focus of Mojiekos work .
Shortly thereafter someone died while being treated by Polanco , and the clinic had to be shut down .
The MAPS study was dead in the water .
Around that same time Clare Wilkins came to Polanco for treatment and she had a similarly alienating experience .
Although as an addict she respond well to the medicine , she was unable to connect with either the setting or the treatment staff on hand .
None of them were addicts , and none of them had ever taken ibogaine .
 I was left completely alone when I did my treatment ,  Clare says , making sure I understand how un - kosher this is .
 I was the only person in the clinic at the time .
It was terrifying .
I didnt want to ever see another addict go through that if I could help it . 
Intending only to volunteer for Polanco in order to have at least one other addict present who knew what the patient was going through , Clare , who has no formal training in addiction , psychology , or medicine , ended up buying the Ibogaine Association from Polanco when he ran into trouble .
A chance meeting with MAPS founder Rick Doblin at the 2006 Burning Man festival led to a renewed relationship with the organization , and a new study .
Clare proved to be an autodidact , an honorary Ph.D in addiction like Howard Lotsof , but she also knew that if she really wanted to understand this medicine she needed to reach out to Lotsof in person , to pay her respects to the Godfather .
 I called and introduced myself to Howard when I bought the clinic .
He asked me for my C.V. which I didnt have , so I felt embarrassed .
But he understood .
He faced the same challenges in life , not having any formal training ( Lostoff had a degree in film from NYU ) .
He treated me like a colleague and told me that the underground was vital to the success of this medicine .
He was right .
Ive learned more from the underground than anyone else . 
In a span of less than four years Lotsof would become Clares friend , mentor , and spiritual father .
She loved his compassion and drive and the way he seemed to lack judgement , which she felt made him the perfect advocate for addicts .
She started booking treatments immediately , modeling her approach after Lotsofs and mostly learning on the fly .
Within six months she moved Pangea into a new space , and paid off the purchase to Polanco in only eighteen months .
To date she has given over 400 treatments .
They are not cheap .
A full 10 - day detox program runs about $ 7500 , not including travel .
The marked increase over Polancos fee reflects improvements Clare made in the treatment protocols in the wake of Valerie Mojiekos bad experience , and deaths at Polancos clinic and others within the underground , even at Pangea under Clare ’s supervision , which caused everyone in the ibogaine underground to take a good hard look at their own protocols .
As a result , many of them , including Clare , implemented more medical safeguards .
Pangeas comprehensive treatment is a complete holistic integrative health plan , and the price tag reflects the doctors , nurses , EMTs , massage therapists , and nutritionists she employs , a staff of twelve with monthly expenses of around $ 30,000 .
Ultimately , though , the medical staff are subordinate to Clare , who is the lead therapist and guide during sessions .
Unlike Polanco , who was often absent , Clare is present for every one of her clients sessions .
Clare is quick to point out that half of the 400 treatments she has given were either subsidized or free , which she says is common in the underground .
She also mentions that three of her former clients formed a not - for - profit called  The Healing Experience  that raises money to provide free treatments for those who cant afford them .
Lots of former addicts pay for treatments for others , or assist with sessions , she tells me .
It s part of their healing process .
 The only way this message is received is if its carried on the backs and in the hearts of addicts ,  she says with utter conviction .
 It only works if addicts help each other . 
Bringing it Home
It pains me to think about what my life might be like today had I only known Clare Wilkins ten years ago .
As my book , Exile Nation , chronicles , I spent nearly a dozen years in flagrante delicto with a brutal crack addiction , which I managed to kick the hard way shortly after 9/11 .
After two decades of abuse and recovery , I prided myself on knowing as much or more about addiction than any specialist , and the one thing I was clear on was that the existing methods of treatment left a lot to be desired .
I am deeply cynical about the medical establishments position on addiction .
I firmly believe , like Carl Jung did , that addiction is a spiritual sickness , and that it is not chronic , but can be cured .
One does not have to saddle oneself with the addict / alcoholic label for the rest of their lives .
It s a permanent , and unnecessary , handicap .
At the same time , however , I began to have some ambivalence about taking ibogaine .
Since I did not need detox , the technical term for the type of treatment I was going to take is called  Psycho - Spiritual . 
But lets be frank , I also knew that there was fifteen odd years of hairy addiction shit to cull through as well , and since I had heard iboga was a harsh taskmaster and didnt pull any punches , I was growing afraid of what I was going to have to face .
After nearly four months of trying to coordinate our schedules , Clare and I finally settle on the second week in February for me to travel to Tijuana ( of course , those who have taken iboga will tell you that the medicine makes itself available to you when the time is right , and not one minute before ) .
I was in Los Angeles preparing for the trip when we all got word that Howard Lotsof had died .
Clare was distraught and headed off to his funeral in New York and didnt know if shed be back in time for my visit .
I spent the week prior to the treatment on a strict diet of mostly fruits , greens , and nuts .
I had no alcohol , very little caffeine , and drank gallons of detox tea .
I crossed the border on the morning of February 8th with my close friend Kristin , a psychotherapist specializing in addiction and PTSD who works part - time at Pangea .
There was no traffic going into Mexico , and nearly a two - hour line cued up on the other side waiting to get out .
The night before at her place in San Diego , Kristin showed me Ibogaine : Rite of Passage , an eight - year - old film set in a Bwiti medicine ritual in Gabon , and at Polancos clinic in Tijuana , that featured Howard Lotsof and Randy Hencken .
Kristin takes great care to point out that Clares protocols are nothing like what I was seeing in the film .
 You re probably not going to take the medicine right away ,  Kristin tells me , youre just going to get your intake work done , and prepare your system .
You also need to acclimate to the setting .
When the moment is right , Clare will appear out of no where and tell you its time .
It could be days .
I went through a comprehensive intake that included a clinical history , complete blood and urine panels , cardiac enzymes , the whole enchilada .
I found out I was healthy as a pack mule , albeit slightly anemic .
Later that night I was given the most sublimely painful two - hour deep tissue detox massage by a Thai man named Neil who had worked with ibogaine for psycho-spiritual purposes and told me it helped him heal wounds stemming from his childhood in Thailand when he was abandoned by his family , and as a result , could not experience intimacy with anyone , including his wife and children .
 The med - cine keep working with you for many year ,  he said in broken English .
 It working when you not know it working , and den one day you say ,  Ah , now it make sense !
There were two other clients at the clinic , a 26 - year - old Orange County princess strung out on Oxys , and a poly - addicted guy in his early thirties from Detroit who was as magnificent a shit - talking addict as I have ever met .
When youve been an addict and spent your life around them , at home , in school , at work , in bed , you very quickly come to see whos serious about cleaning up and whos not .
I had strong doubts about both , particularly the kid from Detroit , about whom I would prove correct .
Both of them screamed I m enabled , what s your name ?!
Clare and her sister Sarah show up at the house a couple hours after I arrive .
They both stand just over five feet tall , and have no physical resemblance beyond that .
Bespectacled Clare resembles a hippie accountant , while ink - and - bleach Sarah is more skate punk .
They both project substantial presence .
Later that afternoon Chris Bava and his wife , Cat , stop by .
Both are artists and former clients who are renting a beautiful beach house just down the hill from Pangea .
Chris was a Category 5 poly - addicted mess , hooked on heroin , ketamine , crystal meth , and methadone .
He had done three years in a federal joint for a drug related offense , and was clean and sober for a number of years before falling back into addiction .
Clare had saved both of their lives through ibogaine therapy , and they now paid their respects , as many former clients did , by volunteering their time at the clinic .
 You cant really use me as an example , though ,  Chris says , waving me off .
 Im not an an ibogaine success story , it didnt work on me the first couple of times . 
Cat quibbles ,  After the second treatment he went on a ketamine rampage and we had to commit him .
That was when he was ready to quit , that third time .
And it worked .
Later the three of us are walking on the beach together while Jeff , another former addict who is part of a provider training program , is keeping an eye on the guy from Detroit , who is throwing balls to Chris and Cats dogs .
Jeff is making sure Detroit doesnt try to cop dope from someone on the beach or street .
The addicts who come to Pangea often need constant monitoring , like this guy .
Within a day he is caught with a smuggled set of works and it becomes apparent to the staff that he has broken into the med closet and stolen methadone and valium .
After hanging around for a week , on his parents dime , without undergoing the treatment , he eventually decides to leave , and Clare ends up having to drop him across the border .
Cat pulls up alongside me as we shuffle through the sand .
 I wasnt expecting anything when I took ibogaine ,  she says in a thick Aussie drawl , but I found it cured me of smoking , and nicotine was definitely my drug of choice .
I smoked for 35 years !
I expected to die of lung cancer .
I cant tell you how surprised I was not to crave a cigarette .
I was simply baffled . 
The next day I fast after gagging down a handful of supplements with a macrobiotic vegetable juice Sarah makes me , part of Pangeas neurotransmitter replacement therapy regimen .
The supplements are meant to prep the brain for the ibogaine , and most of the addicts coming in for treatment have depleted neurotransmitters and are suffering from various degrees of depression , chronic fatigue , liver issues , or viral infection .
In some cases patients have to be stabilized with benzodiazapines before they can undergo the treatment , hence the valium on site .
For the more benign cases , marijuana is provided for anyone who wants it , to combat anxiety , nausea , and depression .
It s also available because its considered medicine , and it ’s not illegal .
This small detail alone would be considered radical , and most likely dangerous , across the border , where just up the road in San Diego legal medical marijuana clinics are raided on a weekly basis .
To be honest , the weed makes for a nice vibe , and in a place like this — a trip factory , a healing center — vibe is everything .
The last step in the preparation procedure is for me to take it in the ass , literally , with a 48 oz coffee enema , what Clare calls a crappuccino . 
She takes me into the bathroom to explain to me how to do it properly .
 This significantly helps with absorption and detoxification .
You need to hold it in for 15 minutes .
That s optimal because the liver cycles out toxins every 5 minutes , so we need you to hold it in for three full cycles .
Just dont take it in too fast or youll get involuntary contractions and it will come back out even faster and well have a hell of a mess to clean up . 
We dont get around to beginning the procedure until nearly 10 pm .
While I settle into my bed , Joaquin the EMT hooks me up to a cardiac pulse / ox monitor and inserts an IV port into my arm in case of emergency .
Im given one last dose of aminos along with omeprazol and metoclopromide to combat nausea , and then Clare appears with the ibogaine .

Iran fired up its verbal sparring match with the United States over Afghanistan on Wednesday , as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived in Kabul and charged the US with playing a “ double game ” in the country .
The words echoed those of US Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who from the same podium at the presidential palace two days earlier accused Iran of “ playing a double game ” in Afghanistan by declaring support for the government while secretly assisting its Taliban enemies .
Mr. Ahmadinejad arrived just before Mr. Gates left Kabul , a fact that the US defense chief said was “ certainly fodder for all the conspiratorialists . ”
The Iranian president said the US - led military presence — which is set to surge to 100,000 troops by the end of the year — will not resolve any of the problems in Iran ’s eastern neighbor .
“ They are not successful in their fight against terrorists because they are playing a double game , ” said Ahmadinejad .
“ They themselves created terrorists , and now they say they are fighting them .
It ’s not possible ; we can see that .
Billions of dollars spent [ with ] casualties on both sides . ”
Ahmadinejad said that Iran ’s recent bloodless capture of the man at the top of its most wanted list should serve as an example .
On Feb. 23 , Iran stated that it had forced down the plane carrying Abdolmalek Rigi , the leader of the Jundallah ( Soldiers of God ) , whose Sunni militants were responsible for a host of attacks against Revolutionary Guard and civilian targets in eastern Iran .
“ Iran captured one terrorist , and did n’t kill anyone , ” the Iranian president said .
“ It ’s possible .
The fight against terrorism is not a military one ; it requires the work of intelligence . ”
Iran : No support for Taliban
Iran denies American claims that it is providing help to the Sunni Taliban , which in past years was a sworn enemy of Shiite - led Tehran .
Washington states that its military presence is protecting the Afghan government – not fostering more terrorism , or a Taliban resurgence .
Ahmadinejad highlighted numerous cases of US airstrikes killing civilians , a point raised repeatedly by Afghanistan ’s President Hamid Karzai as a key destabilizing factor recognized by US and NATO commanders .
In the most recent high - profile incident last month , America ’s top military commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , apologized directly to the Afghan people for the death of 27 civilians when their convoy was attacked by US special forces .
Ahmadinejad pledged “ continued ” support from Iran .
But piqued by its ongoing row with the US , Europe , and the UN Security Council over its nuclear program , Iran declined to take part in a conference on Afghanistan 's future in London in January .
Gates 's admonition to Afghanistan 's neighbors
Before departing the Afghan capital on Wednesday morning , Mr. Gates said he told Mr. Karzai that Kabul should be on good terms with all its neighbors .
“ But we also want all of Afghanistan ’s neighbors to play an up - front game dealing with the government of Afghanistan . ”
The Pentagon chief later visited a training ground for Afghan recruits run by US and British military forces .
The US plans to begin a withdrawal from Afghanistan in mid-2011 .
“ Although attention may be focused on operations in the south today , the training at this facility for the long term is even more important , ” Gates said .
“ At the end of the day , only Afghans will be able to provide long - term security for Afghanistan . ”
9/11 denial
American forces first toppled the Taliban government and their Al Qaeda allies led by Osama bin Laden in October and November 2001 , shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon .
The visit of Ahmadinejad comes just days after the Iranian president declared that event a “ big lie . ”
“ Sept. 11 was a big lie , and a pretext for the war on terror and a prelude to invading Afghanistan , ” Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying on Iranian state TV last weekend .
The attacks were a “ complicated intelligence scenario and act . ”
In the past , Ahmadinejad has inaccurately claimed that the US never published the names of the 2,750 people believed to have died in those attack .
He was denied a request by New York City authorities to visit Ground Zero in 2007 , during a meeting of the UN General Assembly .
He said then that the attacks were a result of “ inhumane managing of the world by the US . ”
On Wednesday in Kabul , Ahmadinejad questioned the US role in Afghanistan , without noting that it was the Sept. 11 attacks that prompted the US intervention in 2001 .
“ My question to Mr. Gates is , what is he doing here in this region ? ” said Ahmadinejad , according to a live translation on Iran ’s English - language channel PressTV .
“ His country is 12,000 kilometers away . ”
He complained that the US and other “ enemies of Iran and Afghanistan ” sought to block technical progress in Iran , from rocket launches into space to nuclear expertise .
“ They want to break down our countries , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ But I am certain that all of them will meet defeat . ”
Shortly after the fall of the Taliban , the Iranian government of then - President Mohammad Khatami played a key role in the creation of the postwar government that brought Karzai to power , and even offered to help train the new Afghan military alongside US forces , according to top US negotiators at the time .
The Bush administration rejected that training offer , but then complicated any future Iranian assistance by labeling the Islamic Republic part of an “ axis of evil ” with Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and North Korea in January 2002 .
For years , officials in Washington made clear that “ regime change ” in Iran was a policy goal .
Plenty of that bitterness remains , and Iran ’s strategic calculations have changed with the presence of so many US - led Western forces in Afghanistan to the east , and today , some 100,000 US troops in Iraq to the west .
“ We do not see the presence of foreign military forces in Afghanistan as a solution for peace in Afghanistan , ” Ahmadinejed said on Wednesday .

File photo of a young male elephant calf born at Sydney 's Taronga Zoo .
A baby elephant believed to have died during labour was born alive at an Australian zoo on Wednesday , amazing its keepers and defying expert opinion that such an outcome would take a " miracle " .
A baby elephant believed to have died during a nine - day labour was born alive at an Australian zoo on Wednesday , amazing its keepers and defying expert opinion that such an outcome would take a " miracle " .
Sydney 's Taronga Zoo said Monday that the calf had died in the womb after becoming trapped in a position from which they believed there was no chance of a successful birth .
But the male elephant was delivered showing signs of life early Wednesday morning and by afternoon was attempting to suckle from its mother and take tentative steps around its pen .
Zoo director Cameron Kerr said that advice from Berlin - based elephant reproduction expert Thomas Hildebrandt was that such an outcome after a protracted labour has never been seen before .
" He said the birth will completely re-write the elephant birth text books , " Kerr said .
On Monday , Hildebrandt told the media that an ultrasound and the failure to detect a heartbeat had led experts to believe the calf was dead .
" Should the calf be born alive , it would be a miracle , " he said at the time .
Experts now believe the calf survived the nine - day labour in a coma , and this could explain why they had thought the calf was dead .
" That unconscious state would explain the complete absence of any vital signs during all the checks and examinations we conducted during the labour , " said senior veterinarian Dr Larry Vogelnest
The zoo said the next 24 hours were critical in keeping the almost 100 kilogram ( 220 pound ) calf alive , particularly given that only 50 percent of first - time elephant mums have successful deliveries .
" Porntip is already showing signs of being an excellent mother , trying to help him suckle although he has n't quite managed to suckle yet , " Vogelnest said .
" She 's in good health and has been getting to know her calf , gently touching the young animal with her trunk . "
The zoo said other elephants in the herd were excited and curious about the new addition , reaching out to him with their trunks .
" The calf has already had some contact with the other elephants in the herd , touching trunks with the older females and also the zoo 's first calf , Luk Chai , an eight - month old male , " Vogelnest said .
Luk Chai , the first baby elephant ever born in Australia , was delivered at Taronga in July 2009 .
He was naturally conceived .
The new male calf is the second elephant conceived by artificial insemination in the country , after the birth of a female , Mali , at Melbourne Zoo in January .
Taronga 's Asian Elephants are part of a controversial programme to breed the endangered creatures which began after the animals arrived from Thailand in 2006 .
As few as 33,000 Asian elephants are thought to remain in Asia .
The zoo said they expected a lot of interest in the newborn after news of its death prompted an outpouring of sympathy letters and cards from the public .

The commercial real estate dilemma
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Luckily for banks , the commercial real estate time bomb just keeps on ticking .
Industry observers have issued dire warnings for more than a year , suggesting that lenders are on a collision course with potentially billions of dollars worth of commercial real estate losses .

Falling commercial real estate values could be another hurdle for banks as they try to navigate troubles in the market .
But for all the gloomy talk , the fallout has remained relatively well contained .
Banks have already recognized about $ 50 billion in losses , or about 60 % of the estimated cumulative losses , according to real estate research firm Foresight Analytics .
And despite a steep drop in the price of apartments , office buildings and industrial properties nationwide over the past year , there have been recent indicators to suggest that the market may have finally hit bottom .
After 13 months of consecutive declines , overall commercial property values climbed 1 % , according to the most recent monthly reading by Moody 's / REAL Commercial Property Price Index .
Even well - respected bankers have offered a glass half - full outlook on the state of the commercial real estate market .
" Commercial real estate is a train wreck , but it 's already happened , " JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) chief executive officer Jamie Dimon said during a company - sponsored conference last month .
But some commercial real estate industry experts have been quick to caution that the problems are n't over yet .
High - profile purchases that were made at the height of the real estate bubble have started to implode left and right .
Last month , owners of New York City 's Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper apartment complexes went into default .
Farther south , lenders that helped finance the Four Seasons Resort and Club just outside of Dallas are moving ever closer to foreclosing on the swanky 400 - acre property .
And with the nation 's unemployment rate still hovering at 10 % and consumer spending still at sickly levels , it stands to reason that borrowers that deal in retail stores and office buildings will feel even more squeezed before long .
" Businesses just are n't taking office space and consumers are n't buying things at retail stores , " said Mark Riedy , the executive director for the Burnham - Moores Center for Real Estate at the University of San Diego .
That 's a deadly prospect for the thousands of community and regional banks nationwide that hold roughly $ 860 billion in commercial mortgages and construction and development loans .
Georgia 's Synovus Financial ( SNV ) , Zions Bancorp ( ZION ) of Utah and Buffalo , N.Y. - based M&T Bank ( MTB ) are just a few banks whose loan portfolios are highly concentrated in commercial real estate , according to credit rating agency Standard & Poor's .
But trying to gauge the scope of those problems has proven difficult as banks have been slow to recognize losses on many of those loans .
That 's because many lenders have not seen the need to foreclose on a borrower that is still current on their payments even if they are upside down on their loan , or owing more than their property is worth , experts said .
At the encouragement of industry regulators , banks have extended the terms of many of their commercial real estate loans , hoping that property values or occupancy levels will improve before long .
" There is an element of ' extend and pretend ' going on , " said Tanya Azarchs , credit analyst and managing director for Standard & Poor's .
" It is in their [ banks ' ] interest to do that . "
Unfortunately , the consensus is that neither prices nor occupancy rates will improve anytime soon .
Estimates published last November by the Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers suggest that commercial real estate vacancies will continue to increase in 2010 , while prices could tumble further during the year .
Prices could fall as low as half their peak levels from 2007 .
If that happens , that would only darken borrowers ' hopes that banks will refinance their outstanding loans .
And some $ 1.4 trillion is commercial real estate debt is expected to come due over the next three years .
Matt Anderson , partner at Foresight Analytics , said that can mean only one thing for banks : more losses .
" When you combine that with [ property ] value declines , you have a big problem , " he said .

GAINESVILLE , Fla . --
With a stern look and some finger - pointing , Florida coach Urban Meyer had harsh words for a reporter following spring practice Wednesday .
Meyer , speaking for the first time in a week , confronted an Orlando Sentinel reporter and defended receiver Deonte Thompson .
It was unclear why Meyer took issue with the Sentinel 's story .
Reporter Jeremy Fowler quoted Thompson as referring to John Brantley as " a real quarterback , " in comparison to Tim Tebow .
The exchange was caught on video , captured by a photographer and witnessed by a dozen or more people -- including several fans leaving spring practice .
" You 'll be out of practice -- you understand that ? -- if you do that again , " Meyer told the reporter .
" I told you five years ago : Do n't mess with our players .
Do n't do it .
You did it .
You do it one more time and the Orlando Sentinel 's not welcome here ever again .
Is that clear ?
It 's yes or no . "
Meyer was reacting to a story posted on the Sentinel 's Web site following Monday 's practice .
Thompson was asked what the biggest difference was between Tebow and Brantley .
" You never know with Tim , " Thompson said .
" He can bolt .
You 'll think he 's running , but then he 'll just come up and pass it to you .
You just have to be ready at all times .
With Brantley , everything 's with rhythm , time .
Like , you know what I mean , a real quarterback . "
Thompson was embarrassed by the remark and the attention it got , mostly because he likes Tebow and never wanted to say anything negative about him .
For his part , Tebow said he was n't bothered by it .
" I do n't think Deonte meant anything by that , " Tebow said Thursday , according to the Palm Beach Post .
" He was just stating facts .
Brantley is a guy who throws on timing .
You know when the ball is coming and when it 's not . "
Meyer , who has praised Thompson for being a good student , a hard worker and a player who has not gotten into any trouble , eventually got word of Thompson 's distress and relayed his concern to school officials .
The school responded by canceling post - practice interviews Wednesday .
But as reporters were hanging around following the session , Meyer walked over to the group and began the exchange with Fowler .
" You 're a bad guy , man .
You 're a bad guy , " Meyer said .
" If that was my son , we 'd be going at it right now . "
Meyer turned and walked away , then met his daughter on the practice field and pointed back at the reporter .
He also avoided reporters by leaving through another exit .
Team spokesman Steve McClain declined comment .
The following video of Steve Jobs , shot during the 1996 filming of “ Triumph of the Nerds ” has been getting a lot of traction today in light of Apple ’s lawsuit against HTC for allegedly infringing on 20 of Apple ’s patents .
In the video below , Jobs references a quote from Picasso and states , “ Good artists copy , great artists steal .
And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas . ”
Meanwhile , in Apple ’s press release yesterday , Steve Jobs explained why Apple is suing HTC :
We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions , or we can do something about it .
We ’ve decided to do something about it .
We think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours .
So what ’s the verdict , folks ?
Is Jobs a hypocrite ?
One minute he ’s bragging about Apple ’s penchant for stealing ideas and now he ’s suing HTC for stealing Apple’s ?
Or are we totally missing the thrust of what Jobs is getting at ?
To figure that out , we ’ll first have to drill down and figure out what exactly Picasso was trying to say .
Many artists have interpreted Picasso ’s quote to mean that to copy a painting , for example , is to simply copy what you see without bringing your own perspective and original ideas to the table .
What stealing refers to , however , is when you copy the inspiration that fueled the development of the original , but also infuse your own perspective and take on things into an entirely new creation .
Meanwhile , an old MacObserver post from 1999 sums up Picasso ’s quote as used by Jobs thusly :
“ Picasso hardly meant that great artists steal popular designs whose original source is known to everyone .
What Picasso did mean was that great artists rummage through the great junk heap of lost , bypassed , and forgotten ideas to find the rare jewels , and then incorporate such languishing gems into their own personal artistic legacy . ”
In other words , when Picasso and Jobs use the word “ steal ” , are they really referring to a “ theft of concept “ as opposed to a theft of implementation ( i.e copying ) ?
Are we misconstruing the spirit of Jobs ’ statement in an overzealous effort to label him a hippocrite , or are we pulling semantic hairs in an attempt to defend him ?
We ’ll go ahead and assert that the way Jobs intended the word “ steal ” to be interpreted in the video above and in the recent Apple press release are completely different .
In the former , ‘ steal ’ seems to take on a more abstract definition , whereas in the latter , it seems to imply , you guessed it , flat out copying .
The following quote from Thomas Stephen is particularly insightful :
So , what do Picasso and T.S. Eliot mean ?
They say , in the briefest of terms : take old work to a new place .
Steal the Google site , strip down what works ( fast load , nonexistent graphics , small quirky changes that delight ) and use the parts on your own site .
Look at the curve of a Coke Bottle and create a beautiful landscape painting with it .
Take the hairline pinstriping on the side of somebody ’s car , reimagine it on your print job .
Find inspiration in the world you live in , where nothing is truly new so that everything has the potential to be innovative .
Love him or hate him , but Steve Jobs genuinely cares about creating products that can change the world , and the folks at Apple undoubtedly derive their inspiration from the world at large – a fact abundantly clear anytime you hear Jonathan Ive talk about Apple ’s design process .
From Jobs perspective , the same apparently ca n’t be said about HTC .
Have n’t you ever been curious of how aircraft food is cooked ?
Let ’s find it out while following a regular tomato from the time it gets inside a five - storied mechanized canteen cooking for flights taking off at the Moscow ’s Domodedovo International Airport till its death from the chef ’s knife .
This “ factory of on - board meals ” is an unusual and unique place – it ’s hard to imagine a kitchen where various culinary traditions from all over the world are mixed together .
Food is one of the key elements of an easy trip if you ’re going on a long flight .
But in a case when a flight is short a normal meal becomes a kind of amusement for a passenger .
Domodedovo mechanized canteen works with over 150 suppliers .
All of them are certified and checked carefully .
And this is a strict rule – one of the aircraft security specifics .
All these suppliers deliver their products through a special gate .
All fruit and vegetables are thoroughly cleaned in a three - level bath .
That ’s so called cascade washing .
After they are cleaned fruit and vegetables are dried , packed in special perforated container , marked and sent to the kitchen .
There in a huge culinary kingdom hundreds of hot dishes are boiled and stewed simultaneously , dainty salads and snacks are cut and served , thousands of aromatic buns and cakes are baked .
Girls are preparing frozen dishes .
Yellow rolls are not bananas , they are frozen pieces of potato mash .
Each staff member has a book with photos of ready dishes on their tables .
This is so called specification .
Here is all information on the future dish as a passenger should get it .
Everything is done strictly according to the instructions .
Staff works in sterilized working clothes and special disposable gloves .
Mass food production working not only for Russians but for foreign customers should be certified not only for Russian but for international standards .
The safety management system here is almost the same as for cooking for space flights .
This bright and motley kaleidoscope of food which seems to be a total mess is indeed thoroughly balanced and well though - out .
A big team of specialists involving economists , nutritionists , technologists and cooks worked hard to organize this process .
Here is the separate room specially for aircraft carts .
Every airline has its own kind of them .

New York ( CNN ) -- CNN 's Lou Dobbs stepped down from his controversial role as an advocacy anchor at the network at the end of his show Wednesday night , saying he plans to seek a more activist role .
" Over the past six months , it has become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country and affecting all of us , and some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem - solving as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible , " Dobbs said during his 7 p.m. broadcast .
Dobbs , 64 , said he had discussed the issue with CNN President Jonathan Klein , who had agreed to a release from his contract " that will enable me to pursue new opportunities . "
In a written statement , Klein called Dobbs " a valued founding member of the CNN family . "
" For decades , Lou fearlessly and tirelessly pursued some of the most important and complex stories of our time , often well ahead of the pack , " Klein said .
" All of us will miss his appetite for big ideas , the megawatt smile and larger - than - life presence he brought to our newsroom , and we 're grateful to have known and worked with him over the years .
" With characteristic forthrightness , Lou has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere .
We respect his decision and wish him , Debi [ Dobbs ' wife ] , and his family the very best . "
Dobbs , who is the last of the 29 - year - old network 's original anchors , said he was considering " a number of options and directions . "
He cited the growth of the middle class , the creation of jobs , health care , immigration policy , the environment , climate change and the U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as " the major issues of our time . "
But , he said , " Each of those issues is , in my opinion , informed by our capacity to demonstrate strong resilience of our now weakened capitalist economy and demonstrate the political will to overcome the lack of true representation in Washington , D.C. I believe these to be profoundly , critically important issues and I will continue to strive to deal honestly and straightforwardly with those issues in the future . "
Read Dobbs ' full statement about his departure from CNN
Those issues , he added , are defined in the public arena " by partisanship and ideology rather than by rigorous , empirical forethought , analysis and discussion , " and he vowed to work to change that .
In an e-mail to CNN staff members , Klein described the parting as " extremely amicable , " and said Dobbs ' replacement would be announced soon .
Dobbs was with Cable News Network from its initial broadcasts in 1980 , acting as chief economics correspondent and host of the business program " Moneyline . "
His coverage of the 1987 stock market crash won him the George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting .
That was one of many awards he received while at CNN , including an Emmy for Lifetime Achievement that he received from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2005 .
Dobbs left the network in 1999 to found SPACE.com , a Web site devoted to space - related subjects .
He returned to the network in 2001 as anchor and managing editor of CNN's Moneyline News Hour , which became Lou Dobbs Tonight .
He also acted as lead business news anchor for CNN / U.S. and CNNfn , the forerunner of CNNMoney .
During his second stint at CNN , Dobbs positioned himself as " tough , relentless , independent , " lashing out at what he described as the deficiencies and " partisan nonsense " of both major political parties , and injecting advocacy journalism into his coverage of topics ranging from free trade to immigration .
His no-holds - barred , sometimes acerbic style brought him a loyal following , but also attracted controversy both to him and to the network , especially over the subject of illegal immigrants .
Dobbs will continue as anchor of The Lou Dobbs Show , a daily radio show that began in March 2008 and is distributed to more than 160 stations nationwide by United Stations Radio Networks Inc .

We 've got to stop Wall Street from bringing us another economic disaster — before it happens .
Tell your U.S. Senators to crack down on Wall Street now .
A real financial reform package must include an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency , restoration of the Glass - Steagall Act , and strict new limits on the derivatives market .
To protect citizens from rapacious banks , we need a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to stop abusive mortgages and credit card terms , and other predatory financial schemes .
The Glass - Steagall Act , which separated commercial and investment banking , was enacted after the financial crash of 1929 , but it was repealed in 1999 .
It is crucial to preventing the reckless investing by commercial banks that caused some of the greatest financial disasters in U.S. history .
Rampant speculation in the unregulated derivatives market was a major factor in the collapse of the global financial system .
We need tough new restrictions on the derivatives market , or speculators will continue to imperil our country 's economic stability for short - term profit .
Tell your U.S. Senators today : support strong financial reform now !
GUI
Much like the mouse , it was Apple who first brought the concept of a graphical user interface to the mainstream when it introduced the Lisa computer in 1983 , soon followed by the Mac in 1984 .
In an interesting piece of Apple history , Apple was first turned onto the idea of a GUI when Steve Jobs and other Apple executives took a tour of Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center in 1979 .
Which arch rival did Apple sue in 1988 over the use of the GUI ?

Illinois Governor Pat Quinn is the latest Democrat to demand a tax increase , this week proposing to raise the state 's top marginal individual income tax rate to 4 % from 3 % .
He 'd better hope this works out better than it has for Maryland .
We reported in May that after passing a millionaire surtax nearly one - third of Maryland 's millionaires had gone missing , thus contributing to a decline in state revenues .
The politicians in Annapolis had said they 'd collect $ 106 million by raising its income tax rate on millionaire households to 6.25 % from 4.75 % .
In cities like Baltimore and Bethesda , which apply add - on income taxes , the top tax rate with the surcharge now reaches as high as 9.3 % — fifth highest in the nation .
Liberals said this was based on incomplete data and that rich Marylanders had n't fled the state .
Well , the state comptroller 's office now has the final tax return data for 2008 , the first year that the higher tax rates applied .
The number of millionaire tax returns fell sharply to 5,529 from 7,898 in 2007 , a 30 % tumble .
The taxes paid by rich filers fell by 22 % , and instead of their payments increasing by $ 106 million , they fell by some $ 257 million .
Yes , a big part of that decline results from the recession that eroded incomes , especially from capital gains .
But there is also little doubt that some rich people moved out or filed their taxes in other states with lower burdens .
One - in - eight millionaires who filed a Maryland tax return in 2007 filed no return in 2008 .
Some died , but the others presumably changed their state of residence .
( Hint to the class warfare crowd : A lot of rich people have two homes . )
A Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysis of federal tax return data on people who migrated from one state to another found that Maryland lost $ 1 billion of its net tax base in 2008 by residents moving to other states .
That 's income that 's now being taxed and is financing services in Virginia , South Carolina and elsewhere .
This show is about Ed Goodson a very old fashion guy who has a shotgun on the wall and wears fishing jackets living his life how he likes , until one day his youngest son moves in with him and a lot of funny stuff happens with Ed , his two sons and the older one 's wife .
No matter what the city says , Lori Mason insists the breast milk she supplied her cheese - making husband is more wholesome than anything on the shelves at Whole Foods .
Her milk is 100 percent organic , free range , and foie gras-fed , she told The Post .
“ I eat healthier than your average cow and I ’m not pumped full of steroids ! ” Mason said .
When Mason ’s husband , Daniel Angerer , blogged about making some of his wife ’s excess breast milk into cheese , customers at his restaurant , Klee Brasserie on Ninth Avenue in Chelsea , began demanding to have a taste .
But as The Post reported yesterday , even though expressed mother ’s - milk cheese is not against health codes , city officials strongly advised Angerer to desist .
The cheese could pose a potential health hazard , the officials said .
That did not stop diners eager to sample the human dairy from showing up at the restaurant yesterday .
“ We had some people who ordered the cheese plate and I had to tell them we do n’t serve the breast - milk cheese in the restaurant , ” maitre d’ Bari Musacchio said .
“ I told them if they wanted to try it , there is a recipe on the [ Klee Brasserie ]
Web site . ”
According to Liz Thorpe , a vice president of Murray ’s Cheese shops in Manhattan , who reviewed Angerer ’s cheese for The Post , they are n’t missing much .
“ It was slippery , slightly crunchy and tasted like pickles , ” she said .
“ I give it a thumbs down . ”
But breast - milk cheese is n’t just a matter of bad taste , it ’s potentially unsafe , city officials said .
“ It ’s not intended for adults , or for wide public consumption , ” a Health Department spokeswoman said .
Risks would “ depend on the health of the lactating woman , ” she said .
“ If the restaurant was found distributing the cheese in the establishment for public consumption , the Health Department could issue a violation . ”
Angerer said he has no intention of selling his wife ’s cheese in the restaurant , but he insisted it ’s actually a healthy food .
“ I tried it and I ’m still alive .
The baby eats it all day long and she ’s fine too , ” he said .
Even though they ’re barred from distributing it to customers , Mason said the couple may hold private tasting parties “ at our apartment or in the park in the spring with wine . ”
Mason , who has been propositioned by several creepy customers eager to sample her breast milk , offered one caveat .
“ We may need security to stop the weird fetish people from coming in . ”
The Health Department nixed the cheese - party idea , too .
“ He ca n’t do that either , ” the spokeswoman said .

Reality Reversals Continue : Scientists Now Propose That Ritalin Boosts Learning
Just in case you doubted the complete incompetence of medical scientists after the H1N1 swine flu scam , they are now claiming that the ADHD drug Ritalin boosts learning .
Oh yes , you heard right !
Ritalin , a drug that causes brain changes similar to cocaine is going to help people learn now .
Ritalin is the brand name for methylphenidate .
Although introduced way back in 1956 , experts still are n’t sure exactly how it works .
It is a stimulant .
Methylphenidate affects the way a patient ’s brain responds to impulses .
It can cause anorexia , heart palpitations , blood pressure / pulse changes , cardiac arrhythmia , anemia , psychosis , liver failure , brain inflammation , decreased white blood cell count among other effects .
However , according to scientists studying the drug , the risks just do n't exceed the learning benefits acquired by children who use the drug .
The scientists claimed their study showed that Ritalin boosts cognitive abilities by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine deep inside the brain .
Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers neurons use to communicate with each other .
They release the molecule , which then docks onto receptors of other neurons .
The scientists also state that Ritalin produces these effects by enhancing brain plasticity – strengthening communication between neurons where they meet at the synapse .
Of course the research is only leading to more invasive drugs that will further lobotomize our children .
" ... the finding could help in the development of better targeted drugs , with fewer side effects , to increase focus and learning , " said Antonello Bonci , MD , principal investigator at the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and professor of neurology at UCSF .
The Gallo Center is affiliated with the UCSF Department of Neurology .
Bonci is co-senior author of the paper , which was published online in " Nature Neuroscience " on Sunday , March 7 , 2010 .
" We found that a dopamine receptor , known as the D2 receptor , controls the ability to stay focused on a task ... " said Patricia Janak , PhD , co-senior author on the paper .
" But we also discovered that another dopamine receptor , D1 , underlies learning efficiency . "
What Bonci and his colleagues fail to highlight is that ALL past research regarding learning efficiency and focus involving Ritalin and dopamine receptors is short term .
High levels of dopamine in the brain cause children to lose contact with reality .
It is not a drug to give a child in the short - term or long - term because of its destructive nature on the brain .
The short - term effects of Ritalin are increased attentiveness and energy , faster heartbeat and breathing , high blood pressure , perspiration , dilated pupils and dry mouth .
Users typically feel more talkative , restless and excited .
They also tend to feel powerful , superior , aggressive , and even hostile at times .
They can exhibit bizarre and repetitive behavior .
Long - term use produces flushing , tremors and hallucinations .
Death can be caused due to burst blood vessels , heart failure and fever .
Violence is a leading cause of amphetamine - related deaths .
Violent tendencies can develop after even regular use .
Long - term effects for chronic heavy users are malnutrition and amphetamine psychosis , a mental illness characterized by hallucinations , delusions , and / or paranoia .
Is that worth a boost in learning and focus ?
The lead author of the paper Kay M. Tye , PhD , admits they do n't have a clue which changes in the brain 's mechanism are caused by using the drug .
" Although Ritalin is so frequently prescribed , it induces many brain changes , making it difficult to identify which of those changes improve learning . " she said .
Children are dying at unprecedented rates from drugs like Ritalain .
An excellent documentary Generation Rx , details the disturbing and ongoing chemical abuse of children by conventional medicine .
The prescription of psychiatric drugs to the masses , specifically children , are altering their minds , bodies and entire lives .
The only objective of studies such Bonci's is to develop more lethal versions of methylphenidates which will further intoxicate young minds and disable them as they age , causing additional symptoms that be can be treated with additional drugs .
It 's not about helping kids , it 's about destroying their lives .
Marco Torres is a research specialist , writer and consumer advocate for healthy lifestyles .
He holds degrees in Public Health and Environmental Science and is a professional speaker on topics such as disease prevention , environmental toxins and health policy .

Abnormalities in how the nucleus accumbens , highlighted here , processes dopamine have been found in individuals with psychopathic traits and may be linked to violent , criminal behavior .
Credit : Gregory R.Samanez - Larkin and Joshua W. Buckholtz
The brains of psychopaths appear to be wired to keep seeking a reward at any cost , new research from Vanderbilt University finds .
The research uncovers the role of the brain 's reward system in psychopathy and opens a new area of study for understanding what drives these individuals .
" This study underscores the importance of neurological research as it relates to behavior , " Dr. Francis S. Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health , said .
" The findings may help us find new ways to intervene before a personality trait becomes antisocial behavior . "
The results were published March 14 , 2010 , in Nature Neuroscience .
" Psychopaths are often thought of as cold - blooded criminals who take what they want without thinking about consequences , " Joshua Buckholtz , a graduate student in the Department of Psychology and lead author of the new study , said .
" We found that a hyper - reactive dopamine reward system may be the foundation for some of the most problematic behaviors associated with psychopathy , such as violent crime , recidivism and substance abuse . "
Previous research on psychopathy has focused on what these individuals lack — fear , empathy and interpersonal skills .
The new research , however , examines what they have in abundance — impulsivity , heightened attraction to rewards and risk taking .
Importantly , it is these latter traits that are most closely linked with the violent and criminal aspects of psychopathy .
" There has been a long tradition of research on psychopathy that has focused on the lack of sensitivity to punishment and a lack of fear , but those traits are not particularly good predictors of violence or criminal behavior , " David Zald , associate professor of psychology and of psychiatry and co-author of the study , said .
" Our data is suggesting that something might be happening on the other side of things .
These individuals appear to have such a strong draw to reward — to the carrot — that it overwhelms the sense of risk or concern about the stick . "
To examine the relationship between dopamine and psychopathy , the researchers used positron emission tomography , or PET , imaging of the brain to measure dopamine release , in concert with a functional magnetic imaging , or fMRI , probe of the brain 's reward system .
" The really striking thing is with these two very different techniques we saw a very similar pattern — both were heightened in individuals with psychopathic traits , " Zald said .
Study volunteers were given a personality test to determine their level of psychopathic traits .
These traits exist on a spectrum , with violent criminals falling at the extreme end of the spectrum .
However , a normally functioning person can also have the traits , which include manipulativeness , egocentricity , aggression and risk taking .
In the first portion of the experiment , the researchers gave the volunteers a dose of amphetamine , or speed , and then scanned their brains using PET to view dopamine release in response to the stimulant .
Substance abuse has been shown in the past to be associated with alterations in dopamine responses .
Psychopathy is strongly associated with substance abuse .
" Our hypothesis was that psychopathic traits are also linked to dysfunction in dopamine reward circuitry , " Buckholtz said .
" Consistent with what we thought , we found people with high levels of psychopathic traits had almost four times the amount of dopamine released in response to amphetamine . "
In the second portion of the experiment , the research subjects were told they would receive a monetary reward for completing a simple task .
Their brains were scanned with fMRI while they were performing the task .
The researchers found in those individuals with elevated psychopathic traits the dopamine reward area of the brain , the nucleus accumbens , was much more active while they were anticipating the monetary reward than in the other volunteers .
" It may be that because of these exaggerated dopamine responses , once they focus on the chance to get a reward , psychopaths are unable to alter their attention until they get what they 're after , " Buckholtz said .
Added Zald , " It 's not just that they do n't appreciate the potential threat , but that the anticipation or motivation for reward overwhelms those concerns . "

Fun is a promising word .
IMHO I felt the problem with the reboot is it lost the element that made the first two films so successful .
They were fun !
I do n't think the Superman franchise will ever be Batman or Iron Man.
Superman is best as a light - hearted adventure .
In the first film , Luthor was not a bitter schemer as in Singer 's reboot but really played as a complete buffoon with an absurdly delicious plan to sink California .
And while Superman II was a little darker , it still focused on adventure and humor .
The last film had none of that .
The next step is to hire the right director .
It should n't be someone looking to make their name by creating something new and edgy .
You need an experienced hand at the helm to effectively pull this off .
I 'd give my suggestion , but I 'm sure people would think I was nuts .

As my regular readers know , I am a zealous Haskell advocate .
After many years of programming in many different languages , Haskell has secured itself as my # 1 language for almost every problem : using any other is like painting with a mop — like playing tetris without being able to rotate your pieces .
Nonetheless , Haskell has some unsightly areas , especially when considering programming in the large .
The more I use Haskell to tackle big problems , the more obnoxious they become .
This post is my account of Haskell ’s Big Three annoyances .
Contrary to my usual shtick about cutting out features because fewer features means more properties , these are missing features .
The order in which I list them is meaningless .
1. No Module Abstraction
Some of the code I am writing for Evo ( purely functional RTS game ) , if stated in full generality , would look like this :
gameUI :: ( RealFrac time , Image image , Causal causal ) => UI time image causal ( ) ()
The first three parameters are constant throughout my entire program .
I ca n’t in my right mind make a data type with 5 type parameters , and I certainly refuse to write those same three constraints on every function involving UI .
So , sacrificing generality , I have fixed those three parameters to the particular choices I need for Evo .
But suppose this module were to be reused — by fixing my choice of , eg. , image to Graphics .
DrawingCombinators .
Image , I have disallowed the reuse of this module by any program that uses another library for drawing .
But I stand by my aesthetic choice , so that I do n’t obscure my code ’s inner beauty behind repulsive , indecipherable type signatures .
Haskell needs some form of abstraction over modules .
ML functors , Agda modules ( aka. awesome records ) , Coq sections — any way to abstract over more than one definition .
This would allow module authors to make their code clean and reusable at the same time .
2. Module Naming Policy
Hackage is a mess .
I cringe looking at vector - space , taking up 9 valuable top - level names ( “ Data . ” does n’t count , everybody uses that ) , preventing anyone else from naming a module or module suite named Data .
Cross or Data .
Derivative ( the latter I actually have a candidate for ) .
data - object for JSON objects , as if nothing else could concievably be called an object .
transformers and mtl both have a module named Control .
Monad .
Trans , preventing both versions from being used from the same package ( suppose this package depends on two other packages , each of which depending on a different monad library ) .
The quick fix , what every other language has done , is to institute a policy or culture of naming conventions that makes the probability of collision low .
I feel like Hackage is nearing its limit — the ad - hoc Data .
Blah naming conventions wo n’t last through another order of magnitude .
If we encouraged people to name packages more conservatively , we may last through one or two more .
But a naming convention is just delaying the inevitable , giving us a false sense of security .
What happens when a package is forked , two packages come to depend on two different branches of this package which forgot to rename itself , and a third package wants to depend on both of those ?
We need something innovative , and in Haskell ’s spirit !
Let ’s allow the flexibility in package names that we allow in symbol names from imports now — if there is a name collision , just rename one of them for the scope of your package .
No big deal .
Let module authors name their modules whatever they think is clearest — go ahead , name your module Monad , we do n’t care .
Right now , a name like that would be a death sentence for that module due to impoliteness .
3. Unrefactorable Typeclasses
The Haskell prelude is a very nice place , in general ( what , you have n’t read it ?
Go , it ’s a nice read ! ) .
However there is one cesspool of which every experienced Haskeller is ashamed : the Num class .
Let ’s look :
class ( Eq a , Show a ) =>
Num a where (+ ) , ( -) , (* ) :: a -> a -> a negate :: a -> a abs , signum :: a -> a fromInteger :: Integer -> a
(+) and ( -) almost surely belong , as does from Integer ( supposing you do n’t allow more flexibility with numeric literals a la IsString ) . ( *) might be considered reasonable , though we have just disallowed vectors as instances of Num .
abs and signum … well I guess as long as you ’re putting in ( * ) those make sense .
But the superclasses Eq and Show , especially Show , what ?
What about being a number involves being convertible to a string ?
Eq and Show both disallow computable reals from being a bona fide instance of Num , they have to cheat .
Same goes for notational extensions like f
Int where f is any applicative functor .
The Num class is pretty bad , but I excuse the Haskell designers for making that mistake .
Library design is hard , especially when you have never used the langauge you are designing the library for .
The weakness in Haskell is much deeper : we are stuck with this cruft because any attempt to change it would break all sorts of code everywhere .
Num is n’t the only class affected , it is just the most public example .
Any module which defines a typeclass and allows users to instantiate it suffers from this problem .
As soon as the typeclass is defined , it may no longer change .
You are stuck with that decision forever , or else you break backwards compatibility .
Ultimately what we would like to do is split Num up into algebraic structures like Group ( with (+ ) , ( - ) ) , Ring ( with ( * ) ) , etc .
There is a simple , conservative proposal that could solve this problem , which essentially would allow us to say :
class alias Num a = ( Eq a , Show a , Field a , IsInteger a )
Which would allow all four of those typeclasses to be instantiated in one go , thus treating the collection of four as one , and allowing us to introduce finer granularity in the Num typeclass without breaking everything .
GHC has implemented all kinds of crazy extensions , and this seems tame in comparison .
I wonder what is preventing it .
( Maybe I should get into some GHC hacking ? )
I have identified further typeclass modularity problems could be solved by a more radical suggestion : outlaw orphan instances .
But that fight is for another day .
Conclusion
I consider Haskell to be by a wide margin the prettiest practical language in existence .
Haskell code in the small is often perfect to my eyes , “ from the book ” as Erdös would say .
Each of these suggestions is about improving Haskell code in the large .
They allow the incremental creation of a perfect module , a perfect package , a perfect typeclass .
We are closer than we think to a language in which an entire program could be considered perfect .
I wrote this article to emphasize these features , open them to active discussion and critique , and entice their implementation .
What do you think , are they worth the effort ?
The following blog post , unless otherwise noted , was written by a member of Gamasutras community .
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company .
Game balancing and tuning are some of the most difficult parts of game design .
Thankfully ( for me anyway ) , they are also some of the most enjoyable and rewarding parts .
That 's because a great game is made in the balancing and tuning .
Bad tuning will wreck any great design .
That 's power !
I consistently rely on 3 rules to help me navigate the minefields .
All three of these rules are a bit sneaky in context of the article title .
That 's because they are not so much rules to balance by as rules to design the systems in the first place .
After all , the best way to help yourself balance is to avoid designing systems that are virtually unbalanceable !
Rule 1 : Systems Should be as Simple as Possible to Satisfy Design Goals
I am a big fan of complexity .
Some of my favorite games of all time have very complex relationships , and I love playing grognard - style wargames on and off the computer .
As a designer , though , complexity is The Enemy !
Ok , perhaps that 's not entirely fair .
But in my experience , a central tenet of successful systems design is to only add as much complexity as necessary .
Of course , " as necessary " is a broad term , and that 's intentional .
The rule is not " never design complex systems . "
Sometimes complex systems are just what the doctor ordered .
However , a lot of times , a simple approach gets the job done -- that is , satisifies your design intent .
When intially designing systems , it 's pretty easy to add in many different layers and mechanics .
It has n't really cost you anything yet , and often you are guessing about gameplay features and mechanics that you might need later in development .
Down the line , though ( during balancing ) , having unduly complex systems in place tend to have differential orders of magnitude effects on tuning complexity .
One way to save yourself some considerable pain is to be militant about keeping things as simple as possible early on .
The old adage " K.I.S.S. " ( Keep it Simple , Stupid ! ) is as true in game design as anything else .
I find a layered approach generally works best : implement your core mechanics , then playtest .
If you find you need another " layer " of mechanics , add that , then playtest .
Repeat until the game is fun .
Sometimes , there is no way around having considerable complexity .
In those cases , Rules 2 and 3 can help slant the playing field in your favor .
Rule 2 : Sytems Should have as Few Independent Dials as Possible
Tuneable game mechanics can be conceptualized as a dial .
Sword damage not powerful enough ?
Twist the dial right to boost it up .
Treasure rewards too rich ?
Twist the dial left to drop them down .
The more tuneable mechanics you have in your game , the more dials you have to monitor and adjust .
Dials can be categorized into two classes : independent and dependent .
For you math and engineery - types , this is the same as independent and dependent variables .
Independent dials : these are mechanics that are not directly affected by changes in othe rmechanics .
For example , the amount of XP awarded for killing a Sewer Rats ( your game * does * have Sewer Rats , right ? ) is not changed if I tune how much damage a sword hit does .
XP Dial -> determines that Sewer Rats = 50 XP
Change in Sword Damage dial -> does not affect Sewer Rats XP .
Nor does anything else .
Dependent dials : these are mechanics that can be directly affected by changes in other mechanics / dials .
For example , if I specify final jump height as a % of Running Speed , then I have created a dependent dial .
Changing the Running Speed will in essence change the Jump Height .
There is no way to absolutely and independently set jump height .
For example :
Jump Height dial -> specifies jump height as a % of running speed ( e.g. 50 % )
Change in Jump Height dial -> changes final jump height
Change in Running Speed dial -> changes final jump height
Thus , adjusting jump height can be done in more than one way .
There is no way to set jump height in a way that is guaranteed not to be affected by something else .
Another example would be specifying " RAGE " damage as an amplification bonus to the current weapon damage .
Change in RAGE dial -> changes final RAGE damage
Change in Current Weapon Damage -> changes final RAGE damage
There is no way to set RAGE damage absolutely and independently
Dependent dials are a GOOD THING , as Martha would say .
Think of your game systems .
Do you want them to look like a 747 cockpit ?
With a zillion different dials and buttons and switches , all of which must be monitored and any one of which could sink the whole plane if toggled at the wrong time ?
Ideally , no .
You want as few dials as possible , so you can carefully and rigorously monitor them and tweak them to your heart 's content .
Less students in the class means more attention per student .
The advantage of dependent dials is that they save you from having to always change every dial .
Want to increase Jump Height and also want to increase Running Speed ?
Turns out you can just change the Running Speed dial and get both things accomplished .
However , you still have control of just jumping if you need to adjust it without affecting running speed .
But often you will want to do both at once , so twisting only one dial saves some time and is easier to remember .
In practice , you want to be adjusting depenedent dials directly only about 1 / 2 or 1/ 4 as much as you are adjusting independent dials .
Those savings add up over time !
Once you find the right relationship between Rage amplification and core weapon damage , you leave that dial set and just tweak core weapon damage to match the other game mechanics .
This analogy still holds up with our 747 visual model .
If you examine a cockpit like that carefully , you will see that often there are dials / switches that are linked ( mechanically or at least visually ) .
Most of the time , all four engine throttles should be moved together , so there is a hard link that facilitates that .
The pilots can decouple the controls if necessary ( and sometimes it is ) , but most of the time one linked adjustment is sufficient .
Sound Engineer panels scare the living bejeezus out of me .
Talk about a lot of dials !
But ever notice that hard linkages exist between many of the sliders ?
Once the engineer gets the relative relationships correct , she can link them and then just push one single slider to get all 27 to move at the same time .
As with Rule 1 , I am not suggesting " do n't add independent dials . "
Just only put in as many as you need .
" You 'll know it when you need it . "
Rule 3 : Relationships ( Links ) Between the Dials Should be as Straightforward as Possible
When you have linked dials , there are a lot of ways you can link them .
Here , the mechanical analogy starts to break down a bit , but essentially you can link dials with all sorts of different ways : hard links , springs , rubber bands , etc .
When you twist this dial 2 notches to the right , what happens to the dependent dial ?
Does it twist 2 notches right as well , or 1 notch , or 5 notches to the left ?
In other words , if two mechanics are related , * how * are they related ?
Here again , simplicity is key .
Unless you have a compelling reason , make it simple and straightforward .
In rough order of simplicity :
Rigid link : changing the independent dial results in exactly the same amount of change to the dependent dial
Linear link : changing the independent dial results in a proportional change in the dependent dial , but the proportionality is n't a direct 1 - for - 1 link
Nonlinear link : changing the independent dials can result in variable changes to the dependent dial .
For example , changing the independent dial from 1 - 2 may result in a change of 5 in the dependent dial , but changing the independent dial from 2 - 3 may result in a change of only 3 .
Rigid link example :
RAGE damage = weapon damage + 5
Changing weapon damage by + 2 points results in a RAGE damage increase of + 2 pts
Linear link example :
RAGE damage = weapon damage * 1.50
Changing weapon damage by +10 % results in a change to RAGE damage of +10 %
Non-linear link example :
RAGE damage = weapon damage * 1.50 BUT there is a minimum of 5 pts of damage and a max cap at 100 pts
Changing weapon damage MIGHT increase Rage damage , but it also might not !
( if the damage is already capped )
Weird Mental Models
Your mileage may vary , but the control panel conceptual model resonates with me .
And the constant strive to attain simplicity and eloquency is one that almost always pays off .
In reality , I sometimes throw in way too many dials , and violate the rules from time to time .
But I typically regret it , and when I am chin deep in balancing dials , less is usually more .

Guerrilla gardeners in Glasgow have been liberating derelict and barren land in the city and turning it into gardens .
BBC Scotland takes a look at the history of movement .
The Bowery Garden circa 1973
Guerrilla gardeners wage urban campaign
The roots of guerrilla gardening can be traced back to New York in 1973 .
Artist Liz Christy , who lived in the city 's Lower East Side , assembled her friends and neighbours to clean out and take back an abandoned lot on the corner of Bowery and Houston .
Dubbing themselves the Green Guerrillas they removed the rubbish and revitalised the soil , planting flowers , trees and edibles , while offering gardening workshops .
Liz Christy took to petitioning the city 's Housing and Preservation Department to make their newly - created garden - which they called the Bowery Garden - an official community garden .
To this day it remains , taken care of by the Green Guerrillas and volunteers .
It is now recognised by the city as an established community garden .
The history of illicit gardening in Britain goes back centuries , starting with " the Diggers " - a 17th Century group who fought for the right to cultivate land .
How the Bowery Garden looks today Some say that the origins of guerrilla gardening in the modern age can be traced back to the hippie movement in the 1960s .
More recently , a statue of Winston Churchill was given an impromptu grass mohawk during the May Day riots in London in 2000 .
But it was not until Richard Reynolds decided to create a blog about his " illicit cultivations around London " in 2004 that it started to become a community in the UK .
In 2008 Mr Reynolds cemented his status as the de facto figurehead of the guerrilla gardening movement by writing a book titled On Guerrilla Gardening .
Not a manifesto as such , it gives a detailed history of guerrilla gardening as well as stories he has picked up on his travels visiting other guerrilla gardeners around the world .
Unconventional weapons
The movement has spread its seeds far and wide , with " cells " existing in places as far flung as Australia and Brazil .
Indeed , any country that has a community of obsessive gardeners is likely to have an underground community of guerrillas , taking back public space .
The " seed bomb " is one of the more unconventional weapons they use , alongside the more traditional watering cans , shovels , trowels , pitchforks , plants and seeds .
The seed bomb of 1973 was known as the " green grenade " Primarily aimed to be used in areas where guerrilla gardeners are unable to cultivate land by themselves - be it through fear of reprisal for hanging around one place too long or in a place where they simply cannot reach - the seed bomb contains all the vital elements for plant life to begin .
The current seed bomb is a far cry from the green grenades that were used when the movement began in 1973 .
Back then , they contained water , peat moss , fertilizer and seeds encased in Christmas decorations and water balloons .
Nowadays there is more than one design and they are more environmentally conscious , using peat - free compost and organic fertilisers .
The most common type of seed bomb is the clay seed ball .
These can be created at home using a mixture of clay soil , compost , seeds and water and can be moulded into any shape .
As times change so does the sophistication of the weaponry , and the latest innovation in seed bomb design has come from Glasgow - based studio Kabloom .
THE MODERN SEED BOMB
Contains peat moss , organic fertilizer and seeds Contents held in a biodegradable grenade shaped shell Unlike the green grenades , they use rain water to grow These new , more environmentally - friendly " SeedBoms " were created by Darren Wilson , who became involved in the Glasgow guerrilla gardening movement after finding out about it during research for the product .
He created his own grenade - shaped version which is made using recycled materials alongside the ingredients needed to grow the flowers .
" It 's a bit fun , a bit quirky - a bit different .
It 's all about the fun , all about the interaction and making an impact ... anyone can use these , " he said .
Darren has gone on to become an integral part of the guerrilla gardening cell in Glasgow , alongside founders Jennifer Calder and Michael Gallacher .
While the actions of guerrilla gardeners are technically illegal , as they are transforming land which does not belong to them , the Glasgow group has won the endorsement of the local city council .
The head of the local authority 's land and environmental services division , Stevie Scott , has given encouragement to the movement .
The council cannot afford to revitalise every bit of barren space in Glasgow , but is happy to support the guerrilla gardeners in their efforts to bring more colour back to the " dear green place " .

The individual health insurance market is not a viable option for the majority of uninsured adults , a new report from The Commonwealth Fund finds .
Seventy - three percent of people who tried to buy insurance on their own in the last three years did not purchase a policy , primarily because premiums were too high .
In addition , among adults with individual coverage or who tried to buy coverage in the past three years , 57 percent said it was very difficult or impossible to find coverage they could afford , 47 percent said it was very difficult or impossible to find a plan with the coverage they needed , and 36 percent were denied coverage or charged more because of a pre-existing condition , or had the condition excluded from their coverage .
The report , Failure to Protect : Why the Individual Insurance Market Is Not a Viable Option for Most U.S. Families , compared the experiences of working - age adults with individual and employer - based private health insurance and found that people who have purchased health insurance in the individual market spend far more out of pocket and on premiums than those with employer - based coverage .
In fact , half of those with individual insurance have out - of - pocket costs and premium expenses that equal 10 percent or more of their income .
People with individual coverage do not have premium contributions from their employers , and many are charged higher premiums because of their health status or age .
According to the report , 64 percent of adults with individual insurance spend $ 3,000 or more per year on premiums while only 20 percent of those with employer insurance spend that much .
On average , adults with employer plans spend $ 2,250 out of pocket for health expenses including premiums , while those with individual market insurance spend an average of $ 6,750 .
" In our current system millions of people without access to employer coverage have no affordable option for health insurance , " said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis .
" To achieve a health care system that works for all Americans we need health care reform that offers comprehensive , affordable health insurance to everyone regardless of their health status , premium subsidies to help families with low and moderate incomes afford health insurance , and requirements to ensure that no one is denied health insurance because of a health problem . "
Experiences In The Individual Market
Those who are able to purchase individual health insurance are more likely to face a host of problems with their insurance , including going without prescription drug coverage ( 20 percent ) , limits on the total dollar amount their insurance will pay for health care ( 49 percent ) ; doctors charging more than insurance will pay and being forced to pay the difference ( 39 percent ) ; and expensive bills that their insurance will not cover ( 36 percent ) .
In addition , 41 percent of individually insured adults reported forgoing needed health care because of costs — up from 24 percent in 2001 .
Over one - third of those with individual coverage ( 36 percent ) also reported medical bill or debt problems , a substantial increase over the 28 percent who also reported medical bill or debt problems in 2005 .
" People buying their own health insurance are paying significantly more in premiums than those with employer - based coverage , but are getting less for their money in terms of protection against high costs and access to the health care they need , " said study co-author and Commonwealth Fund Vice President Sara Collins .
" It is critical that health reform proposals set minimum benefit standards and provide adequate premium subsidies to ensure that families who lose their job - based benefits can purchase affordable coverage that gives them access to timely care and protects them from catastrophic health care costs . "
The large majority of Americans who have individual coverage are unemployed , self - employed , or employed by firms with fewer than 20 workers — one - third ( 36 % ) are unemployed , and another 50 % are self - employed or employed by firms with fewer than 20 workers .
People with individual insurance also tend to be older , with the majority between the ages of 50 and 64 , according to the report .
Families with low and moderate incomes have the hardest time affording insurance on the individual market : 85 percent of those at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level ( about $ 44,000 for a family of four ) who sought an individual health insurance plan did not end up purchasing one and of that group , 67 percent cited cost as the reason they did n't purchase a plan .

Additional Findings
Adults with health problems report the highest rates of problems finding a health plan through the individual market : 60 percent of those found it very difficult or impossible to find a plan with the coverage they needed ; 70 percent found it very difficult or impossible to find an affordable plan , and nearly half were turned down or charged a higher premium because of a pre-existing condition .
Nearly 80 percent never purchased a plan .
Adults with individual insurance are increasingly underinsured : 30 percent were underinsured in 2007 , up from 17 percent in 2003 .
Forty - one percent of those with individual insurance reported not being able to obtain needed care because of cost .
People with individual insurance are seeing higher deductibles : 39 percent of people with individual insurance had policies with deductibles of $ 1,000 or more in 2007 , up from 29 percent in 2003 .
There was also an increase in the share of people with high deductibles in employer plans : 11 percent of those with employer insurance had deductibles of $ 1,000 or more in 2007 , up from 5 percent in 2003 .
The authors cite the declining economy , stagnant wages , and rising health care costs over the last decade as the driving forces behind why fewer working - age adults have access to employer coverage and must turn to the individual market for coverage , where so many end up without a plan .
Provisions in the health care reform proposals under discussion in Washington would prevent insurers from underwriting on the basis of health , and would create new insurance exchanges with sliding scale premium subsidies to help those who lose employer coverage purchase plans that meet a minimum benefit standard .
The authors point out that the mounting job losses in the recession and continued unabated growth in health care costs underscore the need for policymakers to form consensus around strategies that provide affordable and comprehensive coverage for all , as well as health system reforms that can lower costs and improve quality .
Methodology
The Commonwealth Fund 2007 Biennial Health Insurance Survey , conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates from June 6 through October 24 , 2007 , consisted of 25 - minute telephone interviews in either English or Spanish with a random , national sample of 3,501 adults , ages 19 and older , living in telephone households in the continental United States .
This issue brief report is based on 1,517 adults ages 19 to 64 who were insured all year with private insurance .
Of those , 1,387 had employer - sponsored insurance and 130 had individual insurance .
To represent the adult population , the data are weighted by age , sex , race / ethnicity , education , household size and geographic region , using the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2006 Annual Social and Economic Supplement ( ASEC ) .
The survey achieved a 45 percent response rate ( calculated according to the standards of the American Association for Public Opinion Research ) and has an overall margin of sampling error of +/- 2.2 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level .
The Commonwealth Fund is a private foundation supporting independent research on health policy reform and a high performance health system .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Older adults who catch a nap on most days may have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes than those who never take a siesta , researchers reported Monday .
In a study of nearly 20,000 Chinese adults age 50 and older , the investigators found that participants who said they usually napped on at least four to six days out of the week had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes .
Roughly 15 percent had diabetes , based on blood testing , versus about 12 percent of their counterparts who napped less often or not at all .
When the researchers weighed other factors -- including participants ’ ages , physical activity levels and any diagnoses of high blood pressure or heart disease -- frequent napping remained linked to a higher diabetes risk .
Men and women who napped four to six days per week were 36 percent more likely than those who never napped to have diabetes .
Similarly , daily nappers had a 28 percent higher risk , according to findings published in the medical journal Sleep .
Before nap lovers become too alarmed , however , the researchers stress that their findings do not prove that napping itself is the culprit .
For one , the study was cross-sectional , meaning it assessed participants at one point in time rather than following them over years .
So it is not certain which came first , the frequent napping or the diabetes .
There are also many variables that could account for the napping - diabetes link ; people in poorer general health , for example , might sleep more often .
While the researchers tried to adjust their data for that -- factoring in participants ’ self - reported health conditions , for instance -- they could not measure and control for all variables .
“ There is not much to be drawn from the current study until it can be confirmed , ” Dr. G. Neil Thomas , one of the researchers on the work , told Reuters Health in an email .
To make a stronger case for cause - and - effect , studies would have to follow a group of diabetes - free people over time , seeing whether those who napped frequently at the outset had a higher risk of developing diabetes , explained Thomas , of the University of Birmingham in the UK .
He suggested that older adults concentrate on lowering their diabetes risk through proven ways .
“ Even if the ( current ) results are confirmed , ” Thomas said , “ people can do far more for their health by stopping smoking , having a balanced diet and being active .
The data for these are unequivocal . ”
The findings are based on 19,567 Chinese men and women age 50 and up who were questioned about their health and a number of lifestyle habits .
The researchers also measured the participants ’ waist circumference and tested their blood sugar levels to diagnose type 2 diabetes or impaired fasting glucose -- abnormal sugar levels that can be a precursor to diabetes .
In general , the researchers found , frequent nappers had a higher risk of both type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose than other study participants .
Regular napping is a common practice in China , for people of all ages , Thomas and his colleagues note .
So in comparison with Western countries , where many people may nap only when they are exhausted or ill , routine napping among Chinese adults is less likely to be a marker of health problems .
There are several mechanisms by which napping itself could , in theory , contribute to diabetes development , according to Thomas .
Basically , he explained , napping might affect the body ’s natural “ rhythms ” in a way that alters the activity of various hormones .
For example , Thomas noted , waking up is actually stressful for the body , and the nervous system activation it causes may negatively affect the body ’s use of blood sugar .

Finding New Music Worth Listening To
7:54 PM Subscribe July 18 , 2005
How does everyone keep up with new music ?
Over the past year , blind luck and close reading of a few blogs turned me on to some music I 'm glad I did n't miss ( Bloc Party , Arcade Fire , LCD Soundsystem ) .
Work and other obligations prevent me from listening to KCRW , KEXP or some other " hip " radio stream all day , and I just do n't have the time to read through x-amount of MP3 blogs a day looking for the next exciting thing .
Pitchfork 's ' Best New Music ' feature is helpful , but I 'd like something more .
Ideally , I 'd like a podcast of non-podsafe ( i.e. , whatever 's new and good , signed or otherwise ) music or a single blogger who posts frequently and writes well .
I 'm not looking for a bootlegging outlet , just a reliable source for direction on what 's new and worth my time .
