Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails was in Beijing last week for a rock festival .
In a great , inflammatory interview with Music2dot0 , Reznor excoriates the labels , promises to go independent and sell through his website — and he exhorts Chinese fans to download his music for free rather than buying it from pirate CD sellers .
" As for the special situation in China , it does not seem to be easy to obtain Western music via legal channels , so I have the following suggestion for our fans :
If you can find and buy our legal CDs , I express my thanks for your support .
If you cannot find it , I think that downloading from the Internet is a more acceptable option than buying pirated CDs .
Our music is easy to find on the Internet , and you might not need to spend much effort to find most of our songs .
If you like our songs after you 've heard them , please feel free to share it with your friends .
As I have put all my effort and heart into my music , I sincerely hope that more and more people can share the enjoyment with us . "
PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) are n’t highly regarded in the fashion industry .
After a bevy of crazy stunts , where they ’ve stormed catwalks and made immature nuisances of themselves , it has very much become a case of ‘ us and them ’ .
So when their latest campaign hit the Internet most people in the industry sighed a collective breath of relief .
There were no crazy stunts to be seen , not even a crazy protester ( well past her prime ) flashing her privates .
No , all we were hit with was a very naked Alicia Silverstone .
But explaining the virtues of vegetarianism , and labelling it sexy really got us thinking .
Sure , PETA have a point .
The health arguments can be put foward .
And it all works to drive home one of PETA ’s key messages : “ I ’d rather go naked then wear fur . ”
But sexy is a large claim , and in this case it ’s a fraud .
Yes , Silverstone is naked .
But not naked enough .
Do n’t get us wrong , we ’re not asking to see her privates ; she can keep them as private as she likes .
What we ’re after is the real Alica Silverstone .
The fashion industry has often been accused of setting a bad example through the airbrushing / photoshopping of images .
But PETA have taken it a step further .
They are letting the world know that by giving up meat you too can be as perfect as Silverstone , but through the wizardry of modern technology they ’ve avoided presenting the real Silverstone .
So there ’s our reply to PETA .
We ’re willing to listen to your message .
But let ’s be honest .
Show us the real , un - Photoshopped , flawed Alicia Silverstone and then we ’ll weigh up whether or not being a vegetarian or vegan does live up to everything you ’re promising .
Let ’s see if she really looks better now then she did “ 11 years ago ” .
Switching to organic is tough for many families who do n’t want to pay higher prices or give up their favorite foods .
But by choosing organic versions of just a few foods that you eat often , you can increase the percentage of organic food in your diet without big changes to your shopping cart or your spending .
The key is to be strategic in your organic purchases .
Opting for organic produce , for instance , does n’t necessarily have a big impact , depending on what you eat .
According to the Environmental Working Group , commercially - farmed fruits and vegetables vary in their levels of pesticide residue .
Some vegetables , like broccoli , asparagus and onions , as well as foods with peels , such as avocados , bananas and oranges , have relatively low levels compared to other fruits and vegetables .
So how do you make your organic choices count ?
Pediatrician Dr. Alan Greene , whose new book “ Raising Baby Green ” explains how to raise a child in an environmentally - friendly way , has identified a few “ strategic ” organic foods that he says can make the biggest impact on the family diet .
1. Milk : “ When you choose a glass of conventional milk , you are buying into a whole chemical system of agriculture , ” says Dr. Greene .
People who switch to organic milk typically do so because they are concerned about the antibiotics , artificial hormones and pesticides used in the commercial dairy industry .
One recent United States Department of Agriculture survey found certain pesticides in about 30 percent of conventional milk samples and low levels in only one organic sample .
The level is relatively low compared to some other foods , but many kids consume milk in large quantities .
2. Potatoes : Potatoes are a staple of the American diet — one survey found they account for 30 percent of our overall vegetable consumption .
A simple switch to organic potatoes has the potential to have a big impact because commercially - farmed potatoes are some of the most pesticide - contaminated vegetables .
A 2006 U.S.D.A. test found 81 percent of potatoes tested still contained pesticides after being washed and peeled , and the potato has one of the the highest pesticide contents of 43 fruits and vegetables tested , according to the Environmental Working Group .
3 . Peanut butter :
More acres are devoted to growing peanuts than any other fruits , vegetable or nut , according to the U.S.D.A .
More than 99 percent of peanut farms use conventional farming practices , including the use of fungicide to treat mold , a common problem in peanut crops .
Given that some kids eat peanut butter almost every day , this seems like a simple and practical switch .
Commercial food firms now offer organic brands in the regular grocery store , but my daughter loves to go to the health food store and grind her own peanut butter .
4. Ketchup :
For some families , ketchup accounts for a large part of the household vegetable intake .
About 75 percent of tomato consumption is in the form of processed tomatoes , including juice , tomato paste and ketchup .
Notably , recent research has shown organic ketchup has about double the antioxidants of conventional ketchup .
5. Apples : Apples are the second most commonly eaten fresh fruit , after bananas , and they are also used in the second most popular juice , after oranges , according to Dr. Greene .
But apples are also one of the most pesticide - contaminated fruits and vegetables .
The good news is that organic apples are easy to find in regular grocery stores .

ON the pilot episode of “ Gossip Girl , ” the new prime - time soap opera about teenagers at an Upper East Side private school , a raven - haired student named Blair Waldorf put the moves on her boyfriend at a party , pushing him down on a bed upstairs while a waiter pushes canapés on her mother ’s guests below .
“ That would never happen in our grade , but if you were a senior , it might , ” said Brooke Yalof , 12 , who played host to an informal panel of seventh graders convened to view the pilot at the request of The New York Times .
But Simone Rivera , 13 , Ms. Yalof ’s classmate at Spence , the Bergdorf Goodman of Upper East Side private schools , was not so sure .
“ At least I ’d lock the door , ” she said with a laugh to signal that she was speaking hypothetically , of course .
Sprawled in front of the flat - screen television at the Yalofs ’ uptown duplex , the girls analyzed the action over pizza and pretzels , their conversation punctuated by the trilling of cellphones , and the occasional giggle .
Saucy beyond their years , and disinclined to censor themselves , they were not quite the audience envisioned by the producers of “ Gossip Girl , ” which is adapted from a series of best - selling young - adult novels by Cecily von Ziegesar , and which is aimed primarily at 18 - to 34 - year - olds .
But when the show has its premiere on Wednesday night on the CW Network , these girls say they will be watching .
In the view of many teenagers who live the cosseted lives that the program tries to replicate , “ Gossip Girl ” is more than an escapist romp or overwrought melodrama .
It holds up a fairly accurate , if somewhat distorting mirror to their existence .

The video games industry is obsessed with the phrase " next generation " , but what does it actually mean ?
What can gamers expect from any game given that name ?
It would be easy to dismiss the next generation gaming experience as simply eye candy .
Every single thing in the city can be grabbed , climbed on , jumped from
Jade Raymond , Ubisoft producer
The latest games all look great but the potential offered by the processing power of consoles such as the Xbox 360 and PS3 does not end there .
They also give developers a wealth of new gameplay possibilities .
At Ubisoft 's Montreal studio , a team of 300 designers , programmers and artists have spent four years developing Assassin 's Creed , a next generation medieval action adventure .
" A lot of people have heard the term ' next gen game ' thrown around and so far what we 've seen as far as next gen games mostly means better quality graphics , " said Ubisoft producer Jade Raymond .
" So you 've seen in fighting games where boxers are up close , you get more detail on the facial animation .
Or in car racing games it looks exactly like the car , and you get more shiny cars and the environments are more realistic .
" But for me personally , next gen game had to mean new types of gameplay . "
Assassin's Creed is set during the Crusades and the action takes place in three huge cities .
Each is populated with thousands of computer controlled characters .
Players can take Altair , the character they control , anywhere in the city .
" We made this rule and gave ourselves the challenge to try and make huge cities that are completely interactive , which means that every single thing in the city can be grabbed , climbed on , jumped from , " said Ms Raymond .
" Which means that we created tools to be able to recognise the 3D models and automatically generate interactive edges on everything . "
Lego blocks
The gaming environment took so long to develop because everything that sticks out of a wall more than two inches can be an anchor point for Altair .
Bumping into people affects the direction of the main character
" Our challenge was to make it readable for the player as we 're using games to see the level design ingredients or the game designer path , " said creative director Patrice Desilets .
" This time there is no path whatsoever . "
Vincent Pontbriand , Ubisoft associate producer , said : " In a regular , more linear , game what you would do is create game levels .
In our case , since it involved cities in which you could travel anywhere , we quickly realised it was going to be impossible to customise the entire city that way , polygon by polygon .
" So what we did was we created a bank of objects , what we call a Lego system , and this allowed us to produce the first templates for the cities quickly by adding and removing blocks .
" Then we were able to do the same things with objects and eventually with the characters and the population itself . "
While larger environments that allow the player more freedom are certainly a bonus , there is still more to be done before a game can earn that next gen title .
Background characters
Probably one of the biggest challenges facing games is to make computer controlled characters more lifelike .
This is where the hardware buried inside the latest consoles proves so useful .
" The tendency in technology is to move towards multi-core , multi CPU type of machines , " explained AI programmer Matthieu Mazerolles .
" What this means is instead of having just one processing unit you literally have several , sometimes up to a dozen all within the same box .
More than 200 models were used as the templates for characters
" What this allows us to do is to take all of the calculations , which are highly complex , that go into making the AI seem alive , and distribute these across many different processors . "
Said Ms Raymond : " We worked on this whole kind of physics systems for when you bump into people and push them out of the way , so that tactile thing really felt real .
" So bumping into a group of people will make you fall over , running full force into a small woman will knock her over . "
One of the tools the company has worked on is something which generates crowds of diverse people .
" For NPCs we have hundreds and hundreds of different looking characters , that were the templates we used to create our initial models , " said Mr Pontbriand .
" But then we created our own technology to take those templates , cut them down into pieces and then , with the technology , added the ability to randomise between skin colour , clothes , hair colour .
" We ended up with a multiplying factor , so these sketches that became models ended up producing thousands of different variations in game . "
' A player 's story '
Increased production values , emotional involvement , environments that have more bearing on the world - could all of these elements help shift games from what many perceive to be a marginalised ghetto into the mainstream ?
" As an entertainment medium , games are really just scratching the surface , " said Ms Raymond .
" I think we are at where we were with film when we made the transition from silent films to films that were telling a story with sound and dialogue .
" We are just at the point of discovering what we can do with interactivity and what 's an interactive story where you are creating a story for players , but it really has to become the player 's story . "
Said Mr Desilets : " I strongly believe the more we go on with next gen the less we will see video game rules apparent , they will be more and more hidden and the experience will be a lot more immersive because you wo n't see the video game rules that only gamers really like . "
If the invasion of Afghanistan had been a success , we would not still be fighting the Taliban and al - Qaeda in Afghanistan .
If the invasion of Iraq had been a success , we would not be fighting there .
Two invasions of practically defenseless countries with obsolete weapons and decaying infrastructures have to be termed failures .
Both the civilian leadership in Washington and the military ’s officer corps share the blame .
The people in Washington , infected with fatal arrogance , thought of a clever scheme :
We will bribe the criminal gangs known as the Northern Alliance to do the actual fighting , and we ’ll use our special forces to laser - paint Taliban targets for our aircraft .
It worked , as far as it went .
The Taliban had no air defense at all .
Osama bin Laden , however , was smart enough to bribe one of our Northern Alliance allies to leave the back door open at Tora Bora .
That ’s how he escaped into Pakistan .
Six years later , we still have not captured or killed him .
Chalk up another failure .
The big mistake the Washington hotshots made was not understanding the history and culture of the two countries they decided to attack .
They were thinking “ liberation ” ; the people were thinking “ occupation by foreigners . ”
I have n’t googled mankind ’s complete history , but offhand I cannot think of any instance where occupiers were welcomed by the native population .
Even when the native population hates the existing government , as was probably the case in both Afghanistan and Iraq , the period between the time the people are glad and the time they want the occupiers to leave is quite brief .
Most occupations have gotten in trouble by overstaying their welcome .
The officer corps seems to have forgotten the lessons of Vietnam and become obsessed with high - tech gadgetry .
These gadgets and their computers were designed for war against other conventional forces .
Going guerrilla does n’t even the odds , but it certainly cuts into the effectiveness of the gadgets .
With a little luck and stealth , a hungry , barefoot boy with an AK - 47 can kill a well - equipped , well - trained soldier .
Booby traps , now called improvised explosive devices , have been killing soldiers for a long time now .
The great blunder made by Donald Rumsfeld was to not realize that a light force can defeat a conventional force with obsolete equipment , but it ca n’t manage a successful occupation .
Because we were so short of manpower , not only did we allow the whole country to be looted , we left enough unguarded ammunition dumps to supply the insurgents for years to come .
The Washington hotshots also failed to realize how deep the enmity was between the factions .
The Shi’ites have always been ruled by Sunnis in Iraq , and the Sunnis , a minority in the population , were either put into power by the foreigners or shot their way to power .
Being a majority only works when you have fair elections and can enforce the results .
The Shi’ites fear a Sunni coup , and the last thing in the world they are going to do is integrate armed Sunnis into their army and police force .
Our American officials might be naive enough to believe they will , but from the Shi’ite standpoint , it would be suicidal based on their historical experience .
And from the Sunni point of view , a coup is exactly what they have in mind .
They are not going to accept permanent rule by the Shi’ites .
Sooner or later , the American people will realize we do n’t have the brains or the grit to run a world empire .
When our political leaders try , they make fools of themselves .
Business and commerce are our forte , and that ’s what we should stick to .
Let somebody else play Caesar .

The Brave General & The Whining Senator ( Petraeus vs. Betrayus )
Rush Limbaugh 's show |
01/26/07
Posted on by Recovering_Democrat
General David Petraeus
Leader of the forces in Iraq who testified before Congress that a resolution condemning the President 's troop buildup would encourage the enemy and discourage the American soldiers .
Senator Chuck Betrayus
The only Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to vote with the Democrat party to condemn the President 's troop buildup .
Betrayus was a big cheerleader and even had the nerve to " chew out " the patriots on the committee who refused to give aid and comfort to the enemy .
Betrayus literally told the Republicans who opposed him they'd be better off as shoe salesmen .

Very good : General Betrayus .
What a contrast he and his Democrat colleagues make with even our lowest rank servicemen and women in Iraq - they tower above him and all his Democrat colleagues and enablers such as James Webb .

This is at least the third time I 've been a player in cyberspace news among the media elites ... once on PMSNBC .
COM , they did an article for which the launching pad was a thread I started about socialist Michael Moore 's upcoming flick " Fahrenheit 9/11 " , and how I thought we ought to boycott Miramax or contact Disney .
The second time was my thread , quoted nearly verbatim , on Drudge 's headline , when Kanye West made a complete ASS of himself on the Katrina fundraising telethon ...
And now , this . :)
One other time , though I cannot prove it , I posted the Vermont Republican party 's response to Judas Jim Jeffords ' little temper tantrum when he went " independent " ... a few minutes later , Rush Limbaugh himself was reading the very same letter I posted . :)
I ought to work for RL .
I 'd be an asset to his business .
Anyway , THANK YOU , bvw , for the heads up ! :)

Nataša Musar Pirc : E-uprava ni znanstvena fantastika
Kategorija : Intervju Stroka | Datum objave : Sunday , 24 . 09 . 2006 | Avtor : Domen Savič
Dvanajsto nadstropje hotela Lev ponuja prekrasen pogled na prestolnico .
Prav tam se nahaja pisarna informacijske pooblaščenke , ki bedi nad mestom .
Nataša Musar Pirc , diplomirana pravnica , večini Slovencev znana kot novinarka POP TV - ja , v zadnjem času pa neumorna zasledovalka nepravilnosti v zdravstvu , javni upravi ter drugod , se izkaže za zelo zanimivo sogovornico , ki ji skoraj nikoli ne zmanjka besed .
Kritično , napredno in zanimivo .
Mislite , da je data retention ( zbiranje osebnih podatkov ) trenutno modna muha ali gre za konkreten namen ?
Meni se namreč zdi , da to počenjajo samo zato , ker lahko ( poceni tehnologija , razpoložljive kapacitete ) .
Gre za trenuten trend ali se bo naša celotna družba na to prilagodila , kot se je prilagodila na , recimo , videonadzor ?
Bojim se , da gredo trendi v to smer .
Danes ni več debate med zasebnim in javnim , ampak med zasebnim in varnim .
Kje potegnit mejo , da se bomo državljani počutili varno in koliko svoje zasebnosti bomo pripravljeni odstopiti v prid večji varnosti ?
Vseeno mislim , da z izvajanjem t.i. data retention mi kriminaliziramo celotno populacijo .
To pa je tisto , česar se je treba bati in izredno strogo nadzirati .
Jaz sem državni nadzorni organ in sem zavezana sprejetim zakonom , mi pa neodvisni status omogoča nadzor tudi nad tistimi , ki ne bi bili radi nadzirani – vlada , zdravstvo , policija .
In moram reči , da nikjer ni bilo pretiranega odpora – razen v zdravstvu .
Tam je bilo pa najprej trideset let brez nadzora , potem pa kar naenkrat etika prevlada nad pravom .
Na drugi strani s policijo ni nobenih težav , parkrat smo obiskali agencijo SOVA in to brez kakr šnihkoli težav .
Ljudje se namreč zavedajo , kako izjemnega pomena za njih je , da imajo to dobro urejeno in da jim ugled v javnosti zaradi slabe urejenosti ne bo padel .
Kam bo šla pot naprej …veste , ljudje so na kamere že kar nekako navajeni .
Mislijo si , da so z nadzorom bolj varni .
Po drugi strani pa zelo banalno rečeno , nekdo posname sosedo , kako se mečka za vogalom in tečejo špecat njeni mami .
In to so posegi v zasebnost , ki so zaradi razpršenosti kamer in drugih varnostnih ukrepov , izredno povečani .
Z povečanim številom zbirk podatkov se poveča možnost zlorabe teh podatkov .
To je dejstvo .
London je s 500,000 videokamerami poimenovan kar CCTV - city .
Lahko se sprašujemo o pozitivnih učinkih , ampak sama se ne počutim dobro , če me kamera sledi na vsakem koraku .
Kriminaliziranje celotne populacije se mi zdi pretiran ukrep v primerjavi z varnostjo celotne populacije .

Sama vedno pravim , državni organi se morajo zavedati , da več stvari kot bodo sami dali na spletno stran , manj bodo dobivali zahtev .
Splet je idealen pripomoček za dostop do informacij javnega značaja in za zmanjševanje obsega dela .
Urad pooblaščenca do informacij javnega značaja objavlja popolnoma vse .
In vsak , ki hoče videti katerokoli našo odločbo , jo lahko najde na spletni strani .
Temu služi tudi zakon o dostopu do informacij javnega značaja .
Penetracija interneta je v Sloveniji po raziskavah RiS-a 47 - odstotna in to ni majhna številka – to nas uvršča v vrh Evropske Unije oziroma nad povprečje – Estonija na tem področju dela čudeže ; sklepe vladnih sej imate na spletu pet minut po tistem , ko je seja končana .
Moram reči , da tudi naš urad za informiranje zelo hitro objavlja dokumente – in to so idealna orodja za sodelovalno demokracijo .
[ audio : http://www.ljudmila.org/~savicd/natasa/demokracija.mp3]
Premalo delamo na področju uporabe tega , kar ponudimo našim državljanom .
E-uprava , e-dohodnina , elektronski vpogled v centralni register prebivalstva in tako naprej .
Ja , rečemo – Sigenca , sigovca , vse je na spletu , pridite iskat , zastonj je .
Veste , kako to počnejo v Estoniji ?
Vsakemu , ki je prišel do uradnika , so dali v roko potrdilo in mu rekli – Od sedaj naprej drugače ne boste mogli elektronsko poslovat oziroma delati z državno upravo .
Po mojem mnenju idealna rešitev .
Pri nas pa…30,000 elektronskih podpisov .
Sama sem fen e-uprave in takoj ko je bilo možno dohodnino oddajati elektronsko , sem bila zraven .
Ampak vsi ljudje nismo taki in takim je potrebno dati elektronski podpis v roko in jim pojasniti , da brez tega določenih postopkov ne bodo mogli več vodit .
Res je pri nas potrebno upoštevati problem pomanjkanja računalnikov , ampak veste , računalniki so v vsaki knjižnici , in človek bo namesto obiska uradnika raje obiskal knjižnico in si podaljšal prometno dovoljenje .
S tem bi lahko ljudi tudi vzpodbudili k nakupu računalnika , saj bi z njim lahko vse opravili od doma .
To priložnosti bi izkoristila za poziv – Vsem državljanom dajte elektronski podpis in naj bo to osnova , kajti brez tega se mi lahko trudimo , delamo elektronske registre , pa če jih na koncu uporablja 30,000 ljudi od milijona in pol…potem nismo naredili nič ; zmetali smo ogromne količine denarja , uporabnost na drugi strani pa je majhna .
Isto je pri državnih organih .
Mi imamo elektronski podpis in bi želeli elektronsko vročat naše odločbe .
Veste , kje je problem ?
Na drugi strani !
kjer nimajo elektronskega podpisa in elektronska vročitev je nemogoča .
Če ne drugega , vsaj državne organe poenotite , tako da bodo imeli vsi elektronske podpise !
Vprašajte ministra Viranta .
Sama ne razumem , zakaj se tega ne naredi !

In China , 190 children are snatched every day - more than twice the number taken in England and Wales in a year .
The Chinese government does not acknowledge the extent of the problem , or the cause .
The Single Child Policy has made it essential to have a son , leading to the abortion of more than 40 million girls and setting the price on a boy's head at more than six months ' wages .
By Clare Dwyer Hogg
The events of this summer mean that every one of us will have considered , for a moment at least , the horror of having a child snatched .
The emotions parents must endure are n't hard to imagine : the creeping numbness of realisation ; the shock turning to panic as the minutes tick by ; the helpless reliance on the goodwill of others , particularly the police .
In Europe , the cases of child kidnapping are sporadic .
In China , however , they are increasingly common .
Around 190 children are snatched every day - stolen from their beds and the streets .
This is more than double the average number of abductions recorded in England and Wales over a whole year .
If 190 people were dying every day from the same illness , you 'd call it an epidemic .
And that 's exactly what it is , except nobody really wants to talk about it .
Especially the Chinese government .
The government does n't want to talk about it because it's a short step from fully acknowledging the kidnappings to having to address why they 're happening .
Which means entering dangerous territory - a root cause of such large numbers of children being snatched is the fact that having a son in China is a necessity .
He carries the family name , he is the child who will provide for his parents as they age .
A daughter will leave the family to marry into another name , passively obliterating her own family line and leaving her relatives without the assurance of help in old age .
The One Child Policy - which Save The Children calls a ' mass , live experiment in family life which is unique in the history of the world ' - has resulted in prohibitive family - planning laws in China : prospective parents must have a birth permit before conceiving , and while rural families are allowed a second child if their first is a girl , urban families must pay a fine for flouting the one - child rule .
And if you have n't had an abortion to get rid of your female child ( although it is now illegal , around 40 m girls have been selectively aborted since the One Child Policy was instituted in 1979 ) , how can you be sure to get a son ?
Sometimes the only choice seems to be to buy a stolen child , gender already determined .
' I did think about suicide , ' says Li , a woman in her early twenties .
' I missed my child so much . '
It has been a year and a half since her little boy , Chen Jie , was taken .
He was five years old , playing at his grandmother 's vegetable stall in Sichuan , when Zhang , a trusted neighbour , passed by .
Offering to bring Chen Jie back to his mother - and persuading the reluctant boy with the promise of sweets - Zhang left , taking the child with him .
This was the last time Chen Jie was seen by his family .
Later , when parents and grandmother realised that neither had the little boy , they ran to Zhang 's door , desperately hoping he was there .
Calmly , Zhang claimed that after giving him money for sweets , he 'd left Chen Jie at the apartment block .
Their suspicion of his involvement in their son's disappearance could not be translated into evidence - even though when the grandmother confronted him later , she said he yelled , ' I sold the kid , OK ? '
After police questioning , however , Zhang was free to go about his normal business , unlike the Chens .
' Sometimes I do n't want to carry on my life , ' Li continues .
She has come close to killing herself many times , she says , but is always stopped by the thought of how disappointed her family would be .
Culturally , the responsibility for the family weighs heavily : Li and her husband , Lung , already feel they have let their parents down by depriving them of the grandson who would carry on the family name .
Once , Li admits , she was ready to jump from the top of a public washroom , but the owner of the building dragged her home .
' She tried to prevent me from thinking that way , ' Li says .
' She knew a story in which a mother who lost her child killed herself by jumping off a building .
After her death , the father sold the house and lost contact with everyone .
Never came back .
Later , their friend found the child and brought him home , but the whole family was gone . '
Li has thought about this tragic twist many times .
' If you die , and your child comes back one day , he loses his mother forever . '
Li and Lung Chen are determined to do anything to get their son back , but their options are severely limited .
The media is too close to the government to be used as a tool , and even joining a parents ' support group must be done in secret .
They saved up 600RMB - that 's £ 40 - to put Chen Jie 's picture on a poker set that features missing children on every card ; in their desperation they 're gambling on gamblers .
Putting up ' missing ' posters of Chen Jie , his eyes staring out brightly even from a photocopy , was risky because it 's forbidden ( the authorities are n't keen to have the reminder of missing children on show ) , but they did it .
Hiring a private detective cost money , but they did that , because the detective has a reputation for successful rescue missions .
Speaking to Westerners about their plight was downright dangerous , but they 've done that , too .
The production team behind the Emmy Award - winning documentary The Dying Rooms , which in 1995 uncovered the neglect of abandoned children in Chinese state - run orphanages , went back to China this year .
The idea behind the first documentary was that China 's One Child Policy , the population stabiliser , had led to the abandonment of girls - this , and their subsequent abuse in some cases , was recorded as tragic confirmation .
More than 10 years later , the team - this time headed by debut director Jezza Neumann - went back to investigate another consequence of the One Child Policy : the tens of thousands of Chinese children being trafficked every year .
Needless to say , if you 're making a documentary about child abduction , looking for the abductors , the need for undercover filming is paramount .
Sim cards were changed after every call ; the production team met to discuss plans in locations that had plenty of exits ; they all arrived and left from different directions .
The Chinese word for Westerner is gwailo , a once derogatory term , which can be translated as ' ghost man ' : Neumann says his mission was to take this phrase literally .
It 's hard to render yourself unnoticeable as a Westerner with a camera in China , but he and his team tried to move through the country like ghosts , as unseen as the people they were searching for .
The Chinese authorities , loath to let such stories out , are also extremely vigilant , and getting people to talk about their experiences of having a child stolen is virtually impossible .
The air hangs thick with the threat of official reprisals and punishment .
One potential interviewee whose son was stolen was visited by the secret police the day after a researcher had been to ask him questions .
He backed out , too scared to commit to camera what he felt , too frightened to enlist the help of outsiders in such a close - knit community , where anything unusual gets back to officials - apart from , it would seem , the identity of child kidnappers .
The Chens knew the danger , too , but , thirsty for help , they agreed .
It 's not that the Chinese government does n't report on child trafficking : there is coverage of rescue successes , or assurances that the government is doing all it can to combat the criminals .
The stories are often , however , conspicuously free from statistics or analysis .
Save the Children reports that last year Chinese officials from the Ministry of Public Security put overall trafficking figures ( for women and children ) at 2,500 .
This is much lower than NGOs estimate , but it 's all about semantics , of course .
International law - the UN's Palermo Protocol of 2000 - defines trafficking not only by the use of force or manipulation , but also as ' the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability ' .
A child is any person under the age of 18 .
The Chinese government is currently drafting a National Plan of Action against Trafficking but , as it stands , the Chinese definition is much narrower .
Article 240 of the Criminal Law of the People 's Republic of China makes illegal the abduction of women and children ( men are overlooked ) for the purpose of selling .
There is no clause for abduction without being sold - if you are taken away to be a slave or a sex worker , that does n't count .
And currently , if you are abducted at 14 in China , you are an adult , and not part of the statistics .
Chen Jie is very much part of the statistics - one stolen child in the mass of 70,000 snatched every year .
His little life had already been fraught with difficulty .
He was born a year after the Chens started seeing each other : the One Child Policy stipulates that children cannot be born without a birth permit , and you cannot have a birth permit if you do n't have a marriage certificate .
So Li had him in secret , giving birth in her mother 's pigsty .
Li and Lung hid their little boy for a year until they came to a decision that without a birth permit , without an official existence , Chen Jie 's life would be nothing .
They confessed to the authorities , and were ordered to pay a fine of 8,000 RMB ( £ 520 ) .
They only finished paying that debt last year .
Now , the strain of being left without the son for whom they struggled is palpable .
' It has been very difficult , ' Li says , via a translator , speaking on a crackling line from their tiny apartment in the migrant workers ' ghetto .
' We quarrel from time to time , but every time we think of our child , we remember we share the same goal .
I already feel responsible and guilty .
We do n't want Chen Jie to come back to a broken family . '
The strength to stay together - like the rejection of suicide - is fuelled by the need to believe that they are maintaining a home for their missing boy , having in readiness a place for him to return to , and parents who are loving and at peace .
This hope , no matter how tenuous , is some sort of light for the way ahead , even if at times it seems only to emphasise the darkening shadows all around .
Depression floors them , guilt for letting their families down punctures their faith , and time has not been a healer .
The detective , while active , is not getting any leads .
They are - as the Chinese phrase goes - ' looking for a needle in an ocean ' .
Part of the Chens ' problem , and the problem for many parents like them , is that they are up against a highly organised criminal network which supplies a seemingly never - ending demand .
Add to the mix that the moral code is skewed when it comes to ' adopting ' ( buying ) children .
If you were caught buying a child in the UK , you would be charged with child trafficking .
Yet in China - as incongruous as it may seem - while it is illegal to abandon , steal or sell a child , it is not necessarily illegal to buy one .
CCTV , a government - sponsored news outlet , recently reported that : ' Under the current law for families that adopt trafficked children , if they have not abused the children , and have not obstructed the rescue operations , the law enforcement can choose not to press charges , not to pursue further .
Many parents of missing children find that unacceptable . '
Parents of stolen children are immediately on the back foot ; the law is essentially non-punitive , so child traffickers can justify their actions - they are simply supplying a demand that is not , in itself , a crime .
Except , of course , it is .
People buying a child have no guarantee that the child was willingly given up by his parents .
And when the motivator for providing that child is money , reassurances mean nothing .
A boy can fetch around 10,000 RMB ( £ 650 ) which is a lot of money for one ' job ' , when you consider that a skilled production worker in China earns £ 1,200 a year .
One trafficker explains how he and his cohorts would identify the suitability of a child through the vulnerability of his mother .
They would watch , wait , take a note of her routines , and bide their time for that moment when she would leave her son unattended .
One such prize , he says , happened when the child was in bed , and the mother nipped out , unaware of watchful eyes .
' We shoved a hanky into the boy 's mouth to shut him up , ' the trafficker remembers , calmly plotting the strategy as if there was nothing abnormal in his actions , ' and we bundled him into a sack . '
Another trafficker , who specialises in children , and is happy to appear on camera , says , ' I think there must be something wrong with treating children as goods , but I can't figure out what it is . '
He likes to think of himself as an agent for parents who need to sell their children and a conduit for those who want to buy one .
People do sell their children ( if they do n't have a birth permit , or are too poor to raise the child ) , but it is a murky world where a child becomes a missing piece in the commercial chain .
This particular trafficker admits that he used to sell women against their will , luring them first into a false sense of security by pretending to be a loving boyfriend .
And although children are now much more lucrative , it is hard to understand why he would n't empathise with the families left behind : he has witnessed at first hand the devastation his older son feels since his younger brother went missing .
The son , no more than 13 , mourns the loss of a brother .
' I miss him , ' he says .
' This year he would be nine ...'
The trafficker 's son tries to articulate , pausing between thoughts and memories , shaking his head , and squeezing air out through tiny gaps in his mouth - small and potent sounds of regret that can not be put into words .
The twist , heartbreakingly , is that he later discovered that his own father was to blame for the disappearance .
' My grandmother told me my dad sold my brother , ' he says .
' I thought my dad was very bad to do that .
I felt very sad .
At the time ... at the time ... I really hated him .'
As soon as the Chens discovered that Chen Jie was missing , they called 110 , the emergency services .
The police called back instantly for details and a description , but did n't come to their home .
After a day of frantic searching , aided by neighbours with a car , the Chens went to the police station .
A mix - up had occurred : because the emergency call happened late at night , the local police had n't been passed the details .
Looking around the train station and hotspots of trafficking did n't turn up any clues ; they interviewed the neighbour , Zhang - nothing .
By then , Chen Jie could have been halfway across China .
Zhang has now moved to Mongolia , allowed to melt into another crowd in another country .
Suspicion fell on another neighbour , Kong , for whom Lung used to be an apprentice .
The Chens think he could have been in partnership with Zhang , picking Chen Jie as an easy target .
The police questioned him for a whole day , but did not tell the Chens the result .
Desperately , they have asked for Kong to be tested with a lie detector .
There is a waiting list though - there are only a few in the whole country - and they do n't know if they can afford it , or if it 's even worth it .
They are encouraged , however , by a sliver of hope : Lung has heard breaking news that a ring of traffickers has been uncovered .
The police have rescued around 40 babies , and families will be reunited with their kidnapped children - this is hope , in his eyes .
' We 're both victims of the situation , ' Lung says of himself and his wife , yet they are unwilling to criticise the government 's policies : the police are working on their case , Lung says .
Li comes on the line to explain that it's hard for the police , too : ' Police would go and try to investigate but even they get beaten up at remote townships ...'
Her equanimity crumbles later in the call , though , as she breaks down , admitting that she 's not sure if she can keep living like this : the searching , the guilt , the dwindling figure of her husband , who has lost his appetite and is often unwell .
Pregnant again , she worries that she wo n't know how to treat her new baby , that it will be unfair to Chen Jie to have another child .
She does n't sleep well , she says , dreaming every night of Chen Jie suffering in a poor village .
And with a heart wrench Li realises that she has never dreamt he was bought by a rich family and living well , despite the plethora of news stories about children having a ' better life ' with new parents .
But she forces herself to keep going .
' I always remember what a father said who got his stolen boy back , ' she says .
' He said as long as you keep your hope there is a chance ; but if you give up hope and stop looking , the child is gone forever . '
Li's mother , the last to see Chen Jie , grief - stricken and carrying her own burden of guilt , often dreams of her missing grandson , too .
The word in Chinese for dreaming and wishing is the same , and it is no surprise that her daytime longings spill into her night .
' I had a dream that my grandson came back , ' she says .
' I held him in my arms and he asked me , " Grandma , are you tired ? "
I replied that I was not tired at all when holding my grandson .
I was so happy that he finally came back . '
And then , with sorrow , back to the terrible reality .
' Then , ' she says , ' I woke up . '
Some names have been changed

Obama may want to pre-emptively strike Pakistan , but we ’re already well on our way .
From June to September Afghan and Pakistani civilians were killed during U.S. - led air strikes in record numbers .
Afghan civilian casualties reached its climax in August , when 168 civilians died .
Two - thirds of the deaths were attributed to “ military operations conducted by international forces . ”
And today it was reported that over 2,500 families have been displaced in southern Afghanistan due to the Taliban ; of that , hundreds were forced to flee due to “ intense aerial bombing by international forces . ”
Some have pointed out that there is a gruesome air war quietly going on in Iraq , Pakistan , and Afghanistan .
Foreign Policy in Focus points out that some of these air strikes are conducted by unmanned aerial vehicles called MQ - 1 Predators ( which we fly over our south - west border , I might add ) .
The missiles are guided from a base in Nevada .
There has been a “ five fold increase in the number of bombs dropped on Iraq during the first six months of 2007 over the same period in 2006 , ” and more than 30 tons of that have been cluster bombs .
More civilians , the writer suggests , are being killed by coalition forces than the Taliban .
Furthermore , 59,787 pounds of cluster bombs have rained upon Iraq since April 2003 ; the Air Force dropped 111,000 pounds of bombs over Iraq in 2006 over a span of 10 , 519 “ close air support missions . ”
This figure does not include all the other types of weapons and munitions dropped over Iraq , as well as some Army , Marine and private security contractors ’ operations .
Overall , an average of 75 to 100 airstrikes are carried out in the 2 countries everyday by the U.S .
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission remarks how Coalition bombardments against civilians come “ at a time when the government and people of Afghanistan expect … international forces to cooperate and assist them in ensuring security , rule of law and reconstruction of Afghanistan .
But , regretfully , the people of Afghanistan have always been witnessing civilian casualties in their operations against terrorists , particularly during last year [ 2006 ] . ”

Irreversible Death - the end of the Republican Party - Part 1
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
The Republican Party is dead !
It just does n’t realize it or have the decency to lie down and be dead .
Working my way through college as an emergency room technician and a future failed pre-med , I learned the term “ irreversible death . ”
It sounds weird I know , as if the term were an oxymoron , but it is n’t .
A diagnosis of irreversible death results from death at the cellular level and is used in determining a gravely ill or injured patient ’s prognosis .
When a patient so injured or ill presented with the signs and symptoms of one or more of their body ’s systems–brain , kidney , heart , digestive , etc.–in failure or had failed , from that moment , homeostasis was unsupportable and death was inevitable .
Even successful treatment of the failing system would not stop the inevitable because the amount of damage in that organ or system would have begun to degrade some or all of the others at their cellular level .
When disease or damage to the extent of being irreversible is diagnosed , no palliative , surgical , or transplant procedure could be done that would prolong the inevitable .
A diagnosis of irreversible death is not easily made and had to be determined from strictly defined criteria .
But , from the moment a diagnosis of irreversible death is made , it is just a matter of time before the patient expires .
The Republican Party exhibits many signs and symptoms of a body politic with multiple systems in failure .
Broken down into interacting parts , documenting the Republican Party ’s ideology and actions at a cellular level in order to diagnose these failed and failing systems , I predict the inevitable and irreversible death of the Republican Party .
In Part 2 of this essay I will expand my medical analogy by discussing the Republican Party ’s genetic components that substantiate the notion that conservatism is a disease .
I will unambiguously define many of the “ signs and symptoms ” of this disease that are causing the irreversible death of the Republican Party .
Then , I will make a “ practical ” case for the destruction of “ Brand Republican . ”
Numerous examples exist in business and marketing that demonstrate the power of brands , how brands can be damaged , and what happens when those brands are irreparably and irreversibly damaged .
The end result for Republicans is that disillusionment , defections , and a resounding turning away from the Republican Party values will result in its inevitable relegation to the dust bin of history just as were the Whigs , the Bull Moose Party , and other fringe political federations .
Systems are defined as interacting or interdependent items forming a unified whole .
1
Together these interacting items act in concert to serve a common purpose , to influence the functioning , the life even , of the entire organism , entity , or in this case the Republican Party .
For this essay I will consider the values demonstrated and documented by Republicans witnessed through their social , economic , and political practices .
The signs and symptoms of multiple systems in failure that have so corrupted , diseased , and damaged the Republican Party –including its conservative ideology –make prediction of its inevitable death as certain as diagnosing a patient with inoperable metastasizing pancreatic cancer , severe trauma , or Alzheimer ’s disease .
The etiology of irreversible death of the Republican Party can be traced back to President Richard M. Nixon .
The most famous symptom was articulated by John W. Dean when he told President Nixon that , “ there is a cancer on the presidency . ”
Then followed the Watergate hearings and ignominious resignation .
The cancer of that Republican presidency metastasized during the presidency of Ronald Regan .

Mr Bush is facing intense debate over his troop surge strategy
The talks at al - Asad air base were attended by the US secretary of state , defence secretary , the US ambassador to Iraq and the head of US forces there .
They were joined by Iraq 's PM Nouri Maliki and other senior Iraqis .
Mr Bush is facing pressure at home for a US withdrawal , but he insisted any pull out will only result from a " calm assessment " by leaders on the ground .
This is the last big gathering of the president 's military advisers and the Iraqi leadership before the president decides on the way forward
Geoff Morrell
Pentagon spokesman
Transcript : Bush speech Bush tries to boost Iraq will
" Those decisions will be based on a calm assessment by our military commanders on the conditions on the ground , not a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the media , " said Mr Bush , addressing troops at the base on the US Labor Day holiday .
" In other words when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq it will be from a position of strength and success , not from a position of fear and failure . "
White House ' anger '
Speaking to reporters earlier , Mr Bush said his top officials had advised him that if current successes continue , security levels could be maintained with fewer troops .
However , he made no specific reference to how much troop numbers could be cut or any possible timetable for withdrawal , adding : " America does not abandon its friends .
America will not abandon the Iraqi people " .
The BBC's Matt Frei in Washington says the comment could have been a reference to UK forces who on the same day that Mr Bush was visiting Anbar withdrew their last troops from inside the southern city of Basra .
A total of 5,550 UK troops are now located at the airport outside Basra and their Basra Palace base is under Iraqi control .
The meeting in Anbar , which a Pentagon official called a " war council " , comes just days before a key report on how Mr Bush 's surge strategy is faring .
On 10 and 11 September , the head of US forces in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and the US ambassador , Ryan Crocker , are due to report to Congress on the situation in Iraq , focusing particularly on the effect of the surge , which reached full levels in June .
Secrecy
The president was accompanied on his visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the US national security adviser , Steven Hadley .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates arrived ahead of Mr Bush for talks with senior US officials including Gen Petraeus and Mr Crocker .
" This is the last big gathering of the president 's military advisers and the Iraqi leadership before the president decides on the way forward , " Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said .
Mr Maliki travelled to Anbar for just the third time since taking office
In an extraordinary move , Iraq 's senior leaders , including Prime Minister Maliki and President Jalal Talabani , travelled to Anbar to meet Mr Bush .
For Mr Maliki , a Shia , it was only his third visit to the Sunni - dominated province .
The last time Mr Bush was in Iraq was more than a year ago .
Now , as then , the surprise trip was shrouded in secrecy because of the ongoing instability .
He stopped unannounced on board Air Force
One en route to a summit of Asia - Pacific leaders in Australia and remained on the heavily protected air base for the duration of his visit .
He has now left Iraq and is headed to Sydney .
The BBC's Hugh Sykes , in Baghdad , says Mr Bush 's decision to land in Anbar province is significant .
Anbar , west of Baghdad , has often been referred to as the centre of the Sunni insurgency , but the US now believes it has greatly reduced the threat from Sunni Arab militant groups , such as al - Qaeda in Iraq , our correspondent says .
Several imams have been killed for supporting US - led forces and preaching against al - Qaeda in Iraq at Friday prayers , and many local tribes have turned against the insurgents , he adds .
Security Risks of Online Political Contributing
Security researcher Christopher Soghoian gave a presentation this month warning of the potential phishing risk caused by online political donation sites .
The Threat Level blog reported :
The presidential campaigns ’ tactic of relying on impulsive giving spurred by controversial news events and hyped - up deadlines , combined with a number of other factors such as inconsistent Web addresses and a muddle of payment mechanisms creates a conducive environment for fraud , says Soghoian .
“ Basically , the problem here is that banks are doing their best to promote safe online behavior , but the political campaigns are taking advantage of the exact opposite , ” he says .
“ They send out one million e-mails to people designed to encourage impulsive behavior . ”
He characterizes the current state of security of the presidential campaigns ’ online payment systems as a “ mess . ”
“ It ’s a disaster waiting to happen , ” he says .
Fraudsters could easily send out e-mails and establish Web sites that mimic the official campaigns ’ sites and similarly send out such e-mails that would encourage people to “ donate ” money without checking for the authenticity of the site .
He has a point , but it ’s not new to online contributions .
Fake charities and political organizations have long been problems .
When you get a solicitation in the mail for “ Concerned Citizens for a More Perfect Country ” — insert whatever personal definition you have for “ more perfect ” and “ country ” — you do n’t know if the money is going to your cause or into someone ’s pocket .
When you give money on the street to someone soliciting contributions for this cause or that one , you have no idea what will happen to the money at the end of the day .
In the end , contributing money requires trust .
While the Internet certainly makes frauds like this easier — anyone can set up a webpage that accepts PayPal and send out a zillion e-mails — it ’s nothing new .

Rev. Lennox Yearwood , Jr. , president of the Hip Hop Caucus , was attacked by six capitol police today , when he was stopped from entering the Cannon Caucus Room on Capitol Hill , where General Petreaus gave testimony today to a joint hearing for the House Arms Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee on the war in Iraq .
After waiting in line throughout the morning for the hearing that was scheduled to start at 12:30 pm , Rev. Yearwood was stopped from entering the room , while others behind him were allowed to enter .
He told the officers blocking his ability to enter the room , that he was waiting in line with everyone else and had the right to enter as well .
When they threatened him with arrest he responded with " I will not be arrested today . "
According to witnesses , six capitol police , without warning , " football tackled " him .
Yearwood : " The officers decided I was not going to get in Gen. Petreaus ' hearing when they saw my button , which says ' I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ . ' "
Capitol Police are not saying what the charges are , but an inside source has said that the charge is assaulting a police officer .
Rev. Yearwood may have a broken ankle as a result of this arrest .

Apparently , George Soros realized this almost 20 years ago .
Because he realized this , he was able to accumulate a fortune for himself and his family and his investors , by betting against the efforts of Western governments to support ideological Capitalism .
He nearly broke the Bank of England in one of his most lucrative bets , through his understanding that despite the fact that England had the best interests of its people at heart , that Capitalist greed would subvert their attempts to right their economy through magnanimity of the English Treasury .
Soros was then able to subvert the support of Capitalism by the English Government , and make billions for himself , his family and his investors .
What is clear ( which Soros obviously knew ) is that Capitalism is not a guarantor of Democracy , nor is Capitalism necessarily a foundation of Democracy , nor even its advocate .
Therefore government support of Capitalism is doomed to fail and capitalists are its primary beneficiaries .
Without a doubt , Soros is brilliant .
The rise of China , under the CCP is the best example today of what Soros predicted 20 years ago .

The latest addition to Guix 's ever - growing list of services is a little - known virtualization toolkit called Ganeti .
Ganeti is designed to keep virtual machines running on a cluster of servers even in the event of hardware failures , and to make maintenance and recovery tasks easy .
It is comparable to tools such as Proxmox or oVirt , but has some distinctive features .
One is that there is no GUI : third party ones exist , but are not currently packaged in Guix , so you are left with a rich command - line client and a fully featured remote API .
Another interesting feature is that installing Ganeti on its own leaves you no way to actually deploy any virtual machines .
That probably sounds crazy , but stems from the fact that Ganeti is designed to be API - driven and automated , thus it comes with a OS API and users need to install one or more OS providers in addition to Ganeti .
OS providers offer a declarative way to deploy virtual machine variants and should feel natural to Guix users .
At the time of writing , the providers available in Guix are debootstrap for provisioning Debian - and Ubuntu - based VMs , and of course a Guix provider .
Finally Ganeti comes with a sophisticated instance allocation framework that efficiently packs virtual machines across a cluster while maintaining N+1 redundancy in case of a failover scenario .
It can also make informed scheduling decisions based on various cluster tags , such as ensuring primary and secondary nodes are on different power distribution lines .
( Note : if you are looking for a way to run just a few virtual machines on your local computer , you are probably better off using libvirt or even a Childhurd as Ganeti is fairly heavyweight and requires a complicated networking setup . )
Preparing the configuration
With introductions out of the way , let 's see how we can deploy a Ganeti cluster using Guix .
For this tutorial we will create a two - node cluster and connect instances to the local network using an Open vSwitch bridge with no VLANs .
We assume that each node has a single network interface named eth0 connected to the same network , and that a dedicated partition / dev/sdz3 is available for virtual machine storage .
It is possible to store VMs on a number of other storage backends , but a dedicated drive ( or rather LVM volume group ) is necessary to use the DRBD integration to replicate VM disks .
We 'll start off by defining a few helper services to create the Open vSwitch bridge and ensure the physical network interface is in the " up " state .
Since Open vSwich stores the configuration in a database , you might as well run the equivalent ovs-vsctl commands on the host once and be done with it , but we do it through the configuration system to ensure we do n't forget it in the future when adding or reinstalling nodes .
( use - modules ( gnu ) ( gnu packages linux ) ( gnu packages networking ) ( gnu services shepherd ) ) ( define ( start - interface if ) # ~( let ( ( ip # $( file - append iproute " / sbin/ip " ) ) ) ( invoke / quiet ip " link " " set " # $ if " up " ) ) ) ( define ( stop - interface if ) # ~( let ( ( ip # $( file - append iproute " / sbin/ip " ) ) ) ( invoke / quiet ip " link " " set " # $ if " down " ) ) ) ;;
This service is necessary to ensure eth0 is in the " up " state on boot ;; since it is otherwise unmanaged from Guix PoV. ( define ( ifup - service if ) ( let ( ( name ( string - append " ifup - " if ) ) ) ( simple - service name shepherd - root - service - type ( list ( shepherd - service ( provision ( list ( string -> symbol name ) ) ) ( start # ~( lambda ( ) # $ ( start - interface if ) ) ) ( stop # ~( lambda ( _ ) # $ ( stop - interface if ) ) ) ( respawn ? # f ) ) ) ) ) ) ;;
Note : Remove vlan_mode to use tagged VLANs .
( define ( create - openvswitch - bridge bridge uplink ) # ~( let ( ( ovs-vsctl ( lambda ( cmd ) ( apply invoke / quiet #$( file - append openvswitch " / bin/ovs-vsctl " ) ( string - tokenize cmd ) ) ) ) ) ( and ( ovs-vsctl ( string - append " - - may - exist add - br " # $bridge ) ) ( ovs-vsctl ( string - append " - - may - exist add - port " # $bridge " " # $uplink " vlan_mode=native - untagged " ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( create - openvswitch - internal - port bridge port ) #~( invoke / quiet #$( file - append openvswitch " / bin/ovs-vsctl " ) " - - may - exist " " add - port " # $bridge # $port " vlan_mode=native - untagged " " --" " set " " Interface " # $port " type=internal " ) ) ( define %openvswitch - configuration - service ( simple - service ' openvswitch - configuration shepherd - root - service - type ( list ( shepherd - service ( provision '( openvswitch - configuration ) ) ( requirement '( vswitchd ) ) ( start #~( lambda ( ) # $( create - openvswitch - bridge " br0 " " eth0 " ) # $( create -openvswitch - internal - port " br0 " " gnt0 " ) ) ) ( respawn ? # f ) ) ) ) )
This defines a openvswitch - configuration service object that creates a logical switch br0 , connects eth0 as the " uplink " , and creates a logical port gnt0 that we will use later as the main network interface for this system .
We also create an ifup service that can bring network interfaces up and down .
By themselves these variables do nothing , we also have to add them to our operating - system configuration below .
Such a configuration might be suitable for a small home network .
In a datacenter deployment you would likely use tagged VLANs , and maybe a traditional Linux bridge instead of Open vSwitch .
You can also forego bridging altogether with a routed networking setup , or do any combination of the three .
With this in place , we can start creating the operating - system configuration that we will use for the Ganeti servers :
; ; [ continued from the above configuration snippet ] ( use - service - modules base ganeti linux networking ssh ) ( operating - system ( host - name " node1 " ) [...] ;;
Ganeti requires that each node and the cluster name resolves to an ;; IP address .
The easiest way to achieve this is by adding everything ; ; to the hosts file .
( hosts - file ( plain - file " hosts " " 127.0.0.1 localhost ::1 localhost 192.168.1.200 ganeti.lan 192.168.1.201 node1 192.168.1.202 node2 " ) ) ( kernel - arguments ( append %default- kernel - arguments '( ; ; Disable DRBDs usermode helper , as Ganeti is the only entity ; ; that should manage DRBD .
" drbd.usermode_helper=/run/current-system/profile/bin/true " ) ) ) ( packages ( append ( map specification -> package ' ( " qemu " " drbd-utils " " lvm2 " " ganeti-instance - guix " " ganeti-instance - debootstrap " ) ) % base - packages ) ) ( services ( cons * ( service ganeti- service - type ( ganeti- configuration ( file - storage - paths '( " /srv/ganeti/file-storage " ) ) ( os ( list ( guix - os % default - guix - variants ) ( debootstrap - os ( list ( debootstrap - variant " buster " ( debootstrap - configuration ( suite " buster " ) ) ) ( debootstrap - variant " testing+contrib+paravirtualized " ( debootstrap - configuration ( suite " testing " ) ( hooks ( local - file " paravirt - hooks " #:recursive ? # t ) ) ( extra-pkgs ( delete " linux- image-amd64 " % default - debootstrap -extra-pkgs ) ) ( components ' ( " main " " contrib " ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;;
Ensure the DRBD kernel module is loaded .
( service kernel - module - loader - service - type ' ( " drbd " ) ) ;;
Create a static IP on the " gnt0 " Open vSwitch interface .
( service openvswitch - service - type ) %openvswitch - configuration - service ( ifup - service " eth0 " ) ( static - networking - service " gnt0 " " 192.168.1.201 " #:netmask " 255.255.255.0 " #:gateway " 192.168.1.1 " #:requirement '( openvswitch - configuration ) #:name - servers '( " 192.168.1.1 " ) ) ( service openssh - service - type ( openssh - configuration ( permit - root - login ' without - password ) ) ) % base - services ) ) )
Here we declare two OS " variants " for the debootstrap OS provider .
Debootstrap variants rely on a set of scripts ( known as " hooks " ) in the installation process to do things like configure networking , install bootloader , create users , etc .
In the example above , the " buster " variant uses the default hooks provided by Guix which configures network and GRUB , whereas the " testing +contrib+paravirtualized " variant use a local directory next to the configuration file named " paravirt - hooks " ( it is copied into the final system closure ) .
We also declare a default guix - os variant provided by Guix 's Ganeti service .
Ganeti veterans may be surprised that each OS variant has its own hooks .
The Ganeti deployments I 've seen use a single set of hooks for all variants , sometimes with additional logic inside the script based on the variant .
Guix offers a powerful abstraction that makes it trivial to create per-variant hooks , obsoleting the need for a big / etc / ganeti / instance - debootstrap / hooks directory .
Of course you can still create it if you wish and set the hooks property of the variants to #f .
Not all Ganeti options are exposed in the configuration system yet .
If you find it limiting , you can add custom files using extra-special - file , or ideally extend the < ganeti- configuration > data type to suite your needs .
You can also use gnt - cluster copyfile and gnt - cluster command to distribute files or run executables , but undeclared changes in /etc may be lost on the next reboot or reconfigure .
Initializing a cluster
At this stage , you should run guix system reconfigure with the new configuration on all nodes that will participate in the cluster .
If you do this over SSH or with guix deploy , beware that eth0 will lose network connectivity once it is " plugged in to " the virtual switch , and you need to add any IP configuration to gnt0 .
The Guix configuration system does not currently support declaring LVM volume groups , so we will create these manually on each node .
We could write our own declarative configuration like the %openvswitch - configuration - service , but for brevity and safety reasons we 'll do it " by hand " :
pvcreate / dev/sdz3 vgcreate ganetivg / dev/sdz3
On the node that will act as the " master node " , run the init command :
Warning : this will create new SSH keypairs , both host keys and for the root user !
You can prevent that by adding -- no - ssh- init , but then you will need to distribute / var / lib / ganeti / known_hosts to all hosts , and authorize the Ganeti key for the root user in openssh - configuration .
Here we let Ganeti manage the keys for simplicity .
As a bonus , we can automatically rotate the cluster keys in the future using gnt - cluster renew - crypto -- new - ssh- keys .
gnt - cluster init \ -- master-netdev=gnt0 \ --vg-name=ganetivg \ --enabled-disk-templates=file , plain , drbd \ --drbd-usermode-helper=/run/current-system/profile/bin/true \ --enabled-hypervisors=kvm \ -- hypervisor-parameters=kvm:kvm_flag=enabled \ --nic-parameters=mode=openvswitch, link=br0 \ --no-etc-hosts \ ganeti.lan
-- no-etc - hosts prevents Ganeti from automatically updating the /etc / hosts file when nodes are added or removed , which makes little sense on Guix because it is recreated every reboot / reconfigure .
See the gnt - cluster manual for information on the available options .
Most can be changed at runtime with gnt - cluster modify .
If all goes well , the command returns no output and you should have the ganeti.lan IP address visible on gnt0 .
You can run gnt - cluster verify to check that the cluster is in good shape .
Most likely it complains about something :

When using the KVM hypervisor , Ganeti expects to find a dedicated kernel image for virtual machines in / boot .
For this tutorial we only use fully virtualized instances ( meaning each VM runs its own kernel ) , so we can set kernel_path to an empty string to make the warning disappear :
gnt - cluster modify - H kvm:kernel_path=
Now let 's add our other machine to the cluster :
gnt - node add node2
Ganeti will log into the node , copy the cluster configuration and start the relevant Shepherd services .
You may need to authorize node1 's SSH key first .
Run gnt - cluster verify again to check that everything is in order :
gnt - cluster verify
If you used -- no - ssh - init earlier you will likely get SSH host key warnings here .
In that case you should update / var / lib / ganeti / known_hosts with the new node information , and distribute it with gnt - cluster copyfile or by adding it to the OS configuration .
The above configuration will make three operating systems available :
# gnt - os list Name debootstrap + buster debootstrap+testing+contrib+paravirtualized guix + default
Let 's try them out .
But first we 'll make Ganeti aware of our network so it can choose a static IP for the virtual machines .
# gnt-network add -- network=192.168.1.0/24 -- gateway=192.168.1.1 lan # gnt - network connect - N mode=openvswitch , link=br0 lan
Now we can add an instance :
root@node1 ~# gnt - instance add -- no - name - check -- no - ip - check \ -o debootstrap + buster -t drbd -- disk 0:size=5G \ -- net 0:network=lan , ip=pool bustervm1 Thu Jul 16 18:28:58 2020 - INFO : Selected nodes for instance bustervm1 via iallocator hail : node1 , node2 Thu Jul 16 18:28:58 2020 - INFO : NIC/0 inherits netparams [ ' br0 ' , ' openvswitch ' , '']

Ganeti will automatically select the optimal primary and secondary node for this VM based on available cluster resources .
You can manually specify primary and secondary nodes with the -n and -s options .
By default Ganeti assumes that the new instance is already configured in DNS , so we need -- no - name - check and - - no - ip - check to bypass some sanity tests .
Try adding another instance , now using the Guix OS provider with the ' plain ' ( LVM ) disk backend :
gnt - instance add -- no - name - check -- no - ip - check -o guix + default \ -t plain -- disk 0:size=5G - B memory=1G , vcpus=2 \ -- net 0:network=lan , ip=pool \ guix1
The guix + default variant has a configuration that starts an SSH server and authorizes the hosts SSH key , and configures static networking based on information from Ganeti .
To use other configuration files , you should declare variants with the config file as the configuration property .
The Guix provider also supports " OS parameters " that lets you specify a specific Guix commit or branch :
gnt - instance add -- no - name - check -- no - ip - check \ -o guix + gnome - O " commit= < commit > " \ - H kvm:spice_bind=0.0.0.0,cpu_type=host \ -t file -- file - storage-dir=/srv/ganeti/file-storage \ -- disk 0:size=20G - B minmem=1G , maxmem=6G,vcpus=3 \ -- net 0:network=lan , ip=pool -n node1 \ guix2
You can connect to a VM serial console using gnt - instance console < instance > .
For this last VM we used a hypothetical ' guix+gnome ' variant , and added a graphical SPICE console that you can connect to remotely using the spicy command .
If you are new to Ganeti , the next steps is to familiarize yourself with the gnt- family commands .
Fun stuff to do include gnt - instance migrate to move VMs between hosts , gnt - node evacuate to migrate all VMs off a node , and gnt - cluster master - failover to move the master role to a different node .
If you wish to start over for any reason , you can use gnt - cluster destroy .
Final remarks
The declarative nature of Guix maps well to Ganetis OS API .
OS variants can be composed and inherit from each other , something that is not easily achieved with traditional configuration management tools .
The author had a lot of fun creating native data types in the Guix configuration system for Ganetis OS configuration , and it made me wonder whether other parts of Ganeti could be made declarative such as aspects of instance and cluster configuration .
In any case I 'm happy and excited to finally be able to use Guix as a Ganeti host OS .
Like most services in Guix , Ganeti comes with a system test that runs in a VM and ensures that things like initializing a cluster work .
The continuous integration system runs this automatically whenever a dependency is updated , and provides comfort that both the package and service is in a good shape .
Currently it has rudimentary service tests , but it can conceivably be extended to provision a real cluster inside Ganeti and try things like master - failover and live migration .
So far only the KVM hypervisor has been tested .
If you use LXC or Xen with Ganeti , please reach out to guix-devel@gnu.org and share your experience .

Mr Thompson said the plans involved ' difficult choices '
Thompson 's key points
Up to 1,800 staff will also be made redundant - primarily in news , BBC programme - making and regional centres .
The BBC will also sell - off its flagship Television Centre , under the plans to make up a £ 2bn budget shortfall .
But unions are threatening strike action if the corporation calls on staff to volunteer for redundancy .
Director General Mark Thompson said his plan would deliver " a smaller , but fitter , BBC " in the digital age .
The six - year scheme , called Delivering Creative Future , was prompted by a smaller than expected licence fee settlement from the government .
Every part of the BBC will be required to make efficiency savings .
The main changes include :
' Minimum ' repeats
Across TV as a whole , the BBC plans to commission 10 % fewer hours , saving £ 100 m every year .
Despite press speculation , digital channels BBC Three and BBC Four will remain .
HAVE YOUR SAY
More repeats are fine so long as you show programmes people want to see again
Paul Tapner , Poole , UK
Send us your comments
Repeats during the BBC
One peak viewing times would continue to be kept at a minimum .
Programmes like Panorama , Imagine , Horizon and Who Do You Think You Are ? are " safe " , but there will be less light factual " middle - ground " programming , she said .
Ms Bennett also said there would be a " significant investment " in High - Definition TV , which launches next year , and a shift to on - demand and interactive programming .
She said plans to make programmes available through the iPlayer and other interactive platforms were " meeting the needs of our audience " .
Despite 660 redundancies in the BBC 's programme - making department - BBC Vision - she said the corporation would continue to provide a wide range of original drama , such as Spooks , as well as comedy , popular entertainment , and " world class " factual output .
Up to 370 people will be made redundant in BBC News by 2012 , but the process is expected to be pushed through " as fast as possible " .
' Powerful vision '
Mr Thompson told staff : " BBC News is , and will remain , the cornerstone of the whole organisation .
The proportion of content spend that goes to News will go up not down over the coming years . "
Plans for BBC journalism include an enhanced on - demand news , sport and local information for the digital age .
There are also plans to build content for younger audiences , including a multi-media Radio 1 Newsbeat .
Nothing said today reassures us that the BBC is committed to meaningful negotiations over the change
Jeremy Dear , NUJ
Shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC News 24 he had concerns at the nature of the job cuts .
He said : " You have to be very careful that if you are streamlining newsrooms it does not affect quality . "
Unions say they will write to the BBC requesting that they meet for meaningful negotiations on the announced " savage " cuts .
The letter will include a demand for the redundancy process to be halted immediately , with a deadline of midday on Friday .
The National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) and the broadcasting workers union Bectu said 3,000 letters had already been prepared , bearing Friday 's date , asking for volunteers .
Gerry Morrissey , general secretary of Bectu , said he " very confident " his members would support industrial action .
NUJ general secretary Jeremy Dear said : " Nothing said today reassures us that the BBC is committed to meaningful negotiations over the change .
" Unless the BBC reconsiders its position , strike action looks inevitable . "
BBC NET REDUNDANCIES BY DEPARTMENT
Over the past couple of months , most of the rhetoric from top Bush administration officials about the public debate over Iraq has been fairly encouraging .
Sure , far - right activists have said dissent is treasonous .
And sure , in February , when lawmakers were passing a non-binding resolution criticizing the escalation strategy , Tony Snow went so far as to suggest that the debate itself brought “ comfort ” to terrorists .
But in practical terms , senior administration officials have made clear how wrong this is .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in April that demands in Congress for a timeline to withdraw are good for Iraq because they exert pressure on Iraq ’s leaders .
Condoleezza Rice used congressional debate the same way .
And yet , some shamelessly demagogic talking points apparently die hard .
The Pentagon told Democratic presidential front - runner Hillary Rodham Clinton that her questions about how the U.S. plans to eventually withdraw from Iraq boosts enemy propaganda .
In a stinging rebuke to a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Undersecretary of Defense Eric Edelman [ said ] , “ Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq , much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam , Lebanon and Somalia . "
Got that ?
Even discussing withdrawal helps the enemy .
Amanda helped explain how wrong Edelman , a former Cheney aide , is .
I 've been stumping down this long , stony corridor for about five minutes , trying to reach a remote chamber where I 'll battle a dread knight .
But it 's ponderously slow going , because there 's too many twisty nooks – which attract evil bats , so I 'm forced to stop and fight every 20 seconds .
So , like many RPG gamers , I start bitching : Who designed this place ?
Ah , that 's the problem .
I did .
I was playing Dungeon Maker : Hunting Ground on my PSP .
It 's a fairly by - the - numbers role - playing game , with one twist :
You create the dungeon yourself .
Basically , you build a small dungeon , then wander around in it in real time , killing any monsters that show up .
You use the loot from your kills to build an even more tricked - out , phat dungeon – which attracts ever more lethal and profitable monsters .
This allows you to build an even bigger dungeon , attracting yet more monsters , etc. , etc .
It is , if you can dig this , a recursive dungeon crawler .
And it is n't enough merely to build your dungeon big .
No , if you want to attract really top - flight monsters you need to understand their psychology , and even their aesthetics .
Evil spirits and mongrels ?
They like twisty , winding passages .
Intellectual Kobolds ?
They prefer book - lined studies , so they can get in a quiet evening of reading before you kill them .
The gameplay quickly turns into a sort of Extreme Makeover of the damned .
Before I knew it , I 'd spent seven hours frantically rearranging furniture and building new wings .
Basically , if you strip away the ghouls and enchanted magikal attacks , it 's a game about ... architecture .
Yet here 's the thing :
In a way , all games are .
That 's what " level design " is , after all : Architecture and landscape design .
If you listen to gamers rave – or complain – about their latest title , half the time they 're talking about what urban theorists would call the " built environment . "
When we assess the multiplayer maps for Halo 3 , we argue about whether there are enough nooks to hide inside , or sufficiently sneaky promontories from which to snipe .
We whine about the monotonous corridor design in most RPGs .
One of my only major complaints about Super Paper Mario was entirely architectural :
The game forced you to ponderously double back every time you wanted to reach a save point .
Similarly , one of the biggest complaints about multiplayer world games is that they force you spend hours meandering around on foot to reach quest points that are , virtually , miles apart .
( It 's like playing golf , without a golf cart , eternally , in hell . )
Why are online worlds created that way ?
It 's intentional :
The goal is to motivate newbies to " level up " high enough to get a mount they can ride around .
The design exists purely to nudge our behavior in a certain direction .
I understand the architectural intent , and I despise it .
Dungeon Maker , however , also managed to quell much of my whining , because it confronted me for the first time with how damn hard is it to build a good video - game dungeon .
Sure , I tried to avoid tediously long corridor crawls .
But every time I added another parlor room to lure another gibbering fiend , I inevitably added more complexity and more sprawl .
Then I 'd go into my creation and – whoops – my thumbs were numbed with the effort of schlepping from place to place .
By the time I 'd crafted my fourth level , I had the surreal experience of revisiting my first level and literally being unable to remember why the hell I made the creative decisions I 'd made .
Stupid , stupid : Putting the staircase in the far northeast passage ?
What was I thinking ?
" Man , " I thought as I lumbered down yet another passageway , " this dungeon blows . "
Granted , there have been previous video games that included level - design as a core part of the play – such as Neverwinter Nights , RPG Maker , or almost any moddable shooter .
But these usually required a level of scripting geekery that I ( and most average gamers ) did not possess .
Dungeon Maker makes it point - and - click easy .
I now wish that more RPGs offered DIY dungeon crafting – because as I 've discovered , architecture can be a weirdly enjoyable pastime .
Dungeon Maker was fun , but not because of the actual fighting :
The rote , button - mashing combat seemed practically to be an afterthought .
No , the joy was entirely in building .
It reminded me of when I was a kid and I 'd sit around with graph paper , designing massive Dungeons & Dragons levels and imagining how badly I 'd p0wn my friends .
( It was more fun making them than playing them , really . )
The design theorist Christopher Alexander used to claim that all humans have an innate facility for architecture – that everyone is capable of visualizing and imagining good living spaces .
Looking at today 's pop culture , where there are about 47 different reality TV shows devoted to home renovation , you could argue that he was right .
And did you ever wonder how The Sims became the world 's top - selling game ?
It 's not because people actually play it .
Most players set up a couple of families and watch them evolve , but this quickly gets dull .
Ah , but then Sims gamers discover the real game within the game .
They learn about the cheats that give them infinite simoleans – whereupon they begin joyfully building uninhabited monster homes , a pastime that accounts for the vast majority of the game 's replayability .
Will Wright 's genius was n't in making a sim of human life .
It was in making the world 's easiest - to - use CAD tool .
Apparently , there 's a dungeonmaster in all of us – just waiting to come out .
Men 's hairstyles reflect their ' ideological spirit '
North Korea has launched an intensive media assault on its latest arch enemy - the wrong haircut .
A campaign exhorting men to get a proper short - back - and - sides has been aired by state - run Pyongyang television .
The series is entitled Let us trim our hair in accordance with Socialist lifestyle .
While the campaign has been carried out primarily on television , reports have appeared in North Korean press and radio , urging tidy hairstyles and proper attire .
It is the strongest media campaign against men's sloppy appearances mounted in the reclusive and impoverished Communist state in recent years .
The propaganda drive on grooming standards has gone a stage further than previous attempts .
This time television identifies specific individuals deemed too shoddy .
Crew cut
Pyongyang television started the campaign last autumn with a five - part series in its regular TV Common Sense programme .
How the propaganda campaign looks on Pyongyang television
In pictures
Stressing hygiene and health , it showed various state - approved short hairstyles including the " flat - top crew cut , " " middle hairstyle , " " low hairstyle , " and " high hairstyle " - variations from one to five centimetres in length .
The programme allowed men aged over 50 seven centimetres of upper hair to cover balding .
It stressed the " negative effects " of long hair on " human intelligence development " , noting that long hair " consumes a great deal of nutrition " and could thus rob the brain of energy .
Men should get a haircut every 15 days , it recommended .
Named and shamed
A second , and unprecedented , TV series this winter showed hidden - camera style video of " long - haired " men in various locations throughout Pyongyang .
Hair is a very important issue that shows the people 's cultural standards and mental and moral state
Minju Choson newspaper
In a break with North Korean TV 's usual approach , the programme gave their names and addresses , and challenged the fashion victims directly over their appearance .
The North Korean media normally reserves the reporting of names of its citizens to exemplary individuals who show high communist virtues .
The series was shot at various public locations - on the street , at a sports stadium , a barbershop , a bus stop , a restaurant , a department store .
Some unruly - haired pedestrians or customers captured on camera " meanly ran away " , the programme said , while others made excuses about being too busy to get a trim .
Television newsreels such as " Employees of Pyongyang Textile Plant keep their hairstyle and dressing neat and tidy " and " Hairdressers at Ch'anggwangwo'n manage men's hair according to the demands of the military - first era " have also aired .
What not to wear
State radio programmes such as " Dressing in accordance with our people 's emotion and taste " link clothes and appearance with the wearer 's " ideological and mental state " .
People who wear other 's style of dress and live in other 's style will become fools and that nation will come to ruin
Nodong Sinmun newspaper
Tidy attire " is important in repelling the enemies ' manoeuvres to infiltrate corrupt capitalist ideas and lifestyle and establishing the socialist lifestyle of the military - first era , " the radio says .
Newspapers too highlight the civic advantages of short hair and smart shoes .
Hair is a " very important issue that shows the people 's cultural standards and mental and moral state " , argues Minju Choson , a government daily .
" No matter how good the clothes , if one does not wear tidy shoes , one 's personality will be downgraded . "
For party papers such as Nodong Sinmun , the struggle against foreign and anti-communist influence is being fought out in the arena of personal appearance .
" People who wear other 's style of dress and live in other 's style will become fools and that nation will come to ruin , " it says .

Whatever underlying causes science may show in time , and they may be several , the more immediate contributing factors for sleep bruxism are better understood .
The medical literature shows that stress , smoking , alcohol , caffeine and other factors may set off or worsen the condition .
So what ’s a grinder to do ?
Right away , my dentist suggested fitting me with a mouth guard , a small plastic device that covers some or all of the teeth to protect them against damage , but does not stop the grinding or clenching itself .
Unable to afford the $ 300 price tag at the time , I got an over - the - counter version at the drugstore for $ 20 .
“ The over - the - counter guards are usually better than nothing , ” said Dr. Charles McNeill , director of the Center for Orofacial Pain at the University of California , San Francisco .
They protect the teeth , he says , but may also be more likely to induce a chewing response and increase bruxism ; they can also cause irreversible damage to the bite , or arrangement of the teeth , and so should be used only temporarily .
Guards made by a dentist last longer , fit better and are generally designed to distribute the force of grinding to reduce jaw pain .
Feeling frustrated about my persistent bruxism , I was determined to find a way to stop altogether .
Having started grinding during an especially hectic period in my life , I assumed that it was caused by stress .
I tried relaxation techniques like yoga , exercise , biofeedback and hypnotherapy .
Much as these may have helped my overall health , they did n’t seem to kick the football player out of my bed .
Besides , even well after the initial stressor had passed , I was still grinding .

So I did what any reasonable person would do : I turned to drugs .
The medical literature on bruxism showed that anti-anxiety medications like buspirone and clonazepam had worked on some patients ; buspirone only made me jittery , but clonazepam brought my bruxism to , well , a grinding halt .
“ Clonazepam would be a fantastic treatment , but it ’s potentially habit - forming ; it works too well , ” said Dr. Michael Gelb , a clinical professor at the New York University College of Dentistry .
“ The better the pharmacological treatment works , the more fraught it is with difficulty . ”
In two months , I became habituated to the drug and its effect began to diminish .
I now use it only occasionally .
So much for drugs .
What is going on at the FCC ?
The agency established the rules for the upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction back in August , but it turns out that these were not so much " rules " as " suggestions for discussion . "
Verizon , AT&T , and Frontline Wireless have all since petitioned the FCC to change the rules in different ways .
AT&T wants more clarity around the " public / private partnership " part of the auction , while Frontline wants a lower reserve price .
Verizon , however , is directly targeting the most innovative part of the auction , the " open access " requirements on some of the new spectrum .
It has filed a federal lawsuit asking that this part of the rules be struck down by a judge , and it also appears to be lobbying the FCC directly to water them down .
Google , which fought hard for those rules ( and actually wanted more " open " conditions applied ) , is now attacking Verizon both in public and at the FCC .
While Verizon 's court case proceeds through the legal system , the company 's competitors have grown unhappy with the way that Verizon has handled its FCC lobbying .
Frontline Wireless has gone so far as to ask the FCC to bar Verizon from the auction because Verizon has allegedly not disclosed some of its lobbying contacts with the agency quickly enough or in enough detail .
Despite Verizon 's reticence to spell out exactly what it has been talking about with FCC Chairman Kevin Martin in private meetings , Google believes that it has pieced the conversation together .
Google 's understanding is that Verizon wants the FCC to impose the open access requirements only on the network , not on the devices .
That is , Verizon could still sell handsets that are locked and controlled by the company , but its network would have to be open to unlocked handsets from any operator .
According to Google 's new public statement on the issue , " From our perspective , this view ignores the realities of the U.S. wireless market , where some 95 percent of handsets are sold in retail stores run by the large carriers .
More to the point , it is simply contrary to what the FCC 's new rules actually say . "
Those rules focus on customer freedom to access content and applications from any device .
In a filing with the FCC , Google asks the agency to stick to its original plan .
The company points out that while the open access rules might make the spectrum less attractive to Verizon ( and thus might bring in less money at auction ) , the rules actually make it " more attractive , not less " to Google .
Such arguments , both in FCC filings and in public , are coming thick and fast .
The FCC has set a January date for the 700MHz auction , so we should know quite soon if any changes will be made to the auction rules .
Google continues to shield itself in a strategic cloud of uncertainty , but the vigor with which it addresses these issues certainly suggests , at the least , that the company has n't ruled out a bid .

Hypnosis is a very complex mental state that , for a variety of reasons , can be hard to explain concisely .
If we had to tag hypnosis using a single word , it would be “ focus . ”
In the broadest terms , hypnosis is a state of human consciousness that includes highly focused attention and reduced peripheral input during which people may also experience an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion .
Put another way , hypnosis is a state of awareness where you ’re both focused and relaxed at the same time .
A metaphor we often use is that hypnosis is similar to the feeling of being engrossed in a movie or a daydream .
You ’re less aware of the peripheral activity that may be around you , yet you ’re completely focused in a different kind of way .
When people are engaged by a daydream or a movie , an imaginary world seems to be “ real , ” in the sense that it fully engages your emotions .
Some researchers categorize these dream states as forms of self - hypnosis .
Milton Erickson , the late hypnosis expert who greatly expanded the field in the 20th century , believed that people hypnotize themselves on a daily basis .
The difference with intentional , or guided , hypnosis is that practitioners bring on the desired dream state by using strategically designed relaxation and focusing exercises .
This intentional form of hypnosis is believed to be deeper than what we experience in a daydream , and it ’s often compared to the relaxed mental state we experience between wakefulness and sleep .
The way hypnosis actually works is still the subject of debate among a variety of researchers .
What we do know , however , and what you should know , is that hypnosis works .
In this state of focused relaxation , you ’re more open to suggestions , visualizations and affirmations that can help establish new beliefs , which is a powerful and sometimes life - changing experience .
Forming new thought patterns in the subconscious mind can be the foundation for creating new , positive and most importantly lasting changes in your life .
To understand how , let ’s review some of the practical applications of hypnosis , and the real - world effects it can have on your life .
What Are the Practical Applications of Hypnosis ?
Since 1949 , hypnosis has most commonly been used as a supplemental approach to cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) .
CBT is a psychological intervention that focuses on the development of personal coping strategies and changing unhelpful patterns in thoughts and beliefs .
With its focus on updating the unconscious mind with new and more helpful information , it ’s clear how powerful hypnosis can be as a tool for personal growth .
Specifically , hypnosis has been shown to be effective in easing behavior disorders , such as anxiety , depression , phobias and eating disorders .
Yet psychological therapy is far from the only application for hypnosis .
And it ’s important to note that while hypnosis is a safe tool to make positive changes in your life , the process is not therapeutic in and of itself .
There are literally hundreds of scientific studies by institutions like the Stanford University School of Medicine that have tested the effectiveness of hypnosis and proven its effects on conditions like weight management , insomnia and smoking cessation .
This practice has been employed in a wide variety of fields , including self - improvement , forensics , sports , education , physical therapy and rehabilitation .
So how does hypnosis work ?
You can think of it this way : your subconscious mind speaks a different language than your conscious mind .
During hypnosis , a trained therapist speaks directly to the subconscious in a language that it understands .
By using patterns , association and metaphors , you can update the unconscious mind with new , more helpful information .
When you are able to change your way of thinking in such a fundamental way , you can essentially change the way you live your life .
You can relieve negative emotions and behaviors — such as doubt , anxiety , addiction or depression — often without resorting to medications or other treatments with potentially negative side effects .
( Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen . )
What Effects Does Hypnosis Have ?
In a conventional hypnotic state , a person accepts the suggestions of the hypnotist as if they were reality .
The effects can seem very real ; but because hypnosis is a safe space , you are always aware that it ’s all imaginary .
And because you are aware , hypnotic suggestion can’t force you to do something you do n’t want .
It ’s somewhat like “ pretending ” as children do , but at a different level of maturity , and with specific results in mind ( altering your diet or reducing stress , for example ) .
In a hypnotic state , people very often feel uninhibited and relaxed .
It ’s thought that because you are in such a focused state , it allows you to tune out anxieties and doubts that normally keep your actions in check .
Much like watching an absorbing movie , you ’re only thinking about this moment in time .
A hypnotized individual may appear to outsiders to only listen to and respond to the communications of the hypnotist .
As we mentioned previously , in a hypnotic state , an individual can actually see , feel , smell and otherwise perceive their “ reality ” in concert with the hypnotist ’s suggestions , even though those stimuli are clearly not in the room .
However , the effects of hypnosis are by no means limited to sensory change .
Even the way you view memories and yourself may be altered by suggestion .
Consequently , the process of altering the subconscious can be extended , post - hypnotically , into your waking life .
The mental experience of hypnosis can vary dramatically from one subject to another .
Some hypnotized people report feeling a sense of detachment or extreme relaxation , while others may experience hypnosis as if it happens outside of their conscious volition .
Still others may remain fully aware and able to engage while under hypnosis , while still retaining the benefits of altering the subconscious mind .
Hypnosis Is a Safe and Effective Therapy to Make Positive , Permanent Changes
Having a more thorough , more realistic understanding of what hypnosis is and how it helps can be a handy tool in your emotional toolbox .
Hypnosis is an authentic therapeutic tool with a long history backed by research and practice .
However , it is important that you engage with an accredited and experienced hypnotist or hypnotherapist so you can trust the guided process and create a structured plan to help you reach your individual goals .
A new film about the real - life rape and killing of a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl by US soldiers who also murdered her family stunned the Venice festival , with shocking images that left some viewers in tears .
Redacted , by US director Brian De Palma , is one of at least eight American films on the war in Iraq due for release in the next few months and the first of two movies on the conflict screening in Venice 's main competition .
Inspired by one of the most serious crimes committed by American soldiers in Iraq since the 2003 invasion , it is a harrowing indictment of the conflict and spares the audience no brutality to get its message across .
De Palma , 66 , whose Casualties of War in 1989 told a similar tale of abuse by American soldiers in Vietnam , makes no secret of the goal he is hoping to achieve with the film 's images , all based on real material he found on the Internet .
" The movie is an attempt to bring the reality of what is happening in Iraq to the American people , " he told reporters after a press screening .
" The pictures are what will stop the war .
One only hopes that these images will get the public incensed enough to motivate their Congressmen to vote against this war . "
Abeer Qasim Hamza al - Janabi was gang raped , killed and burnt by American soldiers in Mahmudiya , south of Baghdad , in March 2006 .
Her parents and younger sister were also killed .
Five soldiers have since been charged with the attack .
Four of them have been given sentences of between five and 110 years .
' All on the internet '
Halfway between documentary and fiction , Redacted draws on soldiers ' home - made war videos , blogs and journals and footage posted on YouTube , reflecting changes in the way the media cover the war .
" In Vietnam , when we saw the images and the sorrow of the people we were traumatising and killing , we saw the soldiers wounded and brought back in body bags .
We see none of that in this war , " De Palma said .
" It 's all out there on the Internet , you can find it if you look for it , but it 's not in the major media .
The media is now really part of the corporate establishment , " he said .
The film 's title refers to how , according to De Palma , mainstream American newspapers and television channels are failing to tell the true story of the war by keeping the most graphic images of the conflict away from public opinion .
" When I went out to find the pictures , I said ( to the media ) give me the pictures you can't publish , " he said , adding that because of legal dangers he too had to " edit " the material .
" Everything that is in the movie is based on something I found that actually happened .
But once I had put it in the script I would get a note from a lawyer saying you can't use that because it 's real and we may get sued , " De Palma said .
" So I was forced to fictionalise things that were actually real . "
The film , shot in Jordan with a little known cast , ends with a series of photographs of Iraqi civilians killed and their faces blacked out for legal reasons .
" I think that 's terrible because now we have not even given the dignity of faces to this suffering people , " De Palma said .
" The great irony about Redacted is that it was redacted . "
Distributor Magnolia has planned a limited US release for later this year , and the film may be easier to sell to European audiences rather than to the American public .
" This is a harrowing experience you put the audience through .
It is not something you want to go to on a delightful Saturday evening but this message must be put forward and hopefully the public will respond , " De Palma said .

Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio , a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security , has been denied clearance to examine the White House ’s plan for operating the government in the aftermath of a terrorist attack .
The Oregonian reports that DeFazio requested to see the classified plans after being contacted by constituents who expressed concern that the plans contained a conspiracy .
De Fazio is puzzled by the White House ’s denial of his request :
I just ca n’t believe they ’re going to deny a member of Congress the right of reviewing how they plan to conduct the government of the United States after a significant terrorist attack .
De Fazio has never been denied access to classified documents before .
Trey Bohn , White House spokesman , says that it ’s nobody ’s business why DeFazio was denied access to the plans :
We do not comment through the press on the process that this access entails .
It is important to keep in mind that much of the information related to the continuity of government is highly sensitive .
Norm Ornstein a conservative legal scholar at the American Enterprise think tank , says he can’t think of any reason why a member of Congress would be denied the right to review the plans .
Maybe the people who think there ’s a conspiracy out there are right .

The Universe within 14 billion Light Years
The Visible Universe
Number of superclusters in the visible universe = 10 million Number of galaxy groups in the visible universe = 25 billion Number of large galaxies in the visible universe = 350 billion Number of dwarf galaxies in the visible universe = 7 trillion Number of stars in the visible universe = 30 billion trillion ( 3x10 ² ² )
About the Map This map attempts to show the entire visible Universe .
The galaxies in the universe tend to collect into vast sheets and superclusters of galaxies surrounding large voids giving the universe a cellular appearance .
Because light in the universe only travels at a fixed speed , we see objects at the edge of the universe when it was very young up to 14 billion years ago .
The Size of the Universe
The visible universe appears to have a radius of 14 billion light years because the universe is about 14 billion years old .
The light from more distant objects simply has not had time to reach us .
For this reason everybody in the universe will find themselves at the middle of their own visible universe .
The precise scale of the universe is complicated by the fact that the universe is expanding .
Galaxies we see near the edge of the visible universe emitted their light when they were much closer to us , and they will now be much further away .
The true size of the universe is probably much larger than the visible universe .
The geometry of the universe suggests that it may have an infinite size and that it will expand forever .
Even if the universe is not infinite , our visible universe must be a minute speck in a much larger totality .
The Hubble Deep Field
In December 1995 , the Hubble Space Telescope was pointed at a blank area of the sky in Ursa Major for ten days .
It produced one of the most famous astronomy pictures of modern times - the Hubble Deep Field Image .
A part of it is shown here .
Almost every object in this image is a galaxy typically lying 5 to 10 billion light years away .
The galaxies revealed here are all shapes and colours , some are young and blue , whereas others are old , red and dusty .
The Hubble Space Telescope has also produced two other similar pictures : the Hubble Deep Field South in 1998 and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field in 2004 .
A Slice of the Universe
By collecting distances to thousands of galaxies in a narrow strip of the sky , it is possible to produce a slice of the universe , like this one shown below from The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey which looks out into the universe to 3.5 billion light years , although not much data was collected for galaxies beyond 3 billion light years .
These types of plots show how clustered the galaxies in the universe really are , even on the largest scales .
About 52 000 galaxies are plotted .
Do you really think there ’s anyone in our office that does n’t view you , your time and your privacy with the utmost respect ?
One reason people who respect your time interrupt you is that they believe that the activity requiring your participation is urgent .
And if the activity they are interrupting is actual programming , you probably view them as impeding your ability to accomplish something important .
In My “ Working ” Day , I described an office with an “ interrupt - driven ” culture .
And in the comments , someone ( probably from the same office ) asked This is an important point .
Ofthe people I choose as my colleagues view my time with respect .
Naturally .
But interruptions can still cause a disconnect even when people consider your time a precious commodity .
They are n’t interrupting me because they think my time is worthless .
They ’re interrupting me because with the information they have at the moment , a conversation with me is the most valuable activity the two of us can conduct for the company .
That is n’t so odd .
They have a different set of information in front of them , so while I look at the situation and think :
The best use of my time is making sure that deliverable X is complete in this iteration , they look at the situation and think :
The best use of Reg ’s time is giving me a status update on deliverable X , so I can provide top - notch customer service when I call the client in five minutes .
Am I right overall ?
Are they right overall ?
What is the most important thing for me to be working on at this moment ?
One model for understanding the conflict is to judge activities on two orthogonal scales : importance , which measures long - term value and assumes that you can perform the task now or later , and urgency , which measures the degree to which the value of a task declines if you execute it later .
( Of course , both scales go into the negative as well as the positive .
So the value of writing a rent cheque is that you avoid an incredibly negative outcome in the future ) .
If the quasi-economic explanation of the difference does n’t strike a chord , try the exercise Steven Covey suggests in his book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People : Look back on last year .
The whole year .
Now ask yourself : of all the things you wanted to accomplish , what would you like to have done if you had more time ?
Those things are the things that were important but not urgent .
Making time to do things that are important but not urgent is one of life ’s greatest challenges .
Do you really want to learn a new programming language ?
Network with more people ?
Read more books ?
Visit your mother more often ?
You need to make the time to make it happen .
You need to find a way to take time away from urgent activities and give it to important activities .
A reasonable explanation for the conflict between the boss who wants status now and the programmer who wants to get into the flow and complete the work is that the programmer is concentrating on the important while the boss is concentrating on the urgent .
After all , if it was n’t urgent , the boss would request status by email , or wait for the next daily meeting we have on that particular project .
She ’s no dummy , she would n’t be asking now if she did n’t need an answer now .
And if it was n’t important , the programmer would n’t be so obsessed with trying to focus and do it right , trying to think all of the consequences and cases through so as to produce a really solid piece of code .
To summarize , one reason people who respect your time interrupt you is that they believe that the activity requiring your participation is urgent .
And if the activity they are interrupting is actual programming , you probably view them as impeding your ability to accomplish something important .
There ’s another important factor to consider .
Let ’s say that you and your boss synchronize on importance and urgency .
Let ’s say you see eye to eye on how to evaluate what you ought to be doing at any one moment in time .
Can you now allow your boss to interrupt you at will and still maximize the value you provide to her ?
This is a trick question .
What does it mean “ to evaluate what you ought to be doing at any one moment in time ? ”
Does it mean that you can look at all the data in front of you , stuff it into some kind of choice function , and out pops the activity you ought to be doing ?
The answer for my fellow programmers is , Yes , but the function is a closure .
In other words , local maxima are not global maxima .
Or if you like compilers , peephole optimization is most pessimum Let ’s take an example .
What ’s the best use of your time right now ?
Programming ?
Ok , why is n’t that the best use of your time 24/7/365 ?
Forget sleep and social interaction and other non-work things if that seems complicated .
Let ’s just think about work .
Why do anything else while you ’re at work ?
The answer , of course , is that the optimal use of your time involves a balance between different ways of producing value .
Code is more important than documents .
But code without any documents , ever , is less valuable than code with a certain amount of well - written documentation .
And a lead programmer needs to write code .
But they also need to coach their colleagues .
So why do n’t they just code ?
Or just coach ?
It turns out that people who just coach , consultants … oh well , you can fill that one in .
And more than a few electrons have zipped through the pipes about programmers who only produce code , but never interact with their colleagues .
Most teams need leads who have a balance between producing code and raising the value of their colleagues .
Another classic example is a bug .
Stuart reports a bug in Sally ’s code .
It does n’t erase user data or install a root kit .
Should Sally fix it ?
Stupid question .
Once you leave the comfort of a weblog , you know that you cannot evaluate any but the most catastrophic show - stoppers individually .
If you try to make these decisions one at a time , you invariably will work on the wrong things .
You need to establish a rhythm of bug triage meetings , so that at any one time you are looking at enough bugs that you can choose those with the highest value and skip those that are not relatively important .
Balancing activities to produce the overall maximum value for your team ( or yourself if you are a team of one ) requires a broad view of your priorities and activities , just like triaging bugs requires a broad view of the outstanding issues with a release .
You ca n’t make those decisions on a report - by - report basis , you need to optimize globally .
Which leads us back to interruptions .
The primary issue with an interrupt - driven culture is not that people do n’t respect each other ’s time .
It ’s that making decisions on a moment - by - moment basis means you never have the perspective with respect to what ’s important and to the overall balance of what you need to be doing to maximize the value you deliver to your team .
That ’s why time management systems like Getting Things Done place such a premium on daily and weekly reviews : you ca n’t be effective if you are a slave to the to do list and never step back to optimize the value you create in your life .
Interruptions may maximize response to urgent issues .
Interruptions may appear to be the best use of your time given the information the interrupter has at the time .
But other people almost never have all the information you have to know what you need to be doing right now , so for this reason regular interruptions sacrifice your global maximum value for the appearance of local maximum .
And for that reason , it is easy for other people to have the utmost respect for the value of my time but still impeded me from providing the maximum value to our team if they chose to interrupt me rather than using asynchronous channels like email .
In general , if what you want from programmers are working programs , do n’t interrupt them .
Maximize their programming productivity in every way you know how But do n’t you think the managers running an “ interrupt - driven ” workplace know that ?
Of course they do .
They know how to maximize the production of programs , starting with hiring great programmers and working from there .
If they are n’t doing those kinds of things , it may be that they are n’t trying to maximize programming productivity .
There could be many reasons for this .
Perhaps they run their business on a time and materials basis , so they are trying to maximize customer service while optimizing for the cost of labour .
A programmer who wishes to be successful in a particular culture should be careful that programming is really their boss ’ number one priority before trying to optimize their personal programming productivity .
The bottom line , again , is that their colleagues may respect their time to the utmost , but not believe that it is best spent with their head down programming .
In that case , the only problem I have with interruptions is the realization that what I think is important is out of sync with what the team thinks is important .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . -- NASA 's shuttle Endeavour and its seven - astronaut crew returned to EarthTuesday , landing one day early due to earlier concerns that Hurricane Deancould disrupt Mission Control operations in Texas .
Endeavourswooped down out of the Florida sky to loose two sonorous sonic booms beforemaking a 12:32 p.m. EDT ( 1632 GMT ) touchdown at NASA 's Shuttle Landing Facilityhere at the Kennedy Space Center .
" Althoughit 's been a short two weeks , we 've accomplished a lot , " shuttle commanderScott Kelly told Mission Control this morning .
" We still look very muchforward to coming home today . "
Kelly andhis STS - 118 crew , which includes teacher - turned - astronautBarbara Morgan , delivered more than two tons of cargo to the ISS , wherethey replaced a broken gyroscope and installed a new starboard - side piece ofthe outpost 's main truss .
" Ithink the shuttle program gets an A - plus , " said Morgan , who served asNASA 's backup to Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe for the ill - fated 1986 Challenger mission , during the spaceflight .
" Once we do n't have theshuttle anymore , I think it 's going to be something we look back at with greatnostalgia and we 're really , really going to miss it . "
NASA chiefMichael Griffin told reporters after landing that Morgan was in good healthafter her first spaceflight , but required more time to readapt to Earth ' sgravity after spending almost two weeks in weightlessness .
Endeavour ' slanding completed a 5.3 million - mile ( 8.5 million - kilometer ) flight for theorbiter , its first in nearly five years following a major systems overhaul .
Theshuttle orbited the Earth about 201 times and landed with small , but deep , gouge in the heat - resistant tiles lining the orbiter ' sunderbelly , but mission managers found it posed no risk to the spacecraft ' sreentry .
NASA videoof the gouged tiles showed some signs of additional damage , but not theextensive surface tunneling depicted in ground tests last week .
NASA launch andentry flight director Steve Stich said Monday that he did not anticipate anyextra tile damage would hinder preparations for Endeavour 's next flight inFebruary .
" This flight has been extraordinarily productive , " said NASA space shuttleprogram manager Wayne Hale .
" Endeavour , in fact , has performed nearlyflawlessly . "
Returningto Earth aboard Endeavour with Kelly and Morgan were shuttle pilot CharlieHobaugh along with mission specialists Tracy Caldwell , Rick Mastracchio , AlvinDrew , Jr. and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Dave Williams .
Initiallyslated for a Wednesday return , Endeavour 's landing was pushed up one day due toconcerns that Hurricane Dean could prompt an evacuation of NASA 's MissionControl in Houston , Texas .
Those worries fell away over the last few days asthe massive storm headed instead towards central Mexico .
Homeagain
Duringtheir 13 - daymission , Endeavour 's astronaut crew performed four spacewalks to outfit thestation with a new , $ 11 million Starboard 5 ( S5 ) truss .
The small spacersegment primes the station for the deliver of its fourth and final set of U.S.solar arrays on a future shuttle flight .
" Ithink the best lesson is that this is truly a marvelous place to be , " Morgan said of the ISS .
" The station is incredible .
It is a work inprogress . "
Williamsset a new record for the most spacewalks and spacewalking time by a Canadianastronaut , and soaked up the views of his home planet during his threeconstruction sessions of the STS - 118 flight .
" Theview is very hard to describe , " Williams told reporters during themission .
" All around you , you 've got this panoramic view of Earth aroundyou .
It 's absolutely spectacular . "
Endeavour ' screw also installed a new spare parts platform outside the ISS .
The shuttlecast off from the ISS early Sunday , leaving behind the space station ' sthree - astronaut crew of Expedition 15 .
" Havea good trip home , and a very safe trip , " the station 's Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin told Endeavour 's crew .
" We are with you . "
Morework ahead
During theirflight , Endeavour 's crew primed the orbital laboratory 's mast - like Port 6 ( P6 ) truss for relocation to its port - most edge later this year .
The astronauts alsotopped off the station 's nitrogen tanks , delivered some 77 pounds ( 35 kilograms ) of oxygen and left the station 's Expedition 15 crew with 1,000 pounds ( 453 kilograms ) of extra water .
Yurchikinand his Expedition 15 crewmates , during the STS - 118 flight , successfullyreplaced a faulty electronics box and corroded cables responsible for a majorcomputer crash in June .
" Fromour perspective , we 're completely satisfied with the mission , " said MikeSuffredini , NASA 's ISS program manager , of STS - 118 .
" It met every objectivethat we needed to continue on with assembly . "
Some ofthat work begins next week on Aug. 30 , when the space station 's Expedition 15 crew will move a conical docking port on the station 's Unity connecting node tomake way for a new module later this year .
NASA plansat least 11 more shuttle flights to complete construction of the ISS bySeptember 2010 , when the space agency plans to retire its three - orbiter fleet .
Two flights are slated to fly later this year :
The shuttle Discovery isscheduled to launch the new Harmony connecting node on Oct. 23 , and Atlantis isset to haul the European Columbus laboratory to the ISS on Dec. 6 .
Tuesday ' slanding completed NASA 's 119th shuttle flight -- the 22nd bound forthe ISS -- and the 20th spaceflight for Endeavour .
NASA will now begin primingthe shuttle for its next flight , STS - 123 in February 2008 , to deliver the firstcomponent of Japan 's Kibo laboratory to the space station .
Paris has many unusual shops , but one of the most unusual has to be Deyrolle , a 170 - year old establishment on rue du Bac , not far from the Musee d'Orsay on the Left Bank .
To describe it as a taxidermy shop hardly does it justice .
The ground floor looks like a fairly ordinary small home and garden shop ( apart from a couple of stuffed gazelles standing on their hind legs and dressed to look like humans ) .
But walking up the stairs is like passing through a time warp .
The second story ( which in France is considered the first ) appears to have changed little since the store moved to its current location in 1881 .
It 's dusty , chaotic , and crammed with stuffed animals of all shapes , sizes , and poses , as well as ancient wooden cases full of insects , shells , botanical prints and a variety of curiosities .
As the pictures here suggest , it 's really a museum masquerading as a store .
UPDATE : June 2011 - Deyrolle appears in the new Woody Allen film , " Midnight in Paris . "
It 's described in this article in The Washington Post
Harvard Medical School researchers have successfully synthesized a DNA - based memory loop in yeast cells , findings that mark a significant step forward in the emerging field of synthetic biology .
After constructing genes from random bits of DNA , researchers in the lab of Professor Pamela Silver , a faculty member in Harvard Medical School ’s Department of Systems Biology , not only reconstructed the dynamics of memory , but also created a mathematical model that predicted how such a memory “ device ” might work .
“ Synthetic biology is an incredibly exciting field , with more possibilities than many of us can imagine , ” says Silver , lead author of the paper to be published in the September 15 issue of the journal Genes and Development .
“ While this proof - of - concept experiment is simply one step forward , we ’ve established a foundational technology that just might set the standard of what we should expect in subsequent work . ”
Like many emerging fields , there ’s still a bit of uncertainty over what , exactly , synthetic biology is .
Ask any three scientists for a definition , and you ’ll probably get four answers .
Some see it as a means to boost the production of biotech products , such as proteins for pharmaceutical uses or other kinds of molecules for , say , environmental clean - up .
Others see it as a means to creating computer platforms that may bypass many of the onerous stages of clinical trials .
In such a scenario , a scientist would type the chemical structure of a drug candidate into a computer , and a program containing models of cellular metabolism could generate information on how people would react to that compound .
Either way , at it ’s core , synthetic biology boils down to gleaning insights into how biological systems work by reconstructing them .
If you can build it , it forces you to understand it .
A team in Silver ’s Harvard Medical School lab led by Caroline Ajo - Franklin , now at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , and postdoctoral scientist David Drubin decided to demonstrate that not only could they construct circuits out of genetic material , but they could also develop mathematical models whose predictive abilities match those of any electrical engineering system .
“ That ’s the litmus test , ” says Drubin , “ namely , building a biological device that does precisely what you predicted it would do . ”
The components of this memory loop were simple : two genes that coded for proteins called transcription factors .
Transcription factors regulate gene activity .
Like a hand on a faucet , the transcription factor will grab onto a specific gene and control how much , or how little , of a particular protein the gene should make .
The researchers placed two of these newly synthesized , transcription factor - coding genes into a yeast cell , and then exposed the cell to galactose ( a kind of sugar ) .
The first gene , which was designed to switch on when exposed to galactose , created a transcription factor that grabbed on to , and thus activated , the second gene .
It was at this point that the feedback loop began .
The second gene also created a transcription factor .
But this transcription factor , like a boomerang , swung back around and bound to that same gene from which it had originated , reactivating it .
This caused the gene to once again create that very same transcription factor , which once again looped back and reactivated the gene .
In other words , the second gene continually switched itself on via the very transcription factor it created when it was switched on .
The researchers then eliminated the galactose , causing the first synthetic gene , the one that had initiated this whole process , to shut off .
Even with this gene gone , the feedback loop continued .
“ Essentially what happened is that the cell remembered that it had been exposed to galactose , and continued to pass this memory on to its descendents , ” says Ajo - Franklin .
“ So after many cell divisions , the feedback loop remained intact without galactose or any other sort of molecular trigger . ”
Most important , the entire construction of the device was guided by the mathematical model that the researchers developed .
“ Think of how engineers build bridges , ” says Silver .
“ They design quantitative models to help them understand what sorts of pressure and weight the bridge can withstand , and then use these equations to improve the actual physical model .
We really did the same thing .
In fact , our mathematical model not only predicted exactly how our memory loop would work , but it informed how we synthesized the genes . ”
For synthetic biology , this kind of specificity is crucial .
“ If we ever want to create biological black boxes , that is , gene - based circuits like this one that you can plug into a cell and have it perform a specified task , we need levels of mathematical precision as exact as the kind that go into creating computer chips , ” she adds .
The researchers are now working to scale - up the memory device into a larger , more complex circuit , one that can , for example , respond to DNA damage in cells .
“ One day we ’d like to have a comprehensive library of these so - called black boxes , ” says Drubin .
“ In the same way you take a component off the shelf and plug it into a circuit and get a predicted reaction , that ’s what we ’d one day like to do in cells . ”

… But impeachment like everything else is a matter of priorities and responsibility .
In order to move on impeachment now , we would be put in a position at a very , very delicate time in our nation ’s history , of having necessarily to take our eye off the ball on a host of other things that will have longer - lasting impact on the security of this country .
As a practical matter , it sucks all the oxygen out of the air .

Charles G. pointed out in an email discussion recently :
Lisp still does n't seem like the right language for doing text manipulation , and nothing I 've seen from the Emacs libraries is making me think any differently .
It sure beats the hell out of Java though .
Maybe someday someone will write Emacs using Ruby as the embedded interpreter ...
These are all great points .
I know exactly how he feels .
I know soooo exactly how Charles feels that I decided to write a blog instead of an email reply .
Because all the things he 's brought up are real , bona - fide problems .
Lisp for Text Processing
Let 's start by considering the basic problem : how good is Lisp for text processing ?
That turns out to be a complicated question .
When we think of " text processing " , most of us usually think immediately of regular expressions .
Unless " we " are C++ programmers , in which case " we " like to write 2500 - line clones of the Unix ' grep ' utility whenever " we " need to do a text search — or so it would seem , from the candidates I 've interviewed in the past few months .
But I think it 's safe to say that most programmers equate text processing with regular expressions .
Regexps are obviously quite useful .
If you are n't extremely proficient with regular expressions right now , then you should drop everything and go become proficient with them .
I bet I use regular expressions on 350 days out of every year : in my editor , on the command - line , in my code — anywhere that using one would save me time or make my code clearer .
Oh , how it hurts to think about all the so - called " programmers " out there who do n't know how to use regexps .
Argh .
Let 's just drop it .
However , I read somewhere that Lispers have always been a bit skeptical of regular expressions , because regexps are actually a bit weak compared to the generalized processing you can do on tree structures .
Lisp folks ask : why are you storing your data as text in the first place ?
( As opposed to storing it as Lisp . )
I dunno about you , but the first response that comes to my mind is : " duh , what about logs ? "
I remember thinking : gosh , what a bunch of losers ; the Lisp folks do n't even know that the logs of virtually all systems are one - line entries that most easily parsed ( by far ) using regexps .
Yeah , what about logs .
Those dumb Lispers .
Jerks .
Losers .
I certainly had them there .
Then I noticed , no more than three weeks ago , that in Java 1.5 , my java.util.logging output had quietly turned into XML .
D'oh !!!
Regexps suck for processing XML .
If you do n't know why , please do n't tell me that you do n't know , or I will hate you .
Better to keep silent .
Why , then , are logs switching to XML output ?
Well , er , ah , because XML offers more powerful and generalized text - processing capabilities than one - line log entries .
I suppose .
I actually have n't quite gotten used to the new XML output format , but I 'm giving it a go and trying to learn to like it .
It 's quite verbose , which in some cases is good , and in others , maybe not so good .
Case in point : Java stack traces in the logs have each individual stack frame entry wrapped in its own XML element .
The stack traces are already long , but this makes them sort of crazy .
Well , you be the judge .
Would you rather have your log entries look like this :
Feb 21 , 2005 6:57:39 PM
java.util.logging.LogManager$RootLogger log
SEVERE : A very very bad thing has happened !
java.lang.Exception
at logtest.main(logtest.java:24 )
Or like this :
< ? xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " standalone = " no " ?> < !
DOCTYPE log SYSTEM " logger.dtd " > < log > < record > < date >
2005-02-21T18:57:39 < / date > < millis > 1109041059800< / millis > < sequence > 1< / sequence > < logger > < / logger > < level >
SEVERE < / level > < class > java.util.logging.LogManager$RootLogger< / class > < method > log< / method > < thread >
10 < / thread > < message >
A very very bad thing has happened !< / message > < exception > < message > java.lang.Exception< / message > < frame > < class > logtest< / class > < method > main< / method > < line >
30 < / line > < / frame > < / exception > < / record > < / log >
I guess it kinda depends .
If your log only has a few entries , or you 're just doing quick - and - dirty searches , regular expressions might be sufficient .
But with lots of entries , XML ( even though it 's five times as verbose ) becomes a really powerful tool .
For instance , you can do XPath expressions on XML — they 're sort of like regular expressions , but they understand the XML tree structure : something that no regexp , no matter how fancy , will ever be able to do .
With a one - line XPath expression , you could ( for instance ) select all of the log entries that have a stack trace containing a particular Java class ( or a set of classes ) .
Trying to do that reliably with regexps will take you time , patience , and a lot of auxiliary scripting .
With XPath it 's a snap .
( Incidentally , if you 're not already extremely proficient with XPath , I suggest you drop everything and go become proficient with it .
Path expressions are becoming quite popular , and XPath is leading the pack .
They 're very powerful .
If you do n't know how to use XPath , you will wind up reinventing it badly in your XML - processing code . )
XML data also lets you use XSLT transforms ( or XQuery , if you 're hardcore and perhaps slightly crazy ) , or you can simply use your favorite SAX or DOM parser in your favorite language , and quickly do all sorts of remarkable things that would be extremely clunky using regular expressions .
Clunky , nothing — you 'd actually just be writing your own ad - hoc XML parser in each script .
You just do n't want to go there .
So XML is pretty nice .
And that sort of validates what the Lisp people were saying all along , which is that you want even your " simple " text data to be tree - structured .
In Lisp , the equivalent log output might look very similar to the XML :
( log '( record ( date " 2005-02-21T18:57:39 " )
( millis 1109041059800 )
( sequence 1 )
( logger nil )
( level ' SEVERE )
( class " java.util.logging.LogManager$RootLogger " )
( method ' log )
( thread 10 )
( message " A very very bad thing has happened ! " )
( exception ( message " java.lang . Exception " )
( frame ( class " logtest " )
( method ' main )
( line 30 ) ) ) ) )
Well ... similar , except for being ten times cleaner and easier to read .
It still has all the same metadata that the XML gives you , and you can still process it using tools that are just as powerful , if not more so .
You could even trivially convert it to XML and use XSLT , if you were silly enough .
But Lisp is directly executable , so you could simply make the tag names functions that automatically transform themselves .
It 'd be a lot easier than using XSLT , and less than a tenth the size .
And for your XPath queries , well , there are mature Common Lisp packages that support them directly on both XML and Lisp data .
The same is true for Scheme .
I do n't care how fancy your language is — C++ , Ruby , Python , Java , Perl whatever — I can guarantee you that even if it supports doing XPath queries on the syntax trees for source code in that language , which is unlikely , I doubt very much that you 'd want to do it .
Have you ever looked at the ANTLR or JavaCC grammar for Java or C ++?
And the grammars for Python and Ruby are almost as complex .
A query language can't hide that kind of complexity .
It will always be more work to process the source code programmatically in syntactically complex languages .
The Text - Processing Conundrum
So everyone in the world except for the Lisp community is pretty much stuck with the same fundamental text - processing problem , which I 'll summarize :
You want to be able to store and process text data .
Doing this effectively requires your data to be tree - structured .
Regexps do n't cut it for any data or processing that 's sufficiently complex .
Your only real option these days , for most languages , is to use XML .
It has all the best tools and the widest support for your language .
XML processing , which is supposed to be easy , starts to become arbitrarily complex when you start having to use XSLT or XQuery , or roll your own transformations using a SAX or DOM parser in your favorite language .
But those are your only options .
In Lisp , your code is data , and your data is code , so you have a third option ( aside from regexps or XML ) that 's not realistically an option in any other language : you store your text data as a lisp program .
If you simply want to scan it visually , well , you can see for yourself in my example above , it 's easier on the eyes than XML .
It 's also more compact , which is easier on the disks , networks , databases , and IDEs .
If you want to query it , you load it in and use Lisp functions , which now include various flavors of path expressions , including XPath , if you like .
And if you want to transform it , well , you can write your own transformer , of course , but it 's probably easier to make the actual code know how to transform itself .
In any case , your transformers will be easier to write , since they have all the benefits of XSLT ( i.e. transformers can themselves be auto - generated and auto - transformed , breaking things into nice stages ) , without all the downsides of XSLT ( ugliness , surliness , no fun at parties , etc . )
Beyond Logs
Of course we 're not just talking about log data .
The situation is even clearer for configuration files .
You definitely want them in XML , except it has the same problems , so ...
Hey , wait a minute — if your configuration file is ...
Lisp , then it's not really a ... configuration file anymore ; it 's part of your ... program ?
Is that right ?
Um , yep .
You got it .
The whole nasty " configuration " problem becomes incredibly more convenient in the Lisp world .
No more stanza files , apache - config , . properties files , XML configuration files , Makefiles — all those lame , crappy , half - language creatures that you wish were executable , or at least loaded directly into your program without specialized processing .
I know , I know — everyone raves about the power of separating your code and your data .
That 's because they 're using languages that simply can't do a good job of representing data as code .
But it 's what you really want , or all the creepy half - languages would n't all evolve towards being Turing - complete , would they ?
In fact , if you insist on code / data separation and you 're an advocate of OOP , then you 're talking out of both sides of your mouth .
If your gut reaction to having log entries know how to transform or process themselves is " woah , that 's just wrong " , think again : you 're imposing a world - view on the problem that 's not consistent with your notions of data encapsulation and active objects .
This world - view dates back to ancient Unix and pre-Unix days .
But if you think about it , there 's no reason log entries or config files should n't be executable and subclassable .
It might be better .
And what about , oh , web pages ?
Or word - processor documents ?
Well , you figure it out .
Web pages use HTML , which is n't even powerful enough to represent text styles , let alone something like an event handler .
So Web pages have CSS , and JavaScript , and all this other hooey .
It 's become so ugly that people do n't really write web pages anymore , not for production stuff .
Nowadays people treat the morass of ancient , crufty Web technologies as a sort of assembly language .
You write code to assemble your pages piecewise using PHP or XML / XSLT or Perl / Mason or Java / JSP or perhaps all of them in a giant ugly pipeline , which " compiles " down to an unreadable Web page format .
Talk about fun !
I can tell you in all honesty : everyone who tries this feels pain .
And there are a lot of people in the world doing exactly what I described above .
Building production websites == pain .
The world is gradually , very slowly , converging towards using a variety of " executable XML " formats ( e.g. Ant , Jelly , Cocoon ) which ... well , they sort of ease the pain , but it 's replaced with new pain : the pain of the executable - XML language designers not having a frigging clue what they 're doing .
So now Ant has a macro system , and try / catch tags , and if - tags , and it 's gradually migrating towards Turing - completeness if it 's not there already .
But it still has all the same yucky problems it 's had from day one : properties that look like variables that you can only set once , and weird inconsistencies in the way the tags work , and of course the fact that it 's automatically 10 x as verbose as a programming language because it 's XML .
Do n't get me wrong — it 's still way better than Make .
But that 's not a very high bar now , is it ?
Let 's face it : a Turing - complete Ant ( or Jelly , or any pure - XML processing framework ) is going to be a monstrosity , because it will take years ( if not decades ) for them to figure out that Turing - completeness does not equal expressiveness , and they 'll have to add lexical scoping , and data types , and a class system , and first - class functions , and and and ...
And in the end , it 'll still be XML .
The Shaggy Cow
How did I get so far off the original track of text processing ?
Well , that 's the punch line of this shaggy - dog story : it 's all text processing !
Log files , configuration files , XML data , query strings , mini-languages , programming languages , transformers , web pages , word documents , everything ... the vast majority of your programming work involves text processing somehow .
What would you rather do ?
Learn 16 different languages and frameworks in order to do " simple " log - file and configuration - file processing ?
Or just buckle down , learn Lisp , and have all of these problems go away forever ?
It 's a rhetorical question .
The answer is patently obvious at this point : Lisp is evil , and you 'd damned well better write all your code in C++ and XML and JavaScript and PL * SQL and CSS and XSLT and regular expressions and all those other God-fearing red- blooded manly patriotic all - American languages from now on .
No more of this crazy Lisp talk , ya hear ?
Welcome to my life .
I 'm the cow in the Gary Larsen comic — the one who looks up , shocked , and says : " Hey , wait a minute !
This is grass !
We 've been eating grass . "
The other cows stare blankly , munching the grass .
Actually , I do feel like that cow , but I also feel a bit like one of the characters in Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children .
( It 's one of the most amazing fictional works ever written , and if you have n't read it , you 're missing out . )
There 's a character who can travel forward and backward through time , so he can of course see the future .
The funny thing is : all the other children , even though they know he can see the future , refuse to believe anything he says about it .
Yes , you 're probably boiling over with objections to my little discussion above .
You think I 'm trivializing things , or you think that perhaps I 'm overstating the importance of tree - structured data ( perhaps you 're not an XML fan ) , or maybe you 're simply mad at me for reasons you can't really articulate , other than to say , vaguely , that I appear to have " Paul Graham - itis " .
I understand how you feel .
Being able to see the future is actually rather unpleasant .
What About Emacs ?
Putting all ranting aside for the moment , let 's talk about Charles ' second concern : would n't it be better if Emacs were written in Ruby ?
After all , Emacs is designed for manipulating any old kind of text , not just tree - structured text like XML or Lisp .
And Charles was right on the mark when he said nothing in the Emacs libraries indicates that Emacs - Lisp is particularly good for plain - vanilla text manipulation .
It 's missing a lot of features we 've become accustomed to .
Perl has raised the bar on ordinary / arbitrary string processing .
Although a Ruby - based Emacs would probably be quite nice in some respects , I now think ( even liking Ruby as much as I do ) a Common Lisp Emacs would be even nicer .
I do n't want to belabor it , because if you agree with me then you need no convincing , and if you do n't , then you probably cannot be convinced in any reasonable amount of time .
The summary is that Lisp has intrinsic , un - beatable technical advantages stemming from its s-expression structure , and Common Lisp has 20 + years of maturity that give it far more stability , performance , and interoperability than Ruby or Python will have for a long , long time ( if ever . )
Well then , why do n't they just convert Emacs to Common Lisp ?
That 's the rub : Emacs Lisp is even older than Common Lisp , and it's got some unfortunate incompatibilities with Common Lisp ( and Scheme even more so ) that make porting forward so nontrivial as to be nearing a complete rewrite .
Since Emacs is so ancient , there are millions of lines of fairly well - debugged elisp code out there ; it 's one of the original and longest - lived open - source applications , so you 'd have an absolutely huge task in trying to re-implement all of it .
Most people who try this wind up trying to create a " compatibility - mode " for old elisp code .
Guile Emacs , JEmacs and a few Common Lisp editors all attempt this , and none yet have succeeded at doing it well .
The other option is to just live with Emacs , since it is still Lisp , and even has a fairly comprehensive set of macros that give a large subset Common Lisp 's functionality .
So it 's generally easier to hack Emacs to interoperate with your language ( or any system , in fact ) than it is to try to re-implement Emacs .
Unfortunately , this would n't really be a big deal if people could just go in and hack on Emacs source code and " fix things " .
For instance , I 'd love to add Perl5 - compatible regular expressions , and a reader - macro system to allow for raw strings ( or at least hack in some syntax to support regexps without having to double - escape everything ) .
But there are several blocking issues .
One is that the Emacs folks are notoriously picky about contributions — you have to provide legal paperwork saying the work is your own , that the FSF can use it , etc .
It 's the basic problem that led to Eric Raymond 's famous " The Cathedral and the Bazaar " essay — GNU Emacs is the archetypal Cathedral .
So : good luck getting your changes into Emacs .
The Lucid folks tried for a while , and ultimately forked the code base to produce XEmacs , which is a famously bad situation .
The difficulty of contributing extends beyond the core binary .
If you wanted to contribute , say , a pure - elisp String library ( which Emacs could really use ) , or a collections package , I 'm not sure you could pull it off .
You 'd have to get it by RMS , and it seems fairly daunting .
RMS is , well , conservative — to put it mildly .
I think he 's a superhero , but he does n't make it easy to contribute to Emacs .
Even if contributing were n't such a hassle , it 's not entirely clear to people that Emacs is worth hacking on .
It 's missing many of the core rendering - engine features that would make it capable of doing , say , a Web Browser .
Getting it to the point where it could render PostScript seems an impossible task .
And many newer programmers are n't using Emacs at all ; they 've been lured away by the siren - song of IDEs like Eclipse , IntelliJ , Visual Studio , and so on .
Emacs does n't have a very pretty face ( because of the simple rendering engine I mentioned above ) , and it certainly does n't have much marketing .
Most programmers these days are quite astonished that anyone would actually still use Emacs .
If they realized how much functionality it has , and how powerful its extensibility model is , they'd be ten times as astonished .
It 's got things that Eclipse may never have , not in a hundred years , and that 's no exaggeration .
If they tried hard enough , they would eventually wind up rewriting most of it in Lisp , which would be rather ironic , all in all .
The Emacs Problem
So !
The situation is best described as a " dilemma " .
Emacs is n't really advancing , and it appears to be a lot of work to re-implement it in another language .
( Not that people like the Guile folks are n't trying , but it 's still taking forever ) .
And a bunch of less powerful languages are in vogue ; in fact it appears that a language 's popularity is very nearly inversely proportional to its power these days .
People just do n't realize what they 're missing .
So yeah .
Charles is right .
Lisp does n't seem like the right language for doing text processing , at least if you take the fairly narrow view that text processing means syntax for regexps ( and string interpolation , and miscellaneous other Perl- isms ) , and you 're only looking at the libraries bundled with GNU Emacs .
And it does sure still beat the hell out of Java — at least for , uh , creating dynamically - modifiable IDEs .
I wo n't climb too far up that soapbox , lest I get lynched .
And maybe , just maybe , someone will succeed in the gargantuan effort to create a usable replacement for Emacs in some other high - level language .
Probably not any time soon , I 'd bet .
So for now , I use lots of tools : Perl / Python / Ruby for scripts , Java or C for production apps ( perhaps with embedded languages where appropriate ! ) , XML for a lot of my data ; I even use Eclipse for some things .
And Emacs is a great general - purpose extensible editor and programming environment , especially if you make the effort to master it .
But anyone can see that the whole situation ( taking into account Web programming , let 's not forget ) could be a lot better .
This is a hard problem .

Talking of Lisp , XML , and data - is - code - is - data , have you seen this ?
Looks like an interesting alternative to SAX / DOM approaches .
It uses the reflection - layer of the Common Lisp Object System to transform XML elements to and from Lisp objects on the fly .
I suspect the Lisp hardcore would say ' Pah !
Just use sexprs — that 's what they were intended for ' .
But this still looks like an interesting glue layer .

And talking of using Common Lisp to rewrite Emacs , have you taken a look at Hemlock , which comes with CMUCL ?
It 's still not Emacs .
Its incompleteness does a fair job of proving your point about how hard it would be to completely rebuild all of the Emacs utilities in CL , but it * is* kinda nifty .

We used XML / XPath / XSLT for a project to scrape prices from vendor web sites a couple years ago .
It was fun in a , " I ca n't believe we 're making this Elephant dance " kind of way .
I can't imagine actually wanting to use that technology for something I was n't planning to throw away , however .
XSLT is n't a real language ( or it was n't then ) .
Xalan 's xslt extensions allowed us to embed Javascript , which we needed for ... regular expressions !
XPath worked great for finding the nodes we wanted , but then we wanted to find specific text in the nodes and do some simple cleanup .
So , now we had XSLT with Javascript , being executed by a Java program running Xalan 's XML libaries .
I just went back and read through the code again , and its just as ugly as I remembered it being .
Besides the fact that it 's using Xalan extensions , so it is n't really portable anymore .
I think you 've hit on the fundamental flaw .
They are trying to build another lisp , but this one is uglier , way more verbose and not the slightest bit symmetric .
I mean , they have good intentions : XSLT is just executable XML , but there is n't any way to extend it , short of vendor specific extensions .
I really like the idea of having configuration files in Lisp .
That would make parsing them almost trivial , although I think you would still want standard " Perl 'ish " regular expressions for the verbose bits of data at the leaves of the tree .
That would be easy to add in a real language though !
Not to mention the ability , as you say , to just define functions with the same names as your nodes .
You could even use macros to parameterize them for different sorts of transformations .
Sounds great , when do we start ?

> Sounds great , when do we start ?
Just as sooooon as I find a Lisp that does n't cause nausea , diarrhea and severe stomach cramps .
Not entirely clear that such a thing exists , but I 'm working on it .
I keep having to wait for the symptoms to disappear before trying the next one .
Seriously , though : before trying anything with Lisp , I have a big checklist of criteria that it needs to pass .
( Or at least provide some sort of " out " so you can fix it yourself , e.g. by bridging to C libraries ) .
Stuff like decent concurrency support , asynchronous I/O , good tools and cross- platform support , etc. etc .
I really wish someone else had done this evaluation already .
I only have so much free time for it .
But I 've found a few useful links ; Paul Costanza 's Highly Opinionated Guide to Lisp is one ( in no small part because of all the links it has at the bottom ) .
And Cliki is kind of useful .
But I have n't yet found an evaluation of any Lisp 's suitability for what we think of as " production " work .
Feel free to help !
Maybe we need to start a Wiki on it .
Call it Blub , though , so nobody gets scared . :-)
Anyway ...
> Sounds great , when do we start ?
Short answer : not any time soon , I think .
Java and C++ are still the king and queen , respectively .
( Note : C++ programmers who read that are thinking " hey , why do we have to be the queen ? " .
That 's why . :-)

Brian : Yeah , Hemlock looks interesting .
Actually , do so Guile Emacs and JEmacs .
JEmacs could be really cool if it ever got finished .
It 's mostly a proof - of - concept , and Per Bothner is n't working actively on it anymore .
He wants someone to take over the development on it .
The code is clean but complex — Kawa ( unlike pretty much all other JVM " scripting " languages ) goes to great lengths to ensure static typing so it can be efficiently compiled to bytecode .
And Kawa actually supports at least five different languages in its framework .
So it'd be a significant undertaking to ramp up on the code and start pushing it forward .
Not that I do n't think about trying !
Having a reasonable Emacs that you can run in the same JVM as the Java app you 're developing would be nothing short of incredible .
I 'll download Hemlock and actually try it out .
All in all , I generally prefer Scheme to Common Lisp , though I wish for all of CL 's library functions .
I think Per is actually planning on adding namespaces to Kawa , and offering all the Common Lisp stuff to your Scheme code by explicitly prefixing it , e.g. :
( cl:eq foo bar )
is equivalent to the Scheme expression :
( eq ? foo bar )
Being able to mix and match Scheme libraries , CL libraries , elisp libraries , and Java APIs together seamlessly ( which he 's working on ) will make Kawa a serious contender in the Lisp - implementations lineup at some point .
By the time Arc comes out , he 'll be able to support that pretty well too .
I 'm stalling , though .
I really need to download CMUCL and start hacking with it .
All my fun hacking been elisp or scheme lately .

Chris : thanks for the pointer to XMLisp !
It looks really nifty .
Actually , AgentSheets itself looks kind of cool .
Backing the link up a level :
http://agentsheets.com/lisp/
I wonder if their product is all written in Lisp ?
There 's no mention of this anywhere on their website — which I suppose is probably great for marketing .
How 'd you hear about this ?
Just a Google search ?

Tree Regular Expressions ( in SCSH Scheme )
XML is great stuff if you 're working on text with a high content / markup ratio , like written documents .
Take a look at the source of this blog page if you want an example .
Vast swathes of text with a few P and EM elements .
The problems occur when the text / markup ratio approaches zero .
Interview question for people who claim major XML chops :
Why does XML have both attributes and elements ?

I keep on hearing about how great lisp is , and lispers rant on and on about it , but unfortunately all the good lisp examples are badly out of date , or in some horrible state ( emacs vs xemacs and the personal politics of RMS ) , or apparently almost completely unusable according to your previous entries on languages .
So what is a programmer to do ?
If everyone evolves to lisp , the argument is just go straight to lisp , but if the language is so great , why is n't more evangelism being done on it ?
Most statements involving lisp tend to be what the SEC would call ' forward looking statements ' or what i'll call ' niche statements ' .
That is people describe what COULD be or describe what works for a small number of people ( why it never grows beyond that is never really talked about ) .
in the mean time on my Mac , I have the best UI development system ever conceived and it was built using Objective C - it's also shaping up to be one of the most advanced UI programming environments available period ( CoreImage - screw 8 bit integers for each RGBA , how about FLOATS for each component ?! ) .
In the mean time the best face on lisp is ... emacs ?!
I liked your entry on languages , but I was left with the distinct feeling that you do n't like any programming language right now , any follow up there ?
Posted by : Ryan R. at February 24 , 2005 06:18 AM
The fundamental problem appears to be a chicken - and - egg problem , or just a game of chicken .
Nobody wants to use a language unless it 's rock - solid : stable , fast , well - documented , well - specified , bug free ( at least in complying with its specification ) , portable , etc .
Oh , and you already have to know it , which limits the field a bit .
Most people do n't want to learn new things ; they 'd rather build new things , even if what they 're building is something that already exists .
Easier than learning the old thing .
I personally dislike most languages so much that I would hesitate to use them unless absolutely forced into it .
( Even then , it would just be ho -hum , and not all THAT bad .
Getting a dumb language to do what you want can be a fun challenge in itself — that 's got to be part of why the existing popular languages are so popular . )
The game - of - chicken is that a language can't actually become rock - solid without a big community .
The bigger the community , the more solid it gets .
Hence , the most popular languages are the most solid : they 're popular because they 're solid , and they 're solid because they 're popular .
It feeds on itself , reinforcing the desire to use the existing languages , no matter how awkward the languages are at saying things .
I care a lot about how easy or hard it is to say things in a programming language , because I 've decided that I hate giant systems .
They suck .
The gianter a system , the more bugs it 'll have , the harder it 'll be to learn , the worse its availability will be , and the more people you 'll need to hire — to make the system even more giant than it already is .
Higher - level languages provide mechanisms that allow you to say certain common things ( such as : " give me all the elements of this vector that have a customer whose name starts with an S " , although there are many other examples than just data - structure queries ) much more conveniently than you can in C++ or Java .
Not that you can't say them in C++ or Java — it just takes longer .
C++ sometimes lets you say those things better than Java — but then screws you over with having to hand - manage memory and do all this other hooey , and on the balance , it 's worse .
Much worse .
Over time , if you use a language that does n't let you say things compactly — in other words , a language that lets your refactoring make your code base smaller , then your system will grow giant , and then lots of problems will happen : longer builds , slower ramp - up , slower innovation , more bugs , lower availability , etc .
Many developers ( junior and senior ) do n't realize that it does n't really have to be this way ; it 's one of the reasons I write this blog in the first place .
My position at the moment is that I 'd like to see teams use the highest - level language that they can just barely tolerate .
If everyone switched from C++ to Java , I would be overjoyed , and in no small part because stupid - ass porting projects like RHEL3 would disappear , freeing up engineers to do , you know , engineering , rather than a bunch of frigging porting work .
Like , duh .
Ca n't anyone at this company see how much pain C++ is causing us ?
No , because you have no accountability for porting your systems .
Let dev-services do it ... as if that 'll work .
There are half a dozen other reasons that are just as valid as the porting one .
C++ is killing us .
It 's a virus that , once it 's entered your company , will expand until it pushes everything else out , and you will become paralyzed .
You all know this at some level , but you let it happen anyway .
Java just may be the only language out there today that 's higher - level than C++ and still suitable for building a really massive service like CMS .
That 's because it 's rock - solid ( it really is , amazingly so nowadays ) , which stems from its popularity .
I trash on J2EE a lot , because I 'm squarely in the " Better , Faster , Lighter Java " camp , which is a subset of the " use small , reusable tools , not giant - ass frameworks " .
That 's a long discussion that you can have with Peter D. , who agrees and feels even more strongly about it than I do . :-)
But Java in general is a damn good language platform .
Could be better , sure , but there 's a lot to be said for it .
And two or three very promising developments in Java make it even more compelling : Java 1.5 ( which adds some really nice features ) , AspectJ ( which adds some very powerful features and now seems mature enough for production , if approached carefully ) , and the JVM scripting languages , which if used cautiously , can greatly improve your ability to do things like unit testing , builds , debugging , configuration , scripting , prototyping , and other * auxiliary * work that we all do all the time .
If everyone switched to Java here , I 'd be one happy camper .
I 'd say the same thing about Perl , except that Perl is so excruciatingly detestable ( and broken in many ways ) that I could n't bear to recommend it .
But I 'd secretly still be pretty happy about Perl over C ++.
Moving up the language power ladder , Python and Ruby are great for many tasks , and I think we could start using them in moderation .
I picked Ruby somewhat arbitrarily , since it seems a little cleaner , but they 're both good .
Python is more " solid " by the definitions I gave above .
Everything else — the ML family , Haskell , Smalltalk , and a bunch of others — none of them seem like they 're solid enough for any production work at all here .
Python and Ruby are solid enough to use for auxiliary coding , but I 'm not convinced either of them is solid enough ( by which , again , I mean mature , stable , fast , etc. ) to write ( say ) OMS or CMS .
Java is solid enough , although you 'll still have your share of serious engineering headaches that have little to do with the language — distribution , scaling , etc .
Unless maybe you use a language like Erlang that makes these problems part of the language , but I remain a bit skeptical there .
So Java .
Java is what I 'd recommend .
And Ruby or Python for anything you can get away with building using them .
Nothing higher up the power curve is suitable today ...
... except for Lisp .
Lisp is the one ( possible ) exception .
It appears pretty solid , and it happens to be very near ( or at ) the top of the power continuum .
I 'm holding out hope that some version of Lisp will be solid enough to use here .
I 'm looking at them .
These things take time .
What I want could best be described as " Common Scheme " .
Failing that , Common Lisp seems like the main contender .
Our interviewing process hires C++ programmers ; that 's what it 's been carefully tuned to do ( whether we deliberately set out to do that or not ) , and most of them do n't know Lisp , let alone anything between Lisp and C ++.
The problem with Lisp , of course , is that it 's so far up there that most programmers think of it as a complete joke , not even worth mentioning in the same breath as " work that one gets paid for " .
And you 're right , Emacs is the only application most people associate with Lisp .
However , you do n't get to see the production code from most companies .
There are a lot of companies using Lisp , but it turns out that rather than trumpeting this , they hide the fact very carefully .
They view it as a secret strategic advantage , and they do n't want anyone ( except potential hires ) to know they 're using it .
Also , it does n't do a thing for your product marketing if you say it 's written in Lisp — that 's more likely to scare people away than get them to use it .
So Lisp actually appears to be a well - kept secret in the industry .
At least it appears to be .
I have n't written anything big in it , so I can only speak from a sort of investigative standpoint .
It could be a year , or even five years , before I really know .
In the meantime , switching to Java is an absolutely outstanding thing for people to do .
There are no doubts about it , no mysteries — it 's as rock - solid as you need it to be .
And it 's not even scary .

" Common Scheme " being an industrial - strength , portable Scheme implementation with widespread support ?
Already satirized ( and by Guy Steele no less ) :
http://zurich.ai.mit.edu/pipermail/rrrs-authors/1998-May/002343.html
The thread is an argument between the minimalist and maximalist groups of Scheme language designers .
Posted by : Derek U. at February 25 , 2005 05:56 PM
In this entry you present us with a false dilemma .
Either we write our configuration files in ad - hoc languages that eventually become turing - complete monstrosities , or we write them in s-expressions .
Either our logfiles are XML and we are consigned to the world of XSLT / XPath , or they are lisp programs that know how to execute themselves .
I would like to present a third alternative :
logEntry = {
" date " => " 2005-02-21T18:57:39 " ,
" millis " => 1109041059800 ,
" sequence " => 1 ,
" logger " => nil ,
" level " => :SEVERE ,
" class " => " java.util.logging.LogManager$RootLogger " ,
" method " => " log "
" thread " => 10 ,
" message " =>
" A very very bad thing has happened ! " ,
" exception " => {
" message " => " java.lang.Exception " ,
" frame " => {
" class " => " logtest " ,
" method " => : main ,
" line " => 30
}
}
}
LISP is n't the only language that has hierarchical data structures .
No , a hash table is n't executable and can't transform itself like a LISP program could , but it 's not clear to me why it should .
A stack trace is not inherently an executable thing , any more than my license plate number is .
No , I can't subclass a hash table , but I can subclass this :
class LogfileEntry
def initialize ( data )
@data = data
end
end
So : yeah , hopefully we can do better than XML / XSLT .
But what makes LISP the answer ?
And what does it really buy you when your data , which by itself is not meaningfully executable , is expressed in a syntax that could be executable ?

I had never heard the term " s- expression " before .
I saw this article on Google though .
Seems somewhat relevant .
XML is not S - Expressions
Posted by : Joel H. at February 25 , 2005 10:54 PM
The sections " Starting with Syntax " and " Redundancy Is Good " argue that XML is better for document processing — - which is true .
The " Family Matters " section argues that , because ( for example ) XSLT is a domain - specific language for processing XML documents , it 's a better choice than a general language for processing s-expressions .
But each of the listed technologies is getting expanded and expanded because they do n't support " real " programming language concepts :
" Many users have requested the ability to return a conditional value based on a boolean expression .
XPath 2.0 MUST provide a conditional expression ... "
" As part of the XSLT 1.1 work done on extension functions , a proposal to author XSLT extension functions in XSLT itself was deferred for reconsideration in XSLT 2.0 .
This would allow the functions in an extension namespace to be implemented in " pure " XSLT , without resulting to external programming languages . "
" If a :: marker pseudo - element has its ' content ' property set to normal , the following algorithm should be used to generate the computed value of the property . "
" It is the ideal time right now for the W3C XPath 2.0 working group to make the decision to provide the necessary support for higher - order functions as part of the standard XPath 2.0 specification .
In case this golden opportunity is missed , then generic templates and libraries will be used in the years to come . "

Posted by : Derek U. at February 26 , 2005 07:16 AM
I think Derek pegged it better than anyone when he commented earlier that XML is better for high content / markup ratio , and Lisp is better when it 's mostly markup .
I had n't thought of it this way before , but it immediately rang true .
By way of background , you should be aware that Paul Prescod is a person who is trying to let the world know , in no uncertain terms , that Python people can be even snottier than Lisp people .
He 's one of the handful of folks that come to mind when I describe the Python community as " frosty " .
So of course he 's going to try very hard to dissociate XML with s-expressions , because if XML is really s-expressions ( and you fail to take Derek 's observation into account ) , then you could easily draw the conclusion that Lisp beats Python for XML processing , and Paul would very much like for nobody to draw that conclusion .
The XSLT - article guy is just whacked out on acid .
He seems to think that by zooming out to a satellite 's - eye view in his XSLT examples , he will give the impression that XSLT is as compact as Haskell .
I can't help but feel , looking at all those tiny colored blobs , that I 'm about to fall twenty thousand feet to my death , impaled on angle brackets , and that the colors are the spatters of everyone else who 's fallen on them so far — including blue - blooded XSLT aficionados .

Josh : if you only focus on logfiles and other similarly inert- seeming data clumps , then Ruby 's fine , and the solution you suggest seems fine .
The only nitpick I 'd make is that defining the log entries as a language - specific hash makes it more difficult to process the entries in some other language , whereas with XML and Lisp , both of them are syntactically relatively straightforward , and you can in fact convert trivially and lexically between the two of them .
But it 's mostly splitting hairs .
For more complex documents , e.g. web pages or word - processor documents , I might be inclined to go with a Lisp dialect , if I were designing it from scratch .
But who knows .
Ruby 's very nice too .
If only it had native - code compilers and preemptive multithreading and a macro system and all those other goodies Lisp has ...
Posted by : Steve Yegge at February 28 , 2005 11:20 PM
p.s. it 's important to realize that you can fairly cleanly divide programming languages into " scripting languages " and " programming languages " , and I really understand the distinction now .
Scripting languages are all a bunch of miserable hacks : Perl , Python , Ruby , Groovy , Tcl , Rexx ... you name it .
They all start life with no formal grammar or parser , no formal bytecode or native - code generation on the backend , no lexical scoping , no formal semantics , no type system , nothing .
And that 's where most of them wind up .
They may grow and evolve in the right directions , and they all eventually become pleasant to work with , after enough hacks piled on , but all of them are plagued with fundamental problems .
C , C++ , Java , Objective -C , C# , Pascal , Lisp , and Scheme ( to name a few ) are all REAL languages , in all the senses I mentioned in the previous paragraph .
Notice that in " real " languages , you may or may not have good string - processing , or garbage collection , or OOP constructs , or first - class functions , or anything else .
All those concerns are orthogonal to whether the language was built with a compiler framework in mind or not .
And there 's absolutely no reason someone should n't be able to create a " scripting language " that has a solid foundation .
What 's the difference ?
Why do all those formal doo - hickeys matter ?
Performance !
Compiled languages are fast .
Lisp is WAY faster than Ruby , over the long haul .
Smokes it .
I care about other stuff besides performance , of course , and compilation gives you other benefits as well .
But most of all , it gives me this feeling of security , knowing that the formal syntax and semantics are all well - specified .
I think that 's what I mean by " solid " .
( And despite the general ugliness of XML and friends , its formal specification is pretty good . )

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
When the aliens finally invade Earth , you may wish you had listened to Travis Taylor and Bob Boan .
Aliens descend on Manhattan in a scene from the 1996 film " Independence Day " in an image courtesy of 20th Century Fox .
If there are so many aliens out there , why have n't we heard from them already ?
That is the question famously posed by the physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950 to dismiss speculation by his colleagues that intelligent life should be routine .
REUTERS / Handout
And if the invasion follows the plot of a typical Hollywood blockbuster , they might also be the guys called in at the last minute to save the day .
After all , they have written “ An Introduction to Planetary Defence ” , a primer on how humanity can defend itself if little green men wielding death rays show up at our cosmic doorstep .
And yes , they ’re serious .
“ The probability really is there that aliens exist and are old enough to have technology to enable them to come here , ” Taylor said in an interview .
Taylor and Boan are hardly basement - dwelling paranoids obsessed with tinfoil hats and Area 51 .
Taylor holds advanced degrees in astronomy and physics , and is an associate at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton .
He and Boan have done consulting work for the Defence Department and the U.S. space agency NASA .
But their views have won few audiences outside of science fiction conventions , and their book is published by BrownWalker Press , which specialises in fringe topics and books with titles like “ The Science and Lore of the Plant Cell Wall ” and “ ESP and Psychokinesis ” .
Taylor acknowledged alien invasion is hardly a mainstream concern but said it is naive to assume -- as scientists like the late Carl Sagan did -- that any beings advanced enough to master star travel will have evolved beyond war .
“ It ’s a wonderful idea that has no basis in reality , ” Taylor said .
FERMI ’S BLUNDER ?
Taylor and Boan -- along with co-authors R.C. Anding and T. Conley Powell -- revisit two issues that frequently pop up in the debate about whether homo sapiens is alone in the universe : Drake ’s Equation and Fermi ’s Paradox .
The formula drawn up by U.S. astronomer Frank Drake in 1960 tries to estimate how likely contact with an alien civilisation is given factors such as the number of habitable planets .
Taylor and Boan plugged in what they felt were conservative estimates , such as that aliens cannot travel faster than 10 percent of the speed of light .
After crunching the numbers , they say it is possible that our Milky Way galaxy harbours thousands of intelligent alien species and that there is a “ high probability ” that one or two of them visit Earth every century .
But if there are so many aliens out there , why have n’t we heard from them already ?
That is the question famously posed by the physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950 to dismiss speculation by his colleagues that intelligent life should be routine .
Taylor and Boan are convinced Fermi got it wrong .
Even if aliens used Godlike technology to jump across thousands of light years in a single day , they would still need millions of years to explore all the star systems in the galaxy .
They simply may not have stumbled across our neck of the woods yet .
MUJAHIDEEN -STYLE RESISTANCE
Taylor and Boan started thinking about how to respond to an aggressive extraterrestrial attack during a 2001 discussion about defending against terrorist attacks .
“ One thing that popped into my mind was that the only way Americans would be in an asymmetric war on the other side would be if we were attacked by aliens .
Everyone chuckled , but then after a minute the comments started setting in , ” Taylor said .
“ Then we really got to talking about it and we thought , well , you know , we really might need this contingency plan anyway , ” Taylor said .
Failure to prepare may mean mankind will have to dig in and fight with improvised weapons and hit - and - run tactics , much the same way Islamic extremists have battled the U.S. military in Iraq , Taylor said .
“ You ’d have to create an insurgency , a mujahideen - type resistance , ” Taylor said .
“ The insurgents know how to win this war against us .
It also tells us that if we were attacked by aliens , this is our best defence . ”
Fossil evidence of jellyfish dates back to the Cambrian Period , 500 million years ago .
This fossil jellyfish shows similarity to the modern jellyfish , Cunina ( right ) .
It was one of four different types of jellyfish dated back to the Cambrian by researchers in 2007 .
These ancient jellyfish showed the same complexity as modern jellyfish , meaning they either developed rapidly 500 million years ago , or today ’s varieties are much older .
The oldest known fossils of jellyfish have been found in rocks in Utah that are more than 500 million years old , a new study reports .
The fossils are an unusual discovery because soft - bodied creatures , such as jellyfish , rarely survive in the fossil record , unlike animals with hard shells or bones .
" The fossil record is biased against soft - bodied life forms such as jellyfish , because they leave little behind when they die , " said study member Bruce Lieberman of the University of Kansas .
These jellyfish left their lasting imprint because they were deposited in fine sediment , rather than coarse sand .
The film that the jellyfish left behind shows a clear picture , or " fossil snapshot , " of the animals .
" You can see a distinct bell - shape , tentacles , muscle scars and possibly even the gonads , " said study team member Paulyn Cartwright , also of KU .
The rich detail of the fossils allowed the team to compare the cnidarian ( the phylum to which jellyfish , coral and sea anemones belong ) fossils to modern jellyfish .
The comparison confirmed that the fossils were , in fact , jellyfish and pushed the earliest known occurrence of definitive jellyfish back from 300 million to 505 million years ago .
The fossils also offer insights into the rapid species diversification that occurred during the Cambrian radiation , which began around 540 million years ago and when most animal groups start to show up in the fossil record , Lieberman said .
The complexity of these early jellyfish seems to suggest that either the complexity of modern jellyfish developed rapidly about 500 million years ago , or that jellyfish are even older and developed long before that time .
How do antisocial men manage to attract women ?
Or , to put it another way , why do some women always fall for bastards ?
It seems that a little bit of flirting – smiling , raising eyebrows , nodding – goes a long way towards attracting a woman , even outweighing the negative effects of some men ’s antisocial nature .
“ Antisocial men can make up a lot of ground just by being flirtatious , ” says psychologist Andrew Clark .
When we meet people , we are not interacting with static images , yet such images are used in most studies of attractiveness .
Realising this , Clark and colleagues at the University of Bristol , …

The cast from the TV series " The Chaser 's War On Everything " made a mockery of APEC security today , putting together a fake diplomatic motorcade and penetrating all the way to Bush 's lair at the Intercontinental hotel near Circular Quay and then freaking out security when they emerged in Osama Bin Laden costumes .
Good thing the average terrorist in the west is an idiot and not capable of doing the same thing as anarchist comedians otherwise we'd have a smoking crater , no more civil liberties and probably a war with Iran .
As stunts go this one was pretty funny ( something almost everyone agrees on ) , but its a little foolhardy given the number of heavily armed people who seem to be perched on CBD rooftops this week .
ELEVEN crew from the ABC TV show The Chaser have been detained after staging a fake motorcade through Sydney during APEC .
The team from the satirical TV program The Chaser 's War on Everything were in a convoy of three cars and two motorbikes which was reportedly ushered through two checkpoints in Sydney 's APEC security “ red ” zone .
The convoy was pulled over in Macquarie Street on a block adjacent to the InterContinental Hotel , where US President George W Bush is a guest during the APEC summit .
The ABC said Chaser stars Julian Morrow and Chas Licciardello were detained late this morning following the stunt near the hotel .
Chaser members said they had dressed up a convoy to look like an official Canadian motorcade , on a day during which a number of official motorcades crossed the city .
Southern Cross Broadcasting reported that the convoy carrying the Chaser team passed “ through two checkpoints around the hotel before one of The Chaser pranksters jumped out ( dressed ) as Osama Bin Laden ” .
“ They had been waved through , they had three cars ... big black Hummer - style cars decked out with Canadian flags on the front , ” a reporter said .
“ A couple of Chaser team members were in the back of each of these cars and rest of the team were dressed up as bodyguards .
...
Chaser team member Chris Taylor told the Fairfax website the motorcade comprised “ three cars , a couple of motorbikes , and a lot of crew ” .
He said the Chaser convoy had Canadian flags attached to the cars and “ Canada ” signs visible in the front windscreen .
“ No particular reason we chose Canada , ” Taylor said .
“ We just thought they'd be a country who the cops would n't scrutinise too closely , and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade - as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him . ” ...
The Chaser 's War on Everything resumed on ABC TV last night and included a number of stunts aimed at testing APEC security .
Morrow told News Ltd newspapers last weekend the Chaser team was planning something “ extreme ” for APEC .
Chaser team members yesterday staged a stunt during an anti-APEC protest , with Taylor appearing as a police officer on a pantomime horse - a dig at the fact equine flu has prevented NSW police horses being used for APEC security .
Police are allowing the NSW Greens to hold an event for media in Sydney 's Martin Place tomorrow , despite saying on Tuesday they would take legal action to prevent it .
Greens MP Sylvia
Hale , who will host the event , says she told the police she would not change its location , despite receiving a letter from NSW Police general counsel Michael Antrum on Tuesday threatening to launch Supreme Court action against her .
She says police have now backed away from the threat , with Mr Antrum confirming in a letter to her this morning police had dropped their opposition to the event .
" I welcome this backdown by the police , '' Ms Hale said today .
" The police were trying to act beyond their powers in an attempt to intimidate me into moving the event out of Martin Place . "
The Greens event will be a media conference with a group of party members dressed to resemble lifesavers as Greens senator Kerry Nettle calls on APEC leaders to be climate savers .
Police in central Sydney are engaged in a necessary security " overkill " for APEC , the NSW Government says .
Deputy Premier John Watkins has defended police tactics after reports that a city restaurant was told to leave cutlery off outdoor tables , office workers were directed to not to look at passing helicopters , and police leafed through journalists ' notebooks .
As APEC meets , the good ship “ humanity ” is steaming into the teeth of a hurricane with our leaders asleep at the wheel , as the great global issues of climate change and the peaking of oil supply converge .
The need to address human - induced climate change is finally reaching the top of the political agenda , driven primarily by scientific and community concern rather than by any proactive political leadership .
Even now , the political rhetoric confirms that our leaders do not understand or accept the seriousness of our position , and the limited time to take action in reducing carbon emissions before we encounter dangerous climate change .
Recent science suggests that the danger level for atmospheric carbon concentrations , to keep warming below 2 oC , is 450 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent , possibly lower .
Current atmospheric carbon concentrations are 430 ppm CO2e , increasing at 3 ppm per annum and accelerating fast , both here and overseas .
In theory that leaves 7 years before we reach the danger point of 450 p pm .
In reality , given accelerating emissions and the non-linear climatic response which is occurring , we probably have no more than 4 - 5 years to turn down emissions growth .
As there is considerable lag before any reduction in emissions takes effect , substantive action is required now , not in 2011 as the government proposes ; by then we may already be in the danger zone .
...
These challenges are daunting , but successful solutions first require that we accept a wider underlying problem ; namely that human activity is pushing way beyond the ability of the global environment to absorb its impact , thereby threatening the survival of society as we know it .
Further , it will not be resolved by conventional market economics , or technology , in isolation .
Markets are important , but they must be redesigned in line with a fundamental rethink of our values .
Politically , we have yet to cross that threshold and it may take some further crises , or preferably more community pressure , to force the issue .
Climate change and peak oil are only forerunners of many other issues stemming from the impact of human activity .
If a global “ Tragedy of the Commons ” is to be avoided in the 21C , we have to cede sovereignty from narrow national self - interest , to support equitable global solutions .
As global population grows from 6.5 to 9 billion over the next 40 years , per capita allocation mechanisms , whilst anathema to many conventional market economists , will become commonplace .
If complemented with national and international market trading , they can address many of the intractable problems that arise from global inequity , such as failed states , poverty and terrorism .
Which brings us back to APEC .
The 21 APEC leaders are convening for three days to focus on solutions to major global problems .
At present , there is nothing more important than managing our transition to a sustainable global society ; without it , discussions on trade and security are meaningless .
Climate change is on the agenda , but peak oil is not mentioned although it is fundamental to the functioning of the global economy .
It is a great honour for Australia to host the APEC meeting .
However in the current critical circumstances , we are entitled to expect that our leaders devote themselves exclusively to the task of producing substantial initiatives , and dispense with the floss and photo opportunities .
Paul Keating is right ; we need big structural shifts , not more non-core , long - term , “ aspirational ” goals .
President Bush and Prime Minister Howard , between them , have done more to subvert serious action on climate change , and to endanger energy security , than anyone else on the planet .
The foolishness of their policies is being increasingly visited on communities across the world day by day , as extreme climatic events intensify .
They now have a unique opportunity to make amends with real leadership , by ensuring the APEC final communiqué signals the end of “ business - as - usual ” , with binding commitments to come to grips with these problems .
The global politics of climate change are very fluid .
And sometimes a dramatic shift in a nation 's policy can be overlooked by the media because its significance is not properly understood .
The declaration of the June G8 meeting in Heiligendamm provided a strong indication of where the debate is going .
In a crucial move that 's been overlooked in Australia , the statement declared that future negations should occur under the auspices of the Framework Convention on Climate Change .
Having attacked the UN for years , including its alleged failure to develop a viable response to climate change , President Bush ’s endorsement of the G8 statement was a huge concession .
In short , Bush blinked .
So where does that leave Prime Minister John Howard 's endorsement of APEC and AP6 over Kyoto and the UN , and ultimately , Australia 's place in the global climate change conversation ?
When it comes to implementing a carbon trading system , it could have dire economic consequences for this country .
The first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol begins on 1 January 2008 and it is now clear who is committed to action under it and what they will be doing .
The most important developments have been the emergence of the European emissions trading system , which has set the benchmark for the rest of the world , and the emergence of the Clean Development Mechanism , which is channelling billions of dollars of investment into developing countries .
Attention is focusing increasingly on what will emerge after the first commitment period ends in 2012 .
The parameters of what might emerge remain unclear , but pressure is mounting to ensure that the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , to be held in Bali in December , defines a pathway to a new agreement .
The 1992 UN Framework Convention is the mother treaty for the Kyoto Protocol , and the latter was agreed in 1997 because it was accepted that the voluntary measures set out on the Convention had failed to have any appreciable effect on the growth of greenhouse gas emissions .
The decision by the United States to negotiate a future treaty under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention has left the Howard Government stranded .
Although Australia ratified the Convention in the early 1990s , the Prime Minister has repeatedly attacked the UN process as flawed and insists that any progress on climate change must occur in other forums , notable AP6 and the forthcoming APEC meeting .
It does not yet seem to have acknowledged the import of the G8 agreement and the dramatic US shift .
While Howard could have relied on the US to back his push for a new international framework at the APEC meeting in Sydney in September , it now seems likely that the US will join with Japan and China in insisting that anything APEC agrees should be supplementary to Kyoto and should not undermine the task of negotiating a new agreement under the UN process .
The Howard plan for APEC to agree to some sort of ‘ pledge and review ’ system represents a return to the voluntary approach that the original Framework Convention showed cannot work , suggesting that the Government ’s thinking is stuck at around 1995 .
With Kyoto effectively bedded down , Europe is now turning its attention to what sort of structure will succeed it .
Recognising the fluidity of the situation , including the expected transition to a pro-climate administration in the United States at the end of 2008 , the EU understands that now is the time to adopt a flexible stance .
This has important implications for the Howard Government ’s decision to introduce an emissions trading system .
One of the key criteria identified by the Prime Minister ’s Task Group on Emissions Trading was that any domestic system should be able to be integrated into other systems , including Europe’s .
Integration has enormous potential advantages for Australian firms with carbon reduction obligations .
Europe has always insisted that no nation would be permitted to take part in its trading system unless it had ratified Kyoto .
This was done for pragmatic rather than political reasons , because ratification provides the same set of legal obligations on all Kyoto parties and thereby provides the basis for the harmonisation of trading systems .
It is now reported that Europe has changed its mind and will allow the linking of trading systems regardless of whether they have ratified the protocol .
Paul Kelly claims this represents ‘ a sharp change in Europe ’s mind set ’ signalling the obsolescence of Kyoto .
Like most of Kelly ’s commentary , this misunderstands the politics of climate change and the practicalities of policies .
Europe is talking post -2012 .
If Australia wanted to integrate its trading system with the European one before 2013 then it would be required to ratify first .
Europe is , however , taking a flexible view of what might lie beyond 2012 .
This is where Australia hopes it will be able to link its domestic system with others around the world , including the EU .
In principle the EU has no objection ; indeed , as a means of urging Australia to take a more serious approach to climate change , it encourages this thinking .
However , the Australian Government has not thought through the implications .
The report of Mr Howard ’s Task Group spends some time discussing the features a domestic system would need to have to be integrated into the EU system , and other systems being developed ( notably in the US ) that are also expected to be linked with the EU system in due course .
The proposed Australian system is designed to make future links possible .
But the Task Group shied away from the most important consideration of all .
What sort of targets will prevail in each country ?
When we pose this question it is apparent that there is no way any Australian system under the Howard Government could ever be linked with the EU system , and probably not those emerging in the US .
Why is this so ?
Earlier this year the Europe Union committed itself to a binding obligation to cut its emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 , with the option of increasing this to 30 per cent if other countries take comparable action .
This target will require far - reaching changes to the energy economy in the EU 27 .
The Howard Government , blinded by its ideological hostility to Europe , is only now waking up to the fact that Europe takes climate change very seriously indeed .
But any suggestion of an Australian target within coo-ee of the European one is met with howls of outrage from the Government .
Words like ‘ economic ruin ’ are thrown around .
The Howard Government ’s proposed emissions trading scheme , to begin in 2012 , will almost certainly have a very weak target , which will require much less of Australian emitters .
Hard targets in Europe and easy targets in Australia will mean that emission permits will be expensive in Europe and cheap here .
Linking of the two systems would see European firms rushing to Australia to buy cheap permits , and the price difference would disappear on the first day of trading .
One consequence would be the erosion of the integrity of the European targets , something the EU would simply not permit .
In Australia , polluters who thought they had it fairly easy would find that the price of permits had doubled or trebled overnight .
The only way to avoid this problem , which will apply to all attempts to link trading systems , is to harmonise not just the structures of the systems but the process of setting emission targets too .
Of course , this is precisely what happened at the Kyoto conference in 1997 .
Thus , implicit in the Prime Minister ’s grand plan to develop a system to replace the Kyoto Protocol is a structural imperative to replicate it .
This replication process even extends to the proposed method of integrating developing countries into a global trading scheme .
The Prime Minister ’s Task Group recommends a process based closely on the Clean Development Mechanism of the Protocol , which allows firms with carbon reduction obligations to generate credits by investing in emission reductions in poor countries .
So all roads lead back to the Kyoto Protocol or a structure very like it .
Despite all of the ill - informed attacks on the treaty in this country , the protocol was in truth an extraordinary achievement , the essential elements of which will inevitably be imitated in any subsequent global system .
THE Prime Minister , John Howard , has backed George Bush 's new global climate - change strategy to replace the Kyoto Protocol with a plan that calls for all big emitters to cut greenhouse gases , but avoids imposing binding targets on developed economies .
Their agreement was announced yesterday after the US President and Mr Howard met in Sydney , putting Australia squarely in the US camp on climate change - and at odds with European leaders , including the German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , who have backed firm targets for the developed economies .
...
The Greens leader , Bob Brown , attacked the agreement , calling Mr Bush " a climate dunderhead " .
Senator Brown said the President was the " world 's worst performer on climate change " .
...
The 21 APEC leaders are expected to release a declaration at the end of the summit that recognises the risks posed by dangerous climate change and proposes action on energy - efficiency targets and technology exchanges .
But even plans for an " aspirational " goal to cut global emissions may be ditched from the final declaration , as deep differences remain between the US and Australia on one hand and China and Japan on the other .
MURIEL HALSTED and Marjorie Eather have been worrying about coal for a long time .
Like others in the Upper Hunter , the Scone residents are well aware the industry has been a lifeblood for the region .
But that lifeblood is in danger of turning septic .
Greenhouse gases generated when coal is burnt are a major contributor to climate change .
The women were among almost 400 Scone residents yesterday who heard the scientist and Australian of the Year , Tim Flannery , talk about the dangers of climate change .
Professor Flannery said communities such as Scone could play an important role in a carbon constrained future .
...
But Australia would make no progress on climate change if it continued to burn coal with impunity .
" Within 40 years we need to have weaned ourselves off fossil fuels , at least in the way we burn them today , " Professor Flannery said .
Australia , he said , needed to sign the Kyoto Protocol .
" Everything else will flow from that .
As Australians , we have been spectacularly bad at taking part [ in the global ] discussion on climate change . "
Professor Flannery urged people to put pressure on all political parties to adopt tough climate change policies .
" I would not vote for anyone before I had the chance to talk to them about their position . "
Miners have applications before the State Government to extract 558 million tonnes of coal from mines across NSW .
A mine north of Scone owned by Bickham Coal Company has been given permission to extract 47 million tonnes .
That proposal prompted the Department of Planning to study the effect of mining on land used for grazing .
When burnt , the coal will release 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide , the equivalent of putting 446 million cars on the road for a year .
The Australia - China negotiations this week will cover three broad areas : long - term regional security , energy security and environmental security .
Both sides anticipate they will find enthusiastic common ground on the first two topics because they cover mutual interests , particularly trade and investment .
It is the third topic , the issue of the environment , that Australian officials acknowledge will be the most challenging .
Senior sources told The Australian yesterday that Mr Howard and his senior ministers would assure the Chinese that economic development and tackling climate were not mutually exclusive .
...
Mr Hu symbolically chose the boom state of Western Australia , supplier of 40 per cent of China 's iron ore , as the first stop of his week - long visit to Australia .
In a generous speech on Monday night , he toasted “ the friendly co-operation between China and Western Australia ” .
“ As an important energy base and a key state of agriculture , animal husbandry , services and hi-tech industry in Australia , Western Australia has made steady progress in economic and social development , ” he said .
Mr Hu said China 's relationship with the state had “ borne fruit in recent years ” .
“ China is now Western Australia 's largest export market and second - largest trading partner , ” he said .
“ There are a number of large projects of energy co-operation between China and Western Australia which have contributed to the economic development of both countries , ” Mr Hu said .
“ Our co-operation in culture , science and technology and education is growing profusely and has a bright future . ”
WOODSIDE
Petroleum has cut the largest export deal in Australian history , with plans to sell up to $ 45 billion worth of gas to China .
The agreement with PetroChina is for the potential sale of two to three million tonnes of LNG a year from the Browse project , offshore Western Australia , which Woodside operates .
The agreement will facilitate the sale of LNG to PetroChina over 15 to 20 years and bring revenues of $ 35 billion to $ 45 billion into Australia .
...
Woodside 's preliminary agreement with PetroChina sets the key commercial parameters normally included in a sale and purchase agreement , including LNG price .
“ The parties will negotiate in good faith to conclude an LNG supply agreement based on the key terms agreement , ” Woodside said .
“ Supply is targeted to commence during the period 2013 to 2015 . ”
The agreement is subject to conditions , including a final investment decision on the Browse project and relevant government approvals .
“ The Browse joint venturers have not been party to the agreement to this point , however the agreement provides the opportunity for commingled sales , ” Woodside said .
The key terms agreement was signed in Sydney this morning by Woodside chief executive Don Voelte and Zhou Jiping , vice - president China National Petroleum Corporation on behalf of PetroChina .
...
Mr Voelte said Woodside 's agreement strengthened the company 's position as an LNG supplier in the Asia - Pacific region , as China seeks to use more LNG to support its energy needs .
“ An agreement with such a significant foundation customer provides increased certainty to enable Woodside to move the Browse development forward , ” Woodside said .
The Browse basin is off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia .
The development , which is expected to cost up to $ 10 billion to develop , is due to deliver its first gas to Japanese customers by the end of 2010 .
BHP BILLITON 's plan to break into California 's hungry gas market with its $ US800 million ( $ 973 million ) Cabrillo Port proposal may be dead in the water but the rival " OceanWay " proposal from the North - West Shelf project operator Woodside lives on - for the time being at least .
Cabrillo Port was knocked back in May after it became something of an environmental , safety and real estate value cause celebre for Hollywood stars who call beachside Malibu home .
OceanWay has yet to attract that sort of high - profile attention and , to Woodside 's way of thinking , it is sufficiently different to stay that way .
But the environmental assessment of the project has only just begun now that Woodside 's application for a deepwater port licence has been " deemed complete " by US authorities .
OceanWay involves LNG being converted back to natural gas after being unloaded on to a regasification tanker floating 45 kilometres off the coast .
After regasification , the gas would be unloaded into underwater buoys connected to pipelines feeding into the existing southern California market through an entry point near Los Angeles International Airport .
...
There was also a friendly reminder from Woodside that developing what would be California 's first LNG receiving terminal meant a secure and reliable energy source covering 15 per cent of demand .
" This should guard against the price spikes that occurred in past California energy crises , " Mr Larson said .
Woodside said that California 's energy future was at risk .
Republican presidential contenders voiced support for the Iraq war Wednesday night despite a warning from anti-war candidate Ron Paul that they risk dragging the party down to defeat in 2008 .
...
Alone among the contenders , Paul , a veteran Texas congressman with a libertarian streak , made the case for withdrawing troops .
That drew a sharp challenge from Chris Wallace , one of the debate questioners , who asked whether the United States should take its marching orders from al - Qaida .
" No !
We should take our marching orders from our Constitution , " Paul shouted back , pointing his pen at Wallace for emphasis .
" We should not go to war without a declaration " by Congress .
Occasionally interrupted by applause , Paul doggedly stuck to his point .
" We have lost over 5,000 Americans over there in Afghanistan , in Iraq and plus the civilians killed , " he said during his exchange with Huckabee .
" How long — what do we have to pay to save face ?
That 's all we 're doing , is saving face .
It 's time we came home , " Paul said .
The big security breach is all the more amusing given the immense overkill of " security " stopping even the most innocuous activities at ground level .
Ian Dunlop of ASPO Australia has an article in Crikey on global warming and peak oil - " Do n't blow it APEC , habitable planets are hard to find " . I 'm dubious ( to say the least ) about the whole idea of " per capita allocation mechanisms " ( aka " carbon rations " and their peak oil equivalent advocated by the peak oil protocol ) .
A much better alternative is to institute carbon taxes , make them mandatory under the WTO agreements and invest in clean energy - the market will greedily go for broke building clean energy technology and we 'll have a bright future instead of some dismal quasi - wartime rationing system ... Clive Hamilton has an article in Crikey pointing out " Howard 's Kyoto alternative will have dire economic consequences " .
The SMH reports that the Rodent is backing Bush 's new " climate strategy " , which takes the rather useless tack of saying that reducing carbon emissions is a good thing ( rather like world peace ) but that concrete targets and actions are not needed ( rather like world peace ) .
Hopefully when their replacements are installed over the next 12 months or so we 'll see a sudden shift in direction including the introduction of carbon taxes .
The SMH also has an article on some locals in the Hunter Valley with a burning desire to put the coal industry out to pasture The Australia - China relationship is getting a lot of press this week , absent all the controversy that follows Bush around .
The Australian reports that Woodside has announced a $ 45 bn China export deal for LNG gas from the Browse development .
It seems the Browse / Pluto projects are duelling with Gorgon ( who announced a similar tentative deal yesterday ) to see who gets over the line first - though maybe all 3 will at this rate , leaving the East Timorese stranded and broke .
Woodside 's plans for a Californian LNG offloading terminal also continue to plod along .
Ron Paul has stuck to his guns at the latest debate between Republican presidential contenders , telling the torture brigade that they are all doomed to be defeated and that the time to leave Iraq is now .
Apparently Fox " News " has been trying to play down Paul 's winning the post - debate vote by coming up with the usual spurious allegations of Paul supporters spamming the polls - unfortunately pictures showing this can't be done are already circulating .

Another thought on Enron , following on my New Yorker piece .
One of the big points made by Jonathan Macey and others is that the Enron scandal is an example of “ receiver failure ” as well as “ transmitter failure ” : that is , that it was n’t just the case that the company sent misleading signals .
It was also the case that those who were supposed to be listening to and interpreting those signals did n’t do their job .
The exception , of course , were newspapers .
The Enron scandal was , in large part , broken by the Wall Street Journal .
This is strange , no ?
We operate with the assumption , particularly in our understanding of what makes financial markets efficient , that those with the best incentives to ferret out the truth are those who are partial — that is , are directly involved in the process — and those who are economically motivated , who have money at stake .
So you ’d think that hedge funds , shorts , arbs , and analysts — all of whom were massively partial and economically motivated — would have been the first to see the “ real ” Enron .
But they were n’t .
Reporters were , a group who — at least in theory — you ’d think were in the least advantageous position .
They are n’t partial to the proceedings .
They have no money at stake .
( Compared to their Wall Street counterparts , in fact , they barely make any money at all . )
They are n’t ( relatively speaking ) as well - trained as financial intermediaries .
They have to serve a general audience , which disposes them against highly technical examination .
There are real limits on how much space and time they can devote to a particular story , and their rewards for doing well are almost entirely internal and professional : good reporters are rewarded , largely , by having their status elevated among other reporters .
On Wall Street , seeing truth gets you a million dollar bonus .
At a newspaper , it gets you a slap on the back .
We ’ve spent a lot of time , post - Enron , criticizing the flaws in the investment community ’s gatekeeping activities .
But I think we should also recognize what the Enron case tells us about the value of newspaper journalism .
Maybe , in other words , we have underestimated the value of impartial , professionally - motivated , under - paid and overworked generalists in tackling the kind of information - rich , analysis - dependent “ mysteries ” that the modern world throws at us .
All of which , of course , points out the irony of what ’s happening in the newspaper business right now .
We are dismantling the institution of newspaper journalism precisely at the moment when it seems to be of greatest social value .

Police said it was ' unacceptable and dangerous '
Martin Veens was spotted driving his left - hand 40 - tonne truck erratically on the A55 road near Northop , Flintshire .
Prestatyn magistrates heard how the North Wales Police helicopter 's camera filmed him holding and eating from a saucepan as he steered with his knees .
Veens , from the Netherlands , was banned from driving for a year .
At the hearing , magistrates were shown the footage taken by the police .
Chicken carcasses
Prestatyn magistrates heard how the North Wales Police helicopter 's camera filmed him holding and eating from a saucepan as he steered with his knees .
It showed Veens , whose address was given in court as " care of HSF Logistics ( UK ) , Blakenham " , straddling the white lines in the road as he used his left hand to hold a saucepan of food and his right hand holding a fork as he steered the truck with his legs .
It was travelling up the steep Rhuallt Hill and was stopped a few miles further at Northop .
The court heard how Veens accepted his driving was dangerous .
His solicitor said it was agreed it had been an outstandingly stupid thing to do .
Martin Veens admitted he was driving dangerously
Veens was delivering chicken carcasses from Llangefni in Anglesey to Nottingham and had heated the spaghetti while the lorry was being loaded , the court heard .
He was banned from driving for a year and must take an extended test before driving a heavy goods vehicle again .
Chief Supt Geraint Anwyl , of North Wales Police , welcomed the sentence .
He said : " This is a further example of some of the unacceptable and dangerous practices of long - distance lorry drivers travelling on our roads .
" The frightening thing is that this is not an isolated incident . "
The rings of Uranus are shown here captured almost exactly edge - on to Earth .
This false - colour image was obtained by the NAOS - CONICA infrared camera on ESO 's Very Large Telescope at Paranal , Chile .
It was taken at 9:00 UT on 16 Aug. 2007 , just two hours after Earth had crossed to the lit side of the ring plane .
We are peering over the sunlit face of the rings at an opening of only 0.003 degree , an angle so small that the thin rings nearly disappear .
At right , the region around the planet has been enhanced to show a thin line , which is sunlight glinting off the ring edges and also reflected by dust clouds embedded within the system .
The pictures at left shows the planet and identifies four of its largest moons .
One can clearly discern banding in the atmosphere and a bright cloud feature near the planet 's south polar collar , on the left side of the image .
This is a composite of images taken at infrared wavelengths .
The planet is shown in false colour , based on images taken at wavelengths of 1.2 and 1.6 microns .
The rings are extracted from an image taken at 2.2 microns , where the planet is darker and therefore the rings are easier to detect .
The observations were done by Daphne Stam ( TU Delft ) and Markus Hartung ( ESO , Chile ) , in close collaboration with Mark Showalter ( SETI ) and Imke de Pater ( UC Berkeley and TU Delft ) .

As the rings of Uranus swing edge - on to Earth - a short - lived view we get only once every 42 years - astronomers observing the event are getting an unprecedented , glare - free view of the rings and the fine dust that permeates them .
The rings were discovered in 1977 , so this is the first opportunity astronomers have had to observe a Uranus ring crossing and perhaps to discover a new moon or two .
While the Keck II telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope have been looking at the planet for years in anticipation of this event , ground - based telescopes in Chile and southern California have targeted the planet during the actual ring crossing .
Based on the Keck observations , a team of astronomers led by Imke de Pater of University of California , Berkeley , reports today ( Thursday , Aug. 23 ) in Science Express , the online edition of Science magazine , that the rings of micron - sized dust have changed significantly since the Voyager 2 spacecraft photographed the Uranus system 21 years ago .
She will discuss the results during a talk today at the European Planetary Science Congress 2007 meeting in Potsdam , Germany .
The inner rings are much more prominent than expected , revealing material in otherwise empty regions of the system of rings .
" People tend to think of the rings as unchanging , but our observations show that not to be the case , " said de Pater , a UC Berkeley professor of astronomy .
" There are a lot of forces acting on small dust grains , so it is not that crazy to find that the arrangement of rings has changed . "
Using the near infrared camera ( NIRC2 ) and adaptive optics on the Keck II telescope on May 28 , the team took striking images of the nearly edge - on ring appearing as a bright line bisecting a dim Uranus , which appears dark in the infrared .
The observations were conducted during an engineering run by Marcos van Dam , adaptive optics scientist at the W. M. Keck Observatory , after the installation of a new wavefront sensor .
" The improvements to the adaptive optics systems allowed us to capture unbelievably crisp images of Uranus ; it was as if the Keck telescope was orbiting in space , " said van Dam .
On Aug. 14 , the Hubble Space Telescope also imaged the planet very near the moment when the rings were perfectly aligned with Earth , showing similar features but also including some recently - discovered outer rings .
The image was released today by the Space Telescope Science Institute .
" The outermost ring is not visible in our infrared images , " said de Pater 's co-author , Heidi B. Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .
" This ring is very blue , and therefore harder to see in the infrared .
We may detect it when the rings are fully edge - on and when we can observe it for several hours . "
With further analysis of the Hubble data , astronomer Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute hopes to detect some of the small moons , and perhaps some not seen before , that shepherd the debris into distinct rings .
" Two little satellites called Cordelia and Ophelia straddle the brightest ring , the epsilon ring , and keep it in place , but people have always assumed there must be a bunch more of these satellites that are confining the nine other narrow rings , " Showalter said .
" This is the unique viewing geometry that only comes along once in 42 years , when we have a chance of imaging these tiny satellites , because normally they are lost in the glare of the rings .
Now , the rings are essentially invisible . "
Astronomers at the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile , run by the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) , and at the Palomar Observatory in southern California operated by the California Institute of Technology , also observed Uranus during the current crossing .
" The VLT took data at the precise moment when the rings were edge - on to Earth , " said de Pater , who worked with two team members observing in Chile : Daphne Stam of the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands and Markus Hartung of ESO .
Meanwhile , astronomers Philip Nicholson of Cornell University in New York and Keith Matthews of Caltech observed from atop Mt. Palomar .
Until Voyager flew by in January 1986 , the rings were only known from the way they temporarily blocked the light of stars passing behind Uranus .
Earth - based images have been too blurry until recently , with the advent of Keck adaptive optics and the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble telescope .
Nevertheless , when the sunlit side of Uranus 's rings are in full view of Earth , the densely - packed rings reflect so much light that their glare completely dominates the fainter glow from micron - sized dust .
Earth 's orbit around the sun permits three opportunities to view the rings edge - on : Uranus made its first ring crossing as seen from Earth on May 3 , it made its second crossing on Aug. 16 , and will cross for the third and last time on Feb 20 , 2008 .
Though the last ring crossing relative to Earth will be hidden behind the sun , most of Earth 's premier telescopes , including Keck , Hubble , VLT and Palomar , plan to focus on the planet again in the days following Dec. 7 .
" December 7 is the Uranian equinox , when the rings are perfectly edge - on to the sun , and after that , there is a brief period again when we will view the dark side of the rings , before they become illuminated again for another 42 years , " Hammel said .
The advantage of observations at a ring - plane crossing is that it becomes possible to look at the rings from the shadowed side .
From that vantage , the normally - bright outer rings grow fainter because their centimeter - to meter - sized rocks obscure one another , while the dim inner rings get brighter as their material merges into a thin band along the line of sight .
The dust belts that Voyager saw differ radically from today 's dust distribution , according to coauthors de Pater and Showalter .
Most interesting is a broad , inner ring called zeta , whose position today is several thousand kilometers farther from the planet than when it was discovered by Voyager .
" The ring may have moved , or it may be an entirely new ring , " noted Showalter .
Similar , dramatic changes in dust distribution have also been observed recently in Saturn 's and Neptune 's rings .
This is not surprising , because gravity keeps the larger ring particles in orbit , but other smaller forces can nudge the tiny dust grains around , de Pater said .
These forces include pressure from sunlight , drag produced as the dust plows through ionized plasma around Uranus , and even drag from the planet 's magnetic field .
" Impacts into the larger bodies in the system also could knock dust off and create new rings , " de Pater said .
" With further observations , the time scales over which these variations occur should provide new insight into the physical processes at work , " the authors concluded .

Erin Pizzey , founder of the battered wives ' refuge , on how militant feminists - with the collusion of Labour 's leading women - hijacked her cause and used it to try to demonise all men .
During 1970 , I was a young housewife with a husband , two children , two dogs and a cat .
We lived in Hammersmith , West London , and I did n't see much of my husband because he worked for TV's Nationwide .
I was lonely and isolated , and longed for something other than the usual cooking , cleaning and housework to enter my life .
By the early Seventies , a new movement for women - demanding equality and rights - began to make headlines in the daily newspapers .
Among the jargon , I read the words " solidarity " and " support " .
I passionately believed that women would no longer find themselves isolated from each other , and in the future could unite to change our society for the better .
Within a few days I had the address of a local group in Chiswick , and I was on my way to join the Women 's Liberation Movement .
I was asked to pay £ 3 and ten shillings as a joining fee , told to call other women " sisters " and that our meetings were to be called " collectives " .
My fascination with this new movement lasted only a few months .
At the huge " collectives " , I heard shrill women preaching hatred of the family .
They said the family was not a safe place for women and children .
I was horrified at their virulence and violent tendencies .
I stood on the same platforms trying to reason with the leading lights of this new organisation .
I ended up being thrown out by the movement .
My crime was to warn some of the women working in the Women 's Liberation Movement office off Shaftesbury Avenue that if it persisted in cooperating with a plan to bomb Biba , a fashionable clothes shop in Kensington , I would call the police .
Biba was bombed because the women 's movement thought it was a capitalist enterprise devoted to sexualising women 's bodies .
I decided that I was wasting my time trying to influence what , to my mind , was a Marxist / feminist movement touting for money from gullible women like myself .
By that time , I 'd met a small group of women in my area who agreed with me .
We persuaded Hounslow council to give us a tiny house in Belmont Terrace in Chiswick .
We had two rooms upstairs , two rooms downstairs , a kitchen and an outside lavatory .
We installed a telephone and typewriter , and we were in business .
Every day after dropping my children at school , I went to our little house , which we called the Women 's Aid .
Soon women from all over Chiswick were coming to ask for help .
At last we had somewhere women could meet each other and bring their children .
My long , lonely days were over .
But then something happened that made me understand that our role was going to be more than just a forum where women could exchange ideas .
One day , a lady came in to see us .
She took off her jersey , and we saw that she was bruised and swollen across her breasts and back .
Her husband had taken a chair leg to her .
She looked at me and said : " No one will help me . "
For a moment I was somersaulted back in time .
I was six years old , standing in front of a teacher at school .
My legs were striped and bleeding from a whipping I had received from an ironing cord .
" My mother did this to me last night , " I said .
" No wonder , " replied the teacher .
" ' You 're a dreadful child . "
No one would help me then and nobody would ever imagine that my beautiful , rich mother - who was married to a diplomat - could be a violent abuser .
Until that moment 35 years later , I had buried my past and assumed that because we had social workers , probation officers , doctors , hospitals and solicitors , victims of violence had enough help .
I quickly discovered , as battered women with their children poured into the house , that whatever was going on behind other people 's front doors was seen as nobody else 's business .
If someone was beaten up on the street , it was a criminal offence ; the same beating behind a closed door was called " a domestic " ' and the police had no rights or power to interfere .
The shocking fact for me was that there had been a deafening silence on the subject of domestic violence .
All the social agencies knew about domestic violence , but nobody talked about it .
I searched for literature to help me understand this epidemic , but there was nothing to read except a few articles on child abuse in medical journals .
So in 1974 I decided to write Scream Quietly Or The Neighbours Will Hear , the first book in the world on domestic violence .
I revealed that women and children were being abused in their own homes and they could n't escape because the law would n't protect them .
If a husband claimed he would have his wife back , she could n't claim any money from the Department of Health and Social Security , and social services could only offer to take the children into care .
Meanwhile , our little house was packed with women fleeing their violent partners - sometimes as many as 56 mothers and children in four rooms .
All had terrible stories , but I recognised almost immediately that not all the women were innocent .
Some were as violent as the men , and violent towards their children .
The social workers involved with these women told me I was wasting my time because the women would only return to their partners .
I was determined to try to break the chain of violence .
But as the local newspaper picked up the story of our house , I grew worried about a very different threat .
I knew that the radical feminist movement was running out of national support because more sensible women had shunned their anti-male , anti-family agenda .
Not only were they looking for a cause , they also wanted money .
In 1974 , the women living in my refuge organised a meeting in our local church hall to encourage other groups to open refuges across the country .
We were astonished and frightened that many of the radical lesbian and feminist activists that I had seen in the collectives attended .
They began to vote themselves into a national movement across the country .
After a stormy argument , I left the hall with my abused mothers - and what I had most feared happened .
In a matter of months , the feminist movement hijacked the domestic violence movement , not just in Britain , but internationally .
Our grant was given to them and they had a legitimate reason to hate and blame all men .
They came out with sweeping statements which were as biased as they were ignorant .
" All women are innocent victims of men's violence , " they declared .
They opened most of the refuges in the country and banned men from working in them or sitting on their governing committees .
Women with alcohol or drug problems were refused admittance , as were boys over 12 years old .
Refuges that let men work there were refused affiliation .
Our group in Chiswick worked with as many refuges as we could .
Good , caring women still work in refuges across the country , but many women working in the feminist refuges , about 350 , admit they are failing women who most need them .
With the first donation we received in 1972 , we employed a male playgroup leader because we felt our children needed the experience of good , gentle men .
We devised a treatment programme for women who recognised that they , too , were violent and dysfunctional .
And we concentrated on children hurt by violence and sexual abuse .
Yet the feminist refuges continued to create training programmes that described only male violence against women .
Slowly , the police and other organisations were brainwashed into ignoring the research that was proving men could also be victims .
Despite attacks in the Press from feminist journalists and threatening anonymous telephone calls , I continued to argue that violence was a learned pattern of behaviour from early childhood .
When , in the mid-Eighties , I published Prone To Violence , about my work with violence - prone women and their children , I was picketed by hundreds of women from feminist refuges , holding placards which read : " All men are bastards " and " All men are rapists " .
Because of violent threats , I had to have a police escort around the country .
It was bad enough that this relatively small group of women was influencing social workers and police .
But I became aware of a far more insidious development in the form of public policy - making by powerful women , which was creating a poisonous attitude towards men .
In 1990 , Harriet Harman ( who became a Cabinet minister ) , Anna Coote ( who became an adviser to Labour 's Minister for Women ) and Patricia Hewitt ( yes , she 's in the Labour Cabinet , too ! ) expressed their beliefs in a social policy paper called The Family Way .
It said : " It can not be assumed that men are bound to be an asset to family life , or that the presence of fathers in families is necessarily a means to social harmony and cohesion . "
It was a staggering attack on men and their role in modern life .
Hewitt , in a book by Geoff Dench called Transforming Men published in 1995 , said : " But if we want fathers to play a full role in their children 's lives , then we need to bring men into the playgroups and nurseries and the schools .
And here , of course , we hit the immediate difficulty of whether we can trust men with children . "
In 1998 , however , the Home Office published a historic study which stipulated that men as well as women could be victims of domestic violence .
With that report in my hand , I tried to reason with Joan Ruddock , who was then Minister for Women .
The figures for battered men were " minuscule " she insisted and she continued to refer to men only as " perpetrators " .
For nearly four decades , these pernicious attitudes towards family life , fathers and boys have permeated the thinking of our society to such an extent that male teachers and carers are now afraid to touch or cuddle children .
Men can be accused of violence towards their partners and sexual abuse without evidence .
Courts discriminate against fathers and refuse to allow them access to their children on the whims of vicious partners .
Of course , there are dangerous men who manipulate the court systems and social services to persecute their partners and children .
But by blaming all men , we have diluted the focus on this minority of men and pushed aside the many men who would be willing to work with women towards solutions .
I believe that the feminist movement envisaged a new Utopia that depended upon destroying family life .
In the new century , so their credo ran , the family unit will consist of only women and their children .
Fathers are dispensable .
And all that was yoked - unforgivably - to the debate about domestic violence .
To my mind , it has never been a gender issue - those exposed to violence in early childhood often grow up to repeat what they have learned , regardless of whether they are girls or boys .
I look back with sadness to my young self and my vision that there could be places where people - men , women and children who have suffered physical and sexual abuse - could find help , and if they were violent could be given a second chance to learn to live peacefully .
I believe that vision was hijacked by vengeful women who have ghetto - ised the refuge movement and used it to persecute men .
Surely the time has come to challenge this evil ideology and insist that men take their rightful place in the refuge movement .
We need an inclusive movement that offers support to everyone that needs it .
As for me - I will always continue to work with anyone who needs my help or can help others - and yes , that includes men .
Flash memory chips are used in MP3 players and digital cameras
The 64 gigabit ( Gb ) chips could be used to make 128 gigabyte memory cards , commonly used in MP3 players , capable of holding the equivalent of 80 DVDs .
The chips are built using circuits with a minimum feature size of just 30 billionths of a metre ( nanometre ) .
Rival firm Toshiba has said it is also working with similar technology .
Both firms will release products in 2009 .
Flash advance
Flash memory is a so - called non-volatile computer memory , primarily used in memory cards , USB drives and MP3 players .
Non-volatile memory retains information even when there is no power to the device .
Samsung said there was currently " exploding demand " for flash memory as a storage medium in a range of applications .
The new chips are designed to be used in a specific type of memory known as NAND flash .
NAND is one of two types of flash memory and offers higher storage and faster speeds than the cheaper NOR flash .
NOR is commonly used in low - end applications where smaller memory capacity and slower speeds are acceptable , such as in cheaper mobile phone handsets .
Samsung has said that a single chip could be used in an MP3 player capable of holding 18,000 songs .
Combining 16 chips would allow 128GB devices , the company said , making Flash a rival to hard drives .
" This has the biggest storage capacity of a single memory chip ever developed in the world , " Kwon Hyosun of the firm told AFP .
Toshiba announced its plans to use 30nm technology earlier this month .
" Our goal is to gain an edge over rivals by supplying the most advanced chips before anyone else , " a spokeswoman for Toshiba said at the time .

UU World Magazine Winter 2007 , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association
Social Justice , UU Identity
Each week between 1959 and 1964 , a darkly tanned Rod Serling slid into the frame of television screens across the United States and intoned , with clenched jaw and smoke - damaged voice : “ There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man .
. . .
It lies between the pit of man ’s fears and the summit of his knowledge .
This is the dimension of imagination .
It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone . ”
Even now , humming The Twilight Zone ’s eerie theme song is easy code for anything that falls along the creepy edges of everyday life .
Serling , who conceived , narrated , and wrote 92 of the show ’s 156 scripts , is almost as recognizable .
Serling was part of television ’s early “ Golden Age . ”
He drew acclaim for his provocative teleplays , winning Emmys for “ Patterns , ” about the ethics of corporate ladder climbing , and “ Requiem for a Heavyweight , ” an indictment of the seedy world of prize fighters .
But TV executives discovered they could make more money with sitcoms , Westerns , and reruns than with nuanced drama , and advertisers demanded censorship rights — changing the race or religion of Serling ’s characters or watering down plots they deemed controversial .
Serling , who throughout his life spoke out eloquently on political issues —
McCarthyism , racism , the Vietnam War , and nuclear weapons — was incensed .
In 1960 he testified before the Federal Communications Commission against television censorship .
In Serling ’s off - kilter world of the mind , advertisers let him assert his social conscience with a freedom he never had writing straight drama .
“ There were so many taboos , so many censors , so many things you could n’t do , ” says Carol Serling , Rod ’s widow .
“ But with The Twilight Zone , sponsors basically just did n’t understand what he was doing . ”
He confronted capital punishment in an episode called “ The Execution , ” fear of atomic war in “ The Shelter , ” and prejudice in “ Monsters Are Due on Maple Street . ”
“ The singular evil of our time is prejudice , ” Serling told the Los Angeles Times in 1967 .
“ In almost everything I ’ve written there is a thread of this : a man ’s seemingly palpable need to dislike someone other than himself . ”
Serling had seen heavy combat in the Philippines in World War II and suffered the rest of his life from shrapnel wounds , nightmares , and insomnia .
He later credited these , along with an active imagination fed by his childhood passion for horror films , for inspiring his stories of the bizarre .
Most of his stories were about everyday characters grappling with the psychological kinks most people feel at times — déjà vu , nightmares , daydreams , and what today might be called post - traumatic stress disorder .
After the war he enrolled on the GI Bill at Antioch College in Ohio , where he met Carol Kramer , whose family had long been Unitarian .
Later , Serling wrote a Hallmark Hall of Fame teleplay about the college ’s first president , Unitarian Horace Mann , quoting a piece of advice he admired : “ Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity . ”
The Serlings joined the UU Community Church of Santa Monica , California , which Carol still attends .
“ Theologically speaking , Rod was what we call a naturalistic humanist , and that was the underlying philosophy of my pulpit , ” says the Rev. Ernest Pipes , now minister emeritus .
“ Racial issues , class , power — you find all of these in his writings , and he found reinforcement for his viewpoints in his congregation . ”
Pipes remembers
Serling as generous both in money — he often led lucrative fundraisers showing and discussing his teleplays — and in spirit .
At one church picnic , Pipes and Serling collided running for a fly ball .
“ I said , ‘ My , I hope I did n’t hurt your writing arm , ’ and he was generous enough to reply , ‘ Ernie , I hope I did n’t hurt yours ! ’ ”
Serling , whose work pace and four - pack - a - day cigarette habit alarmed even his 1960s Hollywood colleagues , died in 1975 at age 50 during open - heart surgery .

William Belknap , Ulysses S. Grant ’s disgraced secretary of war , is experiencing a revival .
Impeached in 1876 for taking bribes , he has become the inspiration for a movement to remove Attorney General Alberto Gonzales from office .
Impeachment is usually thought of as limited to presidents , but the Constitution not only allows the impeachment of Cabinet members , in Belknap ’s case , it was actually done .
Impeaching Mr. Gonzales has moved beyond the hypothetical , now that Jay Inslee , Democrat of Washington , and five other prosecutors - turned - representatives have introduced a resolution to conduct an impeachment inquiry .
Congress is wary , and not only because of post - Clinton impeachment hangover .
The grounds set out in the Constitution are vague , and the Democrats do not want to be seen as overreaching .
Members of Congress should keep in mind , however , that the founders gave them the impeachment power for a reason — and Mr. Gonzales ’s malfeasance is just the sort they were worried about .
The Constitution provides for impeachment for “ treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
Not a clear formula , but it was n’t meant to be .
Impeachment , Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 65 , cannot be “ tied down ” by “ strict rules , either in the delineation of the offense ” by the House , or “ in the construction of it ” by the Senate .

Wildfires during heat waves can ravage countryside
The authors of the research also discovered that the frequency of extremely hot days has nearly tripled in the past century .
The study suggests many previous assessments of daily summer temperature underestimated the change in heatwaves in Western Europe by about 30 % .
The research appears in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres .
The team found that heatwaves lasted an average of three days now , with some lasting up to 13 days .
This compares with an average of about 1.5 days in 1880 .
Paul Della - Marta , from MeteoSwiss in Zurich , Switzerland , and colleagues analysed daily maximum temperature data from 54 recording stations across Europe .
We 're getting stronger heat waves or perhaps summers that are not so strong in terms of heat - relative to an increasing trend .
This is a major cause for concern
Paul Della - Marta , MeteoSwiss
Forty - six sets of records date back to the 19th Century ; others go back to the early 1900s .
The data sets come from as far north as Finland , as far south as Spain and as far east as Croatia .
In the past , however , thermometers were not kept in modern Stevenson screens .
These wooden shelters protect thermometers from direct sunlight and indirect radiation coming from the ground , both of which distort temperature readings .
Once the researchers had corrected for these effects , they found a " warm bias " in observations made prior to the introduction of these screens .
In other words , temperatures were recorded as being hotter than they really were .
This in turn meant the increase in temperature over time appeared to be smaller than it actually was .
Hot zone
The authors of the latest study also corrected for other biases in the variability of summer temperatures .
We can expect more extremes of temperature in future
" We see a doubling of the length of heatwaves and we also see a tripling in the frequency of one - off events . "
The results support the idea that the western European climate in summer is becoming more variable - that the range of temperatures had increased .
" We 're getting stronger heat waves or perhaps summers that are not so strong in terms of heat - relative to an increasing trend .
This is a major cause for concern , " Dr Della - Marta explained .
Co-author Malcolm Haylock , from re-insurer PartnerRe in Zurich , Switzerland , and formerly of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , UK commented : " We expect to see the largest impact of global warming on extreme temperatures in the future , and this study shows that these large changes are already occurring now . "
The heatwave experienced by Europe in 2003 had major adverse socio-economic and environmental effects .
Thousands of elderly people died .
Forests were devastated by fire , water ecosystems were strained , and the total mass of Alpine glaciers shrank by 10 % .
The authors say we can expect extreme weather events like this to occur more frequently in future .
The paper 's other authors were Jurg Luterbacher and Heinz Wanner , both of the University of Bern , Switzerland .

This past Friday , several dozen Angelenos , organized by the Los Angeles National Impeachment Center ( LANIC ) under the leadership of LANIC Executive Director Peter Thottam , appeared before the Los Angeles City Council to demand that Los Angeles become the 82nd city in the nation to draft a resolution to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Supporting these un-elected everyday patriots in their quest to save their nation was Progressive Democratic Councilmember , Bill Rosendahl , who promises to introduce an impeachment resolution in the Council as soon as ONE of his fellow Councilmembers agrees to be a co-sponsor .
Now how pathetic is that !
Considering the damage George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have done to the United States with their egregious violations of the Constitution , it is unfathomable that patriotic Councilman Rosendahl does n't have unanimous Council approval RIGHT NOW to impeach George Bush and Dick Cheney .
One would think any elected official who honors the Constitution would proudly join Councilman Rosendahl to hold the Executive Branch of this nation accountable for its blatant abuse of power .
Unfortunately , the cowardice and abrogation of responsibility at the national level in Washington , DC , as demonstrated by Congress ' failure to execute articles of impeachment against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , has set a precedent for dereliction that seeps down through the ranks of government to contaminate state , city and local officials as well .
Spinelessness at the top inspires spinelessness at the bottom .
At the federal level , Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi displays disdain for the Constitution by publicly disavowing it .
Mrs. Pelosi declines to honor Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution which authorizes the House to initiate articles of impeachment against any President believed to have committed high crimes and misdemeanors .
According to attorney and former New York Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman , co-author of " The Impeachment of George W. Bush , " high crimes and misdemeanors are interpreted as abuses of power .
Recognizing how George W. Bush and Dick Cheney abused their power by illegally wiretapping American citizens , imprisoning American citizens and denying them access to legal representation , lying our nation into war , authorizing torture , and myriad other abuses , it is astonishing to anyone who has ever read the Constitution that every elected government official is n't rushing to hold Bush and Cheney accountable for their crimes .
Any elected official who is not voting to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is either unfamiliar with the Constitution or purposely forsaking it .
Either situation , be it willful ignorance or willful defiance , renders them unsuitable for office .
Time and again un-elected patriots march and rally across America and visit the offices of federal , state , city and local legislators to implore them to protect this nation from the clear and present danger of the unitary executive .
Time and again the un-elected patriots of this nation display a love of country and a commitment to its laws above and beyond those who have lied their way into office .
And yes , they HAVE lied !
At every level of government the oath of elected office is the same : allegiance to the Constitution and a commitment to protect this nation from all enemies both foreign and domestic .
The Constitution is NEVER off the table .
The Constitution is NEVER overruled , and it is ALWAYS the law of the land - including Article I Section 2 .
What is clear from this youtube video of the citizens ' pleas to the Los Angeles City Council , is how much more these un-elected ordinary citizens care for their nation 's welfare than the elected officials before them .
The more the American people demonstrate their strength at every level , the more rapidly representative democracy will take place .
The more the American people realize their own strength , the more substantive leaders they are certain to produce - like Peter Thottam and Marcy Winograd who work tirelessly to build representative democracy in LA .
The more substantial candidates we are able to produce , the more derelict officials we are able to replace .
Let 's build !

The recent entry of Apple ( AAPL ) and the looming Google ( GOOG ) OS for mobiles are a cause of concern for everyone – from handset makers to mobile carriers .
Their mobile forays should be of serious concern for Mobile OS makers such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Symbian .
While Apple wants to gobble up the high - end smart phone market , Google wants to come from below and commoditize the Mobile OS business .
Jerry Panagrossi , vice president of US operations for smart phone OS maker , does n’t seem to be too worried ( or doing an awesome job of faking it ) about the two competitive threats to his London - based company ’s livelihood .
“ The US market for smart phones has been mostly enterprise related , but Apple has jump started the consumer demand for smart phone , ” he said in a chat earlier today at our offices .
“ Apple ’s market share gains show that devices can make a difference , ” said Panagrossi .
He believes now handset makers will start thinking about making interesting and innovative handsets available in the US .
Hopefully some of them will be using Symbian ’s mobile OS , commonly found in high - end Nokia ( NOK ) and Sony Ericsson ( SNE ) mobile phones .
The number of Symbian - based phones increased 44 % to 34.6 million in the first six months of 2007 from 24 million in 1H 2006 , with a quarter of those sales coming from Japan .
The recent success of Nokia N95 and E - Series phones has also helped Symbian boost its revenues to about $ 172 million .
It is not clear if the company turned a profit .
Nokia will soon launch a US 3G version of its best selling N95 phone soon , and hopefully that will be enough to jump start OS maker ’s anemic market share in the US market .
I do n’t know how they are going to do that unless they come up with smart phones for CDMA - based carriers .
Yet , they seem to be in buoyant mood .
Symbian forecasts that US demand for smart phones is going to get into high gear around Christmas time and will grow at a rapid clip through most of 2008 .
That means new mobile handsets in the US .
Symbian team was carrying the new Motorola ( MOT ) Z8 slider that is based on their OS , and it did look pretty sweet .
( It was a remarkable improvement over Motorola ’s UI . )
Most of the newer Symbian - based phones include Motorola Z8 are packed with multimedia features , thanks to a recent upgrade of the OS by the company .
Symbian predicts that most of the high - end features found in Japanese handsets such as advanced 3G , motion sensors and TV playback are going to become commonplace in 2008 .
The push he believes will come from the carriers , they believe .
“ Our experience shows that when the mobile market reaches a level of maturity , the demand for smart phones grows sharply , ” Panagrossi said , pointing to Japan and Europe as examples .
“ In a saturated market innovation around handsets becomes a key factor . ”
“ Apple has raised the bar in term of usability , and there are many fast followers ( handset makers such as LG and Samsung ) who are taking notice , ” he points out .
At present there are three UIs on top of Symbian – Nokia ’s S60 , Sony Ericsson ’s UIQ and MOAP ( very popular in Japan ) and possibility exists that another UI could emerge in the near future .
When asked about Google OS , Symbian folks said that all that is out there has been rumors .
When it happens , they will talk about it at that point .
Panagrossi said that the company has spent over $ 750 million on developing its OS , and has a developer network , along with partnerships with handset makers and carriers , that others will have to develop .
“ We have been doing this for ten years , and it has taken us many man years to come up with a mature solution , ” he said .
Lets hope that is enough .
JEmacs The Java / Scheme - based Emacs Per Bothner < per@bothner.com >
Abstract JEmacs is a re-implementation of the Emacs programmable text editor .
It is written in Java , and currently uses the Swing GUI toolkit .
Emacs is based on the extension language Emacs Lisp ( Elisp ) , which is a dynamically - scoped member of the Lisp family .
JEmacs supports Elisp , as well as the use of Scheme , a more modern statically - scoped Lisp dialect .
Both languages get compiled to Java bytecodes , either in advance or on - the - fly , using the Kawa compilation framework .
This article is an update of a paper presented at the 2000 Usenix conference .
Introduction Emacs [ Emacs ] [ EmacsManual ] ( in various versions ) is a popular programmer 's text editor .
Emacs is programmable using ‘ Emacs Lisp ’ ( Elisp ) [ Elisp ] and many powerful packages are written in Elisp .
The Free Software Foundation has a goal to replace Elisp with Scheme while also providing a translator to convert old Elisp files to Scheme .
One reason is that Elisp is an ad - hoc , non-standard Lisp variant not used anywhere else , and not consistent with modern programming - language ideas .
Another reason is that Guile , the primary GNU dialect of Scheme , is intended to be the standard extension language for GNU software , and so it makes sense for Emacs ( the main GNU application with extensive use of a scripting language ) to follow suit .
My opinion is that Guile is not the best Scheme implementation to use for Emacs .
I happen to be biased , as I am the author of Kawa , a Java - based Scheme implementation .
I also think that just replacing the extension language may not go far enough , and perhaps it is time to also replace the low - level code written in C .
Therefore , I have been working on a ‘ next - generation ’ Emacs , based on Java and Kawa .
The design includes : An implementation of the Scheme language .
An implementation of the Elisp ( core ) syntax and language , such as functions used for creating lists and strings , defining functions , and macros .
A set of abstract Java classes that implement the Emacs “ editing types ” , such as EBuffer , EWindow , EKeymap , and EMarker .
A set of Java concrete ( implementation ) classes that implement the above abstract classes using the Swing GUI api , such as SwingBuffer , and SwingWindow .
A set of Scheme bindings to the Java methods .
These are “ similar to ” and have the same names as standard Emacs Lisp functions , but are written in Scheme and intended to be called from Scheme .
The equivalent Elisp functions : Implementations of the high - level Emacs functions as Elisp functions , so existing Elisp applications can ( mostly ) run without change .
C-x C-f , which is bound to the function find - file .
When find - file is called interactively or with no arguments , the read - dialog is called , which pops up the simple dialog window we see .
The totality of these features is what I call ‘ JEmacs ’ .
Below is a screenshot showing some of what has been implemented .
It includes a frame with a menubar , split into multiple windows , each with a mode line .
The top window is a ‘ Scheme interaction window ’ , where Scheme expressions can be typed , and the result displayed .
( Notice the user input is automatically boldfaced . )
The user has just typed , which is bound to the function .
Whenis called interactively or with no arguments , theis called , which pops up the simple dialog window we see .
Motivation
This is a major , perhaps foolhardy , undertaking .
Here are some reasons why it might make sense ; I expand on these later .
Kawa is a modern object - oriented Scheme , while Emacs is based on rather old design ideas .
Building on a Java run-time means we benefit from the work being done to run Java bytecodes fast .
Java is multi-threaded .
Java is based on Unicode and has good internationalization support .
Java has lots of neat packages we can use .
Swing is a modern GUI toolkit with good support for major Emacs concepts .
It would be useful to have Scheme ( and Elisp ) scripting for Swing applications .
The Kawa framework
The most visible part of Kawa ( see [ Bothner98a ] , [ Bothner98 b ] ) is an implementation of the Scheme programming language written in Java .
I have been developing Kawa since 1996 .
Unlike other such implementations , Kawa compiles Scheme into Java bytecodes , with non-trivial optimizations .
It also provides almost all the other features you expect from a production Scheme system ( including eval and load ) and convenient interaction between Scheme and Java .
Kawa is also a framework used to implement Scheme , and which can be used for other languages .
The package gnu . bytecode provides classes to generate Java .class bytecode files , including methods to generate the Java virtual machine instructions .
It also lets you read , print , and otherwise manipulate the Java .class file format .
At a higher level , the gnu . expr package works on Expression objects .
This is basically an abstract syntax tree ( AST ) representation , and the package has classes to generate and optimize expressions and declarations .
It uses the gnu . bytecode package to generate bytecodes from the Expression representation .
The Kawa framework was originally used to compile Scheme .
However , I wrote the beginnings of an EcmaScript ( JavaScript ) implementation , and others are using Kawa to compile other languages , including BRL ( http://brl.sourceforge.net/) and Nice ( http://nice.sourceforge.net).
Currenty , I am using Kawa to implement XQuery ( http://www.qexo.org/), the new XML Query language from the World Wide Web Consortium .
For the JEmacs project , the framework is being used to compile Emacs Lisp to Java bytecodes , replacing the Emacs byte - compiler : Instead of .elc files loaded into the Emacs bytecode interpreter , we use Java bytecode ( .class ) files loaded into a Java Virtual Machine .
Kawa also includes the beginnings of a Common Lisp implementation , which shares some code with the Emacs Lisp implementation .
Performance A primary advantage of JEmacs is that Kawa is potentially much faster than either Elisp or Guile .
Using an optimizing compiler that compiles to bytecode is certainly going to be faster than Guile or Emacs 's simple interpreter .
The Emacs bytecode - compiler uses the same idea , and produces a bytecode format that is more suitable to Emacs than Java bytecodes .
However , there are many projects and companies working very hard on running Java bytecodes fast .
The common approach is to use a ‘ Just - in - Time compiler ’ ( JIT ) , which dynamically compiles a bytecode method into native code inside the runtime .
Another approach is to use a traditional ‘ ahead - of - time ’ compiler ( such as the Gcc - based Gcj [ Bothner97 ] ) .
It thus seems plausible ( though unproven ) that JEmacs can achieve better performance than Emacs .
Swing and Alternative Toolkits Sun introduced Swing [ SwingTutorial ] in 1998 as the ‘ next - generation ’ GUI toolkit for Java .
Swing has a lot of functionality and many useful features .
It builds on the earlier AWT ( Abstract Windowing Toolkit ) .
Of particular interest is that the text support in Swing is both very powerful , and also seems to be inspired by Emacs ideas .
Swing has new ‘ widgets ’ based on separating the ‘ model ’ ( data ) and ‘ view+control ’ ( look + feel ) .
For example , Swing distinguishes between a Document versus a JTextComponent that displays the Document , which is essentially the same as the Emacs buffer versus window distinction .
Swing also has a Keymap class similar to that of Emacs , and a Position that is like an Emacs marker .
Swing has some other nice features , such as ‘ pluggable - look - and - feel ’ ( themeability ) , a number of flexible ‘ widgets ’ , and support for ‘ structured ’ documents ( i.e. XML / HTML structure in a buffer ) .
The biggest problem with Swing is that while it is portable and freely redistributable , it does not have a free license .
This also makes debugging JEmacs difficult , since we cannot study the Swing source code to see what is going on .
There have been some recents starts at free re-implementations of Swing , but anything useful seems a long way off .
Another possible problem with Swing is performance .
Swing is huge , and has the reputation of being slow .
The first Emacs package ported to JEmacs ( Towers - of - Hanoi animation ) does run slower than under XEmacs .
The cause of this is not clear , but it is quite possible it is due to Swing overheads .
It may be possible to improve the situation with more low - level Swing coding .
Swing is very flexible in this respect , because the API uses mostly abstract interfaces , rather than specific implementation classes , and the latter can be replaced .
I have recently ( March 2002 ) started separating out the Swing - specific implementation classes from the Swing - independent logic .
The various Emacs types like EBuffer will become abstract classes or interfaces .
Most of JEmacs , including all the Elisp , references these abstract classes , without caring about the specific implementation classes .
The first set of implementation classes will be based on the old Swing implementation , but the goal is to add other implementations using other toolkits , perhaps even curses .
I would like to see a JEmacs implementation based on the Gnome 2 text widgets .
This supports the needed model - view separation , using a GtkTextView widget to implement an Emacs window , and a GtkTextBuffer to implement an Emacs buffer .
An Emacs marker can be implemented using a GtkTextMark .
GtkTextBuffer uses the Pango library and supports embedded images and widgets , multiple styles and fonts , and complex scripts , including bi-directional text , and complex character compositioning .
Another widget set worth examining is SWT , part of the Eclipse project .
Multi-threading
One problem with traditional Emacs is that it is single - threaded .
If you start some non-trivial operation ( such as getting new mail ) , your Emacs session will be frozen until the operation completes .
Java is designed to be multi- threaded , so it is in theory straightforward to create a multi- threaded Emacs .
One complication is that the Emacs Lisp execution model is inherently single threaded , since any Elisp function can change the current buffer or window to another buffer or window , while in the middle of the function .
This means we cannot associate a thread with each buffer or with each window .
A solution to this problem is to use ‘ buffer groups ’ , that is a group of related buffers and their windows which run in the same thread .
Typically , there would be one buffer group for each Elisp ‘ application ’ .
By default , when an Elisp function creates a new buffer , it is put in the same buffer group as the the current buffer .
However , an Elisp function such as find - file can create a new buffer group when it creates a new buffer .
Another problem is that Swing itself is single - threaded .
Only one thread ( the event thread ) can safely modify a buffer that is visible in a window .
In the current JEmacs implementation all interactive commands are run by the event thread .
Thus effectively , all of JEmacs is running inside the event thread .
A solution is for long - running commands to use a ‘ worker ’ thread .
When the worker thread is finished , it lets the event thread know it is done , which can then update the buffers and display .
Java classes for Emacs
The following Java classes in the gnu . jemacs .
buffer package implement what we might call the Emacs data ‘ model ’ .
EBuffer : An Emacs buffer .
Contains the actual text and styles of the buffer , though the actual data representation is handled by derived classes .
Also contains other buffer properties , such as the buffer 's keymap (s ) .
Inherits from gnu.lists .
AbstractSequence , which is part of the Kawa collections framework .
EMarker : A position in a buffer that gets adjusted as needed .
Similar to the Swing Position class , but also knows the EBuffer it points to .
The following Java classes implement what we might call the Emacs ‘ view+controller ’ .
EWindow : An Emacs Window .
Abstract class .
Contains a pointer to the buffer that is displayed in this window .
EFrame : A top - level window .
A Frame manages a nested hierarchy of EWindow objects .
EKeymap : A data structure used to map into events to commands .
The input events are represented as 32 - bit integers encoding the character or the keycode typed and the modifier bits ( shift , control etc ) .
These are the main Swing - specific implementation classes , and are in the gnu .
jemacs.swing package .
SwingBuffer : Extends the EBuffer class .
Uses an instance of Swing 's DefaultStyledDocument to contain the actual text and styles .
SwingContent : A Swing Document uses a separate Content object to store the actual character data ( but not the styles ) .
This class is needed because standard Swing Content implementation does not support the Marker semantics we need .
SwingWindow : Extends the EWindow class .
Uses a Swing JtextPane instance .
Implements the java.awt.event .KeyListener interface ; this is used to handle keyboard input and mouse clicks .
The actual action to perform is found by searching EKeymap objects belonging to the associated Buffer .
Includes an assocated Modeline , and a scrollbar .
SwingFrame : Extends the EFrame class .
Uses Swing 's JSplitPane class to sub-divide a top - level JFrame .
Editing procedures JEmacs includes a number of Scheme procedures for operating on the Java classes just mentioned .
The Scheme API is designed to be similar to the traditional Elisp functions , but in Scheme form .
Here is the JEmacs definition of the standard Emacs function beginning - of - line , written in Scheme .
( define ( beginning - of - line #!optional ( n :: < int > 1 ) ( buffer :: < buffer > ( current - buffer ) ) ) ( invoke buffer ' setPoint ( point - at - bol n buffer ) ) ) ( define - key global - map " \C - a " beginning - of - line )
Note the optional type declarations for the two parameters .
Also note the invoke ‘ function ’ .
This calls the specified method ( in this case setPoint ) on the specified object ( in this case the buffer ) .
In a case like this where the receiver class is known , the Kawa compiler can directly generate a invokevirtual bytecode instruction .
Once we have defined beginning - of - line , it can be used from either Elisp or Scheme code .
This makes it easier to mix Scheme and Elisp , convert ( if desired ) Elisp to Scheme , and lets us re-use Elisp documentation .
Our goal is to be able to run most Elisp package unmodified .
Some packages may require minor changes , but no more than say porting to XEmacs .
The first Emacs package that runs under JEmacs without requiring a single modification to the Elisp source is hanoi.el , an animation of the Towers - of - Hanoi puzzle .
However , it may be desirable to rewrite some packages , possibly in Scheme or Java .
For example , dired needs a more modern interface .
The Scheme and Elisp APIs implemented in JEmacs are based on those of both GNU Emacs and XEmacs .
JEmacs will not implement either API exactly , but will try to implement the features that make most sense .
For example , GNU Emacs and XEmacs have very different APIs for manipulating the menubar .
In this case , JEmacs implemented a menubar API based on the XEmacs API , partly because it was closer to the Swing menubar model .
Some issues in implementing Elisp
There are some tricky issues if you want to implement Elisp , especially if you want nice interoperability with Scheme .
( The plan for GNU Emacs is to translate Elisp into Scheme , which raises similar issues . )
Syntax
While both Scheme and Elisp share the fully parenthesized prefix notation common to the Lisp family , there are some differences in the syntax of literals and identifiers .
For example , the character ' a ' is written #\a in Scheme , and ? a in Elisp .
The part of a Lisp system that converts a stream of characters to a value ( usually a linked list ) is traditionally called the “ reader ” .
I had to write an Elisp reader to go along with the Scheme reader , and make sure the right one is invoked .
Once the reader has converted an input line or file to a list , the list needs to be converted into Kawa 's internal Expression ( abstract syntax tree ) representation .
This is handled similar for Elisp and Scheme .
However , Elisp has some new syntax forms ( such as defun , save - excursion ) and and some forms that are different than in Scheme ( such as lambda ) .
For that we need to write new syntax transformers .
This is almost done .
Symbols
The symbol data type in Scheme is very simple :
It is an immutable atomic string ; you can create a symbol from a ( mutable ) string , and you can convert the symbol back to a string ( for example for printing ) .
Whenever you convert a string to a symbol , you will always get the same identical symbol , as long as the strings have the same characters .
This process is called interning and is implemented using a global hash - table .
Symbols are used for multiple purposes , but the most important one is that identifiers in a Scheme program are represented using symbols .
Java has a similar datatype , the class String , which is used all over the place in Java .
Java has a method , called intern , which returns an interned version of the String .
This functionality is exactly what is needed for Scheme , so Kawa uses String for Scheme symbols .
This has the side benefit of increasing interoperabilty between Scheme and Java .
On the other hand , an Elisp symbol has extra properties : value and function bindings , and a property list .
The traditional implementation is that a symbol value is a pointer to a structure containing the necessary fields .
JEmacs uses this approach , which makes extracting the value and function bindings cheap , though it requires extra space in all symbols , and it complicates the Scheme / Elisp interface .
The Binding class implements symbols .
the Environment is basically a hashtable used to map a string to a Binding ; it corresponds to the CommonLisp package concept .
Nil - the empty list In Elisp , the empty list and the symbol ' nil are the same object , but in Scheme they are different .
There are various ways to deal with the problem , none particularly elegant .
In Kawa , lists inherit from the abstract Sequence class .
I feel it is important that the empty list also be a Sequence , even for Elisp , and it is important to be able to pass lists between Scheme and Elisp code .
I decided that 'nil would have to be a special case :
While the Elisp symbol t is represented using a Binding , the symbol nil is represented by the special LList value LList .
Empty that Kawa uses for empty lists .
Thus the predicate ( symbolp x ) is implemented as ( x == List . Empty || x instanceof Binding ) .
Standard Elisp Functions Elisp has many builtin functions and macros which are different from Scheme .
There is no fundamental difficulty with this ; just a lot of porting / conversion work .
Many of the basic editing functions are already implemented , but many ( such as those involving searching ) are not .
Variables Variable lookup is different in Scheme and Elisp in two main ways : Elisp has different namespaces for function names and variable names , while Scheme has a single namespace for both .
This is handled by using the appropriate field of the Binding .
More troublesome is Elisp 's use of dynamic scoping , while Scheme uses lexical scoping .
Also , Emacs has buffer - local variables .
Kawa supports dynamic scoping using the fluid - name extension to Scheme .
It is straight - forward for the Elisp compiler to translate Emacs local variable declarations ( such as let and parameter specifications ) as if they were fluid - name , and this works pretty well .
However , there is some performance loss when using dynamic scoping compared to lexical scoping , and it turns out that the vast majority of local variables in Elisp code are really local , and would work the same if lexical scoping is used .
The paper [ DynamicScope ] describes how one might do such an optimization .
Kawa actually has a very flexible name - binding mechanism based on storing a Constraint in each Binding .
The constraint contains the actual methods that get / set the value of the Binding .
For example , setting b to x does b.constraint. set ( b , x ) .
A Binding also has a property list ( including the name ) and a value field .
The default action for get retrieves the Binding value field .
Different sub-classes of Constraint have different implementations of get and set .
This framework can handle thread - local dynamic bindings , buffer - local variables , indirection , unbound variables ( get throws an exception ) , and constraint propagation .
Changing a value can trigger arbitrary checks or notification messages .
Modes
In Emacs , a mode is a set of keybindings , functions , and variables local to a buffer .
There is no object corresponding to a ‘ mode ’ , but there is a set of conventions to follow .
In an object - oriented environment it seems better to define a separate mode class for each mode .
Each buffer that has a mode enabled should have a corresponding mode instance .
Each buffer has a linked list of mode instances , one for each major / minor mode that is active for the buffer .
Mode functions are compiled to virtual methods of the mode object .
Instead of a buffer - local variable , use a field of the mode object .
This provides fast access to variables in compiled code , without run-time symbol lookup .
A derived mode can use mode class inheritance .
As an example , the abstract class ProcessMode inherits from the generic Mode class .
A ProcessMode represents some kind of process which ( usually ) generates output that gets inserted into the buffer .
Partial implementations exist of the sub-classes InfProcessMode , which displays the output of an external ( possibly - interactive ) program , and TelnetMode .
Both of these provide minimal terminal emulation .
The Mode framework has been used for modes written directly in Java .
It is now possible to write Java classes in Kawa Scheme , using the define - class special form .
It seems reasonable to add a define - mode syntax form based on define - class .
Of course existing ( legacy ) Elisp code does not use define - mode , but it should be possible for Kawa to recognize a ( defun XXX - mode ( ) BODY ) that follows the standard Emacs conventions , and generate a Mode in that case .
Alternatively , we can just support legacy code using more ad hoc mechanisms .
Unicode and Internationalization The Java char is a 16 - bit Unicode character .
Internal strings and JEmacs buffers use these Unicode char s .
On the other hand , external files consist of 8 - bit bytes .
So Java provides named encodings that map byte streams and character streams .
Java with Swing handles much of the work needed for complex text processing .
For example , bi-directional text ( as needed for Hebrew and Arabic ) is taken care of .
In the screenshot below , we have a file encoded in UTF - 8 .
It contains a string of four Hebrew characters , stored in the buffer in logical ( reading ) order .
When they displayed , they are shown right - to - left .
Notice that if you make a text selection that includes both English and Hebrew text , the selected characters form a contiguous region in the memory , but because different segments are displayed in different order , in the window we see the selection as two non-contiguous pieces .
Also note that characters not present in the font are displayed as hollow rectangles .
I.e. I need to install a more complete font !
The Gnome2 text framework mentioned earlier also has excellent internationalization support .
Current releases of Emacs and XEmacs support some internationalization , using the Mule framework which supports text in many character sets .
However , current releases of Mule do not yet support Unicode , which is where most of the world is heading .
Mule is based on some rather dated design decisions .
JEmacs will not support Mule ; it wo n't need to .
Word Processing and XML Documents will be increasingly represented using XML externally and DOM ( Document Object Model ) internally .
Most of the programs and libraries for manipulating and formatting XML are written in Java .
For example , the Apache group has some major Java - based XML projects .
If Emacs is to support word processing features , it should build on XML standards .
It is easier to use third - party Java libraries if the Emacs core is Java - based .
Kawa already has extensive built - in XML support , partly to implement XQuery , the XML Query language .
Kawa has an integrated framework that combines support for sequences , iterators , and abstract nested trees ( like XML ) .
JEmacs is partly integrated with this framework , but not to the extent it could be .
For example , if Buffer was made abstract then one could have editable documents which are defined using transformations from other documents ( rather like a database view ) .
Status and Conclusion A ‘ proof - of - concept ’ prototype is working , including partial Elisp implementation .
There is still a lot of work before you want to use JEmacs for day - to - day general editing .
Using the libraries of Java and Swing takes care of many problems .
JEmacs has a mailing list and a home page .
JEmacs is currently distributed together with Kawa .
I did most of JEmacs development between Match 1999 and June 2000 .
Since then it has been been a matter of small updates to make JEmacs consistent with the rest of Kawa , with almost no real development , except for the recent effort the split out Swing dependencies .
Mnay people have expressed interested in JEmacs , and like the concept .
Unfortunately no one has volunteered to help with development , and I have had to concentrate on other projects .
Perhaps this article has inspired you to volunteer ?
Right after the Internet became abuzz with news that ATI is going to finally launch the long - awaited R600 VPU on May 14th , we expected NVIDIA to launch a preemptive strike .
And sure enough , they did that today by launching a new flagship GPU - the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra !
NVIDIA 's plan is obvious .
By launching a new flagship card less than two weeks before the R600 launch , they are going to steal some thunder from ATI 's launch .
If the new ATI Radeon HD 2900 flagship card cannot come close to the performance of the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra , then ATI is not only going to lose face but also a lot of business , as the perception will be that , ATI can no longer deliver a competitive graphics solution to challenge NVIDIA 's dominance .
While ATI 's ( and AMD's ) future will be revealed when the new ATI Radeon HD X2000 - series of graphics cards are launched on May 14th , NVIDIA 's new GPU seems designed specifically to tweak ATI 's nose and spoil the launch of the R600 , rather than a serious attempt to improve the GeForce line - up .
Now , we have all been waiting for a silicon refresh ever since NVIDIA released the G80 GPU .
While the G80 was ground - breaking , it was an enormous chip and a really hot one too .
Needless to say , we were eager to see a slimmer , more efficient and more powerful version of the G80 GPU , kind of like what the GeForce 79xx series was to the GeForce 78 xx series .
Unfortunately , the GeForce 8800 Ultra is not that .
The silicon and manufacturing process was merely tweaked to improve timings and clock speeds .
The number of transistors remained the same , and so did the size of the chip .
Even power reduction was minimal at 2W for the entire board , albeit this was achieved at high clock speeds .
In other words , the GeForce 8800 Ultra is nothing more than a faster version of the GeForce 8800 GTX .
But that 's still alright .
It 's always great to see faster cards coming into play , especially if they retain the same level of power consumption and cost .
Unfortunately , this is the GeForce 8800 Ultra 's greatest flaw .
Instead of pricing it to replace the GeForce 8800 GTX , NVIDIA created a new price point at the nose - bleeding altitude of US $ 829 + .
If that does n't kill your appetite for this card , nothing will .
It has been our policy recently to test all graphics cards in Windows Vista .
Needless to say , the NVIDIA driver we used was basic and not as optimized as the Windows XP drivers we are used to .
Still , we saw pretty impressive benchmark results from the GeForce 8800 Ultra .
It beat the GeForce 8800 GTX by 7 % to 12 % in our test results .
While that is impressive due to the fact that it can beat the GeForce 8800 GTX by a noticeable margin , it is still not enough of a performance lead to justify the incredible new price point .
Buying two GeForce 8800 GTS or GTX cards and running them in SLI would give you far better performance ( and price - performance ratio ) than buying a single GeForce 8800 Ultra .
With that said , we are still impressed with the performance of the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra .
Not only is it the fastest graphics card in the market , bar none ; it does so with slightly less power consumption than the GeForce 8800 GTX at much higher clock speeds .
We wish ATI the best of luck in the upcoming duel .

In recent news from the Seattle Times :
Thanks to the work of the Goat Justice League , ruminants now have the right to life and limited liberty in Seattle .
On Monday , the City Council acknowledged the miniature goat ’s attributes as human companion , weed whacker and milk maker , and unanimously voted that the goats could be kept as pets .
“ One small step for man , one giant step for goatkind , ” said Councilmember Richard Conlin , who sponsored the legislation .
As of late , goats have gained the environmental status of hybrid cars and bovine - growth - hormone - free milk , prized for their ability to mow lawns without using fossil fuels .
University of Washington and Seattle City Light recently hired herds to clear slopes of blackberry brambles .
Monday ’s vote marked yet another gain for miniature goats , which are about the size of a large dog .
Also known as pygmy or dwarf goats , the animals weigh between 50 and 100 pounds and grow to about 2 feet tall .
Owners keep them as pets and sources of milk .
The B & H photo and electronics equipment store has agreed to pay $ 4.3 million to settle a discrimination case , the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said yesterday .
The commission , which enforces laws prohibiting discrimination , alleged that the company paid Hispanic employees in its warehouses less than other workers and failed to promote them or provide health benefits .
In its complaint , filed in Federal District Court , the commission said the discrimination was based on the employees ’ nationalities .
Under the agreement , B & H agreed to equalize the wages of its Hispanic employees to those of non-Hispanic workers and to distribute $ 4.3 million to workers who were paid less , not promoted , or denied benefits because they are Hispanic .
The United States ' second - richest man has delivered a blunt message to the Bush administration : he wants to pay more tax .
Warren Buffett , the famous investor known as the " Sage of Omaha " , has complained that he pays a lower rate of tax than any of his staff - including his receptionist .
Mr Buffett , who is worth an estimated $ 52bn ( £ 25 bn ) , said : " The taxation system has tilted towards the rich and away from the middle class in the last 10 years .
It 's dramatic ; I do n't think it 's appreciated and I think it should be addressed . "
During an interview with NBC television , Mr Buffett brandished an informal survey of 15 of his 18 office staff at his Berkshire Hathaway empire .
The billionaire said he was paying 17.7 % payroll and income tax , compared with an average in the office of 32.9 % .
" There was n't anyone in the office , from the receptionist up , who paid as low a tax rate and I have no tax planning ; I do n't have an accountant or use tax shelters .
I just follow what the US Congress tells me to do , " he said .
Mr Buffett also took a pot shot at hedge fund managers .
He said : " Hedge fund operators have spent a record amount lobbying in the last few months - they give money to the political campaigns .
Who represents the cleaning lady ? "
His intervention comes amid an increasingly rancorous debate on Capitol Hill about tax .
Shortly after taking office , President Bush pushed through $ 2 trillion in temporary tax cuts , including sharp reductions for high - earners .
These expire at the end of 2010 and the White House wants to renew them .
A leading Democrat , the Harlem congressman Charlie Rangel , published alternative plans this week that would impose a 4 % surcharge on people earning more than $ 200,000 a year , while delivering tax relief to 90 million working families .
Republicans say the net effect would be a $ 2 trillion tax increase that would hurt small businesses and farmers .
Meanwhile , Mr Buffett 's remarks drew a robust response from the US Chamber of Commerce , which said the top 1 % of US earners accounted for 39 % of tax revenue - and the highest earning 25 % of the population delivered 86 % of the tax - take .
The chamber 's chief economist , Martin Regalia , said : " Mr Buffett has made an awful lot of money and if he wants to pay more taxes , I think that 's fine .
But I think he should get his facts straight . "
He added : " There 's no question in my mind : if you were to impose [ the Democrats ' ] tax increases , you would see the US go into a recession . "
Six years ago , on October 7 , 2001 , the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom .
Over the next 78 days , the U.S. , working with Afghan allies and bolstered by a coalition of support from around the world , drove the Taliban from power and destroyed al Qaeda ’s infrastructure in that country .
But even as a new Afghan interim government was being inaugurated in Kabul that December , Osama bin Laden and several of his key lieutenants were completing their escape from Tora Bora to safe refuge across the border in Pakistan .
Since that point , the United States , despite some sporadic successes , has been gradually losing ground in the “ war on terror . ”
Measured by the number of terrorist incidents , the threat posed by violent jihadism is more significant now than it was prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
It is , most notably , significantly worse than in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 when the American response focused on al Qaeda ’s infrastructure in Afghanistan .
Even when excluding attacks in Afghanistan , Iraq , and those related to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , there are more attacks by jihadist groups on an annual basis than at the beginning of the Iraq war .
This is a stunning finding given the tremendous activity of jihadist groups in those theaters .
The jihadist movement remains vibrant and dynamic .
Early claims about disruption of the al Qaeda network were dramatically overstated .
Only five of the twenty - two most wanted terrorists in 2001 have been captured or killed .
Though some high ranking al Qaeda members have been eliminated , the organization has been able to promote or recruit members to replace losses .
Furthermore , al Qaeda has expanded its reach globally by forging closer relationships with previously autonomous groups .
The United States is losing the battle for hearts and minds in the Muslim world .
According to a Pew Global Poll , the United States is perceived as the biggest threat in important Muslim countries including Morocco , Turkey , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Malaysia and Indonesia .
According to the same poll , only 21 percent of Egyptians have a favorable view of the United States as do 15 percent of Pakistanis , 9 percent of Turks , and 29 percent of Indonesians .
And while it is true that Muslim populations are increasingly denouncing terrorism in the abstract , Osama bin Laden remains more popular in Pakistan and Indonesia than is President Bush in the United States .
U.S. foreign policy has done virtually nothing to reduce ungoverned spaces around the world where terrorists can find safe harbor .
Indeed , there has been a net increase in areas that lack effective governance given the weakness of the current Afghan government and the insurgency in Iraq .
There has been minor progress on disrupting terrorist financing , including better financial controls and more supervision of charities , but all this seems to have accomplished is to push jihadist financing deeper underground and prompt greater involvement of terrorist groups with the growing drug trade in Afghanistan .
It is true that state sponsorship of terrorism is down since 9/11 and nominal international cooperation in the fight against terrorism is up .
Yet , even in this case , the silver lining is pewter .
Many of the successes in reversing state sponsorship of terrorism pre-date the “ war on terror . ”
Libya abandoned its sponsorship of terrorism in the 1990s , and Sudan has similarly backed away from this course despite its atrocities in Darfur .
In terms of broader international cooperation against terror , while the number of countries that have publicly pledged support is high , actual cooperation lags .
U.S. counter - terrorism strategy after the initial success in Afghanistan has been largely unsuccessful and counterproductive , resulting in a loss of focus and momentum and the deterioration of American standing in much of the world .
The jihadist movement relies on a very specific narrative – that Islam is under attack by the West .
Though the removal of the Taliban was both necessary and defensible , our actions since have produced unintended consequences that have made winning the “ war on terror ” a much more distant goal .
Worse , the war in Iraq has so distracted from and distorted appreciation of the jihadist threat that our leaders no longer seem to remember what they were so close to achieving when they had bin Laden and his murderous cronies on the run .

Summary : Active voice is best for most Web content , but using passive voice can let you front - load important keywords in headings , blurbs , and lead sentences .
This enhances scannability and thus SEO effectiveness .
Traditional writing guidelines are clear on the use of passive voice :
Worst :
The passive voice should be avoided .
Bad :
The passive voice should be avoided by writers .
Better : Writers should avoid using passive voice .
Best : Writers should use active voice .
When structuring a sentence , active voice ( " Actor does X to Object " ) is usually better than passive voice ( " Object has X done to it by Actor " ) because it more directly represents the action .
As a result , readers do n't have to jump through as many cognitive hoops when trying to understand what 's going on .
For the same reason , it 's usually better to write a positive statement ( " do X " ) than a negative statement ( " avoid Y " ) , and it 's almost always horrible to use double negatives ( " avoid not doing X " ) .
Again , the simpler the translation between the text and the user 's mental model , the easier the writing is to understand .
Typically , it 's even harder for readers to understand passive sentences that do n't explicitly state the actor .
This style can also lead to additional usability problems if users misinterpret who 's doing the action .
For example , if you write " Social security taxes must be paid monthly " readers might think that employees have to pay the tax .
In contrast , " Employers must pay social security taxes monthly " is clear and easy to read .
Usability increases when users need fewer mental transformations to convert a sentence into actionable understanding .
Writing style impacts website profitability : the easier the writing is to understand , the more likely customers are to plow through your words .
Users do n't like doing hard work .
That is , users prefer effortless reading ( to state it positively , and thus improve readability ) .
When Passive Voice = $ $ $
Here 's the first draft of my summary for a recent Alertbox column , entitled " Tabs , Used Right " :
Yahoo Finance follows all 13 design guidelines for tab controls , but usability suffers due to AJAX overkill and difficult customization .
Active voice , yes sir .
Fairly well written , check .
Complete sentence , not a fragment ; no disapproving squiggles in Word .
All systems go , except for one nagging question :
Does this blurb perform its main job — to attract users who scan SERP listings ( search engine results pages ) or other lists of possible destinations ?
No .
It fails this mission horribly .
Do n't pass
Go , do n't collect $ 200 .
Users scan
Web content in an F - pattern , and often read only the first 2 words of a paragraph .
What are the first two words of my draft deck ?
" Yahoo Finance " — which has zero information scent for article 's target audience .
The column in question is about application design , so it needs to attract readers who care about GUI widgets .
People who are interested in Yahoo or investments are not the targets .
( I used Yahoo Finance purely as an example in the column ; I do n't actually discuss the site .
I have written about Yahoo as a portal and about investor relations .
However , those articles are at other URLs ; users attracted by the misleading information scent created by leading with " Yahoo Finance " would n't find them . )
Here 's the rewritten summary , using passive voice to pull the payoff keywords to the front :
13 design guidelines for tab controls are all followed by Yahoo Finance , but usability suffers due to AJAX overkill and difficult customization .
Because " 13 " is sufficiently short , users will likely fixate on the first 3 words , not just the first 2 , when they initially scan the blurb .
Also , numerals beat words when referring to specifics , so starting with " 13 " is even better at attracting the scanning eye .
So , why not start with " tab controls " ?
After all , these two words carry the most information for the article and the target audience .
The reason is simple :
The blurb will always display below the article 's headline , which starts with the word " tabs . "
Given that users often read only a couple of words from each text element , you should reduce duplication of salient keywords .
Do n't use the same initial keywords in your headline and summary .
You have 4 words to make your point , so use 4 different words .
( Okay , I do bend this guideline a bit for this very article : it leads with " passive voice " in the headline and " active voice " in the summary .
But in this case , " voice " is not a keyword on its own — it 's not an article about vocalization — and I need to grab people scanning for either active voice or passive voice , and both are 2 - word concepts . )
Avoid repeating any headline words in the summary , except for the most important one or two keywords .
You can repeat these halfway through the summary to reinforce them for people who scanned past them in the headline .
ROI from Passive vs. Active Voice
Simple sentence structure , active voice , and positive statements have been key Web - writing guidelines for more than a decade .
I do n't want you to abandon these good ideas .
They do improve content usability in most cases , particularly for body text .
However , recent findings from our eyetracking research emphasized the overwhelming importance of getting the first 2 words right , since that 's often all users see when they scan Web pages .
Given this , we have to bend the writing guidelines a bit , especially for elements that users fixate on when they scan — that is , headlines , subheads , summaries , captions , hypertext links , and bulleted lists .
Words are usually the main moneymakers on a website .
Selecting the first 2 words for your page titles is probably the highest - impact ROI - boosting design decision you make in a Web project .
Front - loading important keywords trumps most other design considerations .
Writing the first 2 words of summaries runs a close second .
Here , too , you might want to succumb to passive voice if it lets you pull key terms into the lead .
The importance of good page titles and summaries goes far beyond traditional search engine optimization ( SEO ) and its narrow focus on getting a high GYM rating ( that is , a high ranking on Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft search listings ) .
Usable and scannable results in your site 's own search engine greatly impacts your website 's conversion rate .
And search usability is key for intranet productivity .
Most text should use simple sentence structure .
But sometimes , passive voice can increase ROI .
Use it .
Carefully .

Meet the Elders ' : Nelson Mandela , Desmond Tutu , Jimmy Carter , Muhammad Yunus and Many More A gathering of elders takes on AIDS , TB , climate change and more .
JOHANNESBURG , July 18 , 2007  --
The Elders , a new alliance made up of an elite group of senior statesmen dedicated to solving thorny global problems , unveiled itself today in Johannesburg .
The rollout coincided with founding member Nelson Mandela 's 89th birthday .
After a grand entrance , Mandela , the former South African president , announced the rest of the Elders .
The members include Desmond Tutu , South African archbishop emeritus of Capetown ; former U.S. President Jimmy Carter ; former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan ; Mary Robinson , former president of Ireland and Mohammed Yunus , the Nobel laureate and founder of the Green Bank in Bangladesh .
The group plans to get involved in some of the world 's most pressing problems -- climate change , pandemics like AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis , violent conflicts .
It was an extraordinary gathering ; a who 's who of famous international leaders , with enough emotion to move some of them to tears .
Under a large white futuristic dome , British billionaire Richard Branson and rock star Peter Gabriel , who conceived the idea for the Elders , gathered enough star power to change the world , or at least that 's the hope .
" The structures we have to deal with these problems are often tied down by political , economic and geographic constraints , " Mandela said .
The Elders , he argued , will face no such constraints .
Seven years ago , Branson and Gabriel approached Mandela about the Elders idea , and he agreed to help them recruit others .
" This group of elders will bring hope and wisdom back into the world , " Branson said .
" They 'll play a role in bringing us together .
" Using their collective experience , their moral courage and their ability to rise above the parochial concerns of nations ?
they can help make our planet a more peaceful , healthy and equitable place to live , " Branson said . "
Let us call them ' global elders , ' not because of their age but because of individual and collective wisdom . "
Calling it " the most extraordinary day " of his life , Gabriel said , " The dream was there might still be a body of people in whom the world could place their trust . "
Archbishop Desmond Tutu , who moderated the event and will serve as its leader , was moved to tears after Gabriel sang an impromptu accapella version of his hit song " Biko , " written about a famous South African political prisoner .
Branson and Gabriel have raised enough money -- some $ 18 million -- to fund this group for three years .
Also onboard are names less well known in the United States , including Indian microfinance leader Ela Bhatt ; former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland ; former Chinese ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing .
The group left an empty seat onstage -- symbolically -- for an elder who was invited , but could not attend because she is under house arrest in Burma , Nobel laureate and human rights advocate Aung San Suu Kyi .
Mandela and Carter emphasized the group 's ability to talk to anyone without risk .
" We will be able to risk failure in worthy causes , and we will not need to claim credit for any successes that might be achieved , " said Carter .
Carter said the group does not want to step on or interfere with other positive work that nations or organizations are doing but wants to supplement that work .
Several members acknowledged that the actual activities and actions of the group remain to be determined .
There are no titles , no ranking of the members .
And it is not clear if they will travel as a group , deploy individual members to global hot spots , or simply sit in a room together to develop strategies or assist those who are suffering find help .
But they certainly have high hopes .
" I did n't like the title " elders , " because I did n't feel like an elder , " said Yunus to laughter , " but I like the idea . "
Yunus said the world is without direction and he hopes the Elders can provide some direction .
Speaking of the Elders , almost in the way one would describe a cartoon about superheroes , Mandela said , " The Elders can become a fiercely independent and positive force for good . "
Annan added that the group does not " intend to go and take on Darfur or Somalia and resolve it singlehandedly .
We do n't have a magic wand , " he said .
But he argued that the group could intervene and perhaps force parties to honor agreements .
" There are certain crimes that shame us all , " said Annan .
" We all have a responsibility , and I hope the Elders will take the lead in asking the question :
What can we do to move the situation forward ?
" Sometimes by saying ' this is enough we can't take this anymore it must stop , ' we are making a difference , " Annan continued
Mandela and Branson both celebrated birthdays today .
At 89 , Mandela looked frail .
He walked with a cane and Carter helped him to the podium .
But once Mandela got there , he stood tall and easily delivered some 10 minutes of remarks .
" He , as you know , walks sedately , " Tutu joked .
BAGHDAD , Jan. 16 — The United Nations reported Tuesday that more than 34,000 Iraqis were killed in violence last year , a figure that represents the first comprehensive annual count of civilian deaths and a vivid measure of the failure the Iraqi government and American military to provide security .
Numbers of civilian deaths have become the central indicator for the trajectory of the war and are extremely sensitive for both Iraqi and American officials .
Both track the tallies but neither will release them .
This latest figure was the first attempt at hand - counting individual deaths for an entire year .
It was compiled using statistics from local morgues , hospitals and municipal authorities across Iraq and was nearly three times higher than an estimate for 2006 compiled from Iraqi ministry tallies by The Associated Press earlier this month .
An Iraqi government spokesman called the count exaggerated and said it had been obtained using “ incorrect sources . ”
Though the Iraqi government closely tracks deaths through the Interior and Health Ministries , he said it did not have a system in place for compiling a comprehensive figure .
First Responders
I live in Minneapolis , so the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River earlier this month hit close to home , and was covered in both my local and national news .
Much of the initial coverage consisted of human interest stories , centered on the victims of the disaster and the incredible bravery shown by first responders : the policemen , firefighters , EMTs , divers , National Guard soldiers and even ordinary people , who all risked their lives to save others .
( Just two weeks later , three rescue workers died in their almost - certainly futile attempt to save six miners in Utah . )
Perhaps the most amazing aspect of these stories is that there ’s nothing particularly amazing about it .
No matter what the disaster — hurricane , earthquake , terrorist attack — the nation ’s first responders get to the scene soon after .
Which is why it ’s such a crime when these people can’t communicate with each other .
Historically , police departments , fire departments and ambulance drivers have all had their own independent communications equipment , so when there ’s a disaster that involves them all , they ca n’t communicate with each other .
A 1996 government report said this about the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 : “ Rescuing victims of the World Trade Center bombing , who were caught between floors , was hindered when police officers could not communicate with firefighters on the very next floor . ”
And we all know that police and firefighters had the same problem on 9/11 .
You can read details in firefighter Dennis Smith ’s book and 9/11 Commission testimony .
The 9/11 Commission Report discusses this as well : Chapter 9 talks about the first responders ’ communications problems , and commission recommendations for improving emergency - response communications are included in Chapter 12 ( pp. 396-397 ) .
In some cities , this communication gap is beginning to close .
Homeland Security money has flowed into communities around the country .
And while some wasted it on measures like cameras , armed robots and things having nothing to do with terrorism , others spent it on interoperable communications capabilities .
Minnesota did that in 2004 .
It worked .
Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek told the St. Paul Pioneer - Press that lives were saved by disaster planning that had been fine - tuned and improved with lessons learned from 9/11 :
“ We have a unified command system now where everyone — police , fire , the sheriff ’s office , doctors , coroners , local and state and federal officials — operate under one voice , ” said Stanek , who is in charge of water recovery efforts at the collapse site .
“ We all operate now under the 800 ( megahertz radio frequency system ) , which was the biggest criticism after 9/11 , ” Stanek said , “ and to have 50 to 60 different agencies able to speak to each other was just fantastic . ”
Others were n’t so lucky .
Louisiana ’s first responders had catastrophic communications problems in 2005 , after Hurricane Katrina .
According to National Defense Magazine :
Police could not talk to firefighters and emergency medical teams .
Helicopter and boat rescuers had to wave signs and follow one another to survivors .
Sometimes , police and other first responders were out of touch with comrades a few blocks away .
National Guard relay runners scurried about with scribbled messages as they did during the Civil War .
A congressional report on preparedness and response to Katrina said much the same thing .
In 2004 , the U.S. Conference of Mayors issued a report on communications interoperability .
In 25 percent of the 192 cities surveyed , the police could n’t communicate with the fire department .
In 80 percent of cities , municipal authorities could n’t communicate with the FBI , FEMA and other federal agencies .
The source of the problem is a basic economic one , called the collective action problem .
A collective action is one that needs the coordinated effort of several entities in order to succeed .
The problem arises when each individual entity ’s needs diverge from the collective needs , and there is no mechanism to ensure that those individual needs are sacrificed in favor of the collective need .
Jerry Brito of George Mason University shows how this applies to first - responder communications .
Each of the nation ’s 50,000 or so emergency - response organizations — local police department , local fire department , etc. — buys its own communications equipment .
As you ’d expect , they buy equipment as closely suited to their needs as they can .
Ensuring interoperability with other organizations ’ equipment benefits the common good , but sacrificing their unique needs for that compatibility may not be in the best immediate interest of any of those organizations .
There ’s no central directive to ensure interoperability , so there ends up being none .
This is an area where the federal government can step in and do good .
Too much of the money spent on terrorism defense has been overly specific : effective only if the terrorists attack a particular target or use a particular tactic .
Money spent on emergency response is different :
It ’s effective regardless of what the terrorists plan , and it ’s also effective in the wake of natural or infrastructure disasters .
No particular disaster , whether intentional or accidental , is common enough to justify spending a lot of money on preparedness for a specific emergency .
But spending money on preparedness in general will pay off again and again .

Here 's an new open thread and a poll for you to discuss the fact that oil went through $ 93 / bbl today .
( and if you have n't seen Drudge this evening , he has the now ubiquitous grasshopper in the sunset picture up ... )
( By the way , the 45ish % of you in the old poll who said 93 before 79 , you were correct . )
The five options in the new poll are , " in the next month , CLZ07 / CLF08 will ... "
1. hit 100 before it hits 86
2. hit 86 before it hits 100
3. stay in a trading range between 86 and 100
4. it 's still all geopolitics , what does a price signal mean anyway ?
5. have n't you heard ?
it 's all about the declining dollar .
it has nothing to do with growing demand and a current lack of supply .
Enjoy . :)

Physicists at the University of Michigan have coaxed two separate atoms to communicate with a sort of quantum intuition that Albert Einstein called " spooky . "
In doing so , the researchers have made an advance toward super - fast quantum computing .
The research could also be a building block for a quantum internet .
Scientists used light to establish what 's called " entanglement " between two atoms , which were trapped a meter apart in separate enclosures ( think of entangling like controlling the outcome of one coin flip with the outcome of a separate coin flip ) .
A paper on the findings appears in the Sept. 6 edition of the journal Nature .
" This linkage between remote atoms could be the fundamental piece of a radically new quantum computer architecture , " said Professor Christopher Monroe , the principal investigator who did this research while at U - M , but is now at the University of Maryland .
" Now that the technique has been demonstrated , it should be possible to scale it up to networks of many interconnected components that will eventually be necessary for quantum information processing . "
David Moehring , the lead author of the paper who did this research as a U - M graduate student , says the most important feature of this experiment is the distance between the two atoms .
Moehring graduated and now has a position at the Max - Planck - Institute for Quantum Optics in Germany .
" The separation of the qubits in our entangled state is the most important feature , " Moehring said .
" Localized entanglement has been performed in ion trap qubits in the past , but if one desires to build a scalable quantum computer network ( or a quantum internet ) , the creation of entanglement schemes between remotely entangled qubit memories is necessary . "
In this experiment , the researchers used two atoms to function as qubits , or quantum bits , storing a piece of information in their electron configuration .
They then excited each atom , inducing electrons to fall into a lower energy state and emit one photon , or one particle of light , in the process .
The atoms , which were actually ions of the rare - earth element ytterbium , are capable of emitting two different types of photon of different wavelengths .
The type of photon released by each atom indicates the particular state of the atom .
Because of this , each photon was entangled with its atom .
By manipulating the photons emitted from each of the two atoms and guiding them to interact along a fiber optic thread , the researchers were able to detect the resulting photon clicks and entangle the atoms .
Monroe says the fiber optic thread was necessary to establish entanglement of the atoms , but then the fiber could be severed and the two atoms would remain entangled , even if one were " ( carefully ) taken to Jupiter . "
Each qubit's information is like a single bit of information in a conventional computer , which is represented as a 0 or a 1 .
Things get weird on the quantum scale , though , and a qubit can be either a 0 , a 1 , or both at the same time , Monroe says .
Scientists call this phenomenon " superposition . "
Even weirder , scientists can't directly observe superposition , because the act of measuring the qubit affects it and forces it to become either a 0 or a 1 .
Entangled particles can default to the same position once measured , for example always ending in 0,0 or 1,1 .
" When entangled objects are measured , they always result in some sort of correlation , like always getting two coins to come up the same , even though they may be very far apart , " Monroe said .
" Einstein called this ' spooky action - at - a - distance , ' and it was the basis for his nonbelief in quantum mechanics .
But entanglement exists , and although very difficult to control , it is actually the basis for quantum computers . "
Scientists could set the position of one qubit and know that its entangled mate will follow suit .
Entanglement provides extra wiring between quantum circuits , Monroe says .
And it allows quantum computers to perform tasks impossible with conventional computers .
Quantum computers could transmit provably secure encrypted data , for example .
And they could factor numbers incredibly faster than today 's machines , making most current encryption technology obsolete ( most encryption today is based on the inability for man or machine to factor large numbers efficiently ) .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama on Wednesday called for completing a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq by the end of 2008 and said if elected president he would start an effort to help Iraqis bridge sectarian differences .
“ I am here to say that we have to begin to end this war now , ” the Illinois senator said in excerpts from a speech he was to deliver later in Iowa .
The excerpts were released by his presidential campaign .
He said he would immediately begin to pull out troops engaged in combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month , to be completed by the end of 2008 .
Obama also cautioned against dumping Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , who is held in deep skepticism by many U.S. lawmakers .
“ The problems in Iraq are bigger than one man , ” Obama said .
Obama was speaking after the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , told the U.S. Congress this week that he recommended gradually withdrawing up to 30,000 U.S. troops from Iraq by next summer , a proposal President George W. Bush is expected to endorse .
Obama said he would call for a new constitutional convention in Iraq , convened with the United Nations , which would not adjourn until Iraq ’s leaders reach a new agreement on political reconciliation .
New Times founders Jim Larkin ( left ) and Michael Lacey ( right ) , now under arrest .
Plainclothes Maricopa County Sheriff 's officers arrested New Times founders , Village Voice Media Executive Editor Michael Lacey and Chairman / CEO Jim Larkin at their homes late Thursday evening for revealing grand jury information in their recent story Grand Jury Targets New Times and Its Readers .
Both were taken into custody and have yet to be bailed out .
Lacey is believed to be in the 4th Ave. Jail .
And there are reports that Larkin was taken to a substation in Mesa .
In a related incident , New Times reporter Ray Stern was issued a citation today for taking digital photos of Sheriff 's Office documents at the law offices of Iafrate and Associates in Phoenix .
This is particularly absurd since all Stern did was try to take pictures of MCSO press releases -- public documents by any definition .
When asked to leave by Michelle Iafrate , the head of the law firm , he did so without incident .
It 's believed the arrests have nothing to do with Judge Baca , the judge in charge of the grand jury currently investigating Phoenix New Times .
Speculation is that New Times enemy Dennis Wilenchik , the special prosecutor in the case , may have filed a complaint against Lacey and Larkin , and that 's the reason they were arrested .
Published yesterday , the cover story with its dual byline revealed details of an ongoing grand jury inquiry into a law allegedly violated years ago when reporter John Dougherty revealed Sheriff Arpaio 's address in a column .
Dougherty was looking into Sheriff Joe 's real estate transactions at the time .
The law makes it illegal to publish the address online , not in the physical paper .
New Times lawyer Steve Suskin called it " highly unusual " that someone would be arrested for a Class 1 misdemeanor such as Lacey and Larkin were , and called it " unprecedented in the annals of journalism . "
More on this outrageous abuse of power by Sheriff Arpaio , County Attorney Andy Thomas and their attack - dog Wilenchik as it develops .
Study : US preparing ' massive ' military attack against Iran Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 28 , 2007
Print This Email This The United States has the capacity for and may be prepared to launch without warning a massive assault on Iranian uranium enrichment facilities , as well as government buildings and infrastructure , using long - range bombers and missiles , according to a new analysis .
The paper , " Considering a war with Iran : A discussion paper on WMD in the Middle East "  written by well - respected British scholar and arms expert Dr. Dan Plesch , Director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy of the School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) at the University of London , and Martin Butcher , a former Director of the British American Security Information Council ( BASIC ) and former adviser to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament  was exclusively provided to RAW STORY late Friday under embargo .
" We wrote the report partly as we were surprised that this sort of quite elementary analysis had not been produced by the many well resourced Institutes in the United States , " wrote Plesch in an email to Raw Story on Tuesday .
Plesch and Butcher examine " what the military option might involve if it were picked up off the table and put into action " and conclude that based on open source analysis and their own assessments , the US has prepared its military for a " massive " attack against Iran , requiring little contingency planning and without a ground invasion .
The study concludes that the US has made military preparations to destroy Irans WMD , nuclear energy , regime , armed forces , state apparatus and economic infrastructure within days if not hours of President George W. Bush giving the order .
The US is not publicising the scale of these preparations to deter Iran , tending to make confrontation more likely .
The US retains the option of avoiding war , but using its forces as part of an overall strategy of shaping Irans actions .
Any attack is likely to be on a massive multi - front scale but avoiding a ground invasion .
Attacks focused on WMD facilities would leave Iran too many retaliatory options , leave President Bush open to the charge of using too little force and leave the regime intact .
US bombers and long range missiles are ready today to destroy 10,000 targets in Iran in a few hours .
US ground , air and marine forces already in the Gulf , Iraq , and Afghanistan can devastate Iranian forces , the regime and the state at short notice .
Some form of low level US and possibly UK military action as well as armed popular resistance appear underway inside the Iranian provinces or ethnic areas of the Azeri , Balujistan , Kurdistan and Khuzestan .
Iran was unable to prevent sabotage of its offshore - to - shore crude oil pipelines in 2005 .
Nuclear weapons are ready , but most unlikely , to be used by the US , the UK and Israel .
The human , political and environmental effects would be devastating , while their military value is limited .
Israel is determined to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons yet has the conventional military capability only to wound Irans WMD programmes .
The attitude of the UK is uncertain , with the Brown government and public opinion opposed psychologically to more war , yet , were Brown to support an attack he would probably carry a vote in Parliament .
The UK is adamant that Iran must not acquire the bomb .
The US is not publicising the scale of these preparations to deter Iran , tending to make confrontation more likely .
The US retains the option of avoiding war , but using its forces as part of an overall strategy of shaping Irans actions .
When asked why the paper seems to indicate a certainty of Iranian WMD , Plesch made clear that " our paper is not , repeat not , about what Iran actually has or not . "
Yet , he added that " Iran certainly has missiles and probably some chemical capability . "
Most significantly , Plesch and Butcher dispute conventional wisdom that any US attack on Iran would be confined to its nuclear sites .
Instead , they foresee a " full - spectrum approach , " designed to either instigate an overthrow of the government or reduce Iran to the status of " a weak or failed state . "
Although they acknowledge potential risks and impediments that might deter the Bush administration from carrying out such a massive attack , they also emphasize that the administration 's National Security Strategy includes as a major goal the elimination of Iran as a regional power .
They suggest , therefore , that :
This wider form of air attack would be the most likely to delay the Iranian nuclear program for a sufficiently long period of time to meet the administrations current counterproliferation goals .
It would also be consistent with the possible goal of employing military action is to overthrow the current Iranian government , since it would severely degrade the capability of the Iranian military ( in particular revolutionary guards units and other ultra-loyalists ) to keep armed opposition and separatist movements under control .
It would also achieve the US objective of neutralizing Iran as a power in the region for many years to come .
However , it is the option that contains the greatest risk of increased global tension and hatred of the United States .
The US would have few , if any allies for such a mission beyond Israel ( and possibly the UK ) .
Once undertaken , the imperatives for success would be enormous .
Butcher says he does not believe the US would use nuclear weapons , with some exceptions .
" My opinion is that [ nuclear weapons ] would n't be used unless there was definite evidence that Iran has them too or is about to acquire them in a matter of days / weeks , " notes Butcher .
" However , the Natanz facility has been so hardened that to destroy it MAY require nuclear weapons , and once an attack had started it may simply be a matter of following military logic and doctrine to full extent , which would call for the use of nukes if all other means failed . "
Military Strategy
The bulk of the paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of specific military strategies for such an attack , of ongoing attempts to destabilize Iran by inciting its ethnic minorities , and of the considerations surrounding the possible employment of nuclear weapons .
In particular , Plesch and Butcher examine what is known as Global Strike  the capability to project military power from the United States to anywhere in the world , which was announced by STRATCOM as having initial operational capability in December 2005 .
It is the that capacity that could provide strategic bombers and missiles to devastate Iran on just a few hours notice .
Iran has a weak air force and anti aircraft capability , almost all of it is 20 - 30 years old and it lacks modern integrated communications .
Not only will these forces be rapidly destroyed by US air power , but Iranian ground and air forces will have to fight without protection from air attack .
British military sources stated on condition of anonymity , that " the US military switched its whole focus to Iran " from March 2003 .
It continued this focus even though it had infantry bogged down in fighting the insurgency in Iraq .
Global Strike could be combined with already - existing " regional operational plans for limited war with Iran , such as Oplan 1002 - 04 , for an attack on the western province of Kuzhestan , or Oplan 1019 which deals with preventing Iran from closing the Straits of Hormuz , and therefore keeping open oil lanes vital to the US economy . "
The Marines are not all tied down fighting in Iraq .
Several Marine forces are assembling in the Gulf , each with its own aircraft carrier .
These carrier forces can each conduct a version of the D - Day landings .
They come with landing craft , tanks , jump - jets , thousands of troops and hundreds more cruise missiles .
Their task is to destroy Iranian forces able to attack oil tankers and to secure oilfields and installations .
They have trained for this mission since the Iranian revolution of 1979 as is indicated in this battle map of Hormuz illustrating an advert for combat training software .
Special Forces units  which are believed to already be operating within Iran  would be available to carry out search - and - destroy missions and incite internal uprisings , while US Army units in both Iraq and Afghanistan could mount air and missile attacks on Iranian forces , which are heavily concentrated along the Iran - Iraq border , as well as protecting their own supply lines within Iraq : A key assessment in any war with Iran concerns Basra province and the Kuwait border .
It is likely that Iran and its sympathizers could take control of population centres and interrupt oil supplies , if it was in their interest to do so .
However it is unlikely that they could make any sustained effort against Kuwait or interrupt supply lines north from Kuwait to central Iraq .
US firepower is simply too great for any Iranian conventional force .
Experts question the report 's conclusions Former CIA analyst and Deputy Director for Transportation Security , Antiterrorism Assistance Training , and Special Operations in the State Department 's Office of Counterterrorism , Larry Johnson , does not agree with the reports findings .
" The report seems to accept without question that US air force and navy bombers could effectively destroy Iran and they seem to ignore the fact that US use of air power in Iraq has failed to destroy all major military , political , economic and transport capabilities , " said Johnson late Monday after the embargo on the study had been lifted .
" But at least in their conclusions they still acknowledge that Iran , if attacked , would be able to retaliate .
Yet they are vague in terms of detailing the extent of the damage that the Iran is capable of inflicting on the US and fairly assessing what those risks are . "
There is also the situation of US soldiers in Iraq and the supply routes that would have to be protected to ensure that US forces had what they needed .
Plesch explains that  " firepower is an effective means of securing supply routes during conventional war and in conventional war a higher loss rate is expected . "
" However as we say do not assume that the Iraqi Shiia will rally to Tehran  the quietist Shiia tradition favoured by Sistani may regard itself as justified if imploding Iranian power can be argued to reduce US problems in Iraq , not increase them . "
John Pike , Director of Global Security , a Washington - based military , intelligence , and security clearinghouse , says that the question of Iraq is the one issue at the center of any questions regarding Iran .
" The situation in Iraq is a wild card , though it may be presumed that Iran would mount attacks on the US at some remove , rather than upsetting the apple - cart in its own front yard , " wrote Pike in an email .
Political Considerations Plesch and Butcher write with concern about the political context within the United States :
This debate is bleeding over into the 2008 Presidential election , with evidence mounting that despite the public unpopularity of the war in Iraq , Iran is emerging as an issue over which Presidential candidates in both major American parties can show their strong national security bona fides .
...
The debate on how to deal with Iran is thus occurring in a political context in the US that is hard for those in Europe or the Middle East to understand .
A context that may seem to some to be divorced from reality , but with the US ability to project military power across the globe , the reality of Washington DC is one that matters perhaps above all else .
...
We should not underestimate the Bush administration 's ability to convince itself that an " Iran of the regions " will emerge from a post - rubble Iran .
So , do not be in the least surprised if the United States attacks Iran .
Timing is an open question , but it is hard to find convincing arguments that war will be avoided , or at least ones that are convincing in Washington .
Plesch and Butcher are also interested in the attitudes of the current UK government , which has carefully avoided revealing what its position might be in the case of an attack .
They point out , however , " One key caution is that regardless of the realities of Irans programme , the British public and elite may simply refuse to participate  almost out of bloody minded revenge for the Iraq deceit . "
And they conclude that even " if the attack is ' successful ' and the US reasserts its global military dominance and reduces Iran to the status of an oil - rich failed state , then the risks to humanity in general and to the states of the Middle East are grave indeed . "

The Internet has been amazingly quiet about IBM ’s litigation against Amazon .
It feels to me like maybe the biggest Internet story of , well , maybe , ever .
I have n’t gone and read the IBM patents yet , because reading patents always depresses me .
If the titles mean anything ( not always a sure bet ) , this might mean that IBM has finally managed to figure out how to set up that Internet Tollbooth that we ’ve always been afraid of .
If you ’re interested in “ Presenting Applications in an Interactive Service ” , “ Storing Data in an Interactive Network ” , “ Presenting Advertising in an Interactive Service ” , “ Adjusting Hypertext Links with Weighted User Goals and Activities ” , or “ Ordering Items Using an Electronic Catalogue ” , apparently IBM thinks you need to pay them for the right to do any of those things .

We owe it to these people :
And we owe it to this woman who died in the WTC :
We owe it to these dead Iraqi children :
And to these :
And we owe it to this American kid :
And we owe it to all the people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time the last six years :
We owe it to the dead everywhere , killed because of lies from these men :
And we owe it to the each of the human beings who gave their lives for a lie :
We owe it to every person whose flesh melted to the bone from the use of white phosphorous in Iraq .
We owe it to every person who died on 9/11 .
We owe it to every person who drowned in New Orleans .
We owe it to everyone who protested the war , KNOWING it was illegal and based on lies .
We owe it to every whistleblower who tried to do the right thing .
We owe it to the world .
We owe it to America itself .

We owe it to history .
In short , those who say " there 's no political upside to impeachment " are engaging in a type of thinking that is profoundly despicable .
It 's the kind of thinking that I want absolutely nothing to do with .
Those people are putting politics , and the fear of somehow " looking bad " , above nothing short of morality .
They 're putting their own fears of losing political capital ahead of their humanity .
And to them I say : I want nothing to do with you .
Exactly how heinous should the crimes be before it becomes obvious to one and all that the removal from office , followed by indictments , convictions , and punishment , be not just an option , not just something " political " but an obligation to humanity ?
I submit that the crimes of the Bush cabal are far and above that requirement .
Anyone thinking otherwise is forgetting the ugliness , the inhuman monstrousness , of these criminals ' activities the last six years .
There is absolutely no reason , practical , moral , or otherwise , to keep these men in the Executive Branch of our Government .
None whatsoever .
My God , people , we just got a mandate from the entire population of the United States .
Does anyone realize this ?
We got a mandate .
To throw the bums out .
That 's what this election was all about -- it was n't even about politics -- it was n't about left wing versus right wing -- it was about throwing out the liars , the opportunists , the corrupt bastards who hijacked this country .
We owe it to everyone who voted for this change .
The American people have spoken .
Why are n't we listening ?

Export sales in August rose to a record and the monthly trade deficit fell to its lowest level since January , the Commerce Department said yesterday .
The report suggested a rosier outlook for third - quarter growth , but analysts warned that a weakening dollar could drag down domestic demand in the months ahead .
The gap between what Americans import and export shrank 2.4 percent in August , to nearly $ 57.6 billion , an improvement over analysts ’ expectations .
The July deficit was revised lower , to $ 59 billion , a drop of about $ 250 million , the department said .
A weakening dollar , which reduces the monetary value of exports , had the counterbalancing effect of contributing to the increase in exports — good news for American producers .
Export sales rose 0.4 percent , to $ 138.3 billion , in August , led by strong business in food and industrial supplies .
Total export sales have risen 12.8 percent since August 2006 .
Imports fell 0.4 percent , to $ 195.9 billion , as pharmaceutical and automotive imports dropped .
But Americans purchased more foreign clothing and technology products , like semiconductors .

The case appeared to be open and shut .
The county sheriff had been caught selling an illegal whiskey still from the back of the county jail .
The buyers were a federal informant and an undercover federal investigator .
The sheriff , to elude honest police , had even escorted the illegal still out of town .
But for Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Thompson , few cases would prove easy .
Today , as a Republican candidate for president , Thompson is cultivating an image as a tough prosecutor who , like the character he played on TV’s “ Law & Order , ” battled powerful criminals during his three - year stint as a prosecutor .
Advertisement
He was “ attacking crime and public corruption , ” boasts a video played at his campaign events .
During a candidate debate this month , Thompson said he spent those years “ prosecuting most of the major federal crimes in middle Tennessee -- most of the major ones . ”
But a review of the 88 criminal cases Thompson handled at the U.S. attorney ’s office in Nashville , from 1969 to 1972 , reveals a different and more human portrait -- that of a young lawyer learning the ropes on routine cases involving gambling , mail theft and , in one instance , talking dirty on CB radio .
There were a few bank robbers and counterfeiters .
But more than anything , Thompson took on the state ’s moonshiners and a local culture , rooted in Tennessee ’s hills and hollows , that celebrated the independent whiskey maker ’s battle against the government ’s revenue agents .
Twenty - seven of his cases involved moonshining -- more than any other crime .
Advertisement
“ Hell , I made whiskey and was violating the law , but I did n’t do nothing wrong , ” said one of Thompson ’s many moonshining defendants , Kenneth Whitehead .
“ I would do it again if I had a still .
I ca n’t afford a still now . ”
Thompson had just turned 27 when he became a prosecutor .
The public stage of the courtroom became a place where he learned to develop the strengths -- and to navigate around his weaknesses -- that would later boost him to the U.S. Senate and , now , to a top slot in the GOP presidential field .
The candidate who today shows an uncertain command of current events -- he flubbed questions last month about the death penalty -- was prone as a younger man to getting dates wrong in indictments .
The candidate who ended his first , unsteady debate appearance with a one - liner ( “ It was getting a little boring without me , ” he said of his decision to join the presidential race ) would disarm tense situations with an offhand joke after he committed a mistake .
Advertisement
And there were plenty of mistakes .
“ I ’ve seen a lot better lawyers , ” said Burton Moulder , the former sheriff whom Thompson prosecuted for selling a still from the county jail .
“ But he was very charming .
He had a nice , clear voice . ”
Thompson is better known for his two later stints in public service : as lead Republican counsel for the Senate Watergate committee and as a U.S. senator representing Tennessee for eight years .
Thompson ’s campaign declined to make him available for an interview .
Thompson got the prosecutor ’s job through politics .
He had been handling divorces and other small cases in his hometown of Lawrenceburg when Republican Richard Nixon won the White House .
Soon after , the new U.S. attorney for middle Tennessee began replacing the Democratic legal staff with Republicans , as was customary at the time .

Thompson was only two years out of law school , but he had managed a Republican congressional campaign ( albeit a losing one ) .
“ That gave me , I guess , some Republican credentials , ” he said in a 2003 interview .
U.S. Attorney Charles Hill Anderson granted his prosecutors wide latitude in choosing which cases to handle , old colleagues say .
In his early months , Thompson indicted a company for selling medication that turned out to be castor oil .
He later prosecuted a man who tried to board an airplane while carrying a loaded revolver .
James Howard “ Daddy Jim ” Gipson pleaded no contest to obscenity charges that Thompson brought because of Gibson ’s habit of saying obscene things over a CB radio while drunk .
“ We did n’t get any coaching , really , ” says W. Buford Bates , who prosecuted cases with Thompson .
“ We did pretty much what we wanted to do . ”
Trials of his own
Advertisement
In his most publicized case , Thompson successfully prosecuted Johnny Pace , a bank robber who had escaped from the federal tank inside the Nashville jail .
“ Mr. Thompson was a true gentleman , ” said John Blalock , the sheriff ’s deputy who captured Pace in Los Angeles County .
“ I ’ve never been treated with more courtesy by a prosecutor . ”
But Thompson ’s charm did not work on U.S. District Judge Frank Gray Jr. , who presided over nearly all of his cases .
A liberal Democrat who had worked on presidential campaigns from Al Smith ’s to Estes Kefauver ’s , Gray had little patience for fools , and even less for Republicans .
In court , the judge would make guttural sounds or break pencils as lawyers tried to form arguments .
“ Judge Gray was very tough on Fred and the lawyers in Charlie Anderson ’s U.S. attorney ’s office -- he did n’t think they knew what they were doing , ” recalled Gilbert S. Merritt , Anderson ’s predecessor , who is now a judge on the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals .
There was much to learn .
After charging a man with stealing checks from the mail , Thompson saw the case dismissed because the wrong date appeared in the indictment .
Another indictment , against a group of counterfeiters , was thrown out when Gray ruled that Thompson had failed to allege a crime .
The judge often chided Thompson for a bad habit of leading witnesses .
Advertisement
In the trial of a man charged with aiding bank robber Johnny Pace in his escape , Gray completely lost it as Thompson struggled with the concept of hearsay evidence .
“ I do n’t see any reason for the consummate passion of the United States attorney ’s getting stuff reversed by getting stuff in the record that has no business in there at all , ” the judge declared , adding that he found Thompson ’s conduct “ utterly incompetent . ”
“ I got initiated by Judge Frank Gray , ” Thompson said in a 2003 interview , “ and I use that term advisedly . ”
Thompson ’s saving grace in court was his calm demeanor ( “ the coolest lawyer I ’ve seen , ” recalls one juror , Henry Bledsoe Jr. ) and his sense of humor .
During a particularly tense trial , as one law enforcement witness tore seals on three successive envelopes before he could get to the evidence within , Thompson quipped , “ Is there really anything in there at all ? ”
Advertisement
At one slow - paced hearing , Thompson attempted so many jokes that the defense attorney objected : “ Is there any way you could rule against the assistant United States attorney for his continued humorous attempts at humorous remarks , and also his references to the fact that he would like to leave here in a hurry ? ”
Alcohol apostasy
For a small - town boy such as Thompson , pursuing rural whiskey makers represented a mild apostasy .
“ Rocky Top , ” one of Tennessee ’s official state songs , tells of “ two strangers , ” presumably tax agents , who disappear forever while “ lookin ’ for a moonshine still ” on a mountaintop .
NASCAR auto racing grew from roots in bootlegging , and movies such as Robert Mitchum ’s 1958 classic “ Thunder Road ” romanticized the moonshine culture .
Advertisement
Nearly 40 years after the demise of Prohibition , most of Tennessee ’s counties remained dry , creating a demand for moonshine -- home - brewed , untaxed liquor .
The federal levy on legal whiskey was more than $ 10 a gallon .
By contrast , a Tennessean could buy moonshine for $ 6 a gallon .
Chasing the moonshiners “ was hard work , ” said Charles Lowe , who investigated cases for the federal division then called Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms .
“ The population in general bought the whiskey , and they kind of sided with the bootleggers philosophically .
But Fred believed in what he was doing .
. . .
He fought . ”
Moonshine was commonly made with sugar , yeast , and a still to separate the alcohol from the fermented mash .
Most Tennessee moonshine was tasty , agents say , though irresponsible moonshiners gave their customers lead poisoning by using automobile radiators in the condensing process .
Thompson ’s defendants were often poor , and few had high school educations , according to Bureau of Prisons reports included in court files .
One typical report described a bootlegger Thompson prosecuted -- a high school dropout who had married at age 14 -- as “ the product of a rural , hill - country environment where illegal distilling and running of whiskey have existed for decades . ”

Many in the illegal whiskey trade say Thompson was merciful and sensitive .
Dwayne Kent , a moonshiner who also served as a witness in a Thompson prosecution , recalls Thompson dealing with a bootlegger who had not seen an elevator before and was afraid to board it at the courthouse .
“ It was like trying to load a wild cow in a truck , ” said Kent , who quit bootlegging and now is chairman of his county ’s tax board .
“ But Fred handled things .
He stopped himself and the other attorneys when they used big words so we could understand what they were saying . ”
Thompson easily won convictions for possession of moonshine , but Judge Gray was lenient in sentencing , rarely doling out jail time .
“ It was a game , ” said Merritt , the former U.S. attorney .
“ Gray did n’t like these cases .
He thought they were a waste of time , and he was right . ”

Pursuing sheriffs
In his third and final year as a prosecutor , Thompson went after law enforcement itself , seeking indictments against two county sheriffs who , investigators told him , were involved in the moonshining business .
These were the only public corruption cases he handled , court records show .
In the first case , he won a conviction against Sheriff Charles Crockarell of Stewart County , near the Kentucky border .
The prosecution of the other sheriff , Burton Moulder of Cannon County , would prove to be the most difficult case of Thompson ’s tenure .
As sheriff , Moulder had investigated moonshiners on nearby Short Mountain .
But according to testimony , Moulder also sold a confiscated still for $ 175 to an undercover federal agent and an informant , who was a moonshiner himself .
Advertisement
Moulder admitted he had sold the still , but he said it was only to assist federal officials in setting up other moonshining investigations .
At the trial , Moulder ’s wife dropped a bombshell :
She testified that she had been having an affair with a state alcohol agent who was part of the investigation of her husband .
Susie Mae Moulder claimed that when she broke off the affair , the state agent threatened to put her husband in the penitentiary .
The trial then focused on whether the sheriff ’s wife had fabricated her claims in order to damage the prosecution case and save her husband .
In his cross-examination , Thompson accused her of sleeping with a different law enforcement agent .
The case was hopelessly compromised in the eyes of at least some jurors .
They failed to reach a verdict , and a mistrial was declared .
The U.S. attorney ’s office later dismissed the charges entirely .

Burton Moulder still lives in Woodbury , a quiet town of 2,500 southeast of Nashville .
In an interview on his front lawn , Moulder said the trial finished him in politics , though he managed to repair his marriage and build a career in emergency medical services .
He remains bitter with the state alcohol agent , but not with Thompson , who he believes was professional in court .
“ Fred did n’t really turn the heat up when I got on the stand .
He could have , but he did n’t , ” recalled Moulder .
“ I ’m still grateful .
I think he knew there was something wrong with the case . ”
When he ran into Thompson at a gun show years later , Moulder said , they “ talked to each other like old friends . ”
A return to politics
Advertisement
Later in the 1970s , moonshining began to die out in Tennessee , but not because of the federal prosecutions .
A sharp rise in the price of sugar made it harder to turn a profit .
“ That era was the beginning of the end of moonshine , ” said Linzie Jones , a federal agent who worked with Thompson .
“ Then the marijuana started coming in . ”
The Moulder case would be Thompson ’s last in the U.S. attorney ’s office .
Less than a week after the trial , he resigned and went into private practice in Nashville .
Thompson also returned to politics .
He spent much of the rest of the year working for the reelection of U.S. Sen .

Baker won , and he soon had to look for someone to serve as lead counsel on the Senate committee investigating the Watergate scandal .
Thompson was a political loyalist and friend .
And he had earned an important credential :
He had been a prosecutor .
By early 1973 , eight months after he had failed to convict a county sheriff , Fred Thompson was on his way to Washington to investigate the president .

Times researchers John Jackson and Robin Mayper contributed to the reporting of this story .
The cheesy theme music blares from the speakers , all keyboards and horns , as the topic of the day 's program scrolls across the screen in bright neon : " I Can't Lose , I Have Two Women , Why Choose ?
Ricki , I Want Them Both ! "
It 's the Ricki Lake Show , sometime in 1997 .
The camera pans across the hyped audience before landing on a very pregnant Ricki , who conducts the entire show from a director 's chair while two helpers dart around the studio , putting mikes in front of people 's faces .
An assortment of trash tumbles across the stage , spilling tales of cheating and heartbreak and betrayal , and then Ricki welcomes Michelle Ormond , a 25 - year - old from Denver , Colorado .
" My next guest says whoever said ' Two 's company , three 's a crowd ' had no idea what they were talking about , because in her life , two may be company , but three is even better , " Ricki announces .
The audience hoots and hollers , and then Michelle calmly explains how she 'd been married to her husband , Dennis , for four years when she met Shawna -- through an ad in local sex rag The Oyster -- and how the three of them now live together in the same house and sleep in the same bed .
Before long , the whole love triangle is out there -- Michelle in her floral print dress , Dennis in a suit and tie with a Full Metal Jacket buzz - cut , Shawna in a pink blazer -- and as Shawna and Michelle kiss , some visionary in the audience mutters to Dennis , " You must be the Big Poppa , because I see how it be working for you ! "
" Everybody 's got to be able to get along , " Michelle explains .
" Everybody 's got to be able to communicate .
That 's the big thing . "
The same threesome also appears on The Maury Povich Show , again extolling the healthiness and happiness of the blissful relationship , preaching about the importance of open lines of communication .
Then Maury attempts to wade through the bullshit .
" Come on , " he says , exasperated .
" Is this just not an explosion ready to happen ? "
Dennis fields the query .
" We do n't concentrate on how it 's going to break up , " he says .
" We concentrate on how to keep it going .
If it ever dies , we 'll deal with it then . "
Maury 's concerns proved accurate ; Shawna moved out the next year .
But not even he could have imagined just how big the ultimate explosion would be .
If Maury had had any idea about the needs pulsating through Michelle , needs that saw her fuck her way through job after job -- including a supervisory role with the Regional Transportation District -- then go on to become the tattooed Internet phenomenon " The Pass Around Girl , " he would have never let her leave the studio .
At least not without filming a few more episodes .
Over the years , Michelle Ormond has played many roles .
" I 've always taken on somebody else 's life and personality to fit in with them , " she says .
" I would just become whoever I was with . "
" She 's a chameleon , " says Dennis Ormond .
" She 's like a mirror of whoever she is with at the time or obsessing over .
She emulates them .
It 's spooky . "
Truth is , Michelle has no idea who she really is .
But for the first time in her 35 years , she 's trying to find out .
" My childhood was normal , " she says of growing up in Thornton .
" My parents are married , they had their first marriage and stayed together , they took me and my sister on vacations , they did n't abuse us , they were n't alcoholics or drug abusers or smokers , but there was a lot of emotional neglect , the idea that our opinion did n't matter at all .
At the same time , there was a lot of guilt put on us , too -- to do better in school , to be a better role model . "
So early on , Michelle cultivated the need to make people happy .
She was the people - pleaser , the class clown .
Her parents both worked , and Michelle would have to wake up on her own and call one of them when she left for school , then call again immediately after coming home .
" I was very limited in what I could do , " she says .
So she would act out in little ways : drinking cherry brandy with a friend in junior high , pocketing money intended for school lunches .
Her parents were Italian Catholics , and not only were they controlling , but they kept the subject of sex taboo .
" I was always taught that sex was done in the dark , once you 're married , on your back for procreation , and that was it , " Michelle says .
" Anything else was grounds for going to hell .
But when you 're young and you have these hormones kicking in , it creates these powerful feelings of guilt . "
Like the time Michelle got caught masturbating when she was twelve or thirteen .
She 'd pilfered her mother 's electric scissors , padded the sharp parts with tape and cotton , and was using the makeshift vibrator when her mom walked in on her .
As her mother recoiled in shock and anger , Michelle sprinted from the house and hid outside for a few hours .
When she finally returned , her mother waited several more hours before talking to her about her sinful behavior , pushing the same Catholic rhetoric on Michelle that she 'd been raised with .
Michelle swore off masturbating for a while .
But the urges returned , and she would satiate herself -- more carefully -- only to be racked by overpowering feelings of guilt .
A tenacious boy she met at summer camp took Michelle 's virginity when she was fifteen .
He 'd follow her home from Thornton High School each day and pressure her for sex .
Michelle did n't really know how to say no -- she did n't want to upset him or have someone not like her -- so she relented .
After that , she took to ditching class and making out with boys in the band room , and she sneaked out to another boyfriend 's house to hook up over lunch .
But it was n't until her junior year that she realized she thought about sex a little differently than most people .
" I was with another boyfriend at the time , and we were hanging out with one of his friends , " Michelle remembers .
" And there was just a lot of guy talk going on .
They were talking about wanting to tag - team me , and I was just trying to keep up , be one of the guys , so I was like , ' No problem , I can take you both ' and whatever .
So we drove behind a shopping center , they flipped a coin , and one guy stayed outside as a lookout while I had sex with the first guy .
It felt good .
They were making a big deal out of me , paying all this attention to me , but then when it came time for the second guy , he chickened out , and that gave me this power .
I had something to hold over him .
And that 's when it added a whole new element to it ; I started to see I could control people with this sex drive . "
She 'd obsess over targets and build them into an ideal fantasy , then screw them , explode the fantasy and move on .
And on .
And on .
After graduating from high school , at nineteen she married Bill , the guy who had n't chickened out of her first threesome attempt .
They moved to Silverthorne , where Michelle found work with a nearby vet .
" Things immediately did n't feel right , " she remembers .
" I figured I could make things work .
You hear about people getting married and falling in love afterwards , but that did n't happen .
I was still calling my parents and checking in with them all the time , making sure I was doing everything right .
That 's how little power I gave him .
That 's how little power he took . "
It did n't help that Michelle was fucking everyone at the office .
Not all at the same time , but systematically .
She 'd go after a co-worker , male or female , obsess over them , sleep with them once , then want nothing more to do with them .
In the eleven months she was with Bill , Michelle estimates that she screwed around with at least a dozen people .
It was n't about the sex ; it was about the power and the attention , having people want her , need her .
Michelle kept her mouth shut about her activities , but in the small mountain town , word spread faster than her legs .
When Bill figured out that the rumors of his wife 's behavior were true , he hopped on his motorcycle and hit the road .
Somewhere between Fort Morgan and Brush , he steered his bike into an oncoming semi .
A few days later , Michelle got his suicide note in the mail , blaming her .
" My parents came and picked me up , " she remembers .
" And the whole thing was just kind of swept under the rug .
My dad saw the note -- of course I denied everything -- and we just decided that there was no need for anyone to know about this , that it would just upset people .
God forbid we do something like that . "
Bill had purchased that motorcycle from Dennis Ormond and was still paying it off .
After a missed payment , Dennis got in touch with Michelle .
She told him that Bill was dead and offered to pay for the rest of the bike , but Dennis told her that it was Bill 's debt , and they would just call it even .
Then he introduced her to his wife , Barbara .
Bill died in August 1992 .
By late October of that year , Michelle had moved in with Dennis and Barbara and was sleeping with both of them .
By July of the following year , Barbara was out of the picture and Dennis and Michelle were wed , embarking on a thirteen - year marriage that was ultimately anything but happily ever after .
The first sign of trouble came in 1995 , after Michelle had been accepted into the Denver Sheriff 's Department academy .
" She had portrayed herself to me as having an occasional sexual experience in high school , " Dennis says .
" I really did n't know much about her past or tendencies .
She was openly sexual , but so was my first wife .
Of course I did n't know it at the time , but she went to work at the Denver Sheriff 's Department and immediately got herself involved in a sexual affair with another officer in the academy . "
" Once I had sex with him the first time , I was done with him , " Michelle says .
" But he was a strong personality , and he was not going to let the relationship end .
I was seeing him every day , and I did n't know how to back out of it , so I just figured I would ride it out until we graduated .
We would be assigned to separate posts , and that would be that . "
Not so .
Angered by Michelle 's increasing distance , one day the man followed her car and attempted to run her off I - 70 .
Michelle veered off the highway , got back on , then managed to pull over into a gas station parking lot near the Smith Road academy facility .
Her scorned lover caught up with her and started beating her .
Both would - be officers pulled out their guns , and police showed up .
Michelle resigned from the academy .
A few months later , Michelle put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger .
Her suicide attempt was unsuccessful : Fearful that his wife was spinning out of control , Dennis had removed the bullets .
" When we came out of that , I thought , well , you 're 23 , that was fucking stupid , do n't do it again , " Dennis says .
" And she swore up and down , ' My God , I had no idea something like that could happen . '
It took us a year to get over that , and I really did chalk it up to youthful indiscretion .
I did n't think it was going to happen again . "
But it did .
As part of the process of finding herself , Michelle has written a timeline of her life , year by year , highlighting significant and pivotal events .
1995 : Husband smacks her around a bit .
1996 : Michelle gets a job at Rocky Mountain PlayMates , undressing and pleasuring herself for online perverts .
1997 : Michelle abuses Shawna , who is now living with her and Dennis .
They all do the Maury and Ricki shows .
1998 : Shawna , whom Michelle has married in a ceremony , leaves , but not before Michelle abuses her again .
1999 : Michelle meets a seventeen - year - old girl online named Britni and starts dating her .
Britni moves into the house .
When she turns eighteen , she begins making porno films as Bisexual Britni .
Dennis goes along on all her shoots and oversees her career ( which is still flourishing ) .
Meanwhile , Michelle is working as a hospital shared - services dispatcher and having an affair with two co-workers -- one male , one female .
2000 : Michelle is hired by RTD .
Last May , Dennis Ormond wrote a fourteen - page , single - spaced letter to ten RTD employees , a letter which he forwarded to RTD 's board of directors .
" I am not here to excuse nor condone Michelle 's behavior at RTD , " he wrote .
" Michelle 's conduct at RTD is absolutely reprehensible and indefensible .
She had sex with coworkers , superiors and later , her own subordinates .
Actually , I am quite amazed she got away with it for so long ....
Michelle , as you all know , basically just let all of you take turns on her .
I sure hope all of you felt cool and powerful as you took advantage of a woman who lacks a single skill as it pertains to acting reasonably .
Is work the same without Michelle ?
Did it occur to a single one of you that ultimately , Michelle would get caught and in doing so , would hazard her own marriage , her own kids and her own mental well being ?
Not a single one of you noticed that she was falling apart and was not even attempting to say ' no ' any longer ?
Or was that the whole point ?
Well , you sure showed us .
Michelle is officially destroyed and I truly hope it was worth it for you all .
Now that we have a basic understanding of how cool and caring each one of you actually is , let us detail it just a bit . "
In those details , Dennis laid out all the lying , cheating and sex in which Michelle engaged while at RTD , addressing each sexual partner by name and asking how they could live with themselves .
The letter is a road map of his wife 's sexual exploits during her time with the company -- those she confessed to , at least .
The first affair happened almost immediately after she started work at RTD , with a driver who kissed and fondled Michelle on an empty bus , then went home with her that night ( Dennis was out of town ) and had rough sex with her on the living room floor .
This driver showed up at the house again the next day , and the two got naked in a hot tub .
The next guy got only blow jobs from Michelle .
In December 2000 , Michelle gave birth to twin baby boys , and she took nine months off .
During that time , she was faithful to her husband and family -- which included Bisexual Britni , of course -- but once she got back to work , the cheating started right back up , this time with two co-workers at the now - closed York Division , men she would play off each other to make them jealous .
The next guy got a blow job in the back office of an RTD facility , then in a parking lot behind a Wal - Mart , before he and Michelle went to a La Quinta on company time and had sex .
Westword contacted many of the men addressed in the letter ; they did not return phone calls .
" There are many things I would like to comment on , " says Scott Reed , RTD 's director of public affairs , when asked about Michelle Ormond .
" But because of confidentiality requirements , I cannot . "
RTD does confirm that Michelle was hired as a bus operator on May 7 , 2000 , and promoted to the position of street supervisor on January 12 , 2004 .
Dennis was no idiot ; he knew that his wife had screwed around in the past , and he was beginning to see all the warning signs of infidelity : secrets and lies about her whereabouts , screaming matches , the change in her behavior whenever she was taking up with someone new .
And then Michelle attempted to sleep with his best friend , Dan .
" When I discovered that she was making moves on Dan , all of a sudden I was in control , " Dennis remembers .
" Because Dan was my friend , I had some control .
He was frozen in his decision , waiting for us to figure things out before he could make his next move .
And somewhere in Michelle 's brain , she was starting to realize that Dan is not going to fuck her unless I give him permission .
It 's the addict needing to finish the cycle , and she just turned on me .
She 's screaming she has to have sex with him , I have to let her , I can take the boys , I can keep the house , she does n't give a fuck .
She was not the same person right then .
She was a junkie negotiating for a fix .
You would have thought she was defending crack rocks . "
Michelle never convinced Dennis that she should sleep with his best friend , but she did convince him that there was something seriously wrong with her .
Dennis did some research on the Internet and determined that his wife was a sex addict .
The two went to counseling , but it did n't take .
Michelle would lie about her intentions to recover , play at being apologetic .
Dennis still did n't know the extent of her activities at RTD , but he had his suspicions .
He started spending more time with her at work , taking her lunch to her , checking up on her .
One day he was casually looking through her locker when she did a 180 - degree flip .
" Out of the blue , she snapped at me , " Dennis says .
" ' What are you doing going through my stuff ?
You look stupid . '
Immediately , I knew something was up .
I found a phone number written on a piece of paper , and I would n't have thought twice about it had it not been for her reaction . "
The number belonged to a man she supervised , a man who'd been pestering her to go to parties , Michelle said .
Dennis told Michelle that she should call the man and put a stop to it .
As Michelle made the call , Dennis listened in .
" She said to him , you know , ' I do n't want you to invite me to any more parties , ' and he was fine with it -- I think she prepped him , but whatever -- and then right before he hung up , he said , ' And I guess we 'll just forget about what happened eighteen months ago . '
Of course Michelle denied it , said she did n't know why he would say something like that .
So I said , okay , why do n't you call him back ?
Her defenses were down , so she agreed to it , and she picks up the phone , dials about three numbers , then hesitates , hangs up the phone and admits that she had sex with him .
I felt like I had been hit in the face with a sledgehammer . "
Not just sex : stupid , reckless sex as a company supervisor .
" She got the job as a supervisor and she got her own company car , " Dennis explains .
" So what does she do with it ?
She drives her supervisor vehicle to the guy 's house -- and he 's married , mind you -- parks her RTD car in the driveway , on company time , goes in and has sex with the union employee that she supervises .
Then does the same thing the next day .
Then she cut it off .
Of course he spent the next year and a half begging her for more sex , saying things like , ' Come with me to this party so I can fuck you . ' "
After confessing to that incident , Michelle kept rattling off other names .
" It was basically , if you want to fix this at all , you need to tell him everything right now , " Michelle remembers .
" In the course of five seconds , I basically learned that I knew nothing about the person that I had been married to for the past thirteen years , " Dennis says .
" Secret cell phones , secret lunches , secret sex rendezvous , secret friends , pay - phone calls -- an entire network of deceit running four , five guys at a time .
I have no idea how she did her job .
I just sort of missed everything , I guess .
Even with her history , it 's just hard to suspect something that ugly . "
Dennis called the man back ; he was surprisingly cordial .
He admitted to the affair , apologized , said his own wife knew about it and that he was devastated about the whole thing .
After discussing it , Michelle and Dennis went to see the woman so that Michelle could apologize for the trouble she 'd caused .
The man had lied .
His wife had n't known about the affair -- but she did now .
The man called Dennis that night , drunk and irate .
" He said , ' I 'm going to kill you .
Your kids are never going to be safe .
I 'm going to find you .
How dare you tell my wife ? ' "
Dennis remembers .
" I thought , ' That 's interesting :
You do n't want me talking to your wife , but you do n't mind fucking mine . '
Of course we had to call the police in on that .
That dragged RTD into it . "
RTD immediately referred the matter to its security department , which conducted an investigation .
" On October 4th , 2005 , " the investigator reported , " I interviewed [ the ] bus operator [ he ] related that he had gone to a friend 's apartment after the call from Ms. Ormond .
[ He ] related that he had received a call from Dennis Ormond discussing several aspects of their prior conversation .
[ He ] stated that he did advise Dennis Ormond to stay out of their lives .
' I do n't want to see or hear from you , stay away from me and my wife . '
Dennis Ormond then asked [ him ] ' or what ? ' and [ he ] replied ' you do n't want to find out . '
He then hung up the phone and left his friend 's house . "
The report continues : He " stated that Ms. Ormond was a supervisor at the time of their affair and that she may have had a company vehicle over at his house during one of their encounters .
[ He ] further advised that Dennis Ormond had told him on the phone that Ms. Ormond had been involved in relations with several other operators .
Based on these statements , it was decided to interview the other RTD employees that had been mentioned in the investigation ....
These interviews were for the sole purpose to try to obtain any information that would implicate Michelle Ormond in inappropriate activity while on duty or acting as a supervisor . "
But Michelle thought other people had behaved inappropriately -- and were continuing to do so .
Typically , she 'd slept with a co-worker only once , and in attempts to get her to repeat the act , men often groped her and made lewd comments .
Now this behavior escalated .
According to the 2005 RTD Employee Handbook , " Any Employee who believes he or she has been the subject of sexual harassment shall report the alleged act immediately to his / her immediate supervisor or to the department head or to the Equal Opportunity Office ....
An investigation will be undertaken immediately . "
On a later page , RTD employees are advised that " the goal of the Equal Opportunity Office is to bring closure to the complaint within 30 days , " and that while employees can also take their complaints to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , the Colorado Civil Rights Division or the Federal Transit Administration , they " are encouraged to file with the RTD Equal Opportunity Office because our timelines for processing a complaint are much shorter . "
Michelle did .
" It is my opinion that since a great many of my socio - sexual mistakes have now been aired at RTD that I now have a long awaited opportunity to wipe the slate clean and start over , " Michelle wrote in an e-mail sent to Jewell Underwood , RTD 's Equal Employment Officer , on October 5 , 2005 .
She went on to outline the troubling behavior of several of her co-workers -- including one who would repeatedly ask , " When do I get to fuck you again ? " and " How are my children ? "
And then she asked for RTD 's EEO office to help her put a stop to it .
" I am attempting to change my life for the better , " Michelle concluded .
" Support and understanding during this difficult time have been invaluable .
I have a problem .
I suffer from a medical condition / addiction that is as debilitating , if not more so , as a drug or alcohol condition / addiction .
I suffer from an addiction to sex that I am CURRENTLY receiving professional treatment for .
This illness , however , does not give others permission to treat me in ways that violate company sexual harassment policies . "
Michelle did n't get any response to her e-mail -- not even an auto -reply that Underwood was unavailable .
So a few days later , she called the EEO office and spoke to a person who told her that Underwood was on a scheduled extended medical leave until November 7 and that Michelle would have to wait for her to return .
There was no one else there to help her : RTD , a company with around 2,500 employees and approximately 935 contractors ( mostly bus operators ) , had only one EEO officer and no plan for dealing with human - resource problems while she was out of the office for more than a month -- well beyond the thirty days ' response time promised in the employee handbook .
In the meantime , the situation was exploding .
The employees whom Michelle had named as sex partners had all been contacted by RTD 's security department , and if the men had n't known that they were n't the only ones who'd slept with Michelle , they did now .
And while Michelle waited to hear from the EEO office , these men formed a club : Drivers That Fucked Michelle .
The DTFM christened Michelle " The Pass Around Girl . "
They harassed her every time they saw her , she remembers .
They called her and Dennis and made lewd comments .
They tagged their home with the initials " DTFM " -- on the door , on fenceposts .
They formed a Yahoo group , where they would comment on what a whore Michelle was and post tips on how to get her into bed .
And from an account labeled DTFM , they sent pornographic e-cards .
" I fucked your wife while she begged me to do it harder and deeper , " says one card depicting a man and a woman engaged in doggie - style sex .
" Maybe if you lost some weight she would want to fuck you and not so many other men . "
A Father 's Day greeting reads , " How happy can fathers day be when your not sure if your kids are actually yours ? "
After a few weeks , Michelle stopped going to work .
On December 12 , 2005 , RTD fired her for abandoning her job .
When she filed for unemployment , RTD appealed .
The two parties took the dispute to the state 's Department of Labor and Unemployment .
RTD lost .
Michelle got her unemployment checks .
Last June , Michelle Ormond checked into the Del Amo Hospital in Woodland Hills , California , an inpatient facility that provides treatment for sexual addiction as well as a slew of other LaLa Land conditions , from alcoholism to bulimia .
Doctors there diagnosed Michelle 's problem areas : " Depression , history of suicide attempt , ongoing suicidal ideation , irritability , fatigue , feeling worthless / hopeless , anxiety , sexual acting out behavior , marital problems and flashbacks . "
" I did n't see her for the first ten days , " Dennis remembers .
" And our house had just been annihilated by this , the screaming , yelling , fights , slamming doors .
Our poor boys had just been brutalized , and all of a sudden it was peaceful , quiet .
There was part of me that was not sure if I ever wanted to see this person again . "
But he went to see her at Del Amo , where he realized she was obsessing over another patient .
Inside one of the top sexual - addiction treatment facilities in the country , Michelle the Pass Around Girl had fallen right back into her addictive pattern .
Dennis brought her back to Denver , kept her sequestered in their house , made sure she attended regular Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous Meetings and counseling sessions .
But soon Michelle was corresponding with another sex addict online and obsessing over that woman .
Dennis pointed out that she was falling into her standard addictive pattern and asked her to step forward , not back , and call off the Internet affair .
" Immediately , Michelle started bargaining and negotiating again , " Dennis remembers .
" Next thing I know , she 's offering up the boys to me to see this relationship through .
That 's when I realized that all the treatment we were doing -- a year of counseling , SLAA meetings , reading and talking and crying and driving her all over town and damn near bankrupting us with her inpatient fees -- it never scratched the surface of her addiction . "
Finally accepting that he had to remove his boys from the conflict , Dennis filed for divorce .
Michelle agreed not to fight for custody of their sons .
" The funny thing is , I 'm not exactly what you would call sexually possessive , " Dennis says .
" We do three - ways , we swing ; that 's where it makes no sense .
She could have slept with anyone .
She could have called me and said , ' Hey I met this guy on the way home .
Do you mind if I screw him ? '
And I would have said , ' Great , have a good time , be safe , tell me about it when you get home . '
That would have been fine .
But it 's the power issue of it , the lying , the cheating , the wanting people to pay attention to her .
That 's when you realize how strong her addiction is . "
Today , Michelle splits her time between Dennis 's house -- the two are still very close and occasionally have sex ( Michelle is also on - again / off - again with Bisexual Britni ) -- and her parents ' place in Thornton .
She fears returning to any sort of work environment , because she knows her behavior will resurface .
So she 's biding her time , struggling to beat her sex addiction .
" Before all those times when I tried to get better , I was underestimating just how addicted I was , " Michelle says .
" I was n't paying attention to how it worked .
But I 've been working really hard on listening to the thoughts that take place in my head and asking myself , ' Is this real , or is this something I 'm making up to feed my addiction ? '
It 's a daily struggle , because that addiction just wants to be fed . "
If it 's an addiction at all .
" According to the diagnostic statistical manual for psychological disorders , there is no DSM - IV for sex addiction , and so , by the book , there is no such thing as sex addiction , " says Tracy Todd , a licensed marriage and family therapist and president of the Brief Therapy Institute of Denver , who has not treated Michelle .
" I stay out of these debates , but depending on who you talk to , some people will say this is the greatest marketing scam ever created , and other people will say , no , this is truly a disorder . "
Psychologist Patrick J. Carnes is one of the latter .
In his 1991 book Do n't Call It Love , Carnes writes , " We are surrounded by the signs of sex addiction , yet still resist its reality .
We can accept that people can be sick with alcoholism or can destroy themselves with gambling or food -- but not sex . "
Todd says that people " using sexuality in a problematic way " generally fall into three categories : those who display behavior that rubs people the wrong way but may not be problematic , such as buying a lot of porn ; those who display behavior that adversely effects a marriage or a relationship but whose sexual acting - out is a symptom of a relationship issue with a significant other ; and people who are sexual train wrecks , who have sex with anyone .
It 's with this third category that things get tricky .
" A great number of these have a more fundamental disorder that is obsessive compulsive , a mood disorder or a personality disorder , " he notes .
" When you start to look at other psychological disorders that can be present , there are a great deal of them that have an underlying , fundamental psychological disorder that needs treatment , and just to treat the ' sexual addiction ' really misses the boat and sets them up to fail , because this underlying disorder is not going to get treated , and then they go out and do something else . "
Michelle has been doing something else to combat her sexual urges : getting tattoos .
Although she 'd been inked before , when she was in California she began using tattoos like self - medication .
Over the past year , she 's amassed quite a collection -- twelve sexually explicit tattoos including " I Swallow Cum " on her right breast , " I Eat Pussy " on her left breast and " Fuck My Whore Ass " on her hip .
Those tattoos went on display in October , when Michelle the Pass Around Girl was interviewed by the popular tattooing and piercing site www.bmezine.com, which had heard about her through Dennis 's porn-industry connections .
The story and photographs were the type of provocative fare that spreads like an STD across the web , from sketchy site to even sketchier site , which all posted photos of the " For Deposit Only " tag above Michelle 's vagina and the words " Fuck " and " Slut " on either side .
" Since I was trying hard not to have sex with everyone I spoke to during a day , my sexual addiction came out in other ways , " Michelle told the bmezine interviewer .
" My mind would not and could not stop focusing on sex 24 / 7 ... I started tattooing what I was thinking on my body . "
She talked about struggling to come to terms with sex addiction , but also shared tales of nurses going down on her and made the same " I 'll fuck anyone " declarations .
" The interview with bmezine.com , that was a character , " Michelle says now , pointing out that she told the online magazine that she was 27 , not 35 .
" The tattoos are a result of my abstinence .
They release some of what I was feeling , but it 's become a character , like , if someone comes at me with the whole tattooed , oh - what - a - whore angle , I just play that character . "
The character did not get a lot of sympathy .
" I would n't fuck that self - hating , misbegotten specimen with a stolen dog dick , " one poster wrote .
" I can see how one tat along those lines could be viewed as empowering , " another poster said on the now - defunct www.trainwrecks.net.
" But this is just sick , sad and sick . "
Another character emerges on her MySpace page , a character who lies about her age , says she 's interested in dating and serious relationships , and brags that she 's a porn star with an enormous income that she can use to spite anyone who 's ever crossed her , slept with and discarded her .
Since the interview with bmezine.com went global , TV's gotten interested in Michelle again .
No one wanted to talk to her about the issue of sex addiction , she says , but the tattoos make the story more marketable , more salacious .
She and Dennis have already filmed an episode of The Dr. Keith Ablow Show , as well as a segment for Dr. Phil , they say .
They 've returned to their daytime television days -- only this time they 're not singing the praises of swinging threesome relationships , they 're preaching the dangers of sexual addiction .
" The only reason we are doing the shows is because they promise to help you with your problem , " Michelle says .
" They want to talk about the tattoos and everything , but we also talk about the danger of this addiction .
Of course , they have n't aired either one of those episodes , and since shooting them , I have n't heard a thing from a producer of either show .
But we 're doing this to find a way to get me better . "
Maybe Oprah will come through .
Michelle and Dennis say they 've taken a call from a producer representing the queen of talk television , and she 's interested in Michelle 's story .
From Ricki Lake to Oprah Winfrey , that Michelle Ormond sure gets around .
WHITE PLAINS , New York ( Reuters ) - Reversing years of denials , U.S. track superstar Marion Jones pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to federal investigators and admitted using steroids , which could cost her the five medals she won in the 2000 Olympics .
In a sober court hearing and a tear - filled appearance before reporters , Jones , 31 , admitted using performance - enhancing drugs .
“ It is with a great amount of shame that I stand before you and tell you that I have betrayed your trust , ” Jones told reporters outside court , addressing her fans and family .
“ I want you to know that I have been dishonest and you have the right to be angry with me , ” she said , breaking down in tears .
“ I have let my country down and I have let myself down . ”
The head of the U.S. Olympic Committee urged Jones to give back the medals she won at the Sydney Summer Olympics .
Jones told the court she swallowed tetrahydrogestrinone , or THG , also known as “ the clear , ” which she said had been given to her by her former coach Trevor Graham .
“ I consumed the substance several times before the Sydney Games , ” Jones told U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains , just north of New York City .
“ He ( Graham ) told me to put it under my tongue and to swallow it . ”
She pleaded guilty to two felonies -- lying to federal investigators about her steroid use and lying to them about a separate check fraud case .
Jones faces up to six months in jail under a plea agreement with prosecutors .
She was released on bail , surrendered her passport , and will be sentenced on January 11 .
She later told reporters she was retiring from track and field , ending a spectacular career in which she became the first woman to win five medals at a single Olympics .
She captured the gold in the 100 meters , 200 meters and 4x400 - metre relay , and won the bronze in the long jump and 4x100 - metre relay at the 2000 Sydney Games .
USOC Chairman Peter Ueberroth said , “ Ms. Jones has cheated her sport , her teammates , her competitors , her country and herself .
“ She now has an opportunity to make a very different choice by returning her Olympic medals , and in so doing , properly acknowledge the efforts of the vast majority of athletes who choose to compete clean . ”

The chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency , Dick Pound , said he expected the IOC to move quickly and strip Jones of her medals .
Jones is already under investigation by the International Olympic Committee for suspicion of using steroids .
IOC President Jacques Rogge called it “ a sad day for sport . ”

BALCO SCANDAL
Jones became the first athlete convicted in connection with the probe into the San Francisco - area laboratory BALCO , the center of a doping scandal that has tarnished the reputations of leading athletes in baseball , American football and athletics .
In 2004 , she told reporters she had “ never , never ” used performance - enhancing drugs and that “ I have accomplished what I have accomplished because of my God - given abilities and hard work . ”
In court , she said Graham received “ the clear ” from BALCO head Victor Conte , one of five men previously convicted for their roles in distributing steroids , including the personal trainer of baseball superstar Barry Bonds .
Jones said she believed at first the substance was flaxseed oil and continued to use it until July 2001 , after which she said she realized she was unable to train as intensively and did not recover as quickly afterward .
By November 2003 , when interviewed by federal investigators , she knew she had taken THG , but when shown a sample by investigators she said she had never seen it before .
“ This was a lie , your honor , as I knew I had taken the substance , ” Jones told the judge .
Soon after Jones ’ dominating performance in Sydney , her reputation came into question as those around her were ensnared in steroids controversies .
Her then - husband C.J. Hunter , the 1999 world shot put champion , tested positive for steroids in 2000 .
Tim Montgomery , former world record holder in the 100 meters and father of one of Jones ’ children , was banned for two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after evidence showed he had taken THG .
Conte told Reuters that Jones was by no means the only one to blame for her fate .
“ Those who have made the majority of the money from Olympic as well as professional sport must also take responsibility for the drug culture that exists , ” Conte said .
Newsweek :
So consider these scenes from March 2004 , described by two former top Justice officials who , like other ex-officials interviewed by NEWSWEEK , did not wish to be identified discussing sensitive internal matters .
Attorney General John Ashcroft is really sick .
About to give a press conference in Virginia , he is stricken with pain so severe he has to lie down on the floor .
Taken to the hospital for an emergency gallbladder operation , he hallucinates under medication as he lies , near death , in intensive care .
On the night after his operation , he has two visitors : White House chief of staff Andrew Card and presidential counsel Alberto Gonzales .
As described in public testimony , they want Ashcroft to sign a document authorizing the government 's top - secret eavesdropping program to go on .
The attorney general , who thinks the program is illegal , refuses .
Back at the Justice Department , there is an equally extraordinary scene .
Appalled by the White House 's heavy - handed attempt to coerce the gravely ill attorney general , virtually the entire top leadership of the Justice Department is threatening to resign .
The group includes the director of the FBI , Robert Mueller , Associate Attorney General Robert McCallum and the chief of the Criminal Division , Chris Wray .
Some of them gather in the conference room of Deputy Attorney General James Comey , who describes Ashcroft 's bravely turning away the president 's men from his hospital bed .
The mood that night in the conference room was tense — and sober .
" This was a showdown , " says a former senior Justice Department official who was there .
" Everybody understood the choice they were making and the gravity of the situation .
Everybody knew what the stakes were . "
A different source estimated that as many as 30 top DOJ officials would have resigned .

Sports are a major part of today 's society and as you will see , advertising plays a big role in this , with creative ads everywhere from billboards to bags and parking garages .
Here are 10 Amazing Sports
Ads from recent advertising campaigns :
Starting with a common sport that millions of people around the world in participate in both competitively and for leisure .
1. Tennis Trampoline
This non traditional advertising was used in China to promote the Tennis Masters Cup in 2006 .
The racket was actually a trampoline with a man , dressed in neon yellow , bouncing up and down .
Can you see it ?
The " tennis racket " trampoline is " serving " the bouncing up and down man .
The " Tennis trampoline " reads " The fastest server generates over 560 Newtons .
Enough force to propel a human skywards .
Experience the best tennis at the Tennis Masters Cup 2006 . "

2. Running - You are faster than you think
This Nike ad , part of the You 're Faster Than You Think campaign , displays a large cut out of Canadian hurdler Perdita Felicien hurdling over the actual billboard .
3. Running -
You are faster than you think
Also in Canada , making his way through this bus stop is distance runner Bernard Lagat in this Nike ad .
For this series of ads , Nike used simple window stickers to make it appear as though Lagat was literally hauling through the bus stops .
Same campaign , same runner , overall same idea , but thru buildings .

A sport loved globally , soccer ( or football in some parts of the world ) also uses alternative advertising mediums to promote the sport .
3. Soccer - Nike Stadium Shoe Box
Nike wrapped actual soccer cleat boxes to look like a soccer stadium .

4. Urinal Soccer
Never under estimate the power of advertising in the urinal .
This ad for ESPN gave those oh so talented men a chance to " play " while promoting ESPN Brazil in the bathroom at local bars and restaurants .

Even nontraditional sports have made their way into advertising .
Moving on from the advertising of tennis , running and soccer and switching to very nontraditional sports ( but none the less , still athletic hobby ) jump roping , dancing and weightlifting .
5. Jump roping ... never out of style
What do you think of this bag advertising ?
Over the last few years we have seen much use of bag advertising , but very few that use the string handles as part of the ad , let alone the main focus .

6 . Weight lifting ... the strongest of all
This 3D Chinese billboard shows a man hanging from what appears to be a very heavy weight lifting challenge .

7. Dance -
Who said dancing was n't a sport ?
People around the world take dance classes to lose weight , get in shape and even compete .
This following advertising was used in parking garages throughout Germany to promote upcoming dance classes .
Source : Ads of the World
There is also advertising for sports who have recently gained worldwide popularity including tennis and cycling .
8. Cycling - Love your bike .
This outdoor campaign was seen around the United Kingdom in order to promote cycling as exercise and hobby and directed you to loveyourbike.com for more info .
Besides the main purposes , mentioned above , there were other purposes for the ads as the Fast Lane / Fat Lane campaign copy reads :
Burn calories , save cash , get there on time .
Source : Eye on Manchester
Even those with nothing to do with sports use sports to promote their product / organization / idea .
This advertising " referee , " for example , is advertising Monster.com job site and the idea of looking for a new job .
10 . Monster.com
The " Tired of Your Job ? " campaign from Monster.com placed people dressed as those who do n't always have desirable jobs on street corners to pass out advertising for Monster.com .

I blog for a variety of reasons .
To practice my writing and communications skills .
To vent frustration in a safe place .
For public intellectual exhibitionism .
Today I blog to remember something I had forgotten .
A design pattern , generally speaking , is a common pattern that we use to solve a problem .
Unfortunately that observation has been reduced by most programmers I know into an exercise in name calling –and like the practice in high school of teaching history as a dry list of dates and event names , has a way of turning a wonderful observation as to how problems can be solved using common themes into mindless recital .
( The next time someone tells me “ why did n’t you use a fubar pattern here ? ” I ’m going to smack them . )
Design patterns , however , are not just a dry list of names and UML class diagrams , just as history is not a dry list of dates and event names .
And some design patterns from yesterday are nearly forgotten–at least I had nearly forgotten them –which as far as I ’m concerned is the same thing .
All this came about because I was reading the paper Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast .
Because I ’ve spent the past couple of months locked in meetings and other brain - scrambling exercises , I figured it would be good to exercise that most important muscle , the brain , on an interesting problem : writing my own regular expression matcher engine in Java , and do it without looking at the code in the paper .
( Yes , I know : I can just use java.util.regex , or compile the code in the paper–but the point here was not to mindlessly go “ oook ! regular expression ! ” like a brainless monkey .
The idea here was to engage in a mental exercise .
Do you think Sudoku puzzles are pulled out of thin air without first computing a solution then working backwards to create the puzzle ? )
The first design pattern comes about in the discussion of the Regular Expression paper ; this is the State Machine .
While I ’ve linked the Wikipedia paper , the key thing to remember is that a state machine consists of a set of states S and a set of actions A , such that each state {s 1 } triggers action a 1 and transitions to a new state s 2 depending on the action ’s outcome .
Typically states are represented as an integer , and your state machine code often looks like :
int state = 1 ; boolean done = false ; while ( ! done ) { switch ( state ) { case 1 : state = doAction1 ( ) ; break ; case 2 : state = doAction2 ( ) ; break ; ... } }
What ’s great about state machines is twofold : first , it helps break a computational problem into small chunks of code .
This can be useful if you need to write code that fits into a small footprint ( like an embedded processor you ’d find in a remote control or a watch or calculator ) , and is especially useful in this context if you are emulating a multi - threaded process in an environment where you do n’t have a multi- tasking operating system to rely upon .
( I once built a print spool server that ran on a 6809 embedded processor without any operating system by building the entire network stack as a sequence of states in a state machine .
I could then monitor up to 8 separate incoming network connections at the same time simply by having my program walk through 8 separate chunks of memory which held the state for each incoming connection and running the state machine in each : update state in slot 1 , then update state in lot 2 , then… , then update state in slot 8 , then repeat with slot 1 , etc. )
The second thing that is great about state machines is that it allows you to represent a dynamic program which is built from some input string ( such as a language specification in BNF form or a regular expression parser ) ; in this case , each state is not an integer in a switch statement , but an object in a linked list of objects .
It ’s great ; rather than hard - code how your program works , you load the string , build the state machine , and your execution code simply works the state machine until it ’s done .
The second design pattern that came about when creating the regular expression parser–and I ’m kicking myself because it took me four hours to notice this last night ( because of the brain - scrambling effects of managerial meetings ) is the shunting yard algorithm , which is used to convert a statement in infix notation into a parse tree which can then be turned into a state machine or solved or turned into assembly language code .
Typically the shunting yard algorithm is used to solve algebraic equations in infix notation , so we can convert the string “ 34 + 4 * 5 – ( - 3 + 4 ) * 8 ” into a parse tree ( shown here in LISP style notation ) (- (+ 34 (* 4 5 ) ) ( * (+ (- 3 ) 4 ) 8 ) ) , which can eventually be solved :
(- (+ 34 (* 4 5 ) ) (* (+ (- 3 ) 4 ) 8 ) ) => (- (+ 34 20 ) ( * (+ - 3 4 ) 8 ) ) => (- 54 (* 1 8 ) ) => (- 54 8 ) => 46
The nice thing about the shunting yard algorithm is that it works for any string which uses a series of prefix , postfix and infix operators : we could use it to solve , for example , - ( 1+2 ) + 3 ! , where the first minus sign is a negation operator , and the “ ! ” is a factorial operator .
The algorithm itself is rather simple : you need an operator stack ( a push / pop stack which stores the operators you ’re using , such as ‘+’ , ‘*’ , etc ) , and an ‘ eval ’ stack , which can be as simple as a push / pop stack of numbers or a stack of parse trees or whatever intermediate representation you ’re using to store the equation .
Then it ’s just a matter of reading the string as a series of tokens : each value is pushed onto the eval stack ( popping prefix operators as needed after the push , updating the eval stack as needed ) , and each operator is pushed onto the stack , popping and evaluating operators that are of lower precedence .
The details are in the Wikipedia article linked above .
What took me four hours to remember–and why I ’m upset at myself today–is that this algorithm is not just good for solving math equations , but is useful for any sort of notation which is expressed as a series of prefix , infix and postfix operators .
Such as regular expressions .
When you get right down to it , a regular expression is a series of values ( letters or characters you ’re matching against ) , with a series of implicit and explicit operators .
‘ Concatenation ’ is an implicit operator here .
Using # to represent the concatenation operator , it ’s easy to see that / ABC / ( which matches the substring “ ABC ” in DABCDEF ) can be represented as ‘ A ’ ( i.e. “ match letter ‘ A ' ” ) # ‘ B’ # ‘ C ’ .
The ‘ |’ ( or ‘ or ’ operator ) , which for the expression / ABC|DEF / matches either “ ABC ” or “ DEF ” , is an explicit infix operator : the regular expression / ABC|DEF / can be represented by the parse tree ( in LISP notation ) : ( | ( # A B C ) ( # D E F ) ) .
And the ‘*’ ( match 0 or more ) , ‘+’ ( match 1 or more ) and ‘?’ ( match 0 or 1 ) are all postfix operators with higher precedence than the concatenation operator : ABC * matches the string ABCCCCCCCC or AB and all in between .
The point is that all of this ( including the ‘ [… ] ’ character group , which is simply a single value object matching multiple letters , and the ‘(… ) ’ , which operates in the same way as the parenthesis in an algebraic statement ) can all be parsed using the shunting yard algorithm .
As an aside , what ’s really spifilicious about the regular expression algorithm in the paper is the observation that a state does n’t have to be a single integer value , but can actually be an array of values , with each value representing a specific action to carry out–and a single action can spawn two or more values representing two or more actions to carry out at the same time .
For example if you have a regular expression ‘ a*a ’ , essentially meaning “ match 0 or more ‘ a ’ characters , followed by a single ‘ a ’ character , and you ’re matching against “ aaa ” , then is the second ‘ a ’ in that string part of the ‘ a * ’ ( match 0 or more ‘ a ’ characters ) , or part of the terminal ‘ a’ ( match a single ‘ a ’ ) character ?
In the case of the algorithm outlined in the regular expression paper at the top of this article , the answer can be ‘ both ! ’
In other words , you can maintain a state which is an array of vectors , and if we represent our regular expression ‘ a * a ’ with ‘ a * ’ as 1 , ‘ a ’ as 2 , and ‘ done ’ as 3 , we could have our state go from { 1} ( read first ‘ a ’ ) to { 1,2} ( read second ‘ a ’ ) to { 1,3,2} ( read third ‘ a ’ ) to { 1,3,3,2} ( read end of string ) to { 3,3,3} : that is , we can simultaneously be doing multiple things at once .
This , by the way , is the point of the paper : by maintaining multiple “ states ” at once , or rather , by representing our current match state as a vector rather than backtracking ( that is , rewinding the matcher back so we can try an alternate matching strategy ) , we can solve degenerate matching cases without having the program grind to a halt .
I ’m blogging this so I can remember .
And what I want to remember is this : that the shunting yard algorithm and the state machine are cornerstone design patterns nearly a half century old .
For a regular expression , they both can be brought to bare on the problem : the shunting yard algorithm can be used to build a parse tree from a regular expression , and the parse tree can then be used to build an optimal state machine for matching strings against the regular expression .
And more importantly , they are two forgotten tools in a very old toolbox which are a hell of a lot more powerful than the ‘ singleton design pattern ’ , which , to be honest , barely deserves to be named outside of the halls where computer scientists engage in taxonomy for the purpose of obtaining tenure .

Facebook Federal regulators appear set to crack down on cable companies that sign exclusive deals with apartment and condominium buildings , denying residents the fruits of emerging pay - TV competition .
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin is recommending prohibiting such future agreements and preventing enforcement of exclusivity clauses in existing contracts , three FCC officials say .
They requested anonymity because the agency 's five commissioners have not yet voted on the proposal .
While the details could change before the vote , most commissioners have backed opening the multifamily housing market to more video competition .
Martin believes apartment dwellers deserve the same benefits of new cable choices as those in houses , officials say .
Phone companies have started to compete with cable providers across large swaths of the USA by selling packages of pay - TV , broadband and phone services .
To block competition , phone companies contend , cable companies increasingly sew up exclusive deals with apartment building owners and condo boards that bar rivals from offering video service to residents .
Some agreements last 10 years or more .
Noting that up to a third of U.S. residents live in multifamily dwellings , the United States Telecom Association said in an FCC filing that the agreements deny competition to " a significant percentage of consumers . "
" If you 're going to serve a city like New York and you can't get into apartment buildings , you 're pretty much going to be out of luck , " says Verizon ( VZ ) spokesman Eric Rabe .
SureWest Communications ( SURW ) told the FCC that half the 40,000 units it could serve in Northern California are locked into such deals .
Verizon says at least 42 % of the multifamily units it surveyed in Tampa are bound by the contracts .
AT&T and Verizon say cable companies often insist on the deals just as phone companies are poised to enter a market with pay - TV offerings .
But No. 1 cable provider Comcast ( CMCSA ) told the FCC the set - ups bring consumers benefits , such as discount prices .
They are largely designed to ensure a cable company can recoup its costs to run wires through a building , it says .
A building owner often gets a share of revenue in exchange for the restricted access .
The National Cable & Telecommunications Association says the FCC lacks authority to repeal exclusivity clauses in existing contracts .
It says a ban on future exclusive deals should extend to phone - company entrants , but Martin 's proposal would apply only to the dominant cable companies .
It relies on a 1992 federal law that bars cable providers from competing unfairly .
The FCC has been promoting pay - TV competition .
A 2006 FCC report found cable rates are 17 % lower where cable and wire - line companies compete .
Last year , the FCC passed rules allowing phone companies to more easily obtain local video franchises .

TheGardenLady received this question from P. S :
A friend is watering roses ( I ’m sorry , but I do n’t know the variety ) several
times a week , for several hours at a time , with the hose on full blast , so that
a swamp forms around the rose bushes .
The soil is heavy adobe clay , and we have been having mostly moderate summer weather , temperatures in the eighties .
Is this watering necessary or even helpful for the roses ?
Please let me know if any further information is needed .
Thanks for your help .
Most rose plants are demanding plants .
Roses are high water use plants .
They do like and need good watering but not too much water .
Too much water can stress any plant .
Keep roses too dry and they fail to thrive ; if they are too wet they may succumb to root damage or disease .
Keeping soils too wet will also deprive a plant ’s roots of needed oxygen .
A plant ’s root system needs moisture , nutrients , and air in order to carry out respiration .
Oxygen is required for respiration .
Without adequate air space in the soil , roots will soon deplete the soil of oxygen , carbon dioxide builds up , and this combination will slow down respiration .
When respiration slows , other plant processes slow as well , including the plant ’s ability to transport water .
So wilting may occur .
The well - meaning gardener may apply too much water thinking that the plant is parched when it really is overwatered .
One wants to avoid standing water around the base of the plants .
When plants are under stress such as during flooding , they often release hormones that alter plant growth .
One such hormone is ethylene .
An over watered or flooded root system will trigger the plant to release ethylene that then causes the foliage to droop and eventually fall off if the stress is not removed .
This drooping of foliage is called epinasty and sometimes looks like the plant is not getting enough water .
Actually the culprit is too much water .
Roses like to have the soil slowly watered until the soil is soaked to a depth of 12 to 18 inches .
Roses love well drained , fertile , loamy soil at least 2 feet deep , not heavy adobe clay .
Loam is light and when squeezed the soil should crumble .
The best soil drains freely .
Soil should take 15 minutes to drain , longer than that and work should be done to improve the drainage .
If it takes less than 15 minutes , one needs to add more organic matter to increase water retention .
Usually this 15 minute test is done prior to planting the rose – when the hole was dug and was empty .
Then it would have been easiest to amend the soil .
The problem of not having good drainage is especially severe in compacted soils where the natural air spaces present in the soil have collapsed .
Heavy clay soils are particularly prone to compaction .
Once planted , keep roses mulched with 2 - 3 inches of an organic material .
Mulch keeps the soil moist , helps reduce compaction thus improving drainage and continually adds nutrients to the soil .
Roses do n’t like their roots disturbed , so be very careful if you dig around the roots when adding the mulch .
And the next time you see a wilting plant , check the soil to see if it is really dry before watering .
Roses are prone to diseases and damaging insects .
Getting the foliage wet is not good for roses .
Too much water splashing onto the foliage can spread diseases or encourage insects that harm the rose .
One disease is called black spot .
Black spot makes the rose leaves ugly .
The leaves turn yellow with black spots .
To prevent an insect called the rose sawfly , Arge ochropa , avoid excessive watering .
The easiest way to get the moisture needed for the rose without soaking the foliage is to use soaker hoses or soil level and drip irrigation .
After watering use a device for testing how much water is getting into the soil .
A great site that discusses watering devices and how to test how deep the soil has been watered is this .
As I began the column , I reiterate and end by saying that roses are one of the more demanding plants to grow .
The GardenLady suggests that anyone who is serious about raising roses should join the American Rose Society where one can learn the best techniques for growing roses in your area .

It 's common knowledge that a security system is only as effective as its weakest point .
You can install a reinforced steel door with a two - phase palm - print / retinal - scan entry to protect your home , but if you leave a first - floor window open , you 're more vulnerable than your neighbor with a simple deadbolt .
One of Nate 's clients learned this lesson first hand with its e-commerce Web site .
The operation did n't involve terribly sensitive data : there were no bank accounts , no Social Security numbers , nor even any credit card numbers .
Pre -approved customers would simply sign in and place their orders .
Accounts payable and fulfillment would take it from there .
Yet the Web site painted a different picture , featuring two - factor authentication , encrypted databases and a giant padlock graphic advertising " secure . "
Before Nate 's team arrived , hacking the Web site proved to be about as difficult as entering a house through an open , ground - floor window .
The original developers managed to implement virtually every type of vulnerability :
Query String Replacement .
Users could ( and did ) fiddle with the URL in the address bar ( for example , changing " /viewOrder.asp?OrderNumber= 80023 " to " /viewOrder.asp?OrderNumber= 80024 " ) to view other customer 's data .
SQL Injection .
By using single - quote characters , attackers were able to easily " inject " SQL code .
For example , typing " ' OR '' = ' " in the Password textbox would result in a query that asked for users " WHERE Password = ' ' OR '' = '' . "
Because an empty string ( '' ) is always equal to itself , this would always return a user .
Trusting the Browser .
Instead of using server - side code to disable and hide unauthorized navigation links , CSS and JavaScript were used .
A quick " View Source " or even a line or two of JavaScript type in the address bar could ( and did ) easily bypass the protection .
Every time the Web site was hacked , the original developers insisted it was an infrastructure problem .
They had the company buy a secure certificate .
Then they added a separate database server .
Then they installed a firewall to put between the servers .
Then an intrusion detection server .
And so on .
Still , hackers waltzed right in .
Eventually , the company decided that enough was enough and hired Nate and his team to remediate the problems .
But his hands were tied as the client insisted on dictating security requirements .
And dictate they did :
All data must be encrypted twice : first through Rijndael / AES and then through RSA - 512
Decryption / encryption keys must change daily and then be stored ( after being encrypted ) in a database
Passwords must contain three uppercase letters , three lowercase letters , one number , and one special character , and must be stored ( after being encrypted ) in a " Hardware Vault , " which only the production server could access
No words of any known language shall be used for database table or column names
Try as he might , Nate was unable to convince his client that such requirements provided only the illusion of security .
Encryption is meaningless when the application dutifully jumps through all the decryption hoops and displays it to unauthorized users .
And obfuscating column names only makes it slightly less convenient for a dedicated hacker ; could a column filled with " someone@somewhere.com " be anything but e-mail addresses ?
Nate , however , was able to break the tasks into two separate phases with the hope that the second one would never come .
The first phase involved patching up the actual vulnerabilities ( a task he had to fight for ) and implementing the least - absurd security requirements from the customer .
The second phase involved implementing the most ridiculous mandates , such as the rotating encryption keys .
It 's been a solid year and a half since Phase One was deployed , and there has n't been a single break - in .
Nate says that Phase Two is still technically " planned , but not a priority . "
In the meantime , developers have learned to deal with the " obfuscated " database naming convention : SELECT emaNtsriF , emaNtsaL , sserddA , ytiC , etatS , rebmuNenohP ... FROM sremotsuC .

Bush and Cheney are steering the U.S. into a collapse .
Only strong public voices by influential people can prevent the coming disaster .
We desperately need for men and women who are known to the public and have credibility to speak up in the critical period ahead to avoid catastrophe .
A few weeks ago , Israel bombed a alleged nuclear facility in Syria .
This is a warm - up for an attack on Iran .
In the last few days , the U.S. unilaterally tightened sanctions on Iran .
Russia and China do not support this move .
A week ago Bush warned Iran that its attainment of nuclear arms would lead to World War III .
Russia , which has been assisting Iran in its nuclear construction program for decades , regards Western military action against Iran as unacceptable .
China has been arming Iran with missiles .
Its relations with Iran have been improving for years .
We know that Bush and Cheney are capable of pre-emptive attack .
We know that Bush will act if he believes he is right no matter what the costs are .
In his distorted worldview , Iran with nuclear weapons is a scenario worth any cost to avoid .
We know that Bush , Cheney , and Rice have repeatedly warned Iran of meaningful consequences if Iran arms itself with nuclear weapons .
We know that their terms in office end in 15 months .
These are the critical months .
But it is by no means clear that the front - running candidates for office who may replace them hold substantially different views .
Hillary Clinton has publicly called for sanctions against Iran and has called Iran a threat to Israel .
Why may an unprovoked attack on Iran lead to WWIII and why may it lead to the collapse of the U.S. ?
Imagine this scenario .
The U.S. encourages Israel to bomb the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran .
Russia attempts to restrain an Iranian response but fails .
Iran responds in any of many ways , such as launching missiles on Israel , firing on shipping in the Straits of Hormuz , mining the Straits of Hormuz , sending troops into Iraq , or allying its military with Hezbollah and attacking Israel from Lebanon .
The U.S. , citing Iran ’s aggressions ( that will be the story ) , launches a full - scale attack on Iran designed to devastate the country .
This attack has actually been planned by the U.S. for years .
Syria is unable to maintain neutrality and quickly becomes a battleground between Iran and Israel .
The price of oil by this point has already soared to $ 200 a barrel .
The U.S. begins to use its strategic reserve and to divert Iraqi production .
Russia responds by taking steps to prevent its oil production from reaching the U.S. China responds by cutting off its support of the U.S. Treasury market .
Venezuela halts oil shipments to the U.S.
The first stages of WWIII are economic warfare designed to cripple the U.S. and halt its war - making capacity .
The U.S. , unable to finance its deficits and fund its sovereign debt , is forced into raising interest rates drastically in order to borrow .
The Fed is forced to print money .
An inflationary spiral occurs .
Meanwhile the high interest rates and high oil prices , not to mention the shock of a spreading conflict , drive the U.S. economy into severe decline .
The U.S. attempts to raise taxes in order to fund itself , further crippling the economy .
Gold soars to $ 1,500 — $ 2,000 an ounce .
The U.S. attempts to bolster its military forces .
The draft is reinstated .
The severity of the emergency allows Bush and Cheney to assume emergency powers and begin a dictatorship .
Elections are postponed .
The U.S. collapses .
Unfortunately , even if this scenario does not occur , the position of the U.S. is so precarious that any number of other scenarios equally disastrous lie in wait .
This house needs urgently to be put in order or it will fall , and especially if it does not terminate its imperial adventures .
The very fact that Bush and Cheney ( or any major U.S. political officials ) gain by starting WWIII is a terrible indictment of our entire political system .
Who can stop this ?
Who can prevent this ?
It will only take a few well - placed people to prevent this catastrophe .
My guess is 5 — 20 people could sway public opinion against war or provide enough cover for Congressional dissenters to screw up their courage .
Maybe even as few as 3 or 4 influential people could derail the Bush - Cheney train to disaster .
They need to speak out at the right times and they must be heard .
Previously mute or muted voices simply must speak out .
They know who they are .
They know that their silence will mean silent approval of a U.S. collapse .

By putting on a virtual reality mask , holding a stylus in one hand and a tracking device in the other , an artist can draw 3D objects in the air with unprecedented precision .
This new system is called “ Drawing on Air , ” and researchers have designed the interface to be intuitive and provide the necessary control for artists to illustrate complicated artistic , scientific , and medical subjects .
Computer scientists Daniel Keefe ( who ’s also an artist ) , Robert Zeleznik , and David Laidlaw from Brown University have presented Drawing on Air in a recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics .
The technique introduces two new strategies , using one hand or two hands , to give artists the tools they need for drawing different types of curves , and for viewing and editing their work .
While other drawing techniques that use virtual reality allow artists to draw rough sketches , the researchers hope that Drawing on Air will take the technology to a new level with its ability to achieve a higher degree of control .
“ First , think about a curve found in some interesting 3D shape — the handlebar of a road bike is a good example because it follows a smooth 3D curve , ” Keefe explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ Ok , now take your index finger and try to trace that curve out in the air in front of you .
If you were able to leave a trail of paint behind your finger as it moves through the air , what you would notice from this exercise is that drawing a nice shape is really hard to do .
First , you would probably notice that your drawing is quite wobbly .
Second , you would probably find that the 3D proportion of the form is off . ”
Keefe explained how Drawing on Air uses drawing guidelines , force feedback , and two - handed interaction to help artists draw this type of curve more precisely .
The system then transfers the 3D drawing into the computer for use in 3D modeling , design , and illustration programs .
Drawing on Air ’s two - handed method is based on the “ tape drawing ” technique , which is a highly controlled , two - handed method for drawing in 2D .
Artists hold a stylus in one hand for drawing and a tracker ( hooked up to the virtual reality setup ) in the other hand for defining the direction of the line .
The artist coordinates the movement of both hands to examine the work from different angles and draw accordingly .
While the two - handed method provides more control for experts , the researchers explain that a one - handed method is easier to learn , and is also more appropriate for drawing circular shapes because the artist ’s arms do n’t need to cross .
In the one - hand method , the artist defines the direction of the line and draws the line with the same hand .
The researchers describe the drawing operation as a pen being dragged behind the artist ’s stylus as if on a tow rope .
This drag enables the user to establish a drawing direction before actually drawing .
In both versions , artists can stylize their curves while drawing by dynamically adjusting line thickness and color .
Haptic effects enable artists to intuitively adjust line thickness by applying pressure against an imaginary 3D surface , making drawing in the air feel similar to pushing a paintbrush against paper .
Artists can easily switch back and forth between the two variations , and can also edit their work with the system ’s features .
In a trial with 12 trained artists , results showed that Drawing on Air was easy to learn and provided sufficient control to illustrate complex 3D subjects with variety .
For example , biologists studying bat flight find accurate 3D illustrations very valuable , since bats have a flexible wing membrane and curved bones that actually bend during flight .
Artists in the trial successfully drew bats based on data from a bat flying in a wind tunnel , revealing the details of the animal ’s anatomy in motion , and simplifying the uninteresting parts of the body .
“ If we can boost the precision with which scientists can interact with their 3D data using a computer , then many more scientific uses for virtual reality technology may become possible , ” Keefe said .
He said that another exciting part of this technology is that “ once you have this ability to sketch in the air , there are so many different artistic directions you can go with it . ”
“ We 're not too far from this sort of thing being available to consumers , ” he added .
“ Right now , the cost is prohibitive , but with the advent of technologies like camera - based 3D tracking , I would expect the cost to create two - handed input systems like this to come down from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars in the next few years . ”

π- calculus 超入門
π- calculus は、80 年代の終わりごろに Milner らによって提案された並行計算のモデルの一つです。そこでは、プロセスと呼ばれる複数の独立した主体が、通信チャネルと呼ばれるデータの通り道を介して値をやりとりしながら、計算を行っていきます。π-calculus にはいろいろな変種があるのですが、ここではとりあえず次のような構成要素からなるものを考えましょう。
new x .
P 新しいチャネル x を作ってから、プロセス P を実行する ( channel creation ) x![v 1 , ... , v n ] チャネル x に値 v 1 , ... , v n を送る ( asynchronous output ) x?[v 1 , ... , v n ] .
P チャネル x から値 v 1 , ... , v n を受け取っ て 、P を実行する ( input guard ) P | Q プロセス P とプロセス Q を並行して実行する ( parallel composition )
たとえば
x ![ 123 ] | ( x ? [ v ] . result ![ v ] )
result ! [ 123 ]
π-calculus では、チャネル自体を値として送受信することもできます。たとえば、
( new c . ( x ! [ c ] | ( c ? [ v ] . print ![ v ] ) ) ) | ( x ? [ d ] . d! [ " abc " ] )
( c? [ v ] . print ![v ] ) | c ! [ " abc " ]
print ![ " abc " ]
π - calculus の最大の特徴は、この 「 チャネル自体も値としてやりとりできる」という点にあります。この考え方をさらに押し進めていくと、実は整数や文字列などの値も、チャネルとその上での通信だけで表せてしまうことが知られています。つまり、λ-calculus
ですべてのものがλ式として表されているのと同様に、π-calculus
ではすべてのものをプロセスで表す（encode する）ことができるのです。
たとえば bool 値をプロセスで表してみるとどうなるでしょうか。データ型としての bool は、 「 true 」 と「 false」の二つの定数で構成されます。そこで「true」をあらわすプロセスとしては、二つのチャネル t , f を受け取り、t のほうに空の値を送信す る
true ?[t , f ] . t! [ ]
false ?[t , f ] . f ! [ ]
new t . new f . ( x![t , f ] | ( t ? [ ] .
P ) | ( f ? [ ] . Q ) )
ただし、このままだとちょっとまずいことが起きます。上のように true や false を定義しても、これらは一回値が来ると消えてなくなってしまいますから、何回も使うためにはそれだけの数のプロセスを用意しておかないといけません。これでは使われる回数があらかじめわからない場合困ってしまいます。そのため、一般的な π-calculus には、replication と呼ばれる無限個の複製を作る operator が存在します 。
!P P | P | P | P | P | ... のように無限個の P が並行して存在する ( replication )
記号が output と同じ !
なのでちょっと紛らわしいのですが、replication を使えば、先の true と false も
!( true ? [t , f ] . t! [ ] ) | !( false ?[t , f ] . f ! [ ] )
!( fact ? [n , r ] . ( if n=0 then r! [ 1 ] else ( new c . ( fact ! [ n - 1 , c ] | ( c ? [ x ] . r! [n * x ] ) ) ) ) )
!( fib ? [n , r ] . ( if n < 2 then r![ 1 ] else ( new c . new d . ( fib ! [ n - 1 , c ] | fib ! [ n - 2 , d ] | ( c ? [ x ] . d?[y ] . r![x+y ] ) ) ) ) )
もちろん = や + などの整数演算は、また別に定義しておかないといけません。余裕のある人は自分で考えてみると良い練習になると思います（実は
λ- calculus 全体が π-calculus の上で自然に encode できるので、bool や int が表せるのは当たり前なのですが） 。

BBC News , Melbourne
Alex Kurzem came to Australia in 1949 carrying just a small brown briefcase , but weighed down by some harrowing psychological and emotional baggage .
Tucked away in his briefcase were the secrets of his past - fragments of his life that he kept hidden for decades .
Alex was forced to keep his Jewish identity hidden
In 1997 , after raising a family in Melbourne with his Australian bride , he finally revealed himself .
He told how , at the age of five , he had been adopted by the SS and became a Nazi mascot .
His personal history , one of the most remarkable stories to emerge from World War II , was published recently in a book entitled The Mascot .
" They gave me a uniform , a little gun and little pistol , " Alex told the BBC .
" They gave me little jobs to do - to polish shoes , carry water or light a fire .
But my main job was to entertain the soldiers .
To make them feel a bit happier . "
Painful memories
In newsreels , he was paraded as ' the Reich 's youngest Nazi ' and he witnessed some unspeakable atrocities .
But his SS masters never discovered the most essential detail about his life : their little Nazi mascot was Jewish .
" They did n't know that I was a Jewish boy who had escaped a Nazi death squad .
They thought I was a Russian orphan . "
His story starts where his childhood memories begin - in a village in Belarus on 20 October 1941 , the day it was invaded by the German army .
When the shooting stopped I had no idea where to go so I went to live in the forests , because I could n't go back .
I was the only one left
" I remember the German army invading the village , lining up all the men in the city square and shooting them .
My mother told me that my father had been killed , and that we would all be killed . "
" I did n't want to die , so in the middle of the night I tried to escape .
I went to kiss my mother goodbye , and ran up into the hill overlooking the village until the morning came . "
That was the day his family was massacred - his mother , his brother , his sister .
" I was very traumatised .
I remember biting my hand so I could n't cry out loud , because if I did they would have seen me hiding in the forest .
I can't remember exactly what happened .
I think I must have passed out a few times .
It was terrible . "
False identity
" When the shooting stopped I had no idea where to go so I went to live in the forests , because I could n't go back .
I was the only one left .
I must have been five or six . "
" I went into the forest but no - one wanted me .
I knocked on peoples ' doors and they gave me bits of bread but they told me to move on .
Nobody took me in . "
He survived by scavenging clothes from the bodies of dead soldiers .
After about nine months in the forest , a local man handed him over to the Latvian police brigade , which later became incorporated in the Nazi SS .
That very day , people were being lined up for execution , and Alex thought he , too , was about to die .
" There was a soldier near me and I said , ' Before you kill me , can you give me a bit of bread ? '
He looked at me , and took me around the back of the school .
He examined me and saw that I was Jewish .
" No good , no good , " he said .
' Look I do n't want to kill , but I can't leave you here because you will perish .
" 'I 'll take you with me , give you a new name and tell the other soldiers that you are a Russian orphan . ' "
Joining the circus
To this day , Alex Kurzem has no idea why Sergeant Jekabs Kulis took pity on him .
Whatever his motives , it certainly helped that Alex had Aryan looks .
And together , they kept the secret .
" Every moment I had to remind myself not to let my guard down , because if ever anyone found out , I was dead .
I was scared of the Russians shooting me and the Germans discovering I was Jewish .
I had no - one to turn to . "
Alex Kurzem kept the secret from his wife and family for decades
Young Alex saw action on the Russian front , and was even used by the SS to lure Jewish people to their deaths .
Outside the cattle trains which carried victims to the concentration camps , he handed out chocolate bars to tempt them in .
Then , in 1944 , with the Nazis facing almost certain defeat , the commander of the SS unit sent him to live with a Latvian family .
Five years later , he managed to reach Australia .
For a time , he worked in a circus and eventually became a television repair man in Melbourne .
All the time , he kept his past life to himself , not even telling his Australian wife , Patricia .
" When I left Europe I said ' forget about your past .
You are going to a new country and a new life .
Switch off and do n't even think about it .'
" I managed to do it .
I told people I lost my parents in the war , but I did n't go into detail .
I kept the secret and never told anyone . "
It was not until 1997 that he finally told his family , and along with his son , Mark , set about discovering more about his past life .
After visiting the village where he was born , they found out his real name was Ilya Galperin , and even uncovered a film in a Latvian archive of Alex in full SS regalia .
Arctic sea ice is melting at a significantly faster rate than projected by even the most advanced computer models , a new study concludes .
" While the ice is disappearing faster than the computer models indicate , both observations and the models point in the same direction :
The Arctic is losing ice at an increasingly rapid pace and the impact of greenhouse gases is growing , " said study team member Marika Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
Holland and her colleagues compared model simulation of past climate with observations by satellites and found that the models simulated a loss in September ice cover of 2.5 percent per decade from 1953 to 2006 .
( September marks the yearly minimum in Arctic ice cover . )
While the highest rate of decline in any of the models was 5.4 percent per decade , satellite measurements , which are considered more reliable , showed that September ice actually declined at a rate of about 7.8 percent per decade during the same period .
" This suggests that current model projections may in fact provide a conservative estimate of future Arctic change , and that the summer Arctic sea ice may disappear considerably earlier than IPCC [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ] projections , " said study team member Julienne Stroeve of the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
The shrinking ice may actually be about 30 years ahead of model predictions , meaning the Arctic could be ice free in the summer earlier than the IPCC ’s predicted timeframe of 2050 - 2100 .
In which Anne Neville agrees to believe pretty much anything anyone ever tells her , ever , and Richard discovers people are gullible idiots .
Go back and read Part I. Hurry .
Let 's review the idea of sequential binding .
A drug with affinity for multiple receptors does n't bind to all of them simultaneously , but rather sequentially , like an aging polygamist , starting with the system for which it has the greatest affinity .
Eventually , this maxes out , and it goes and adds the receptor system for which it has the second greatest affinity .
Once it has maxed out a receptor system , pushing the dose does n't get you any more of that effect ( or side effects . )
You do n't get less , but you do n't get any more .
You know what else is like that , sort of ?
Chlamydia .
Let 's look at an SSRI , Celexa .
That first S stands for selective ( serotonin reuptake inhibitor . )
All of its clinical effect is coming from one single receptor system ; this rum fountain has only one level -- and it's not that deep .
By about 20 mg , you 've gotten as much serotonin effect as you are going to ever get .
Certainly , by 40 mg , you 're all done .
Do you expect the clinical difference from 10 mg to 20 mg to be significant ?
Maybe .
How about 20 mg to 40 mg ?
Not so much .
40 mg to 60 mg ?
You woke me up for this ?
Do n't touch me .
In other words , there 's only one level in Celexa 's rum fountain , and it 's pretty much filled by 40mg .
Pushing it to 60mg ( " Now , with 50 % more citalopram ! " ) gets you a whole 3 % more serotonin transporter binding .
Which is embarrassing .
I said do n't touch me .
Do it again and I 'm calling an adult .
So what about Effexor , the serotonin / norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , invented at Wyeth Labs by Kirsten Dunst , aka Vitamin C ?
From the American Journal of Psychiatry study :
la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la
la , la , la , la , la , la
yeah , yeah , yeah ,
la , la , la , la , la , la , [ repeat x 36 ]
we will still be friends forever [ sic ]
Which is exactly the point .
You do n't get both S and N at all doses , it is , again , sequential : level 1 is S , maxed out by 75 mg ; and level 2 is N. Guess when level 2 ( N ) really kicks in ?
150mg .
So anything after 150 mg is really two systems at once , with the N increasing from there .
300 mg is the same amount of S as 150 mg , but the N is more .
Would you expect 75 mg Effexor to be generally more efficacious than 40mg Celexa ?
No , because they are both doing the same thing : blocking about 80 % of serotonin transporters .
But what about after 150 mg , when you have S and N ?
This is why Effexor studies only show superior efficacy at doses above 150 mg -- because at 150 mg , you start adding N on top of your already maxed out S .
It 's not adding more of the same drug , it is like adding a second drug .
It 's not more Effexor ; it 's taking a maxed out SSRI , and adding a NRI .
It 's like being with Princess Leia , but then adding Princess Ardala .
And if you understood that joke , you should put down Yars ' Revenge and kill yourself .
Let me be clear : I 'm not saying Effexor is or is not better than an SSRI .
I am saying that
it would be impossible for it to be better then SSRIs , across a population , at less than 150 mg .
if it is going to be better , it would be better after 150 mg , and only because you are adding a second system .
If you are a doctor who " went all the way " up to 75 mg Effexor for depression ( or 300 mg Seroquel for psychosis , etc , etc ) and then stopped it because " it was n't helping at all " then you should probably punch yourself in the testicles / uterus , you have missed the point .
How one responds at 75mg IS NOT AT ALL PREDICTIVE of what might happen at 150 or more ( or , for Seroquel and psychosis , 500 mg or more ) again , and for the last time , because higher doses are n't more , they are different . ( 2 )
You can see this most clearly if you look at an MRI :
which is self - explanatory . ( 3 )
What you may want to ask is this : why have n't you heard this stuff before ?
You think I discovered all this , in my basement lab , the one I use to create Jessica Simpson clones ?
I 'm the Ponce de Leon of psychiatry ?
( 4 ) Why the accepted delusion that a drug is the same , regardless of dose ?
Perhaps it 's because this supposedly only applies to the newer drugs ?
The old ones -- Thorazine , Elavil , Pamelor , Remeron , Wellbutrin -- all blunt instruments , single receptor system drugs ?
Why do we think that an inanimate object has a fixed identity , when even a person does n't ?
Next up : Are n't Two Drugs Better Than One ?

FBI Should Notify Customers and Name the Phone Companies Involved , ACLU Says

( 3/9/2007 )
WASHINGTON – Claims that the FBI ’s reported Patriot Act abuses were the “ unintentional ” result of outmoded computer systems and human error are not credible , the American Civil Liberties Union said today , citing evidence that agents contracted with phone companies to obtain customer records and later sought to cover up the illegal requests .
The report also shows that the FBI is issuing hundreds of thousands more National Security Letters than ever imagined , and that tracking of the NSLs is sloppy , resulting in thousands of innocent Americans being entered into databases that are shared with numerous U.S. agencies and foreign governments .
“ It seems that every time the American people entrust the Bush administration with some new power , it not only abuses that power but also seizes additional powers without our knowledge , ” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero .
“ It is long past time for Congress to take back the civil liberties of the American people and right these wrongs .
The Attorney General and the FBI are part of the problem and cannot be trusted to be the only solution . ”
The ACLU ’s criticisms came in response to a report issued today by the Justice Department ’s own Inspector General about abuses of Patriot Act powers used to obtain sensitive personal information such as telephone records and e-mail .
The report revealed that FBI agents have issued “ at least 739 ” so - called “ exigent letters ” that illegally circumvent even the scant requirements of the Patriot Act ’s controversial National Security Letter ( NSL ) provision .
In some cases , NSLs were issued “ after the fact ” to “ cover ” the illegitimate record demands , the report said .
According to the Inspector General ’s report , FBI agents contracted with phone companies to improperly obtain customer records , saying that subpoenas would later be issued in connection with an underlying investigation .
But in a random examination of such “ exigent letters , ” not one subpoena was sent , and in many cases the requests were not tied to any pending FBI investigations , in clear violation of the law .
“ It simply is not credible for the FBI to claim that these unauthorized and illegal fishing expeditions were the result of human error or outmoded computer systems , ” Romero said .
Romero also expressed doubt about FBI Director Mueller ’s claim that no one was harmed by these massive privacy breaches , saying that customers should be alerted that their telephone and e-mail records may now be in U.S. and even foreign government databases .
“ We call on the FBI to immediately disclose the identity of the telecommunications companies that were involved and to notify the customers whose records were obtained about this unauthorized invasion of their privacy rights . ”
Today ’s report contained numerous other revelations of abuses of the National Security Letter power and other Patriot Act powers , including :
The FBI issued NSLs even where no underlying investigation had been approved ; obtained more information from recipients than was requested ; and obtained information about telephone numbers that did not belong to the target of the NSLs .
The violations of privacy that resulted from the FBI ’s abuse of its NSL power go way beyond phone and email records and in some instances included medical records and educational records .
In one case , the FBI issued an NSL to a North Carolina university that sought several categories of records , including applications for admission , housing information , emergency contacts , and campus health records .
The FBI has no uniform system for tracking responses to National Security Letters , either manually or electronically , and is sharing information derived from NSL with numerous U.S. intelligence agencies and even foreign governments
The number of NSL requests reported to Congress in 2003 , 2004 , and 2005 , were “ significantly understated . ”
After the Patriot Act , the number of NSL requests increased from 8,500 in 2000 to approximately 39,000 in 2003 , approximately 56,000 in 2004 , and approximately 47,000 in 2005 – but even these numbers are incomplete because the FBI “ did not consistently enter ” its data .
Some NSL recipients erroneously provided prohibited content to the FBI , including voice messages , e-mails , and images .
The ACLU also noted that the Inspector General ’s report looked at only a tiny sample of the hundreds of thousands of NSLs .
That so many violations and abuses were uncovered in such a small sample points to major systemic problems with the FBI ’s use of NSLs , the ACLU said .
As a result of today ’s revelations , the ACLU has renewed its call to Congress to repeal the NSL provision of the Patriot Act and to exercise its oversight powers .
" Congress must fix the fundamental flaws with the Patriot Act , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" The FBI abused the powers it was given in the Patriot Act to pry in to the private lives of more Americans than ever before in our history . ”
The ACLU has successfully challenged the procedures for issuing NSLs in two separate lawsuits .
The lawsuits challenge the National Security Letter provision of the Patriot Act , which authorizes the FBI to demand a range of personal records without court approval , such as the identity of a person who has visited a particular Web site on a library computer , or who has engaged in anonymous speech on the Internet .
Under the expanded Patriot
Act power , anyone who receives an NSL is forbidden , or " gagged " from telling anyone about the record demand .
In response to the court rulings , Congress made some minor changes to the law when it reauthorized the Patriot Act in 2006 .
As today ’s report demonstrates , the ACLU said , those changes are not enough .
In a September 2004 ruling striking down the draconian gag provision of the NSL power , Federal District Court Judge Victor Marrero said : “ As our sunshine laws and judicial doctrine attest , democracy abhors undue secrecy .
An unlimited government warrant to conceal , effectively a form of secrecy per se , has no place in our open society .
Such a claim is especially inimical to democratic values for reasons borne out by painful experience . "
Next month Judge Marrero will hear arguments in the ACLU ’s challenge to the gag and secrecy provisions of the NSL law as amended by Congress in 2006 .

Finally Tagless , Partially Evaluated , Tagless Staged Interpreters for Simpler Typed Languages .
Jacques Carette , Oleg Kiselyov , and Chung - chieh Shan .
We have built the first family of tagless interpretations for a higher - order typed object language in a typed metalanguage ( Haskell or ML ) that require no dependent types , generalized algebraic data types , or postprocessing to eliminate tags .
The statically type - preserving interpretations include an evaluator , a compiler ( or staged evaluator ) , a partial evaluator , and call - by - name and call - by - value CPS transformers .
Our main idea is to encode HOAS using cogen functions rather than data constructors .
In other words , we represent object terms not in an initial algebra but using the coalgebraic structure of the LC .
Our representation also simulates inductive maps from types to types , which are required for typed partial evaluation and CPS transformations .
Oleg explains :
It seems like a common wisdom that an embedding of a typed object language ( e.g. , DSL ) to a typed meta - language so that all and only typed object terms can be represented requires dependent types , GADTs or other such advanced type systems .
In fact , this problem of writing ( tagless ) type - preserving typed interpreters has been the motivation for most of the papers on GADTs .
We show that regardless of merits and conveniences of GADTs , type - preserving typed interpretation can be achieved with no GADTs whatsoever , using very simple type systems of ML or Haskell98 .
We also show the same approach lets us perform statically type - preserving partial evaluation and call - by - value or call - by - name CPS tansformations .
The latter transformations , too , are often claimed impossible in Haskell98 or ML - requiring instead quite advanced type systems or language features .
The complete ( Meta ) OCaml and Haskell code accompanying the paper is
available ( see readme ) .
One of features of our approach is writing the DSL code in a form that can be interpreted in multiple ways .
Recently we have become aware the very same approach underlies `abstract categorial grammars ' ( ACG ) in linguistics .
Chung - chieh Shan has written an extensive article on this correspondence .
That post itself can be interpreted in several ways : the file can be read as plain text , or it can be loaded as it is in Haskell or OCaml interpreters .
It should be noted that the linguistic terms `tectogrammatics ' and ` phenogrammatics ' were coined by none else but Haskell Curry , in his famous 1961 paper ' Some Logical Aspects of Grammatical Structure ' .
The summary of the ESSLLI workshop describes further connections to linear lambda - calculus .
The paper has been accepted for APLAS ; the authors appreciate any comments indeed .
In 1982 , the only computer virus people had to worry about was something of a poet .
Once the mischievous code lodged itself into an Apple II computer , the virus spouted verse :
" It will get on all your disks /
It will infiltrate your chips / Yes it 's Cloner ! " the bardic virus displayed on screens every 50th time the machine started up .
" It will stick to you like glue / It will modify RAM too / Send in the Cloner ! "
If only today 's computer viruses were so benign .
Twenty - five years later , the worms , bots , and other " malware " that sneak onto computers are far more than mere annoyances .
They swindle users , overwhelm networks , and cause billions of dollars in damage each year .
Such a future was unimaginable to Richard Skrenta when he programmed that first virus back in 1982 .
He was 15 at the time .
Calling his code the " Elk Cloner " –­ after the elk head trophy that hung in his father 's study –­ the ninth - grader released the program as a practical joke .
The code infected operating systems , then spread to floppy disks , then contaminated other operating systems , and copied itself to other floppies .
It infected his friend 's computers , as intended .
But before long , the poem popped up on his math teacher 's computer , and later on the computers of complete strangers .
" I realized that it would spread , but my imagination did n't picture it spreading all around the world , " says Mr. Skrenta , who last month stepped down as CEO of the social networking site Topix .
net to pursue other start - ups .
He seems to get a kick out of reporters still asking questions about his little prank 25 years later .
" What you have to remember is that there were no laws against this kind of thing , " he says .
" The idea of the evil hacker did n't even exist at the time . "
But as more programmers thought up wicked malware , media attention followed .
There was the infamous " Morris worm " that wiggled through the nascent Internet in 1988 .
Programmed by a Cornell University student , the worm clogged systems across the country and cost researchers up to $ 10 million in lost time as they weeded out the self - replicating code .
Then came the " Michelangelo virus , " a ticking - bomb program that threatened to erase thousands of hard drives simultaneously on March 6 , 1992 .
Like the Y2 K bug that followed , however , Michelangelo scared more people than it hurt .
These early codes and the scores that came in between had a much different goal than today 's crop of malware .
They were designed to vandalize , earn bragging rights , and tinker with new technology .
It was a time of hobbyists , says Zulfikar Ramzan , a senior principal researcher at the computer security firm Symantec in Cupertino , Calif .
But around 2001 , the trend shifted .
Amateur - made viruses gave way to a new breed – one that was more evolved , relied on stealth , and targeted your wallet .
New schemes , new virus vocabulary
So what changed ?
For one , a growing number of Americans started to use the Internet for banking , shopping , and advertising .
Once real money started flying through cyberspace , hackers began to devise nefarious business plans .
" It used to be that most of the new malware we discovered appeared during nights and weekends – when hobbyists would have time to work on them , " Mr. Ramzan says .
" Nowadays , the virus writers are more active during office hours . "
Hackers no longer want to share poetry or wipe your hard drive clean .
After all , if a virus erases disks , it erases itself – and the opportunity to take advantage of unsuspecting computer users would be lost .
Now viruses can infect computers and the user might never know .
Digital beasties such as " rootkits " burrow deep into operating systems .
" Spyware " lurks behind the scenes , quietly sending passwords or other data to hackers .
" Bots " can even allow hackers to take over systems .
Once " bot herders " lasso enough computers , they can order thousands of hijacked machines to stampede networks , overwhelming websites and possibly blackmailing the companies that run them .
Bots in particular are hard to track down because they are often international in scope , says Dave Marcus , security research and communications manager for McAfee 's antivirus lab in Santa Clara , Calif .
A herder can operate in Romania , commandeer a computer in China , and then attack a network in the United States .
In fact , he says , 80 to 90 percent of all spam comes from infected machines .
Another major change from the hobbyist phase to today 's era of full - time criminal coders : sheer volume .
In 2002 , McAfee 's antivirus team found 100 new malware designs each week , says Mr. Marcus .
Now , the Internet snoopers discover 125 to 175 new codes every day .
Hackers caused $ 13.3 billion in damages last year , according to a report released last month by Computer Economics , a digital research firm in Irvine , Calif .
But thanks to wider adoption of security software , that number is down from $ 17.5 billion in 2004 .
One challenge in fighting malware is that current antivirus measures are still largely reactive .
Once a company spots a problem , it can take days or weeks to plug the hole – plenty of time for viruses to slip in .
Of course , the biggest problem is not the computer 's defenses , it 's the people using the machines , says Richard Ford , director of the Center for Security Science at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne , Fla .
" Humans are always going to be the weakest link , " he says .
" If a hacker can convince you to download a malicious file or , better yet , trick you into deleting good files , then it does n't matter what precautions you have in place . "
A future threat : cellphone viruses
Antivirus experts agree that it 's just a matter of time before cellphone viruses reach US shores .
They already exist in England and Japan , where mobile phones play a bigger role in everyday life .
" One thing protecting Americans now is that there is no dominant cellphone standard , " unlike on computers , where Microsoft Windows enjoys a 90 percent market share , says Ramzan .
However , " I would n't be surprised if something came up soon to attack the BlackBerry . "
Earlier this week , a team of security advocates claimed to have cracked Apple 's month - old iPhone , allowing hackers to swipe personal information from users .
The development is a sign that computer viruses will stalk networks long after this silver anniversary fades .
" Fifty years from now we 'll still be plugging away , " says McAfee 's Marcus .
" But let me say this :
We 're at the front lines of this fight , and even though there is so much that we deal with , even we do n't think it 's doomsday . "
“ I did n’t relish the carpal tunnel syndrome that would result from signing all these forms .
We tried to ‘ sign ’ them by running the forms through the laser printer again to print the signature in the right place .
But , as I learned , something traumatic happens to paper on its way through a printer .
Once a sheet of paper has been through a laser printer , the next time you try to print on it , it ’s going to fight back , jamming the printer and resulting in the deaths of three other pages , and you ’re going to spend five minutes with a putty knife cleaning up the bloodshed . ”
How Hard Could It Be? : Unfocused and Unabashed

On Aug. 15 , before an overflow crowd at the federal courthouse at 7th and Mission in San Francisco , three judges from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals listened to lawyers argue whether the once - obscure “ state secrets privilege ” gives the government an absolute right to withhold documents , bury evidence and block lawsuits .
The government claimed the privilege in connection with two cases challenging the Bush administration ’s domestic surveillance programs , including its controversial warrantless wiretapping operation .
Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Garre , arguing for the government , maintained that the cases should be dismissed instantly , no questions asked , because a trial would endanger national security .
Presenting any evidence in a courtroom , he said , would put the country at “ exceptionally grave harm . ”
When it comes to national security , Garre said , judges must give the executive branch the “ utmost deference . ”
After listening to such claims for a while , the senior judge on the appellate panel , Harry Pregerson , asked Garre whether the state secrets privilege meant that the courts must simply “ rubber stamp ” the decisions of the executive .
“ The bottom line here is the government declares something is a state secret , that ’s the end of it , ” Pregerson said .
“ The king can do no wrong . ”
“ This seems to put us in the ‘ trust us ’ category , ” said Judge M. Margaret McKeown , referring to government assurances that the surveillance program did n’t violate the law .
“ We do n’t do it .
Trust us .
And do n’t ask us about it . ”
This apparent skepticism on the part of Pregerson and his fellow judges was highly unusual and may signal a new willingness to question government assertions about national security .
In recent years , as the Bush administration has relied more heavily on the state secrets privilege to have cases thrown out of court , judges have generally been willing to concede meekly to the government ’s argument .
Could it be that the government has finally overplayed its hand ?
The battles over the state secrets privilege go back more than 50 years .
Close your eyes and it could be Aug. 9 , 1950 .
In a federal courthouse in Washington that humid day , others faced a similar issue during litigation over the crash of an Air Force B - 29 two years earlier near Waycross , Ga .
A lawyer for the widows of three civilian engineers who died in that crash wanted the Air Force ’s accident report , expecting it would shed light on the cause of the disaster .
An assistant U.S. attorney balked , arguing that the report could not be released without seriously hampering national security .
He presented Air Force affidavits that said the plane was “ engaged in a highly secret mission ” and “ carried confidential equipment . ”
In response , a skeptical U.S. District Judge William Kirkpatrick said , “ I only want to know where your argument leads . ”
The assistant U.S. attorney made plain where it led : “ We contend that the findings of the [ executive branch ] are binding . . . upon the judiciary .
You can not review it or interpret it .
That is what it comes down to . ”
Kirkpatrick did not agree .
He found the government in default and awarded the widows damages .
A three - judge panel of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed his decision .
But when the matter came before the U.S. Supreme Court , it reversed the lower courts , for the first time formally recognizing a state secrets privilege in the landmark ruling U.S. vs. Reynolds .
The government should n’t have absolute autonomy , wrote Chief Justice Fred Vinson in his 1953 opinion , but if the government can satisfy the court that a “ reasonable danger ” to national security exists , judges should defer and not force the government to produce documents -- not even for private examination in the judge ’s chambers .
So it began .
Slowly and haltingly , at first , then not so slowly .
Between 1953 and 1976 , the government invoked the privilege in only five cases ; between 1977 and 2001 , in 59 cases .
In the last six years , the Bush administration has invoked it 39 times , according to the best available count -- or more than six times every year .
Along with the numbers , the scope and definition of what constitutes a state secret has expanded -- now including what one judicial decision described as “ bits and pieces of seemingly innocuous information ” that might form a revealing “ mosaic . ”
Government lawyers have found that merely waving the Reynolds flag in the background for effect gains them deference from judges .
Rarely has a court rejected a government claim of privilege .
As a result , Vietnam War protesters subjected to surveillance and wiretapping have not been allowed to sue , blocked by rulings in 1978 and 1982 .
The retreat of the judiciary has also meant that accused enemy combatants and victims of “ extraordinary rendition , ” such as Maher Arar and Khaled El - Masri , have not been able to protest their treatment in court .
Nor have a variety of penalized whistle - blowers and federal employees making discrimination claims against the government .
Nor have contractors embroiled in business conflicts with the military , a scientist defamed by accusations of espionage or a sixth - grade boy investigated by the FBI for corresponding with foreign countries during a school project .
Over time , the desire to protect military secrets has started to look a good deal like the impulse to cover up mistakes , avoid embarrassment and gain insulation from liability .
How to know , though ?
Most often , judges rule blindly , without looking at the disputed documents underlying the state secrets claims .
Since 1993 , they have required in - camera review in less than an eighth of cases .
They choose , instead , to trust the government -- the ultimate act of faith .
They opt for deference ; deference lets them off the hook .
No one wants to be the judge whose decision leads to an apocalyptic disaster .
Better to say , we ’re not equipped , we ca n’t tell whether it implicates national security , we need to leave this to those who know .
This is understandable :
In an ominous world full of national security threats , it is hard indeed to deny the government .
Yet the Bush administration may finally have escalated the dubious use of the state secrets privilege to a point of resistance .
In the summer of 2006 , U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker in San Francisco and District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor in Detroit ventured to deny government state secrets claims in the domestic surveillance and eavesdropping cases .
“ It is important to note that even the state secrets privilege has its limits , ” Walker wrote .
“ While the court recognizes and respects the executive ’s constitutional duty to protect the nation from threats , the court also takes seriously its constitutional duty to adjudicate the disputes that come before it .
. . .
To defer to a blanket assertion of secrecy here would be to abdicate that duty . ”
It is Walker ’s opinion ( along with one from Oregon ) that came on appeal before the three - judge U.S. 9th Circuit panel last month .
By then , the U.S. 6th Circuit had already reversed Taylor ’s decision , ruling that the plaintiffs there had no legal standing because the state secrets privilege prevented them from learning if they ’d been targets of wiretapping .
Now , the government wanted Walker ’s opinion reversed too .
But judicial deference , for once , did not seem to be in the air .
According to news reports , Pregerson ( a President Carter appointee ) sounded downright irritated ; judges McKeown and Michael Daly Hawkins ( President Clinton appointees ) at the least were doubtful .
Pregerson wondered what roles judges were to play when the executive branch invoked state secrets :
“ Who decides whether something is a state secret or not ? ”
Hearing the deputy solicitor general talk of “ ultimate deference ” due the executive branch , Pregerson asked : “ What does ‘ ultimate deference ’ mean ?
Bow to it ? ”
That , above all , is the question before the members of the 9th Circuit panel .
As they ponder , they would do well to consider Judge Kirkpatrick ’s response to the same question in August 1950 -- and to what we now know about the government ’s state secrets claim those many years ago .
Declassified half a century later , the disputed B - 29 accident report turned out to tell a tale of military negligence -- maintenance failures , missing heat shields , cockpit confusion -- not one of national security secrets about a radar guidance system .
The government , it seems , was seeking to cover its embarrassment and hide its mistakes , not to protect the country ’s security .
This revelation has helped fuel calls for reform by legal scholars , public interest groups and the American Bar Assn .
It should also inspire the 9th Circuit panel in the current cases to think long and hard before trusting the government or accepting its claims .
In a system of three separate but equal powers of government , it ’s time for the judges to do their job .
Barry Siegel , a former Times national correspondent , directs the literary journalism program at UC Irvine .
His book on U.S. vs. Reynolds and the state secrets privilege , “ Claim of Privilege , ” will be published next year .
Yet part of the reason Alex ’s death attracted so much sympathy , and why Dr. Pepperberg ’s grief seems normal rather than excessive , is that Alex , in the public eye , was neither pet nor ordinary parrot .
He was Pinocchio , striving to realize his full potential — his humanity .
Importantly , Alex did n’t merely nuzzle his affection for Dr. Pepperberg .
He had genuine dying words , the fine four - hanky phrase , “ I love you . ”
By contrast , when Leona Helmsley , the hotel magnate who died in August , specified in her will that she was leaving $ 12 million to her pet dog , Trouble , while stiffing two of her grandchildren , there was scant talk of dogs as best friends .
There were hoots , clucks and growls , with one reader on The New York Times Web site advising the grandchildren to “ go kill that stupid dog . ”
Marc Hauser , professor of psychology at Harvard and author of “ Wild Minds : What Animals Really Think , ” says ambivalence and tension have long been woven into our feelings about animals .
“ On the one hand , we feel a connection to other animals and we can’t imagine a world where we ’re the only species on the planet , ” he said .
“ On the other hand , we ’re always trying to show that we ’re not animals .
We ’re like them , yet we do n’t want to be like them . ”
Dr. Hauser traces this tension to self - defense .
We use animals , and we want to feel justified in using animals .
We eat their muscles for meat , flay their hides for shoes and accessories , inject them with experimental vaccines , genetically engineer them into grotesque morphologies to study human diseases .
This requires a certain mental distance .
So we adore our pets and lavish time and money on them .
Annual pet expenditures in this country have doubled in the last decade and are now more than $ 40 billion a year .
And then we scold ourselves for our foolish fiscal priorities .
We adore our pets and can come to identify with them so deeply that we attribute to them some truly daffy notions , like the radio listener who called in a comment to Colin Allen , a philosopher and cognitive scientist at Indiana University ’s Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior .
“ She wanted to tell me about how her cat had very gingerly brought in an injured bird to show her , as though to say , It ’s hurt , please take care of it , ” Dr. Allen said .
“ I suggested there might be other interpretations for her cat ’s behavior . ”
Yes , we love our pets and anthropomorphize them to the point where we think our cat might enjoy wearing the mouse hat Halloween costume now on sale at Petsmart.com .
And still we abandon difficult pets , and shelters euthanize some 10 million pets a year .
I understand the ambivalence of the human - animal bond .
I loved my cats , and I miss them , but I resent them , too , for showing me what a creature of small habits I am , and for reminding me that even love is not enough .
Life , like the laundry , will always cool down .
Insulin , it turns out , may be as important for the mind as it is for the body .
Research in the last few years has raised the possibility that Alzheimer ’s memory loss could be due to a novel third form of diabetes .
Now scientists at Northwestern University have discovered why brain insulin signaling -- crucial for memory formation -- would stop working in Alzheimer ’s disease .
They have shown that a toxic protein found in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer ’s removes insulin receptors from nerve cells , rendering those neurons insulin resistant .
( The protein , known to attack memory - forming synapses , is called an ADDL for “ amyloid ß- derived diffusible ligand . ” )
With other research showing that levels of brain insulin and its related receptors are lower in individuals with Alzheimer ’s disease , the Northwestern study sheds light on the emerging idea of Alzheimer ’s being a “ type 3 ” diabetes .
The new findings , published online by the FASEB Journal , could help researchers determine which aspects of existing drugs now used to treat diabetic patients may protect neurons from ADDLs and improve insulin signaling in individuals with Alzheimer ’s .
( The FASEB Journal is a publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology . )
In the brain , insulin and insulin receptors are vital to learning and memory .
When insulin binds to a receptor at a synapse , it turns on a mechanism necessary for nerve cells to survive and memories to form .
That Alzheimer ’s disease may in part be caused by insulin resistance in the brain has scientists asking how that process gets initiated .
“ We found the binding of ADDLs to synapses somehow prevents insulin receptors from accumulating at the synapses where they are needed , ” said William L. Klein , professor of neurobiology and physiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences , who led the research team .
“ Instead , they are piling up where they are made , in the cell body , near the nucleus .
Insulin cannot reach receptors there .
This finding is the first molecular evidence as to why nerve cells should become insulin resistant in Alzheimer ’s disease . ”
ADDLS are small , soluble aggregated proteins .
The clinical data strongly support a theory in which ADDLs accumulate at the beginning of Alzheimer ’s disease and block memory function by a process predicted to be reversible .
In earlier research , Klein and colleagues found that ADDLs bind very specifically at synapses , initiating deterioration of synapse function and causing changes in synapse composition and shape .
Now Klein and his team have shown that the molecules that make memories at synapses -- insulin receptors -- are being removed by ADDLs from the surface membrane of nerve cells .
“ We think this is a major factor in the memory deficiencies caused by ADDLs in Alzheimer ’s brains , ” said Klein , a member of Northwestern ’s Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer 's Disease Center .
“ We ’re dealing with a fundamental new connection between two fields , diabetes and Alzheimer ’s disease , and the implication is for therapeutics .
We want to find ways to make those insulin receptors themselves resistant to the impact of ADDLs .
And that might not be so difficult . ”
Using mature cultures of hippocampal neurons , Klein and his team studied synapses that have been implicated in learning and memory mechanisms .
The extremely differentiated neurons can be investigated at the molecular level .
The researchers studied the synapses and their insulin receptors before and after ADDLs were introduced .
They discovered the toxic protein causes a rapid and significant loss of insulin receptors from the surface of neurons specifically on dendrites to which ADDLs are bound .
ADDL binding clearly damages the trafficking of the insulin receptors , preventing them from getting to the synapses .
The researchers measured the neuronal response to insulin and found that it was greatly inhibited by ADDLs .
“ In addition to finding that neurons with ADDL binding showed a virtual absence of insulin receptors on their dendrites , we also found that dendrites with an abundance of insulin receptors showed no ADDL binding , ” said co-author Fernanda G. De Felice , a visiting scientist from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who is working in Klein ’s lab .
“ These factors suggest that insulin resistance in the brains of those with Alzheimer ’s is a response to ADDLs . ”
“ With proper research and development the drug arsenal for type 2 diabetes , in which individuals become insulin resistant , may be translated to Alzheimer ’s treatment , ” said Klein .
“ I think such drugs could supercede currently available Alzheimer ’s drugs . ”

The stepdaughter - in - law of Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum died while in police custody in Phoenix following a heated argument with an airport - gate attendant , officials said yesterday .
Phoenix police said Carol Ann Gotbaum , 45 , who lives in Manhattan , appeared to have strangled herself while trying to wriggle free from handcuffs while in a holding cell after the Friday incident .
Gotbaum ’s husband , Noah , is the son of Victor Gotbaum , the former DC - 37 union boss who is married to the public advocate .
“ The family is in great grieving and stress , ” Betsy Gotbaum told The Post last night from her home .
“ We have nothing to say .
We hope that The Post and every other newspaper will respect our privacy . ”
Carol Ann Gotbaum ’s distraught husband , who answered the door at their Upper West Side townhouse , said , “ I do n’t want to talk about it .
It ’s rude . ”
It was not clear why Carol Ann Gotbaum was in Arizona , but cops said she was traveling alone .
She arrived late for her U.S. Airways flight to Tucson and was told that the plane was preparing to depart , airline spokesman Derek Hanna said .
She allegedly began shouting at the gate attendant , and her persistent unruliness prompted the agent to call the cops just before 3 p.m .
“ She became extremely irate , apparently running up and down the gate area , ” Hanna said .
Gotbaum ran into the responding officers after going back through the security checkpoint toward the main terminal , said Sgt. Andy Hill , a police spokesman .
“ The officers were not able to calm Ms. Gotbaum and eventually arrested her for disorderly conduct . ”
Gotbaum resisted , and was “ continually screaming ” after being put into a holding cell , Hill said .
Officers checked on her every 15 minutes , but some five to 10 minutes after one check - in , he said , she had gone silent .
They then found that she was n’t breathing and attempts to revive her failed .
“ It appeared as though Ms. Gotbaum had possibly tried to manipulate the handcuffs from behind her to the front , got tangled up in the process , and they ended up around her neck area , ” Hill said .
The Phoenix police are investigating .
Gotbaum , the daughter of a retired South African Navy commander , married Noah Gotbaum 12 years ago in Central Park .
Gotbaum and her husband have three young children , according to the Web site of a cellular technology company where Noah is on the board of directors .

I made two claims about the transcript published by El Pais of Bush ’s conversations with Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar on 22 February , 2003 , at Crawford , Texas .
The first is that the transcript shows that Bush intended to disregard a negative outcome in his quest for a UN Security Council resolution authorizing a war against Iraq .
Bush wanted such a resolution .
He expressed a willingness to use threats and economic coercion to secure it .
But he makes it perfectly clear that he will not wait for the UNSC to act beyond mid-March .
He also explicitly says that if any of the permanent members of the UNSC uses its veto , “ we will go . ”
That is , failure to secure the resolution would trigger the war .
Uh , that is the opposite of the way it is supposed to work .
If you ca n’t get a UNSC resolution , and you have n’t been attacked by the state against whom you want to go to war , then you are supposed to stand down .
Both because he set a deadline beyond which his “ patience ” would not stretch ( the poor thing had already waited four months ; I mean , is he a toddler that he lacks elementary patience ? ) , and because he specified a UNSC veto as a signal for his launching of the war , Bush made it very clear that he was willing to trash the charter of the United Nations and to take the world back to the 1930s , to an era of mass politics when powerful states launched wars of choice at will on the basis of fevered rhetoric and fits of pique .
The second claim that I made was that Bush was aware of , and rejected , an offer by Saddam Hussein to flee Iraq , probably for Saudi Arabia , presuming he could take out with him a billion dollars and some documents on Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction programs .
Both provisions were intended by Saddam to protect him from later retaliation .
The money would buy him protection from extradition , and the documents presumably showed that the Reagan and Bush senior administrations had secretly authorized his chemical and biological weapons programs .
With these documents in his possession , it was unlikely that Bush would come after him , since he could ruin the reputation of the Bush family if he did .
The destruction of these documents was presumably Bush ’s goal when he had Rumsfeld order US military personnel not to interfere with the looting and burning of government offices after the fall of Saddam .
The looting , which set off the guerrilla war , also functioned as a vast shredding party , destroying incriminating evidence about the complicity of the Bushes and Rumsfeld in Iraq ’s war crimes .
The claims by some pundits that Saddam ’s reported desire to take documents on his WMD programs out of the country proves he had such programs in 2003 or that he wanted to somehow retain specialized knowledge involved in them , are silly .
Saddam had destroyed his chemical , nuclear and biological programs and stockpiles , which we know from the most extensive postwar inspections in the history of mammal life .
Almost certainly , he wanted to keep with him the documents that showed precisely that – that he was in fact in compliance with UN resolutions ( which he was ) and so could not on those grounds be subject to extraordinary rendition and delivered to the Hague .
Also , as I say , he may well have wanted to keep with him documents with which to blackmail the Bush family , which in the 1980s had been involved in winking at and enabling his WMD capabilities .
( The objections of some observers that Saddam could have avoided the war by just admitting he had destroyed his WMD and providing the documentation ignore what we have since found out– that Saddam was afraid that if the world knew he had no chemical weapons left , the Shiites , Kurds and Iranians would finish him off in no time .
He could not hope to stay in power if he came clean on this matter , but once he left power he knew that his actions of the 1980s could get him convicted at the Hague and so he needed to keep with him documentation on his Reagan / Bush partners in crime as a hedge . )
Aznar asked Bush if he would grant Saddam these guarantees , and Bush roared back that he would not .
( That is the answer to those who want to know where in the text Bush declines Saddam ’s offer to flee .
Nobody in his right mind would flee without guarantees ; by declining them , Bush scotched the deal . )
By refusing to allow Saddam to flee with guarantees , Bush ensured that a land war would have to be fought .
This is one of the greatest crimes any US president ever committed , and it is all the more contemptible for being rooted in mere pride and petulance .
Note that even General Pervez Musharraf allowed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to go to Saudi Arabia with similar guarantees , even though Sharif was alleged to have attempted to cause Musharraf ’s death .
A tinpot Pakistani general had more devotion to the good of his country , and more good sense , than did George W. Bush .
The passage in which Bush agrees with Aznar that it would be better if Baghdad fell without a fight refers to the possibility that the Iraqi officer corps would assassinate Saddam and decline to put up a fight .
Bush would very much have liked such a fantasy to come true .
But he did not need to fantasize .
He had a real offer in the hand , of Saddam ’s flight .
He rejected it .
By rejecting it , he will have killed at least a million persons and became one of the more monstrous figures in recent world history .
I have done a translation of the transcript , with some dictionary work .
I would be glad of any corrections , but I think it is good enough for government work .
No one can read it without recognizing that Bush was champing at the bit to go to war ; that he only wanted the UNSC as a fig leaf and was determined to ignore it if it did not authorize the war ; and that he had a deal on the table from Saddam but absolutely refused to pursue it , preferring instead either a sanguinary conflict or his adolescent fantasy of Baghdad falling without a shot .

Transcript of Bush - Aznar Consultation in Crawford , February 22 , 2003
President Bush .
We are in favor of getting a second resolution in the Security Council and would want to do it quickly .
We would want to announce it Monday or Tuesday [ 24 or 25 of February of 2003 ] .
President Aznar : Better Tuesday , after the meeting of the Council of General Affairs of the European Union .
It is important to maintain the momentum gained by the resolution at the summit of the European Union [ in Brussels , Monday 17 of February ] .
We would prefer to wait until Tuesday .
Bush .
It could be in the evening Monday , considering the time difference .
In any case , the next week .
We will see that the resolution is written so that it does not contain obligatory steps [ for Iraq ] , that it does not mention the use of force , and that it states that Saddam Hussein has been unable to fulfill his obligations .
That type of resolution can be voted for by many people .
It would be something similar to the one passed regarding Kosovo [ the 10th of June of 1999 ] .
Aznar : Would it be presented to the Security Council before , and independently of , a parallel declaration ?
Condoleezza Rice .
In fact there would not be parallel declaration .
We are thinking about as simple a resolution as possible , without many details regarding [ Iraq ’s ] obligations–such that Saddam Hussein could use them as stages and consequently could neglect to fulfill them .
We are speaking with Blix [ head of the inspectors of the UN ] and others of his team to get ideas that can serve to introduce the resolution .
Bush .
Saddam Hussein will not change and will continue playing games .
The moment has come to be rid of him .
That ’s the way it is .
As for me , from now on I will try to tone down the rhetoric as much as possible , while we seek approval of the resolution .
If somebody uses a veto , we will go .
[ Russia , China and France have , along with the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom the right to a veto in the Security Council by virtue of being permanent members ]
Saddam Hussein is not disarming .
We have to take him right now .
We have shown an incredible degree of patience so far .
There are two weeks left .
In two weeks we will be militarily ready .
I believe that we will get the second resolution .
In the Security Council we have the three African members [ Cameroun , Angola and Guinea ] , the Chileans , and the Mexicans .
I will speak with all of them , also with Putin , naturally .
We will be in Baghdad at the end of March .
There is a 15 % possibility that Saddam Hussein will die or flee .
But that possibility will not exist until we have demonstrated our resolve .
The Egyptians are talking to Saddam Hussein .
It seems that he has indicated that he is willing to go into exile if he can take a billion dollars with him and all the information that he wants on weapons of mass destruction .
[ Muammar ] Gaddafi told Berlusconi that Saddam Hussein wants to go away .
Mubarak tells us that in these circumstances it is entirely possible that he will be assassinated .
We would like to act with the mandate of the United Nations .
If we act militarily we will do it with great precision , tightly focusing on our objectives .
We will decimate the troops loyal to him , and the regular army quickly will recognize what is going on .
We have sent a very clear message to Saddam ’s generals : we will treat them like war criminals .
We know that they have accumulated an enormous amount of dynamite to demolish bridges and other infrastructure and to blow up the oil wells .
We foresee occupying those wells very quickly .
Also , the Saudis will help us by putting on the market all the petroleum that is necessary .
We are developing a package of very extensive humanitarian aid .
We can win without destruction .
We are already planning for a post - Saddam Iraq , and I believe that there are good bases for a better future .
Iraq has a relatively good bureaucracy and a civil society .
It can be organized as a federal system .
Meanwhile , we are doing everything possible to take care of the political needs of our friends and allies .
Aznar :
It is very important to have a resolution .
It is not the same to act with it as without it .
It would be very advisable to have a majority in the Security Council that supported that resolution .
In fact , it is important to have it passed by a majority , even if someone exercises a veto .
Let us consider that the text of the resolution would have among other things to state that Saddam Hussein has lost his opportunity .
Bush .
Yes , by all means .
It would be better to have a reference to “ necessary means ” [ a reference to the type of UN resolution that authorizes the use of “ all necessary means ” ] .
Aznar : Saddam Hussein has not cooperated , has not been disarmed ; we would have to summarize his breaches and to send a more detailed message .
That would allow , for example , Mexico to move [ a reference to a change in its negative position on the second resolution , the extent of which Aznar could have known about from the lips of president Vicente Fox on Friday , February 21 , in Mexico City ] .
Bush .
The resolution will be custom - made in such a way that it will help you .
I do n’t care much about the content .
Aznar :
We will send you some sample texts .
Bush .
We do not have any text .
Only a criterion : that Saddam Hussein disarm .
We cannot allow Saddam Hussein to drag things out until the summer .
After all , this last stage has already lasted four months , and this is more than enough time to disarm .
Aznar : Having a text would allow us to sponsor it and to be its coauthors , and to arrange for many others to sponsor it .
Bush .
Perfect .
Aznar :
The next Wednesday [ ( 2 ) 6 of February ]
I will meet with Chirac .
The resolution will already have begun to circulate .
Bush .
It seems to me all very good .
Chirac knows the reality perfectly .
Their intelligence services have explained it to him .
The Arabs are transmitting a very clear message to Chirac : Saddam Hussein must go .
The problem is that Chirac thinks he is Mister Arab , but in fact he is making their lives impossible .
But I do not want to have any rivalry with Chirac .
We have different points of view , but I would like that to be all .
Give him my best regards .
Really !
The less rivalry he feels exists between us , the better it will be for everyone .
Aznar :
How to combine the resolution with the report of the inspectors ?
Condoleezza Rice .
Actually there will not be a report on February 28 , but the inspectors will present a report written on March 1 .
We do n’t have high hopes for that report .
As with the previous ones , it will be a mixed picture .
I have the impression that Blix will now be more negative than he was before , with regard to the Iraqis ’ intentions .
After the appearance of the inspectors before the Council , we must anticipate a vote on the resolution one week later .
The Iraqis , meanwhile , will try to explain that they are fulfilling their obligations .
It is n’t true , and it wo n’t be sufficient , though they may announce the destruction of some missiles .
Bush .
This is like Chinese water torture .
We must put an end to it .
Aznar .
I agree , but it would be good to have the maximum possible number of people .
Have a little patience .
Bush :
My patience is exhausted .
I do n’t intend to wait longer than the middle of March .
Aznar .
I do not request that you have infinite patience .
Simply that you do everything possible so that it all works out .
Bush : Countries like Mexico , Chile , Angola , and Cameroon must realize that what ’s at stake is the security of the United States , and they should act with a sense of friendship toward us .
[ Chilean President Ricardo ]
Lagos should know that the Free Trade Accord with Chile is awaiting Senate confirmation and a negative attitude about this could put ratification in danger .
Angola is receiving Millennium Account funds [ to help alleviate poverty ] and that could be jeopardized also if he ’s not supportive .
And Putin must know that his attitude is putting in danger the relations of Russia with the United States .
Aznar .
Tony [ Blair ] would like to wait until the 14th of March .
Bush : I prefer the 10th .
This is like a game of bad cop , good cop .
I do n’t mind being the bad cop , and Blair can be the good one .
Aznar .
Is it certain that any possibility exists that Saddam Hussein will go into exile ?
Bush :
The possibility exists , including that he will be assassinated .
Aznar .
Exile with a guarantee ?
Bush : No guarantee .
He is a thief , a terrorist , a war criminal .
Compared with Saddam , Milosevic would be a Mother Teresa .
When we go in , we are going to discover many more crimes and we will take him to the Court the International Justice .
Saddam Hussein thinks that he has already escaped .
He thinks that France and Germany have ceased fulfilling their responsibilities .
He also thinks that the demonstrations of the last week [ Saturday , February 15 ] will protect him .
And he thinks that I very am weak .
But the people around him know that the things are otherwise .
They know that his future is in exile or a coffin .
For that reason it is very important to maintain the pressure on him .
Gaddafi tells us through back channels that that is the only thing that can finish him off .
Saddam Hussein ’s only strategy is to delay , to delay and to delay .
Aznar .
In fact the biggest success would be to win the game without firing a single shot and entering Baghdad .
Bush :
For me it would be the perfect solution .
I do not want war .
I know what wars are .
I know the destruction and the death that they bring with them .
I am the one who has to console the mothers and the widows of the dead .
By all means , for us that would be the best solution .
In addition , it would save $ 50 billion .
Aznar .
We need you to help us with our public opinion .
Bush :
We will do everything we can .
Wednesday I am going to speak on the situation in the Middle East , proposing the new peace plan with which you are familiar , and on weapons of mass destruction , on the benefits of a free society , and I will locate the history of Iraq in a wider context .
Perhaps it will serve you .
Aznar .
What we are doing is a very deep change for Spain and the Spaniards .
We are changing the policy that the country had followed for the past two hundred years .
Bush : A historical sense of responsibility guides me just as it does you .
When within a few years History judges us , I do not want people to ask themselves why Bush , or Aznar , or Blair did not face their responsibilities .
In the end , what people want is to enjoy freedom .
Recently , in Romania they reminded me of the example of Ceausescu : it was enough for a woman to call him a liar , for the entire repressive edifice to come down .
It is the uncontrollable power of freedom .
I am convinced that I will get the resolution .
Aznar .
All to the good .
Bush : I made the decision to go to the Security Council .
In spite of the disagreements in my Administration , I said to my people that we had to work with our friends .
It will be wonderful to get a second resolution .
Aznar .
The only thing that worries me about you is your optimism .
Bush : I am optimistic because I believe that I am in the right .
I am at peace with myself .
It has been up to us to face a serious threat to the peace .
It irritates me a great deal to consider the indifference of the Europeans to the sufferings that Saddam Hussein inflicts on Iraqis .
Perhaps because he is brown - skinned , far away , and Muslim , many Europeans think that everything is all right in his regard .
I will not forget what Solana once said to me : why do we Americans think that the Europeans are anti-Semitic and unable to confront their responsibilities ?
That defensive attitude is terrible .
I have to acknowledge I have just great relations with Kofi Annan .
Aznar .
He shares your ethical preoccupations .
Bush :
The more the Europeans attack me , the stronger I am in the United States .
Aznar .
We would like to make your strength compatible with the esteem of the Europeans .
England 's Euro 2008 qualifying hopes were wrenched out of their own hands as they crashed to defeat in Moscow .
The result means Steve McClaren 's side must now beat Croatia at Wembley next month and hope Russia stumble in their remaining games against a hopeless Andorra and an Israel side with nothing to play for .
The Russia substitute Roman Pavlyuchenko grabbed both of his team 's goals in a four - minute spell in the second half , cancelling out Wayne Rooney 's delightfully volleyed first - half opener .
Russia , backed by a hostile atmosphere inside the Luzhniki Stadium , started brightly , with Yuri Zhirkov and Alexander Kerzhakov having their shots blocked by Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell respectively .
However , England grew in confidence as the half wore on and Joleon Lescott 's header was deflected on to the crossbar , before Shaun Wright - Phillips broke free only for him to see his cross run behind the incoming Rooney .
If Rooney had been sluggish for that chance however , he was at his brilliant best a few minutes later .
Micah Richards lumped an aimless ball upfield and Michael Owen - unexpectedly finding himself in the Emile Heskey role - flicked it on to Rooney , who hammered an unstoppable , dipping volley past Vladimir Gabulov .
England then managed to miss two unmissable chances that would have sealed the game early in the second - half .
Gerrard was the first culprit , volleying wide after a Gareth Barry free - kick found him unmarked at the far post , while Richards - six - yards out - failed to connect with a Rooney flick - on a few minutes later .
Those misses appeared to weigh heavily on England and Russia took full advantage : Zurianov stole past Rooney on his blind side and was clipped - but the initial contact was outside the area .
No matter , the referee gave the spot - kick and Pavlyuchenko converted .
Worse was to come though .
Vasili Berezutsky 's fierce shot was palmed away by Robinson , but neither he nor the defenders surrounding him could get to the ball before Pavlyuchenko , who poked Russia into the lead .
England struggled to create any meaningful chances in the rest of the half , until the 85th minute .
First , Rooney 's shot was forced wide by Gabulov and then Campbell headed the resulting corner high and wide when unmarked .
That was their last chance .
Now England must hope for help from elsewhere if they are to qualify for next summer 's finals .
From walking to zipping , Part 1 : Moving right
In a series of posts , Oleg and I will continue his earlier work on the generic zipper .
We will use delimited continuations to convert any monadic traversal into a zipper that can traverse a complex data structure — up and down , left and right — and update it purely functionally .
We will use the programming language Haskell : every post will be a literate program that you can run as is .
For example , you can download this post as a program .
{-# OPTIONS - W - fglasgow - exts #-} module WalkZip1 where import Control .
Monad ( liftM ) import Control .
Monad .
Trans ( MonadTrans ( lift ) ) import Control .
Monad .
Writer ( WriterT ( runWriterT ) , tell ) import Data .
Generics ( Typeable , Data , gmapM , mkM ) import Data .
Monoid ( Any ( Any ) ) import Data .
Maybe ( isJust , fromMaybe )
Our running example will be a familiar data type , that of untyped λ- terms .
data Term = V String | L String Term | A Term Term deriving ( Eq , Read , Show , Typeable , Data )
This data type has a familiar inhabitant , the infinite loop ( λx.xx ) ( λx.xx ) .
term ::
Term term =
A t t where t = L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) )
A monadic traversal , or a walk for short , is a way to enumerate parts of a value .
To a first approximation , if part and whole are two types , then a function of the type
type Walk part whole = forall m. ( Monad m ) => ( part -> m part ) -> whole -> m whole
is a way to enumerate parts ( of type part ) of a value ( of type whole ) .
Such a function takes two arguments : a visitor ( a callback function of type part -> m part , where m is any monad ) and the value whose parts to enumerate ( of type whole ) .
The function produces a monadic action comprised of visiting each part of the given value .
Each visit to a part yields a new , updated part ; the resulting monadic action yields a new , updated whole .
For example , the Prelude function
mapM :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> m b ) -> [ a ] -> m [ b ]
is a walk because it has the type Walk a [ a ] .
It enumerates the elements of a list as its parts .
We depict such a walk as follows , moving across a list from left to right .
For that matter , the identity function
id :: a -> a
is also a walk because it has the type Walk a a .
It enumerates a value itself as its only part .
We depict such a trivial walk as follows .
The actual type of walks is a bit more complex than this approximation , for three reasons .
First , a walk may proceed in multiple directions from the same part , and we want to let the visitor decide where to go next .
So the visitor should yield not just a new part but also an outgoing direction , of type to .
type Walk to part whole = forall m. ( Monad m ) => ( part -> m ( part , to ) ) -> whole -> m whole
To express the simplest case where only one outgoing direction is available , we define a singleton type After .
We also define a type class
To for a default outgoing direction after .
data After =
After deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show ) class ( Eq to ) =>
To to where after :: to instance To After where after =
After
Second , a walk may arrive from multiple directions at the same part , and we want to let the visitor know whence .
So the visitor should be passed not just an old part but also an incoming direction , of type from .
type Walk from to part whole = forall m. ( Monad m ) => ( from -> part -> m ( part , to ) ) -> whole -> m whole
We treat outgoing and incoming directions separately .
To express the simplest case where only one incoming direction is available , we define a singleton type Before .
We also define a type class From for a default incoming direction before .
data Before = Before deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show ) class ( Eq from ) =>
From from where before :: from instance From Before where before = Before
The final complication is that , to preserve sharing and save memory , we want to avoid copying values , so we want to distinguish between changed and unchanged values .
Thus , the visitor should yield not a part but a Maybe part , and the traversal should yield not a whole but a Maybe whole .
The result Nothing signals no change .
type Walk from to part whole = forall m. ( Monad m ) => ( from -> part -> m ( Maybe part , to ) ) -> whole -> m ( Maybe whole )
The definition above is final .
Instead of id , the trivial , one - stop walk from an incoming direction from is now defined by
stop :: from ->
Walk from
After a a stop from visit = liftM fst .
visit from
To test the definitions so far and engender a sense of achievement , let us write a visitor that simply prints out the visited part and continues .
To describe what it means to continue , we define a type class Next .
class ( From from , To to , Show from , Read to ) =>
Next from to where next :: from -> to instance Next Before After where next Before = After
To exalt the beauty of each visited part , our tourist operates in the IO monad .
tourist :: ( Next from to , Show part ) => from -> part -> IO ( Maybe part , to ) tourist from part = do putStrLn ( show from ++ " : " ++ show part ) return ( Nothing , next from )
Look !
After paying an exorbitant admission fee , you can see an entire term all at once from the observation deck .
* WalkZip1 > stop Before tourist term Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) )
Nothing
We can also define a more hands - on visitor .
tourist ' :: ( Next from to ) => from -> Term -> IO ( Maybe Term , to ) tourist ' from part = do putStrLn ( show from ++ " : " ++ show part ) return ( Just ( V " poof " ) , next from )
This visitor just ca n’t help but wonder what that button over there is for .
* WalkZip1 > stop Before tourist ' term Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) )
Just ( V " poof " )
To finish off this post , let us define a less trivial walk : given a data value of type b , we can visit each of its components of type a .
The code below performs the actual traversal using gmapM and mkM from the Scrap Your Boilerplate library .
The rest of the code looks messy , but it ’s just using the writer monad transformer ( runWriterT , lift , tell ) over the logical - or monoid ( Any ) to remember whether any part changed ( dirty ) .
What ’s more interesting is that gwalk defined below is a walk transformer : it maps one walk ( such as stop Before ) to another .
gwalk :: ( Typeable a , Data b ) =>
Walk from to part a ->
Walk from to part b gwalk walk visit a = do ( a ' , Any dirty ) <- runWriterT ( gmapM ( mkM f ) a ) return ( scavenge dirty a ' ) where f part = do part ' <- lift ( walk visit part ) tell ( Any ( isJust part ' ) ) return ( fromMaybe part part ' )
The helper function scavenge throws away a new whole if no part changed .
scavenge :: Bool -> a ->
Maybe a scavenge True a = Just a scavenge False _ = Nothing
We can now traverse the immediate subterms of a term and change them .
* WalkZip1 > gwalk ( stop Before ) tourist ' term Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) )
Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Just ( A ( V " poof " ) ( V " poof " ) )
As depicted in the pictures above , so far we can only move right .
The next post will show how to move down and up .
We will then turn ( from ) walks to zippers .
MADISON , Wis .
Officer Brent Plisch drove off to start his shift with the campus police , as all around this college town the planets were aligned for undergraduate excess .
It was Friday night of the Labor Day long weekend , the eve of the first football game for the highly ranked Wisconsin Badgers .
Classes for the fall semester had yet to begin , so there was no homework to tug at the student conscience for moderation , much less temperance .
Sure enough , half past midnight , Officer Plisch got a call in his cruiser from three other policemen .
They had spotted a young woman woozily negotiating a pedestrian bridge between two dorms .
When they questioned her , she could n’t spell her name or remember her address .
Her breath test showed a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit .
Staring with both scrutiny and compassion into the woman ’s glazed eyes , Officer Plisch and the others considered taking her to a detox center .
They elicited her name and address from a dorm friend , so that the next day , when , presumably , the woman would be sober and aware , they could serve her with a summons for under - age drinking .
And there , under the university ’s guidelines , the matter would most certainly not end .
A few days later , a dean would be required to review the night ’s police log and call in the woman for a discussion .
Then , in all likelihood , that dean would telephone the woman ’s parents to inform them .
MEXICO CITY --
After a humiliating defeat in Mexico's
presidential election last year , Roberto Madrazo appeared to be
back on top :
He 'd won the men's age - 55 category in the Sept. 30
Berlin Marathon with a surprising time of 2:41:12 .
But Madrazo could n't leave his reputation for shady dealings in
the dust .
Race officials said Monday they disqualified him for
apparently taking a shortcut -- an electronic tracking chip
indicates he skipped two checkpoints in the race and would have
needed superhuman speed to achieve his win .
According to the chip , Madrazo took only 21 minutes to cover
nine miles -- faster than any human can run .
" Not even the world
record holder can go that fast , '' race director Mark Milde said .
In a photograph taken as he crossed the finish line , Madrazo
wears an ear - to - ear grin and pumps his arms in the air .
But he also
wore a wind breaker , hat and long , skintight running pants -- too
much clothing , some said , for a person who had just run 26.2 miles
in 60 - degree weather .
Madrazo's outfit caught the attention of the New York - based
marathon photographer Victor Sailer , who alerted race organizers
that they might have a cheater on their hands .
" It was so obvious to me , if you look at everyone else that 's
in the picture , everyone 's wearing T - shirts and shorts , and the
guy 's got a jacket on and a hat or whatever , '' Sailer said .
" I
looked at it and was like , wait a second . ''
The world record for 15 kilometers -- the distance Madrazo
covered in 21 minutes -- is 41 minutes 29 seconds , by Felix Limo of
Kenya .
At a Mexico City taxi stand on Monday , drivers Octavio Elizalde
Cerrillo and Roberto Valle Rivera poked fun at Madrazo's troubles .
They , like other Mexicans their age , lived under decades of
uninterrupted rule by Madrazo's Institutional Revolutionary Party ,
which often resorted to fraud to win elections , leaving many deeply
distrustful of politicians .
" If he 's a cheat at one thing , he 'll cheat at anything , '' said
Valle Rivera , 44 .
" If you 're going to steal , you 'll steal here , in the United
States , in Europe , everywhere in the world , '' Elizalde Cerrillo ,
41 , added with a smile .
Madrazo's reputation at home was already tarnished .
In 1996 ,
Mexico 's attorney general confirmed reports that he had spent tens
of millions of dollars more than the legal campaign spending limit
in his winning 1994 bid for the Tabasco state governorship .
While under investigation on those charges , Madrazo told police
he was kidnapped for seven hours , beaten and threatened with death
by unidentified assailants .
Police could n't find evidence of any
such abduction , and many saw it as a sympathy ploy .
During the 2006 presidential campaign , opponents plastered walls
with posters reading , " Do you believe Madrazo ?
I do n't either ! ''
In June , Madrazo completed the San Diego marathon with a time of
3:44:06 , more than an hour slower than his time in Berlin , Mexican
newspaper Reforma reported .
Madrazo's office did not return phone
calls from The Associated Press .
Race director Milde noted that Madrazo may have intended to drop
out and taken a shortcut to reach the start - finish area .
" I do n't know if it was his intention or accidental : I try to
believe in the good of people , '' Milde said .
But the fact that
Madrazo appears to be celebrating in the photograph could go
against this theory , he added .
Some 32,500 people finished the race and about 40 are
disqualified every year , Milde said .
By Martin Bosworth
Today former Virginia governor Mark Warner ( a Democrat ) announced his plan to run for the Senate seat currently held by retiring Republican John Warner ( no relation ) .
Within moments of the announcement , a flamewar broke out among the progressive netroots .
Matt Stoller called Warner ’s announcement “ Liebermanesque ” and said he was too centrist to be a real Democrat .
Lowell at Raising Kaine supported Warner and called out Stoller for slamming Democrats .
Stoller ’s old partner at MyDD ( and former Warner consultant ) Jerome Armstrong also smacked Stoller .
This whole thing mystified me at first , but the more I think about it , the more this idea makes sense :
Warner himself is n’t necessarily the issue , but it ’s what his candidacy stands for that ’s causing the division–a split between the faction that supports
Dems in office at all costs , and the faction that wants truly partisan Dems rather than DINOs ( Dems In Name Only ) .
I never really understood why some people were so hot for Mark Warner .
He was a successful governor and won great popularity for developing solutions from compromises and collaboration , true .
He ’s also big into technology –remember his foray into Second Life ? –and that definitely appealed to the technophilic aspect of the “ netroots . ”
Overall , he ’s got that whole “ white Southern male who is n’t a racist or ignoramus ” vibe that gives the likes of Mudcat Saunders hot flashes .
But he never really struck me as presidential material , and I could n’t figure out what made him so appealing to Armstrong and the other opinion leaders of the time–and why he ’s causing such a row now .
But since 2004 , we ’ve had a Democratic majority take over Congress , many of whom were centrist Democrats ( like Jim Webb , a former Reaganite Republican ) that were eagerly bolstered and supported by the netroots as the kind of Dems we need to build long - term victories .
Of course , it was many of those same Democrats who promptly folded like origami on the two biggest issues in front of them –the Iraq war spending and the FISA authorization .
So I can understand why Stoller ’s angry –do we really need yet more “ centrist ” Democrats who claim to be “ above partisan politics , ” and whose idea of collaboration involves basically giving Republicans whatever they want ?
Of course not .
Electing Democrats just for the sake of electing Democrats is a crap idea , particularly when they end up crapping out on you .
But is Warner going to be one of those people ?
That , I can not answer .
He is worshiped like a God by Virginia ’s Democrats , and living in D.C. , I can tell you from experience that it ’ll be years before Virginia elects a Senator who ’s a progressive even on the level of John Edwards , let alone Bernie Sanders .
The state is trending more left in urban enclaves like Alexandria , but once you get out of the NOVA region , it ’s as right - wing as they come .
So the fact that Virginia could have even one Democratic Senator , let alone two , is a minor miracle .
But is having Democrats in office enough if they simply support Republican policies every step of the way ?
It is n’t for me , and the Warner candidacy will be a very crucial test of the strength of the two factions–and how much support each one can pull from voters and pundits alike .
9/14 UPDATE : Matt , in the comments , reminded me that he never actually said Warner was n’t a real Democrat , so I apologize for implying that .
Matt ’s also offered his own mea culpas about some of the things he said , and the discussion about Warner and what his candidacy could mean for Virginia has had some fascinating insights offered .
If Warner is indeed in favor of net neutrality , that ’s another mark in his favor in my book .
Is P2P the future in the fight against spam ?
Today the Open Relay Database ( ORDB ) announced that it will shut down by the end of the year .
From the ORDB website ORDB has been used to collect the IP addresses of so - called open SMTP relays - mail servers that allow people to send e-mails without prior authorization .
Open SMTP relays have in the past been the major source of spam mail .
System administrators used to use the ORDB database information to selectively block or pre-filter e-mail from known relays .
The nature of spam has changed substantially in the last few years however .
Spammers now prefer to use P2P botnets that are controlled by Trojans like Spamthru .
Secureworks analyzed Spamthru in October The SecureWorks team has since concluded that more than 73.000 PCs worldwide are controled by Spamthru .
Now anti-spam activists are thinking about beating the spammers with their own weapons .
The idea : P2P tools are supposed to block spam better than solutions that rely on centrally maintained databases .
Many users are having high hopes for the Okopipi project - a P2P anti-spam tool that is going to be based on Gnunet Okopipi is thought to be a P2P replacement for Bluefrog - a community - based , but centrally administered anti-spam project that was run by a company called Blue Security .
Bluefrog shut down this May after being bombarded by a massive Denial of Service attack that also briefly knocked out Typepad.com and other websites .
The Okopipi development has stalled recently , but the developer promises to revive his effords early next year :
After 2000 , I thought something was up ( as did many others ) .
But I thought it was more related to the butterfly ballot and a horrific Supreme Court decision that could n’t even be cited as precedent and would ultimately be the impetus for change in the right direction .
Man was I wrong .
As the next few years passed , I became more and more suspicious , but after the 2004 election , there were too many others that said , " move along , nothing to see here " or " it ’s always been like this , so what are you going to do about it ? "
And as more and more information came out , whether it was through the most excellent Brad Blog , Talking Points Memo , ePluribus Media or even through Black Box Voting ( which , while certainly far from perfect , it did keep this issue out in the open ) and the reports of exit polls being so far off for the first time ever that it defied all logic and reason , there was more and more suspicion .
But it was really just that – suspicion and a growing suspicion .
However , the US Attorney purge has really opened the door to a number of , frankly shocking , issues , events and " coincidences " that certainly go a long way towards confirming a concerted effort by the republican party ( as well as the RNC itself ) , this administration , the Department of Justice , Diebold and republican linked organizations to either manipulate the votes , disenfranchise large numbers of probably Democratic voters , change the makeup of voting districts , purge the voting rolls and otherwise skew the elections or give the republicans a distinct advantage .
Hence , I am not using the terms " voter fraud " or " voting fraud " – but am consciously using " election fraud " – which to me indicates that there was intent to skew the actual election process in favor of republicans .
I will try to keep the tin foil hattery to a minimum and not provide any of my personal thoughts or assertions .
But what I hope to do here is to provide some of the major pieces to a puzzle that to me would certainly give a large amount of evidence that something massive was going on with respect to ensuring the " permanent republican majority " that Tom DeLay and Karl Rove envisioned .
The US Attorney Purge
I ’ll start with this , because it is the most recent , and instead of the allegations and statistics that have been used in the past , this shows ( at least to me ) a more than coincidental connection between the replacement of US Attorneys and their willingness to pursue voter fraud cases and other cases that would " assist " republicans in certain elections which were thought to be close .
I am not going to provide the background of the purge , but will indicate that there were a few things that should be noted :
Let ’s look at a few of these Attorneys :
Washington District Attorney John McKay , a man who received excellent performance reviews , was fired .
And coincidentally , his dismissal is widely speculated to have been related to his not bringing ( nonexistent ) voter fraud charges in the 2004 Gubernatorial election .
New Mexico District Attorney David Iglesias was added to the list of attorneys to be fired on Election Day 2006 after being threatened by NM Senator Pete Dominici ( a republican ) for not bringing corruption charges against a Democrat before the 2006 election ( specifically public corruption charges of Albuquerque 's Metropolitan Courthouse construction ) .
Dominici reached out to Karl Rove directly in order to have Iglesias dismissed after both he and NM Representative Heather Wilson leaned on Iglesias to bring indictments before Election Day 2006 .
Arkansas District Attorney Bud Cummins , the one US Attorney that Alberto Gonzales and his team backtracked from earlier assertions of " performance related dismissal " , was replaced with Tim Griffin , who worked under Karl Rove at the Republican National Committee .
Griffin had a large role in " caging " during the 2004 elections :
Another of the most important reasons why Griffin 's appointment deserves a harder look is from his involvement in " caging , " which " appeared to be " a Republican Party effort to challenge the ballots of thousands of voters in largely African American communities through mailings targeting those who were serving in Iraq .
Since they were stationed out of country , they were not at the address to which the mailings were sent , and the letters were returned as " not deliverable , " establishing " cause " to strike the intended recipients from the voter roles .
Who sent the originating email with respect to this caging " program " ?
Tim Griffin .
Griffin is now being investigated FOR VOTER FRAUD for his role in the caging scheme .
Additionally , Murray Waas recently reported that the White House was concealing emails that linked Rove to Griffin ’s hiring :
The Bush administration has withheld a series of e-mails from Congress showing that senior White House and Justice Department officials worked together to conceal the role of Karl Rove in installing Timothy Griffin , a protégé of Rove 's , as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas .
The withheld records show that D. Kyle Sampson , who was then - chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , consulted with White House officials in drafting two letters to Congress that appear to have misrepresented the circumstances of Griffin 's appointment as U.S. attorney and of Rove 's role in supporting Griffin .
New Jersey District Attorney Chris Christie was on the November 1 , 2006 list as well as an earlier list in January 2006 ( contrary to prior reports ) , which would appear to be a " cover " for other US Attorneys that were to be fired .
Christie seems to be one who would n’t make any list that would be penalizing those who were n’t " loyal Bushies " , since he was a " Bush Pioneer " in 2000 , " raising " over $ 100,000 for Bush .
Additionally , the 2006 NJ Senate race was a pretty close one for much of the year , and during September 2006 , there were leaks to the press about a corruption probe into Democratic Senator Menendez .
While this was meant to give Kean a push , it was not only largely dismissed by the Philadelphia Inquirer at the time but nothing ever came of the probe .
My guess is that Christie was put on the list as a cover for some of the other attorneys and there was little to no intention to ever fire him , but it could also be due to the fact that his probe into Menendez did n’t result in Kean winning the election .
Western Missouri District Attorney Todd Graves was dismissed in March 2006 , replaced by Bradley Schlozman ( a man with no prosecutorial experience ) .
Schlozman was a political appointee to the Justice Department ’s Voting Rights Section ( remember this group as I will discuss it in detail below ) before being appointed as replacement for Graves .
The reason behind this change ?
Voter fraud prosecutions :
Then , in March 2006 , Graves was replaced by a new US attorney -- one who had no prosecutorial experience and bypassed Senate confirmation .
Bradley Schlozman moved aggressively where Graves had not , announcing felony indictments of four workers for a liberal activist group on voter registration fraud charges less than a week before the 2006 election .
Republicans , who had been pushing for restrictive new voting laws , applauded .
But critics said Schlozman violated a department policy to wait until after an election to bring voter fraud indictments if the case could affect the outcome , either by becoming a campaign issue or by scaring legitimate voters into staying home .
Also recently reported by the McClatchy Washington Bureau was a story indicating the White House was urging the Justice Department to pursue voting fraud cases against Democrats in three states BEFORE the 2006 elections :
Only weeks before last year 's pivotal midterm elections , the White House urged the Justice Department to pursue voter - fraud allegations against Democrats in three battleground states , a high - ranking Justice official has told congressional investigators .
In two instances in October 2006 , President Bush 's political adviser , Karl Rove , or his deputies passed the allegations on to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' then - chief of staff , Kyle Sampson .
Sampson tapped Gonzales aide Matthew Friedrich , who'd just left his post as chief of staff of the criminal division .
In the first case , Friedrich agreed to find out whether Justice officials knew of " rampant " voter fraud or " lax " enforcement in parts of New Mexico , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , and report back .
All in all , these are five examples of situations where the US Attorneys were directly involved in some actions around an election which had the potential to swing or impact an election .
Those that went along kept their jobs or were promoted while those who did not were removed and replaced .

The Voting Rights Section at the Department of Justice
I mentioned this above with respect to Western Missouri ’s Attorney Bradley Schlozman .
The issue here involves Schlozman , the Voting Rights Section ’s ( " VRS " ) Special Counsel , Robert Popper and a host of others .
But , consider that the Voting Rights Section is supposed to enforce the Voting Rights Act , the Help America Vote Act , protect minority rights in redistricting , make sure that voters are not disenfranchised and are able to have their votes counted .
Makes sense , yes ?
Now consider the following ( much of this can be found in a prior diary of mine ) :
In the Boston Globe article linked above , there was the following quote about Schlozman ’s tenure at the Voting Rights Section :
There , he came into conflict with veteran staff over his decisions to approve a Texas redistricting plan and a Georgia photo - ID voting law , both of which benefited Republicans .
He also hired many new career lawyers with strong conservative credentials , in what critics say was an attempt to reduce enforcement of laws designed to eliminate obstacles to voting by minorities .
" Schlozman was reshaping the Civil Rights Division , " said Joe Rich , who was chief of the voting rights section until taking a buyout in 2005 , in an interview .
" Schlozman did n't know anything about voting law .
. . .
All he knew is he wanted to be sure that the Republicans were going to win . "
With respect to Special Counsel Robert Popper , consider the following :
Popper has vast experience with redistricting cases – but in a way that challenges old district lines in order to redraw them " more fairly " – focusing almost exclusively on redrawing largely minority districts ( a 1996 case deals with the largely minority 12th district in New York ;
Other cases being pursued by the Voting Rights Section ( signed by Alberto Gonzales and Robert Popper ) target districts for " not properly eliminating ineligible voters from the voting rolls " .
As opposed to making sure that voters CAN vote – they are focusing on cleansing ( my word ) the voting rolls – again , in districts that have had a large increase in Democratic registrations or are largely minority districts .
This includes a questionable case in Alabama , cases in New Jersey , in Maine and Indiana all dealing with the purging of voter rolls or not using electronic voting machines ;
Over 50 % of the career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division have been forced out in one way or another over the past two years ;
These attorneys were replaced largely with people affiliated with the Federalist Society or the Republican National Lawyers Association ; and
Less than half of these " new attorneys " have little to no experience in civil rights cases at all .
There are more examples in an excellent ePluribus Media story , including the following quote from one of the career attorneys who was forced out :
" Political appointees made it quite clear that they did not wish to draw on the expertise and institutional knowledge of career attorneys .
Instead , there appeared to be a conscious effort to remake the Division 's career staff . "
A recent editorial in the LA Times contained this observation of the Justice Department under the Bush administration :
Under the Bush administration , however , all that changed .
Over the last six years , this Justice Department has ignored the advice of its staff and skewed aspects of law enforcement in ways that clearly were intended to influence the outcome of elections .
It has notably shirked its legal responsibility to protect voting rights .
From 2001 to 2006 , no voting discrimination cases were brought on behalf of African American or Native American voters .
U.S. attorneys were told instead to give priority to voter fraud cases , which , when coupled with the strong support for voter ID laws , indicated an intent to depress voter turnout in minority and poor communities .
Given the numerous instances of reports asserting the destruction of Democratic party voter registrations in numerous states , as well as the numerous reports of irregularities around the country , none of these were pursued by the VRS .
Yet , the VRS , under Popper , Schlozman and Gonzales , chose to pursue cases where it would curtail the rights of people to have their votes counted .

2002 - New Hampshire Phone Jamming and Georgia ’s " Miracle Win By Chambliss "
In 2002 , John Sununu won a close Senate race .
On Election Day 2002 , there were charges of " phone jamming " the Democrats ’ get out the vote efforts .
While Sununu probably would have won even without this , there was ultimately the conviction of three NH Republican Party officials of violating Federal Communications Law :
[ Charles ] McGee and two other participants -- Republican National Committee regional political director James Tobin and GOP consultant Allen Raymond -- have been found guilty of criminally violating federal communications law .
Tobin will be sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Concord , N.H .
It should be noted that right before the phone jamming scheme , there were two $ 5,000 contributions from Jack Abramoff clients as well as another $ 5,000 from Tom DeLay ’s " Americans for a Republican Majority " PAC .
********************
This paled in comparison to what went on in Georgia in 2002 .
An article in the September 21 , 2006 Rolling Stone by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. contained a discussion with a Diebold consultant who was involved with the Georgia election in 2002 .
Now , this was one of the first in which the Diebold machines were used , and was also the election where Saxby Chambliss came from a five to six point deficit the week of the election to win by seven points – a near statistical impossibility .
While this was dubbed a " miracle " , there was much more to it than met the eye .
Essentially , as described by Christopher Hood ( the former Diebold consultant ) , Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox basically " outsourced " the entire 2002 election process – the training , setting up of machines , counting the votes , etc. to Diebold .
As Hood described , there were unapproved and unauthorized software patches put in around the time of the Georgia primary :
Then , one muggy day in mid-August , Hood was surprised to see the president of Diebold 's election unit , Bob Urosevich , arrive in Georgia from his headquarters in Texas .
With the primaries looming , Urosevich was personally distributing a " patch , " a little piece of software designed to correct glitches in the computer program .
" We were told that it was intended to fix the clock in the system , which it did n't do , " Hood says .
" The curious thing is the very swift , covert way this was done . "
---snip---
" It was an unauthorized patch , and they were trying to keep it secret from the state , " Hood told me .
" We were told not to talk to county personnel about it .
I received instructions directly from Urosevich .
It was very unusual that a president of the company would give an order like that and be involved at that level . "
--- snip---
According to Hood , Diebold employees altered software in some 5,000 machines in DeKalb and Fulton counties - the state 's largest Democratic strongholds .
To avoid detection , Hood and others on his team entered warehouses early in the morning .
" We went in at 7:30 a.m. and were out by 11 , " Hood says .
" There was a universal key to unlock the machines , and it 's easy to get access .
The machines in the warehouses were unlocked .
We had control of everything .
The state gave us the keys to the castle , so to speak , and they stayed out of our way . "
Hood personally patched fifty - six machines and witnessed the patch being applied to more than 1,200 others .
All emphasis here is mine .
During 2003 , A number of reports and presentations were made throughout the United States showing why the Diebold machines should not be certified for use in elections .
I ’ll also point out that California unanimously voted to have the Secretary of State decertify the machines in 2004 , and was considering bringing charges against the firm related to use of these machines .
However , the machines were still widely used during the 2004 elections .
*********************
2004 Texas Redistricting
For those who forget the gerrymandering of the Texas House Districts which was engineered by Tom DeLay , I ’ll make brief mention of it here .
Through DeLay ’s two PACs ( Texans for a Republican Majority and Americans for a Republican Majority ) , the newly republican Texas Legislature in 2003 tried to ram through a redistricting plan which was hotly contested by the Democrats .
The the redistricting case ultimately went to the Supreme Court , who partially overturned in 2006 , and there were two walkouts by Democrats in the Texas Legislature – precluding a quorum from existing and allowing the redistricting to occur .
The Justice Department ruled that this violated the Voting Rights Act. Republicans gained 4 or 5 seats from this redistricting alone .
2004 Election – Ohio .
The " fruits " of their labor
Without beating this to death , there were so many issues with the 2004 election , I ’ll just make mention of them – mainly since this is already getting long , many people already know of most of these and they really are more symptoms than the root cause of the larger point of the diary .
But , I will provide links to these and a brief description of the " issues and irregularities " – pretty much all of which favored Bush and the republicans .
There was Ohio , and anything related to Ohio is not complete without Georgia10 ’s excellent writeup from January 2005 and eRiposte ’s roundup of overall voter suppression / intimidation / suppression items from 2004 .
I want to point out here that the following issues with Ohio may not be the " proof " that the election was stolen , and I am not really interested in giving my opinion of this here anyway .
What I want to do with Ohio is to provide a summary of the major issues that have been pointed out in the past .
As I also said in my opening , I am also not discussing the exit poll discrepancies in Ohio , Florida , Pennsylvania or any other states , as even though I think it is highly fishy , there are a number of postings and people who doubt the methodology and accuracy , or do n’t think this rises to a level of " fraud " .
Needless to say , I think that the exit polls are n’t really as pertinent to the larger picture of what I am laying out here .
They are quite possibly " proof " or support for the " fruits of the larger picture " of election fraud .
However , for my purpose here , the following merely serves as examples of what this effort could produce on election day .
That all being said , consider the following :
Extremely long lines in minority and predominantly Democratic districts .
Nearly 100 voting machines staying in storage when they were desperately needed in such districts ( I ’ll point out that there was very little waiting time in republican districts ) .
So many " errors and issues " that would necessitate a recount , just based on the number of issues alone .
Widespread voter suppression tactics , including " Democrats vote on November 3 " flyers .
The nonexistent terror threat in Warren County that precluded anyone from watching the votes be counted .
Secretary of State Ken Blackwell ’s connection to Florida 2000 , the decision regarding voter registrations being on a certain weight paper and his being co-Chair of Bush ’s reelection committee .
The incredibly high voter turnout ( 131 % in the Clyde precinct ) in republican counties and just as incredibly low turnout ( as low as 7 % ) in Democratic counties .
The " fixed Ohio recount " , where the tallies and counties were pre-selected .
There are many more , but I do n’t want this to become a rehashing of what happened in Ohio .
Again , this is not to say that every one of these ( 1 ) are related or ( 2 ) indicative of a centralized effort to commit voter fraud .
However , nearly all of the irregularities and issues favored Bush and the republicans .
This also does n’t provide proof that there was hacking of the voting machines either .
Yet , there were still 4,000 votes for Bush in a precinct that had 600 total voters , and too large of a number of widespread issues that were all targeting Democrats .
This is not something that can all be the result of isolated incidents .
Again , these are more " suppression " tactics that can be linked back to decisions made by Blackwell , who was linked to Bush ’s re-election campaign .
********************
Conclusion
Of course , there was the comment made by Rep.
Peter King in the fall of 2004 indicating that " it ’s all over but the counting , and we ’ll take care of the counting " .
There were the exit poll discrepancies , and while there has been much debate over whether there was a problem with the way the exit polls were conducted , it is interesting to note that exit polls have been as close to the best indicator of a fair election for decades in scores of countries .
The same exit polls that led to allegations of fraud and massive protests in the Ukraine right after our own 2004 elections .
they do lead to questions ( updated so as to not distract from the true intent of the diary )
There was also the proclamation by Diebold Executive Walden O’Dell that he would deliver Ohio ’s electoral votes to Bush .
But the hundreds of instances of irregularities , suppression , disenfranchisement and possible fraud in the 2004 election are merely symptoms of the larger issue .
Maybe Peter King was kidding when he uttered those words on the White House lawn and maybe O’Dell was just saying this as a Bush supporter – but sometimes the truth comes out in jest as well .
From my perspective , the whole " permanent republican majority " meme was something that really resonated .
What is happening at the Voting Rights Section in the DOJ , and what has happened with the voting machine security issues , especially in light of them being run by businesses that are very cozy to the republican party .
There are also other things that can not be explained at this time which may play a part as well .
For example , what was in those missing emails that Rove deleted ?
What was the purpose of the wiretapping program that even had Ashcroft not want to recertify it ?
What was being done with the data mining rooms at AT&T and other facilities ?
Maybe it had nothing to do with keeping the " permanent republican majority " .
Maybe it did – but either way , there is ample evidence that the republicans over the past six years have put many things into place that " had the appearance " of tilting the scales in favor of republicans – not just on or around election day , but all throughout the Justice Department , the RNC , the Secretary of State in " key battleground states " , through destroying voter registrations and through Political Action Committees ( at least in NH and Texas , if not other states as well ) .
As I said last week , this cuts right to the heart of our democracy .
Update [ 2007-5-18 11:17:20 by clammyc ] :
Please see this comment from AlanF for some updates on the Rush Holt bill and other links .
Front paged at Booman Tribune , ePluribus Media and My Left Wing
In the late 1960s and early ’ 70s , then US President Richard Nixon appealed to the country ’s " Silent Majority " to oppose growing anti-Vietnam War sentiment in the United States .
A decade later , President Ronald Reagan had the Rev. Jerry Falwell ’s " Moral Majority " working by his side in support of Reagan ’s low - intensity warfare in Central America , and contra movements in Africa .
During the run-up to , and period following the 1994 Republican revolution that gave that conservative party control of Congress for the first time in decades , the high - profile Georgia legislator Newt Gingrich ’s band had the Rev. Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed ’s Christian Coalition stirring the conservative grassroots into action against the Bill Clinton administration .
Now , in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration , Gary Bauer , a former Reagan administration official and longtime conservative activist , is heading up a new organization aimed at countering liberal groups like MoveOn.org , and supporting President Bush ’s global " war on terror . ”
The " Forgotten Americans Coalition " is composed of a number of veteran conservative leaders , including the American Family Association ’s Dr. Don Wildmon , Christian Broadcasting Network ’s Robertson , the Free Congress Foundation ’s Paul Weyrich , and Tim LaHaye , the co-author of the wildly popular " Left Behind " series of apocalyptic novels , and his wife , Beverly , the founder of Concerned Women for America .
Just prior to their testimony before Congress of General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on the situation in Iraq , the Forgotten Americans Coalition ( FAC ) issued a Declaration " warning Americans of the catastrophic consequences of a US withdrawal from Iraq . "
" Many of the [ 44 ] signers  who lead organizations with millions of members  are usually associated with issues like abortion , marriage and the family .
Still , they feel compelled to speak out against a cut - and - run strategy being pushed by isolationists inside and beyond the confines of Congress , " Bauer said in a FAC press release .
Don Feder , a conservative columnist and a member of the FAC steering committee observed : " By signing this declaration , religious conservatives are saying : ‘ Yes , we care about marriage , the family and the unborn .
But we also care about national security , the morale of our servicemen and women and the war on terrorism . ’
The left , which thinks neocons are the only ones on the right opposing an Iraq withdrawal , had better think again . "
But critics like Fred Clarkson , co-founder of the blog TalkToAction , says the coalition appears to be " a classic inside the beltway paper tiger . ”
" It does n’t exist except to issue ‘ messages ’ to true believers and to make it appear in the media that there is more support for a failed foreign policy than really exists , " he told IPS .
" It smacks of a desperation move to shore up support even among religious conservatives , whose support for the war seems to be melting faster than the polar ice cap . "
Rob Boston , the assistant director of communications for the civil liberties watchdog group Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , agreed that the Forgotten Americans Coalition could be " just another Astroturf [ rather than grassroots ] organization . "
" But if we assume this is a serious effort , " Boston told IPS , " it appears to be an attempt to create a ‘ public relations surge ’ among the far right to match the military one . "
Although support for the Iraq war has pretty much disintegrated among the general population , " many religious right leaders have not wavered , " Boston pointed out .
" Bauer , for example , was among a coterie of religious right leaders who met with Bush at the White House Feb. 1 for an update on the war .
Bauer and his allies tend to view the war through a sectarian lens with the US leading the way against ‘ Islamo - fascism . ’
It ’s a type of new crusade , " Boston added .
The declaration , entitled , " The Tragic Consequences of a US Withdrawal From Iraq " , is FAC ’s first public project .
It says in part that " The Iraq war must be seen in the broader context of Islamo - fascism ’s war on America and Western Civilization …
If we pull out now , or announce a timetable for withdrawal , the region will be destabilized and Israel further endangered .
Iran and Syria , two legs of the axis of evil , will become far more powerful … "
" It took 20 years to recover from the demoralizing experience of our failure in Vietnam , " the document reads .
" How will we convince young Americans to enlist in the next effort to combat terrorism , if  by withdrawing now  we tacitly admit that more than 3,600 of our service men and women died in vain ? "
" The coalition ’s declaration shows us how closely top religious right leaders have hitched their wagon to the star of neoconservative militarism , " Clarkson observed .
" These leaders have made it clear , like Bush , that there is no going back .
They are also at considerable pains to try to show that the religious right ’s concern about domestic culture has anything to do with an unjustifiable war on the other side of the world . "
In a column dated Sep. 14 , Bauer wrote that " what ’s most striking " about FAC " is the involvement of dozens of religious and family values leaders .
Historically , values organizations have been reluctant to engage in foreign policy .
But six years into a struggle that has reshaped understandings of the relationship between war and duty , our unique coalition reaffirms a fundamental insight : Victory is a values issue .
We believe defeat at the hands of an ideology that worships death would be immoral . "
Reading straight out of the Bush administration playbook , Bauer added : " Values voters also recognize that the battle against Islamic extremism , with Iraq as its central front , and their decades - long battle against materialism and cultural relativism are in fact two fronts in the same war for our survival …
In a very real sense , victory in Iraq is inextricably linked not only with victory in the larger war on terror but also with our ability to protect our cherished values at home . "
But in Clarkson ’s view , " The cold war conservatives had an identity crisis when the cold war ended .
But thanks to the neoconservative program , framed by Samuel Huntington ’s clash of civilizations thesis , cold war ideology is being revived in the form of anti-Islamism , and these leaders of the religious right are completely on board . "
Americans United ’s Rob Boston also connected the founding of FAC to the 2008 US presidential election .
" Gary Bauer undoubtedly also wants to use the war on terror to energize the far - right base in advance of the 2008 election .
They need some new issues .
You can only pass so many constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage in the states , and the immigrant - bashing is getting a little tiresome , " he noted .
Mr. Saslove said that people like Prince Bandar , who is now the secretary general of the Saudi National Security Council and is not spending as much time in the United States as he once did , helped establish Aspen ’s newer style , which is much more about family , culture and art — and wealth that even Hollywood stars cannot match .
“ I do n’t see as much braggadocio as I used to , ” said Mr. Saslove , a gruff 66 - year - old with longish hair and a nonstop Blackberry .
In his 22 years as Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to the United States , a tenure that ended in 2005 , Prince Bandar was a powerful ally to a succession of presidents .
Most recently , however , British media accounts have said that a major British arms contractor paid more than $ 2 billion clandestinely into bank accounts in Washington controlled by Prince Bandar .
The prince has denied the allegations .

At 56,000 square feet , Hala is bigger than the White House , with a staff of 12 .
It has 15 bedrooms , 16 baths , a private barbershop and beauty salon just off the master suite and enough space for a party of 450 people .
Many of the rooms are huge , with banks of windows overlooking the Aspen valley and the mountains beyond .
There are few proclamations of grandiosity beyond the occasional artwork , like the Albert Bierstadt painting that hangs over the main fireplace .
( It does not come with the house . )
Dark , gleaming wood beams , all with notched construction and not a single nailhead showing , pale plaster walls and television screens dominate the decor .
It is not a house for a family that putters in the kitchen , which is in the basement , the province of professional chefs with its stainless - steel everything and rows of hanging pots .
Housekeepers were ironing the sheets in the nearby laundry , feeding them through a giant pressing machine .
Do n't Argue With The Gay Flight Attendant
My flight was being served by an obviously gay flight attendant , who was camping it up outrageously .
He seemed to put everyone in a good mood as he served us food and drinks .
As the plane prepared to descend , he came swishing down the aisle and told us " Captain Marvey has asked me to announce that he 'll be landing the big scary plane shortly , so lovely people , if you could just put your trays up , that would be super . "
On his trip back up the aisle , he noticed an extremely well - dressed and exotic young woman had n't moved a muscle .
" Perhaps you did n't hear me over those big brute engines but I asked you to raise your tray , so the main man can pitty - pat us on the ground . "
She calmly turned her head and said , " In my country , I am called a Princess and I take orders from no one . "
To which the flight attendant replied , without missing a beat , " Well , sweet - cheeks , in my country I 'm called a Queen , so I outrank you .
Tray up , Bitch . "
... and who knows , perhaps this was on Southwest ?
... or Westjet ?

As you root through genomic sequences – and there are more and more of them to root through these days – you come across some stretches of DNA that hardly seem to vary at all .
The hard - core “ ultraconserved ” parts , first identified in 2004 , are absolutely identical between mice , rats , and humans .
Our last common ancestor was rather a long time ago ( I know , I know – everyone works with some people who seem to be exceptions , but bear with me ) , so these things are rather well - preserved .
Even important enzyme sequences vary a bit among the three species , so what could these pristine stretches ( some of which are hundreds of base pairs long ) be used for ?
The assumption , naturally , has been that whatever it is , it must be mighty important , but if we ’re going to be scientists , we ca n’t just go around assuming that what we think must be right .
A team at Lawrence Berkeley and the DOE put things to the test recently by identifying four of the ultraconserved elements that all seem to be located next to critical genes – and deleting them .
The knockout mice turned out to do something very surprising indeed .
They were born normally , but then they grew up normally .
When they reached adulthood , though , they were completely normal .
Exhaustive biochemical and behavioral tests finally uncovered the truth : they ’re basically indistinguishable from the wild type .
Hey , I told you it was surprising .
This must have been the last thing that the researchers expected .
Reaction to these results has been a series of raised eyebrows and furrowed foreheads .
Deleting any of the known genes near the ultraconserved sequences confirms that they , anyway , are as important as they ’re billed to be .
And these genes show the usual level of difference that you see among the three species .
So what ’s this unchanged , untouchable , but apparently disposable stuff in there with them ?
No one knows .
And it ’s a real puzzle , the answer to which is going to be tangled up with a lot of our basic ideas about genes and evolution .
To a good first approximation , it ’s hard to see how ( or why ) something like this should be going on .
So what , exactly , are we missing ?
Something important ?
And if so , what else have we missed , too ?
Small science has big potential , say scientists
US scientists have unveiled a detector thousands of times smaller than the diameter of a human hair that can translate radio waves into sound .
According to a University of California team , the study marks the first time that a nano - sized detector has been demonstrated in a working radio system .
Made of carbon nanotubes a few atoms across , it is almost 1,000 times smaller than current radio technology .
Peter Burke and Chris Rutherglen incorporated the microscopic detector into a complete radio system .
It is conceivable in the future that all components could be nanoscale , thus allowing a truly nanoscale wireless communications system
Prof Peter Burke
Full details of their findings will be published next month in the American Chemical Society 's Nano Letters .
" Though we have only demonstrated the critical component of the entire radio system out of a nanotube ( the demodulator ) , it is conceivable in the future that all components could be nanoscale , thus allowing a truly nanoscale wireless communications system , " they write .
Smart dust
Many companies are interested in the long - term potential of carbon nanotubes - tiny cylinders of carbon that measure just a few billionths of a metre across .
Kris Sangani , Consumer Electronics Editor at the Institution of Engineering and Technology , UK , one of the world 's leading professional societies , said there were many possible real world applications of " microscopic radio technology " - in medicine , commerce and on the battlefield .
He said the real challenge for industry was to miniaturise not just radio technology but other components such as sensors , the power supply and processors .
" Scientists are looking at carbon nanotubes to miniaturise all other technologies as well , " he told BBC News .
" If you can combine miniaturisation with cost control ; that type of technology would be ubiquitous . "
Such a development would bring the concept of smart dust - a cluster of devices , smaller than a grain of sand , equipped with wireless communications that can detect the likes of light , temperature , or vibration - into the realms of reality rather than science fiction .
Future uses might include meteorological , geophysical and biological research sensors .
They could also be used for discreet military surveillance , or to create a distributed internet that would be accessible anywhere .
General Odom was the Director of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) under Reagan ( think “ Minority Report , ” and you have the NSA ) .
They ’re the super - duper secret spy agency that ’s way more top secret than even the CIA .
This guy ’s credentials are beyond stellar .
Here is an excerpt of his recent essay :
If the Democrats truly want to succeed in forcing to begin withdrawing from Iraq , the first step is to redefine “ supporting the troops ” as withdrawing them , citing the mass of accumulating evidence of the psychological as well as the physical damage that the president is forcing them to endure because he did not raise adequate forces .
Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress could confirm this evidence and lay the blame for “ not supporting the troops ” where it really belongs – on the president .
And they could rightly claim to the public that they are supporting the troops by cutting off the funds that he uses to keep U.S. forces in Iraq .
The public is ahead of the both branches of government in grasping this reality , but political leaders and opinion makers in the media must give them greater voice … .
The president is strongly motivated to string out the war until he leaves office , in order to avoid taking responsibility for the defeat he has caused and persisted in making greater each year for more than three years .
To force him to begin a withdrawal before then , the first step should be to rally the public by providing an honest and candid definition of what “ supporting the troops ” really means and pointing out who is and who is not supporting our troops at war .
The next step should be a flat refusal to appropriate money for to be used in Iraq for anything but withdrawal operations with a clear deadline for completion .
The final step should be to put that president on notice that if ignores this legislative action and tries to extort Congress into providing funds by keeping U.S. forces in peril , impeachment proceeding will proceed in the House of Representatives .
Such presidential behavior surely would constitute the “ high crime ” of squandering the lives of soldiers and Marines for his own personal interest .

Central Valley – A former CIA analyst will present arguments for the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney Sunday at Monroe - Woodbury High School .
Ray McGovern will talk about what he says are impeachable offenses by the president and vice president starting at 2 p.m. in the high school auditorium .
The forum was organized by Citizens for Impeachment and other local groups .
McGovern served as an analyst for 27 years , starting with the administration of John F. Kennedy and continuing through George H. W. Bush ’s term .
The high school is located at 155 Dunderberg Road , off Route 32 , in Central Valley .
Why the Alt Attribute May Be Omitted
The specification of the alt attribute was recently worked on to thoroughly improve its definition , including an in depth explanation of how to provide appropriate alternate text , with clear authoring requirements .
The requirements describe situations where alternate text must be provided , where an empty alt attribute must be used and , most controversially , where the alt attribute may be omitted entirely .
This is controversial because at first glance , it seems like an attempt to endorse the bad and inaccessible practice of omitting the alt attribute , and thus yet another slap in the face for accessibility .
That is an unfortunate misconception that needs to be carefully examined to settle any concerns people have .
Although it may seem backwards , the situation is actually much more positive .
There are many observed cases where alternate text is simply unavailable and there ’s little that can be done about it .
For example , most users of photo sharing sites like Flickr would n’t have a clue how or why to provide alternate text , even if Flickr provided the ability .
While everyone agrees that it would be wonderful if all users did – indeed , the spec strongly encourages that – most users simply wo n’t .
The problem being addressed is what should be done in those cases where no alt text has been provided and is virtually impossible to acquire .
With the current requirement for including the alt attribute in HTML4 , it has been observed that many systems will attempt to fulfil the requirement by generating alternate text from the images metadata .
Flickr , for example , repeats the images title ; Photobucket appears to combine the image ’s filename , title and the author ’s username ; and Wikipedia redundantly repeats the image caption .
The problem with these approaches is that using such values does not provide any additional or useful information about the image and , in some cases , this is worse than providing no alternate text at all .
The benefit of requiring the alt attribute to be omitted , rather than simply requiring the empty value , is that it makes a clear distinction between an image that has no alternate text ( such as an iconic or graphical representation of the surrounding text ) and an image that is a critical part of the content , but for which not alt text is available .
It has been claimed that Lynx and Opera already use this distinction .
For images without alt attributes Lynx shows the filename and Opera displays " Image " , but neither show anything for images with empty alt attributes .
It is still somewhat questionable whether this distinction is actually useful and whether or not browsers can realistically make such a distinction with real world content , and that is certainly open to debate if you have further evidence to provide .
It has been suggested that taking away the unconditional requirement for the alt attribute will affect the ability of validators to notify authors of their mistakes and take away a useful tool for promoting accessibility .
However , using validation errors as an accessibility evangelism tool is not necessarily the only , nor the best , way to address the issue .
While it is indeed very useful for authors to know when they have mistakenly omitted an alt attribute , attempting to unconditionally enforce their use , using a tool as blunt as a validator , is counter productive since it encourages the use of poor quality , automatically generated text .
Besides , nothing will prevent conformance checkers and authoring tools from notifying authors , if they so desire .
American makers of plowshares could , with time and as required , make swords as well .
But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense ; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions .
Added to this , three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment .
We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations .
This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience .
The total influence – economic , political , even spiritual – is felt in every city , every Statehouse , every office of the Federal government .
We recognize the imperative need for this development .
Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications .
Our toil , resources and livelihood are all involved ; so is the very structure of our society .
In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes .
We should take nothing for granted .
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals , so that security and liberty may prosper together .
General Dwight Eisenhower in Presidential farewell address warning about a threat facing America " new in kind or degree . "
Jan. 17 , 1961 .
War is just a racket .
A racket is best described , I believe , as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people .
Only a small inside group knows what it is about .
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses .
I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else .
If a nation comes over here to fight , then we 'll fight .
The trouble with America is that when the dollar only earns 6 percent over here , then it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent .
Then the flag follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag .
I would n't go to war again as I have done to protect some lousy investment of the bankers .
There are only two things we should fight for .
One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights .
War for any other reason is simply a racket .

Hence , likewise , they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which , under any form of government , are inauspicious to liberty , and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty .
In this sense it is that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty , and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other ....
Observe good faith and justice toward all nations .
Cultivate peace and harmony with all .
Religion and morality enjoin this conduct .
And can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it ?
It will be worthy of a free , enlightened , and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence .
Who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it ?
Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue ?
The experiment , at least , is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature .
Alas ! is it rendered impossible by its vices ?
In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded , and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated .
The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave .
It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection , either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest .
Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury , to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage , and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur .

The truth about the Middle East is , had there been no oil there , it would be like Africa .
Nobody is threatening to intervene in Africa .
The problem is the opposite , we keep asking for people to intervene and stop it .

It is hard to disagree with the jury ’s guilty verdict against Jose Padilla , the accused , but never formally charged , dirty bomber .
But it would be a mistake to see it as a vindication for the Bush administration ’s serial abuse of the American legal system in the name of fighting terrorism .
On the way to this verdict , the government repeatedly trampled on the Constitution , and its prosecution of Mr. Padilla was so cynical and inept that the crime he was convicted of — conspiracy to commit terrorism overseas — bears no relation to the ambitious plot to wreak mass destruction inside the United States , which the Justice Department first loudly proclaimed .
Even with the guilty verdict , this conviction remains a shining example of how not to prosecute terrorism cases .
When Mr. Padilla was arrested in 2002 , the government said he was an Al Qaeda operative who had plotted to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb inside the United States .
Mr. Padilla , who is an American citizen , should have been charged as a criminal and put on trial in a civilian court .
Instead , President Bush declared him an “ enemy combatant ” and kept him in a Navy brig for more than three years .
The administration ’s insistence that it had the right to hold Mr. Padilla indefinitely — simply on the president ’s word — was its first outrageous act in the case , but hardly its last .
Mr. Padilla was kept in a small isolation cell , and when he left that cell he was blindfolded and his ears were covered .
He was denied access to a lawyer even when he was being questioned .
Glory days
High school was a great time .
I ate everything I wanted and stayed at around 140 pounds .
I graduated high school many , many years ago , and my , how things change .
I remember the first time I looked in the mirror and realized how much my hairline was receding .
I also remember the first time I jumped on a scale , something I had n't done in years , and saw that my weight was about to hit 190 .
I was floored .
I have a feeling that I 'm a lot like many of you .
We spend a lot of time working on our monitor tan , and the busier we are the harder it is to eat well ; my life consisted of way too much fast food with a soda chaser while I was working , studying , or writing .
Not only had I gained weight , but I felt worse .
Two flights of stairs were enough to wind me .
Something had to be done .
One roadblock : gyms are expensive , and I 'm not really into the high - pressure sales tactics and bodies - on - display vibe of the gyms I visited .
We have a lot of work to do .
Even with shoes
After poking around a bit , I found that there was a glut of products for video game systems that are meant to promote fitness .
I remember back in the day when rowing machines had simplistic video games attached to them to get you to work out harder , but I had no clue there were exercise bikes attached to PlayStations , EyeToy games dedicated to fitness , or a game that includes its own personal trainer named Maya ... who just happens to have a great , uh , energizing spirit .
As I started on my quest for fitness , I had a few questions .
How good are these games ?
Can someone actually get into shape using just video games in their own home ?
How much was this going to cost me ?
Clearly there is a market for this sort of thing , but are people actually being helped , or is this just a clever way to get people to buy more games ?
Thus began the experiment : a few fitness games , two months testing time , and a tweaked diet .
How well do these games really work ?
We 're about to find out .

I knew I wanted to try Dance Dance Revolution ; it 's the game that gave me this unholy idea in the first place .
I 've played the game before and knew that I wanted the newest version with an official Konami pad .
One copy of Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 with a pad , $ 60  check .
I 'll treat myself to a nice aftermarket pad if I stick with it .
For the second game I decided on Yourself !
Fitness , and I 'd be lying if I said I did n't take into account the fact that the girl on the cover was pretty hot .
Our own Dr. Gitlin recommends it highly .
It was hard to find : it seems to be out of print and none of my local stores had it used .
I found it at Overstock.com for $ 40 .
I wanted to stay away from anything too expensive and needing a lot of hardware , so specialized fitness equipment for consoles is out .
At that point you might as well join a gym for the cost .
But this does need to be fun , so for my third game I decided on EyeToy Kinetic , a Nike - endorsed fitness game that uses the EyeToy to put your image into the game and uses your own movements to interact with the images on the screen .
I like the EyeToy ; it 's usually a great little toy .
When I 've used it with friends , after a few minutes I 'm usually breathing pretty heavily , so this became game number three .
I found it with the updated , smaller EyeToy for $ 50 at my local software store .
Total price : $ 150 for three games and two pieces of hardware .
So after a long day of shopping for games , I have a big glass of water that I wish was a Coke , and then go to bed with happy , non-aching muscles .
If I knew how long it would be before I was in that state again , I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more .
No Morgan Spurlock jokes , please
Before starting with the games , I had to see where I was at .
Weight : 194 pounds .
Body fat percentage : 23.3 percent .
BMI : 27.9 .
Ick , I 'm overweight .
I 'm not obese , but I 'm certainly heading there .
I 've got love handles , a gut , and a face that looks much wider than it did in my high school pictures .
If this is how I look at 25 , what will my 30th birthday bring ?
I took stock of my diet , which consisted of almost criminal amounts of fast food and soda .
I was going through a twelve - pack of Coke a day , or about 1,860 calories just in soda .
In a recommended diet of 2,000 calories , I was leaving myself no room for actual food .
Soda had to go .
I substituted black coffee and green tea ; I wanted to lose weight , but I certainly was n't ready to give up caffeine .
Yet .
Half of my dinners were fast food .
I started looking up the nutritional information on the pizza chains I was ordering from , only to be shocked that one slice of pizza could have as many as 300 calories .
I was eating four or five slices in a sitting , so in one meal I was at 1500 calories .
That had to go .
Changing my diet was n't that hard .
I discovered the joy of chicken breasts and the George Foreman Grill ; about 20 minutes less time than delivery pizza and about a hojillion calories less .
Add salad , pay attention to labels , cut the fat , and I 'm set .
Nothing drastic , just common sense changes I could live with .
Now I knew a little bit more about what I should be eating : stay away from fast food , make my own meals , and cut out the soda .
Sticking to this diet will probably be hard in the future , but at least I know where I stand .
Games ?
Check .
Proper diet ?
Check .
Let 's get exercising ... er , gaming .
Web - development anti-pattern : Compulsory Internationalization
Blogger really takes internationalization seriously .
They even have a Croatian translation of their site interface -- when I tried to comment on a post earlier today I was told things like " Postoje izmjene koje nisu spremijene . "
Very thorough job , it seems .
Similarly , when I type www.google.com in my address bar , I arrive at www.google.hr , where I can search " Web " , " Slike " , " Grupe " , or " Imenik " .
The problem is , I do not speak Croatian .
To make internationalization work , browsers send an Accept - Language header with every request .
This header lists one or more languages that are considered ' acceptable ' by the client , and the server can use this information to determine in what language it should respond .
Alternatively , it could ignore the header if it only knows one language .
My browser is sending Accept - Language headers telling all webservers that I would like the pages sent to me to be in English .
However , at the moment I am in Zagreb , so my IP will resolve to something ending in .hr ( Hrvatska ) .
Apparently , Blogger and Google are ignoring the header , and using the IP .
To point out the obvious :
Just because someone happens to be connecting from a certain country does not mean he or she speaks that country 's language .
It puzzles and annoys me that these sites do not just use the Accept - Language header , which has been invented for precisely this purpose .
If you are aware of some good reason for using this bizarre approach to internationalization , kindly e-mail me and explain , or leave a comment at reddit .
Michael Stevens suggests :
I do n't know why google do this , but I have a guess I think is very likely .
Accept - Language depends on the user 's browser being correctly configured to send the appropriate header .
I suspect most browsers are not correctly configured , and google have found that guessing based on country gives the correct language interface for a higher percentage of users than the more technically correct approach .
... which might be the case , at least historically .
However , I know that current versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer , when run on Windows , use the system 's language setting to adjust their Accept - Language header , and I suspect that other modern browsers do the same .
OS X probably has a similar feature , and I 've even seen it on Linux machines in Internet - cafes .
I 'm not sure how big the group of people is that have their operating system configured to a language they do not speak .

There many strategies you can use to select and plan a career path , but perhaps the two most basic patterns are bottom - up and top - down .
Bottom - up career planning
Bottom - up career planning means figuring out how you can best take advantage of the career building blocks you already possess .
It ’s a low - level , objective method of planning .
Perhaps the simplest form of bottom - up planning is when you pass a store window with a “ Help Wanted ” sign , and you apply for a job there because it ’s available and because you think it ’s a halfway decent fit for you .
A more complex method of bottom - up planning involves assessing your current needs ( salary , hours , benefits , location ) and qualifications ( education , skills , experience ) in order to figure out what line of work would best suit you .
Then you might create a resume and start looking for work based on what positions you feel qualified for , or you might go freelance and / or build a business around your capabilities .
In the back of your mind , you ’re asking , “ What kind of job should I get ? ” or “ What kind of work am I qualified to do ? ”
Bottom - up career planning is pretty much the de facto standard .
When people do any serious career planning at all , they almost always use a bottom - up strategy .
The very act of creating a resume is largely a bottom - up process .
Have you ever taken one of those career assessment tests ?
That ’s also a bottom - up process .
In high school I took the Kuder Occupational Interest Survey , which is a lengthy multiple - choice test that ’s supposed to help you determine what kind of career would best suit you .
It asks strange questions like , “ Would you rather watch an opera , a political rally , or a fire ? ”
Then it compares your answers to those of various career professionals in its database .
The results tell you which careers are filled with people who think like you do , so I guess the assumption is that you ’ll be happiest among your own kind .
It seemed a bit Brave New World - ish to me .
Incidentally , the top 3 matches the Kuder spit out for me were : ( 1 ) computer programmer , ( 2 ) forester , and ( 3 ) math professor .
An unfortunate limitation of the Kuder is that it ca n’t recommend careers that do n’t exist at the time of the test .
I suppose forester is pretty close to blogger though ; they both keep the trees safe .
After we got our results , I had a lot of fun ribbing an intelligent friend whose Kuder recommended bricklayer as his top career choice .
For all I know he ’s probably building web server farms today .
Top - down career planning
Top - down career planning means getting in touch with who you really are at the deepest level ( either soulfully or mentally , depending on your preference ) and figuring out the best way to outwardly express and share that core value with the world .
This is a high - level subjective method of planning .
A very simple form of top - down planning would be to say , “ I really resonate with the concept of courage , so I ’m going to make a career out of being courageous . ”
But of course you can delve much deeper into your values , character , and other soulful attributes to come up with a more detailed career concept .
In the back of your mind , you ’re asking , “ Who am I really ? ” or “ How can I best share my core , innate value with the world ? ”
Top - down career planning is much less common than bottom - up .
Top - down is sometimes seen in artistic fields like music , art , and drama , but even then it ’s rare to see it executed consciously .
For example , deciding to be a musician because you love music is still bottom - up .
Deciding to express peace because you recognize that the core of your being is perfect stillness would be top - down , and composing peaceful music would be one of many media you could use for that .
Many people have done top - down exercises such as clarifying their values or writing a mission statement , but they rarely take the process far enough to actually develop those core ideas into a full - time career .
This is why you see people with mission statements like , “ I want to use music to teach people unconditional love and compassion ” who work in retail sales .
Bottom - up vs. top - down career planning
Bottom - up career planning starts with the practical , low - level , physical aspects of a career .
It regards things like salary , qualifications , security , perks , and potential for advancement as the most important elements to get right .
Once you have those things in place , it ’s up to you to do the best you can to enjoy it .
Top - down career planning starts with the high - level , spiritual and emotional aspects of a career .
It regards creative self - expression as the most important element to get right .
Once you have an outlet for creatively expressing the real you , you then work through the practical issues of developing your skills and generating income to meet your physical needs .
Both strategies have their strengths and weaknesses , so a balanced approach seems wise .
I would n’t recommend applying both strategies with equal weight , however .
I think the best career planning combo would be about 80 % top - down and 20 % bottom - up .
What would this 80 - 20 combo look like ?
It means that you ’d invest the bulk of your career planning efforts into figuring out who you really are , getting in touch with your core values , and deciding what it is you really want to express to the world .
The result of that would basically be a statement of purpose that deeply resonates with you .
Once you have this , you ’re really 80 % of the way there .
For example , Erin knows that she ’s all about compassion .
She ’s very clear about that .
She knows that no matter what the physical form of her career looks like , it has to be centered around the expression of compassion .
Otherwise she would n’t be expressing her true self .
She ’ll never be happy and fulfilled in a career that is n’t a strong fit for expressing and sharing compassion , regardless of her qualifications , how well it pays , or how otherwise perfect it seems .
Given that she knows this , she can continue with the top - down planning process to drill down into exploring different ways of expressing that , such as by blogging , offering intuitive readings , helping people in the forums , etc .
As soon as she got clear on the core value she needed to express , it was n’t that hard for her to get the low - level pieces in order , including developing her skills via education and practice and finding a sustainable way to generate income from her work .
When I first met Erin back in 1994 , however , she was working as a secretary .
She held many secretarial positions before that too .
Why ?
Mainly because she can type 90 + words per minute .
If she kept going with that bottom - up approach , she might have eventually progressed to being an executive assistant .
That would have been a great fit for her qualifications and experience , and it would have met her physical needs just fine , but secretarial work would have been a very weak outlet for expressing her core value of compassion .
Interestingly , her typing skills now serve her very well as a blogger .
If you put bottom - up planning ahead of top - down planning , you ’re putting the cart before the horse .
That approach just wo n’t yield the right level of clarity .
It ’s not a good way to consciously build a fulfilling career .
It ’s like looking at the ground to explore the stars .
I see the results of excessive bottom - up planning in my email inbox every week .
People who center their career paths around their qualifications , skills , and salary requirements so often end up miserable — or at the very least disillusioned — even when they seem to be thriving from an objective standpoint .
It ’s rough when people succeed in getting what they asked for , only to realize they asked for the wrong thing .
After 10 - 20 years , they ’re dying inside while their souls are screaming for them to just stop and quit everything … invariably to move to a career that will serve as a better outlet for their creative self - expression .
Just because you can do something and get paid well for it does n’t mean you should .
Do n’t confuse your medium with your message .
You ’ll be much more fulfilled if you pursue a career that allows you to express your true self as fully as possible .
Then educate yourself , practice , and build your skills to get good at compatible forms of expression until you can abundantly satisfy your physical needs .
That may take some time , but if you ’re really expressing your true self , the process should be fun and enjoyable .
Your optimal career is simply this :
Share the real you with the physical world through the process of creative self - expression .
In order to do that , however , you must first discover the real you .
But it makes no sense to choose a medium for self - expression ( i.e. a traditional career ) , such as being a doctor , writer , or entrepreneur , until you first determine what it is you ’re going to express .
Ron Paul 's campaign takes to the airwaves Maverick boosts pursuit of votes in early primaries
WASHINGTON — Hoping to defy more expectations , Rep. Ron Paul is ratcheting up his maverick Republican presidential campaign by launching TV and radio commercials in early primary states and setting an ambitious $ 12 million fundraising goal .
For a candidate often relegated by pundits to second - or third - tier status , Paul 's ability to make a big entry into advertising wars is unusual .
With just over two months until the first primaries , experts question whether the libertarian - leaning congressman from Lake Jackson can expand his intense following to make a credible showing in these early contests .
Officials with Paul 's campaign acknowledge they have an uphill battle , but say they plan to broaden his support with an advertising campaign that includes $ 1.1 million in television spots that begin airing Monday in New Hampshire .
Campaign spokesman Jesse Benton said the purpose of the ads was to " give people a full picture of who Ron Paul is .
The war is a component , but there is a heck of a lot more , too . "
The television spots feature people in New Hampshire talking about Paul 's stands , including bringing troops home from Iraq .
The ad also includes biographical material , emphasizing that obstetrician Paul is the only doctor in the race , said Benton .
This month the Paul campaign began running about $ 430,000 worth of radio spots in New Hampshire and early primary states of South Carolina , Iowa and Nevada .
Those radio ads stress his domestic stands such as opposition to tax increases and amnesty for illegal immigrants .
To help pay for the stepped - up efforts — of course the campaign hopes to reach beyond past donors who included a self - identified clown and a wizard — the campaign has also set a target of raising $ 12 million for the last three months of this year .
That would be more than double the $ 5.2 million campaign took in during the third quarter of 2007 , and about as much as better - known GOP presidential contender Fred Thompson raised last quarter .
Also , Paul — whose district includes Galveston and areas on three sides of Houston — has run a frugal campaign , spending $ 2.8 million for the first nine months of this year compared with $ 30 million by GOP front - runner Rudolph Giuliani and $ 53 million by Mitt Romney .
Unlike some rivals , Paul mostly flies commercial , except for two trips where his campaign paid $ 40,000 for a charter .
His catering tab included Costco and Sam's Club in Des Moines , Iowa , and Peters ' Cut Rate Liquor in Freeport .
The Texan has surprised political observers and party officials with his fundraising , almost 80 percent of it via the Internet .
He has attracted many donors with his opposition to the Iraq war and a limited - government message .
Cash cushion , no debt
So Paul enters the final stretch before the early primaries in a relatively comfortable financial position , with $ 5.4 million cash on hand and no debt .
He has about $ 2 million more money in the bank than fellow contender , Arizona Republican Sen.
John McCain
GOP officials in early primary states say that while they have been impressed with the intensity of Paul 's supporters , they are not sure if he can expand his following , particularly among Republican primary voters generally supportive of the Iraq war .
" I know Ron Paul has an army .
They believe in him and follow him .
You see the people on the street corners , " said Katon Dawson , chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party .
" But is it big enough ?
I do n't know . "
Dawson said Paul 's anti-war message " is not selling in the circles that I travel in . "
But he added that Paul 's focus on limited government " does hit a vein . "
He said that Paul 's ability to spend more money in the state will help , adding , " Money is the mother 's milk of politics . "
A new poll of likely Granite state voters for the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College showed Paul garnering 7 percent of the GOP primary vote , ahead of Mike Huckabee and Thompson .
In New Hampshire , state GOP chairman Fergus Cullen cites evidence of support for Paul in campaign signs that appear to outnumber those of other candidates .
Cullen noted the signs are on private property , not on the side of the road , indicating that individual owners , rather than the campaigns , have taken the time to put them up .
Likened to Howard Dean
Paul 's best chance in New Hampshire would be if voters conclude the party does n't stand a chance of winning the general election , said Andy Smith , director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center
He said they may then register a protest vote , much as they did in 1996 when conservative commentator Pat Buchanan beat former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole in the state 's GOP primary .
Dole got the nomination later , and lost to Bill Clinton .
Some political observers likened Paul to Howard Dean , the Democratic candidate in 2004 who also drew a devoted cyberspace following with his anti-war message but failed to attract sufficient primary voters .
But Glenn McCall , the GOP chairman in York County in South Carolina , said Paul has come across in debates as more sincere than his rivals .
Voters " feel that some of the other candidates are too polished and not true to themselves , " McCall said .
" Dr. Paul , they feel , is being natural .
He is being himself . "
Paul 's outspoken opposition to the war has made him a favorite on the talk show circuit .
He is scheduled to appear Tuesday on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno .
The Paul campaign spent about $ 387,000 on salaries for the first nine months of the year compared with Giuliani 's campaign payroll of $ 4.6 million .
On Paul 's payroll are his daughter , Lori Pyeatt , who works in Clute , as well as his granddaughter , Valorie Pyeatt , and grandson , Matthew Pyeatt , who helped design the candidate 's MySpace profile .

Scientists have discovered a new gene that makes mice happy , a finding that suggests another avenue of drugs for improving depression in humans .
The research represents the first time that depression has been eliminated genetically in any organism , said Guy Debonnel , a psychiatrist and professor at McGill University .
Debonnel and his colleagues achieved this effect by creating and breeding mice lacking a gene also found in humans that affects the transmission of the mood - modulating chemical serotinin .
Mice without the gene , called TREK - 1 , acted as if they had been treated with anti-depressants for at least three weeks , he said .
By removing TREK - 1 in mice , the animals performed as if they were n't depressed when confronted with five standard behavioral tests scientists use for depression in mice .
If future scientists follow up on this research and find a compound which can effectively shut down the same gene in humans , then the same mood lift could be induced .
" This would be completely different , in terms of pharmaceutical approach , from everything else that is done today for the treatment of depression , " Dubonnel told LiveScience .
A separate study earlier this year by Eric Nestler of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and his colleagues identified a different gene , called BDNF , as involved in depression , and found that removing it in mice made them tolerant of bullying and resistant to withdrawing socially from the rest of the mice .
Debonnel said that social withdrawal or defeat is not considered to stand in for depression by researchers in this field .
Rather , social defeat is just a form of fear .
Also , the earlier research tested just one behavioral expression .
Debonnel 's research focused on five classic , behavioral models of depression .
How depression works
Major depression affects about 13 percent of all Americans during their lifetime , according to Columbia University 's Deborah Hasin , who was part of a team of scientists that analyzed one of the largest surveys ever conducted on psychiatric disorders and their relationship to alcohol and drug abuse among U.S. adults .
Debonnel put the figure higher -- at 15 percent -- worldwide .
Mild depression is an often - hidden trigger behind major depression events , such that people who suffer from mild depression over time are more likely to have a major depression later on that could result in suicide .
Scientists still lack a clear picture of what causes any type of depression and a consensus on how to cure it .
Most will say that depression is caused by a combination of genetic , chemical and environmental factors , such as stress .
The most popular drug therapies nowadays focus on serotonin and other brain chemistry neurotransmitters .
SSRIs ( selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors ) , unlike the previous generation of anti-depressants , work on just serotonin , not other neurotransmitters related to depression .
( Depression is far from the only brain process in which serotonin is involved . )
These drugs improve the brain 's efficiency in its use of serotonin , allowing it to build up at brain cell ( neuron ) receptors , so the chemical gets a chance to accumulate to a high enough level to set of neuron firings .
Diminished neuron firings might be the basis of at least some depressions , scientists say .
Serotonin management
Debonnel 's research targeted TREK - 1 because it creates a protein that is among a group of compounds that is affected by serotonin and other neurotransmitters , and the enhanced management of serotonin is the focus of anti-depressant drugs .
Since mice cannot tell us how they feel , Debonnel and his team tested the mice without TREK - 1 to see how they performed on the five different behavioral tests that are used in the lab to discern between effective and ineffective depression drugs .?
For instance , one test measures how long mice wait to swim after they are put in a tank full of water .
Mice who wait a long time are interpreted to have " behavioral despair . "
Another test involves waiting to see how long it takes for mice to react when suspended by the tail .
Irwin Lucki , a psychiatrist and depression expert at the University of Pennsylvania , noted that Debonnel 's research , focusing on several tests for mice with the same mutation , must have taken years .
Still , he agreed with Debonnel that it is unclear whether the mice 's resistance to depression emerged as the genetically altered mice matured or only in adulthood .
The latter situation would be more promising for genetic interventions in adult humans , he said .
" If this effect were confirmed , " Lucki told LiveScience , " this would justify a drug - development program for this target . "
Also , this research does n't prove that the TREK - 1 gene is associated with depression in human patients .
Depression emerges from many types of genetic pathways , Lucki said , and probably more than one gene is involved .
Still , even if TREK - 1 later is shown not to cause depression , these findings still might be valuable information in efforts to find new treatments for depression , he said .
" The most solemn hope of these researchers is to ultimately provide more effective relief and more rapid relief to patients suffering from depression , " he said .
DESPITE its use to symbolise a bright idea , the traditional incandescent lightbulb is a dud .
It wastes electricity , radiating 95 % of the energy it consumes as heat rather than light .
Its life is also relatively short , culminating in a dull pop as its filament fractures .
Now a team of researchers has devised a lightbulb that is not only much more energy efficient .
It also lasts , in effect , forever — that is , it is expected to last longer than the devices into which it is inserted .
Moreover the lamp could be used for rear - projection televisions as well as general illumination .
The trick to a longer life , for lightbulbs at least , is to ensure that the lamp has no electrodes .
Although electrodes are undeniably convenient for plugging bulbs directly into the lighting system , they are also the main reason why lamps fail .
The electrodes wear out .
They can react chemically with the gas inside the lightbulb , making it grow dimmer .
They are also difficult to seal into the structure of the bulb , making the rupture of these seals another potential source of failure .
Scientists working for Ceravision , a company based in Milton Keynes , in Britain , have designed a lamp that eliminates the need for electrodes .
Their device uses microwaves to transform electricity into light .
It consists of a relatively small lump of aluminium oxide into which a hole has been bored .
When the aluminium oxide is bombarded with microwaves generated from the same sort of device that powers a microwave oven , it generates a concentrated electric field in the void .
If a cylindrical capsule containing a suitable gas is inserted into the hole , the atoms of the gas become ionised .
As electrons accelerate in the electric field , they gain energy that they pass on to the atoms and molecules of the gas as they collide with them , creating a glowing plasma .
The light is bright , and the process is energy efficient .
Indeed , while traditional lightbulbs emit just 5 % of their power as light , and fluorescent tubes about 15 % , the Ceravision lamp has an efficiency greater than 50 % .
Because the lamp has no filament , the scientists who developed it think it will last for thousands of hours of use — in other words , decades .
Moreover the light it generates comes from what is almost a single point , which means that the bulbs can be used in projectors and televisions .
Because of this , the light is much more directional and the lamp could thus prove more efficient than bulbs that scatter light in all directions .
Its long life would make the new light ideal for places where the architecture makes changing lightbulbs a complicated and expensive job .
Its small size makes it comparable to light - emitting diodes but the new lamp generates much brighter light than do those semiconductor devices .
Another environmental advantage of the system is that it does not have to use mercury .
The metal is highly toxic and is found in most of the bulbs used today , including the energy - saving bulb , fluorescent tubes and the high - pressure bulbs used in projectors .
Its developers reckon it should be cheap to make .
With lighting accounting for some 20 % of electricity use worldwide , switching to a more efficient system could save not only energy but also on emissions of carbon .
Now that would be a bright idea .
Balancing America 's Need for Food and Fuel .
http://www.foodandfuelamerica.com
The guys on the ramp ( pilots do not say tarmac ) are the unsung and often unseen hard working types that load all of the luggage by hand into the cargo bins .
They also guide the airplane in for parking , drive the push - back tug , and take care of hooking up and disconnecting the “ Ground Power and Ground Air ” .
A little explanation is in order .
The airplane is capable of being self sufficient as to electrical power and air - conditioning .
This power and air is provided by a little jet engine mounted in the tail called an Auxiliary Power Unit ( APU ) .
The little APU is very capable but it burns a fairly large amount of fuel .
Since the airlines get electricity for free for some reason it makes more economic sense to provide power and air - conditioning to the airplane from the building , than it does to use the APU .
This program should save about three thousand hundred trillion dollars a day or something .
Since many of our electrical components and computers are a little fussy about power surges and interruptions it is important that the change over from ground power to ships power be coordinated to some degree .
This is accomplished through a combination of Plains Indian sign language and banging on the side of the airplane .
So here we all were ready to get started with the third leg of the day , somebody in every seat , two cockpit observers along with us in the cockpit , and the agent was just handing us the final load sheet so we could enter the takeoff data in the computer .
CLICK .
… the airplane went dark , multiple warnings , click and chirp , no power , navigation system warnings , emergency exit lighting activated .
The first response is to initiate the start sequence for the APU , this takes about two minutes .
My second response ( and one nobody expected ) was to yank the cockpit window open lean out over the side of the plane and yell HeeeYaaaEeee .
I asked the cockpit observers if they had any fruit I could throw at the guys down there .
What ?
Yea , an orange or something just to get their attention .
Nobody admitted to having any good ammo for a food fight so I yelled again , “ TURN ON THE POWER ” .
Finally one of the guys appeared from under the airplane holding the airplane end of the umbilical cord in his hand .
WHAT are You DOING ?
Were ANY of your Mothers Children born with Brains ?
wha ?
( nobody looks smart looking up from 20 feet down )
I ’ve got a hundred and forty two people sitting up here in the dark because you are an idiot .
Why did you do that ?
Is that part of your training ?
Is that in your manual ?
By now the rest of the cockpit system warnings were beeping and complaining telling us that e v e r y t h i n g would have to be reprogrammed for departure .
“ She said you were ready to go ” , which would have meant that we were all boarded up , what she ( the operations agent in the jetway ) meant to indicate to him was that it was time to stop playing frisbee and talk to the pilots .
I was n’t very nice but I did n’t scream anything obscene or especially demeaning since the airplane is really quiet with no fans or equipment running .
All of the passengers could hear clearly and were listening since they did n’t have anything else to do .
Any more time with the emergency lighting system activated and we would been delayed up to an hour while it recharged .
“ You get that power hooked back up right now or I ’m coming out of this window after you . ”
So they hooked it up .
We got everything re-programmed , re-set and re-entered , It took about ten minutes .
When we were finally ready to go they went and got a different crew to push the airplane back so they would n’t have to talk to the wild man hanging out of the window anymore .
Idiots , and cowards too .
But still valued , hardworking , recognized co-workers .
I ’ll see them again next week .

SAN FRANCISCO , California ( Reuters ) --
Sony has cut the price of the PlayStation 3 by $ 100 , or 17 percent , in the United States , a move that should boost the video game console 's lackluster sales .
Starting Monday , the current PS3 60 gigabyte model will cost $ 499 -- a $ 100 price drop .
The PlayStation 3 , which includes a 60 - gigabyte hard drive and a Blu-ray high - definition DVD player , will now cost $ 500 , or $ 20 more than the most expensive version of Microsoft 's Xbox 360 .
The PS3 still costs twice that of Nintendo 's Wii console , whose $ 250 price and motion - sensing controller have made it a best - seller despite its lack of cutting - edge graphics and hard disk .
" Our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum , " Jack Tretton , chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America , said in an interview .
" We 've gotten our production issues behind us on the PlayStation 3 , reaching a position to pass on the savings to consumers , and our attitude is the sooner the better . "
The price drop Monday was widely anticipated by industry analysts despite Sony President Ryoji Chubachi telling Reuters last week that the company had no immediate plans for one .
Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter said Sony 's price reduction would not double sales but may boost them by 50 percent to about 120,000 units a month .
" The greater significance is that Sony is signaling to the market that we 're coming down the cost curve pretty fast in making this thing .
It 's a pretty consumer - friendly move , " Pachter said .
Sony 's move comes two days before the start of the video game industry 's annual E3 trade show in Santa Monica , California , where some expect Microsoft to respond with its first price cuts on the Xbox 360 .
Nintendo , whose Wii is selling so well that it is still hard to find in stores eight months after its launch , is not expected to budge on pricing .
The Xbox 360 and Wii have outsold the PS3 by several times in the crucial U.S. market , leaving Sony , whose PlayStation 2 dominated the last console generation , in the unfamiliar position of playing catch up .
Sony is counting on the price cut to help it significantly grow sales of the PS3 ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season that accounts for most of the annual sales of highly profitable gaming software .
Sony is also introducing a new version of the PS3 featuring an 80 - gigabyte hard drive and a copy of " Motorstorm , " an off - road racing game that has already sold a million copies .
The new model will sell for $ 600 and is aimed at gamers who expect to download a lot of games and other content from Sony 's burgeoning online network .
Sony also hopes the PS3 will win some converts following Microsoft 's admission last week that the failure rate of its Xbox 360 console had been unacceptably high , forcing it to book $ 1 billion in repair costs .
" We 're especially proud of the fact that the PlayStation 3 has the lowest failure rate of any PlayStation product .
It 's absolutely the gold standard , " Tretton said .
" The quality of the product and long - term viability is what ultimately wins . "

A special investigative report from inside Iraq
Monday , September 17 , 2007 - Did you see George all choked up ?
In his surreal TV talk on Thursday , he got all emotional over the killing by Al Qaeda of Sheik Abu Risha , the leader of the new Sunni alliance with the US against the insurgents in Anbar Province , Iraq .
Bush shook Abu Risha 's hand two weeks ago for the cameras .
Bush can shake his hand again , but not the rest of him : Abu Risha was blown away just hours before Bush was to go on the air to praise his new friend .
Here 's what you need to know that NPR wo n't tell you .
1. Sheik Abu Risha was n't a sheik .
2 . He was n't killed by Al Qaeda .
3 . The new alliance with former insurgents in Anbar is as fake as the sheik – and a murderous deceit .
How do I know this ?
You can see the film – of “ Sheik ” Abu Risha , of the guys who likely whacked him and of their other victims .
Just in case you think I 've lost my mind and put my butt in insane danger to get this footage , do n't worry .
I was safe and dry in Budapest .
It was my brilliant new cameraman , Rick Rowley , who went to Iraq to get the story on his own .
Rick 's “ the future of TV news , ” says BBC .
He 's also completely out of control .
Despite our pleas ,
Rick and his partner Dave Enders went to Anbar and filmed where no cameraman had dared tread .
Why was “ sheik ” Abu Risha so important ?
As the New York Times put it this morning , “ Abu Risha had become a charismatic symbol of the security gains in Sunni areas that have become a cornerstone of American plans to keep large numbers of troops in Iraq though much of next year . ”
In other words , Abu Risha was the PR hook used to sell the “ success ” of the surge .
The sheik was n't a sheik .
He was a fake .
While proclaiming to Rick that he was “ the leader of all the Iraqi tribes , ” Abu lead no one .
But for a reported sum in the millions in cash for so - called , “ reconstruction contracts , ” Abu Risha was willing to say he was Napoleon and Julius Caesar and do the hand - shakie thing with Bush on camera .
Notably , Rowley and his camera caught up with Abu Risha on his way to a “ business trip ” to Dubai , money laundering capital of the Middle East .
There are some real sheiks in Anbar , like Ali Hathem of the dominant Dulaimi tribe , who told Rick Abu Risha was a con man .
Where was his tribe , this tribal leader ?
“ The Americans like to create characters like Disney cartoon heros . ”
Then Ali Hathem added , “ Abu Risha is no longer welcome ” in Anbar .
“ Not welcome ” from a sheik in Anbar is roughly the same as a kiss on both cheeks from the capo di capi .
Within days , when Abu Risha returned from Dubai to Dulaimi turf in Ramadi , Bush 's hand - sheik was whacked .
On Thursday , Bush said Abu Risha was killed , “ fighting Al Qaeda ” – and the White House issued a statement that the sheik was “ killed by al Qaeda . ”
Bullshit .
There ai n't no Easter Bunny and “ Al Qaeda ” ai n't in Iraq , Mr. Bush .
It was very cute , on the week of the September 11 memorials , to tie the death of your Anbar toy - boy to bin Laden 's Saudi hijackers .
But it 's a lie .
Yes , there is a group of berserkers who call themselves “ Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia . ”
But they have as much to do with the real Qaeda of bin Laden as a Rolling Stones “ tribute ” band has to do with Mick Jagger .
Who got Abu Risha ?
Nothing – NOTHING – moves in Ramadi without the approval of the REAL tribal sheiks .
They were none - too - happy , as Hathem , noted , about the millions the US handed to Risha .
The sheiks either ordered the hit – or simply gave the bomber free passage to do the deed .
So who are these guys , the sheiks who lead the Sunni tribes of Anbar – the potentates of the Tamimi , Fallaji , Obeidi , Zobal and Jumaili tribes ?
Think of them as the Sopranos of Arabia .
They are also members of the so - called “ Awakening Council ” – getting their slice of the millions handed out – which they had no interest in sharing with Risha .
But creepy and deadly or not , these capi of the desert were effective in eliminating “ Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia . ”
Indeed , as US military so proudly pointed out to Rick , the moment the sheiks declared their opposition to Al Qaeda – i.e. got the payments from the US taxpayers – Al Qaeda instantly diappeared .
This miraculous military change , where the enemy just evaporates , has one explanation : the sheiks ARE al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
Just like the Sopranos extract “ protection ” payments from New Jersey businesses , the mobsters of Anbar joined our side when we laid down the loot .
What 's wrong with that ?
After all , I 'd rather send a check than send our kids from Columbus to fight them .
But there 's something deeply , horribly wrong with dealing with these killers .
They still kill .
With new US protection , weapons and cash , they have turned on the Shia of Anbar .
Fifteen thousand Shia families from a single district were forced at gunpoint to leave Anbar .
Those moving too slowly were shot .
Kids and moms too .
Do the Americans know about the ethnic cleansing of Anbar by our erstwhile “ allies ” ?
Rick 's film shows US commanders placing their headquarters in the homes abandoned by terrorized Shia .
Rick 's craziest move was to go and find these Shia refugees from Anbar .
They were dumped , over a hundred thousand of them , in a cinder block slum with no running water in Baghdad .
They are under the “ protection ” of the Mahdi Army , another group of cutthroats .
But at least these are Shia cutthroats .
So the great “ success ” of the surge is our arming and providing cover for ethnic cleansing in Anbar .
Nice , Mr. Bush .
And with the US press “ embedded , ” we wo n't get the real story .
Even Democrats are buying into the Anbar “ awakening ” fairy tale .
An Iraqi government official frets that giving guns and cover to the Anbar gang is like adopting a baby crocodile .
“ A crocodile is not a pet , ” he told Rick .
It will soon grow to devour you .
But what could the puppet do but complain about his strings ?
This Iraqi got it right : the surge is a crock .

· Sales of 7in singles rise by 13 % in first half of year · New bands and collectors turning to old format
The format was supposed to have been badly wounded by the introduction of CDs and killed off completely by the ipod- generation that bought music online .
But in a rare case of cheerful news for the record labels , the latest phenomenon in a notoriously fickle industry is one nobody dared predict : a vinyl revival .
Latest figures show a big jump in vinyl sales in the first half of this year , confirming the anecdotal evidence from specialist shops throughout the UK .
It comes as sales of CD singles continue to slide - and it is not being driven by technophobic middle - aged consumers .
Teenagers and students are developing a taste for records and are turning away from the clinical method of downloading music on to an MP3 player .
The data , released by the UK 's industry group BPI , shows that 7in vinyl sales were up 13 % in the first half , with the White Stripes ' Icky Thump the best seller .
Two - thirds of all singles in the UK now come out on in the 7in format , with sales topping 1 m .
Though still a far cry from vinyl 's heyday in 1979 , when Art Garfunkel 's Bright Eyes alone sold that number and the total vinyl singles market was 89 m , the latest sales are still up more than fivefold in five years .
For record stores , the resurgence has meant a move from racks of vintage Rolling Stones and Beatles releases to brand new singles and younger buyers .
" The student population seem to be loving the 7in , " says Stuart Smith , who runs Seismic Records in Leamington Spa , Warwickshire .
He sells 300-600 records a week and is preparing to launch an online store .
" I 'm still not sure about the MP3 generation .
You can have a full hard drive and nothing to show for it .
Record collections are very personal .
You can view into a person 's soul really , " he says .
The customers rummaging through racks at his store , a small room above a skate shop , are students and DJs .
When Mr Smith opened the vinyl shop in early 2005 , digital download sales were rocketing and , amid rampant piracy , global music revenues were several years into their current downward spiral .
A shop selling LPs and 7in singles did n't sound like the most promising business plan .
But when his employers at the local outlet of music chain Fopp - now closed down - decided to stop selling vinyl it was something he could n't resist .
" I just could n't understand why they decided to turn their backs on it .
I saw an opportunity to do something I love doing .
I 've been a collector myself for years , " says the 31 - year - old .
" It 's just one of things .
It just felt right . "
Two years on , the White Stripes ' Icky Thump has just notched up the highest weekly sales for a 7in single for more than 20 years .
Retailers and record labels put the rising vinyl sales down to bands rediscovering the format and to music fans ' enduring desire to collect .
It 's not unusual for fans to buy a 7in but have nothing to play it on , says Paul Williams at industry magazine Music Week .
" It 's about the kind of acts that have very loyal fan bases that want everything to do with that act , " he says .
" They maybe will buy the download to listen to , but they get the vinyl to own .
It 's looked at like artwork . "
HMV agrees that vinyl is back from the brink , and the chain has been rapidly expanding its record racks to meet rising demand .
The group 's Gennaro Castaldo cites the huge popularity of " indie " bands , such as Franz Ferdinand and Arctic Monkeys , which enjoy loyal followings among teenagers and students , especially during the summer festival season .
" Labels have realised that it 's cool for bands to release their music on vinyl , especially in limited edition form , which makes it highly collectible , " he says .
London company
Art Vinyl has built a whole business out of the format 's visual and tactile appeal by selling easy - to - open frames to display records and their sleeves .
For fans , buying and owning a record can provide a welcome change from the anonymity of online downloads , says Art Vinyl 's founder Andrew Heeps .
" If you go into a record shop to buy something , you feel part of something , " he says .
" The fact that last year we sold over 9,000 frames to people says an awful lot about where the market is going . "
Cara Henn , a DJ and regular Seismic Records customer says going to the store puts her in touch with her peers and has hammered home the vinyl trend .
" I 've really been getting back into my vinyl .
I love it , " she says .
" I like to hear crackling , as if it 's actually real .
Especially with drum 'n ' bass , DJs are really encouraging fans to buy vinyl . "

Summary of Findings
So far religion is not proving to be a clear - cut positive in the 2008 presidential campaign .
The candidates viewed by voters as the least religious among the leading contenders are the current frontrunners for the Democratic and Republican nominations — Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani , respectively .
On the other hand , the candidate seen as far and away the most religious — Mitt Romney — is handicapped by this perception because of voter concerns about Mormonism .
As in the past , most Americans continue to say that it is important for a president to have strong religious beliefs .
And voters who see presidential candidates as religious express more favorable views toward those candidates than do voters who view them as not religious .
But the latest
Pew survey finds that candidates for the White House need not be seen as very religious to be broadly acceptable to the voting public .
Among people who offer an opinion of the religiosity of leading Democrats , more say that John Edwards ( 28 % ) and Barack Obama ( 24 % ) are very religious than say the same about Hillary Clinton ( 16 % ) .
Yet wide majorities see all three as at least somewhat religious , and those who do view the candidates in overwhelmingly favorable terms .
Similarly , just 14 % who offer an opinion see Rudy Giuliani as very religious , but another 63 % see him as somewhat religious , and both groups offer comparably favorable assessments of the former New York City mayor .
Mitt Romney stands apart from the other candidates tested — nearly half ( 46 % ) of those who express an opinion say Romney is very religious ; that is roughly the same number saying that George W. Bush is very religious ( 43 % ) , though many more people express an opinion about Bush ’s religiosity than Romney ’s .
However , a quarter of Americans — Democrat , independent and Republican alike — say they would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who is Mormon .
And those who say this have substantially less favorable impressions of Mitt Romney .
In general , being a Mormon is viewed as far less of a liability for a presidential candidate than not believing in God or being a Muslim .
Roughly six - in - ten Americans ( 61 % ) say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who does not believe in God , while 45 % say they would be reluctant to vote for a Muslim .
At the same time , more people express reservations about voting for a Mormon ( 25 % ) than about supporting a candidate who is an evangelical Christian ( 16 % ) , a Jew ( 11 % ) or a Catholic ( 7 % ) .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life , conducted Aug. 1 -18 among 3,002 adults , finds that social issues such as abortion and gay marriage continue to be greatly overshadowed in the presidential campaign by both domestic issues and the war in Iraq .
This is consistent with a Pew Research Center survey in June in which abortion was rated as the least important issue of the nine tested in the survey ( see June 4 , 2007 : Thompson Demonstrates Broad Potential Appeal ) .
More than three - quarters of Americans ( 78 % ) say domestic issues such as the economy , health care and the environment will be very important in their decisions about whom to support for president ; 72 % say the same about the war in Iraq .
By comparison , just 38 % say that social issues like abortion and gay marriage will be very important in their voting decisions .
Social issues are lagging in importance among members of both parties .
White evangelical Protestants are the only major political or religious group in which a majority ( 56 % ) says that social issues like abortion and gay marriage will be very important in their presidential voting decisions .
Even among white evangelicals , however , social issues trail domestic matters and the war in Iraq : 72 % of white evangelicals cite the economy and other domestic issues as very important , while 66 % rate the war in Iraq as very important to their vote .
The survey finds that the Republican Party continues to hold a substantial advantage over the Democratic Party in terms of being seen as more friendly to religion .
Half of Americans say the GOP is friendly to religion , compared with just 30 % who see the Democratic Party as friendly toward religion .
A plurality ( 37 % ) says the Democratic Party is neutral to religion , while 15 % see it as unfriendly to religion .
The proportion saying the Democratic Party is unfriendly to religion has declined slightly since July 2006 ( 20 % ) .
In addition , nearly half of Americans ( 47 % ) now disagree with the idea that “ liberals who are not religious have too much control over the Democratic Party , ” and 37 % agree with this statement .
In July 2005 , the public was evenly split as to whether secular liberals exert too much influence over the Democratic Party .
The widespread perception that Mitt Romney is very religious would appear to be an asset for the former Massachusetts governor in his race for the Republican nomination : far more Republicans ( 44 % ) than either Democrats ( 26 % ) or independents ( 23 % ) completely agree that it is important for the president to have strong religious beliefs .
But the political benefit Romney receives from this perception is being offset by the concerns that some voters express about Mormonism .
Overall , Romney is viewed favorably by 75 % of Republican and Republican - leaning voters who offer an opinion of him .
However , his favorability rating is much lower among Republican voters who say they would be less likely to vote for a Mormon than among those who have no reluctance about supporting a Mormon ( 54 % vs. 82 % ) .
A quarter of Republican and Republican - leaning voters say they would be less likely to vote for a Mormon .
But among white Republican evangelical Protestants , 36 % express reservations about voting for a Mormon .
That compares with 21 % of white Catholic Republican voters , and 16 % of white non-evangelical Protestant Republicans .
Meanwhile , there is no evidence that Rudy Giuliani ’s image has been affected much by his pro-choice stance on abortion .
At this stage in the campaign , there is minimal public awareness of Guiliani ’s position on abortion .
Overall , just 22 % of the public — and just 31 % of Republicans — know that Giuliani is pro-choice .
Even among Republican and Republican - leaning voters who rate social issues as very important , just 33 % are aware of Giuliani ’s position on abortion .
Perhaps more important , it does not appear that Giuliani ’s stance has appreciably hurt his image within his party ’s conservative base .
Giuliani ’s favorability rating among social - issue Republican and Republican - leaning voters who are aware that he is pro-choice is not significantly lower than among those who are unaware of his position on abortion ( 76 % vs. 80 % ) .
The survey finds that all of the leading presidential contenders in both parties are perceived as at least somewhat religious by large majorities of the public .
But among those expressing an opinion about the religiosity of the candidates , far more view Romney as “ very religious ” than say that about the other candidates .
Indeed , comparable numbers who expressed an opinion see Romney and President Bush as very religious ( 46 % vs. 43 % ) , though far fewer offered an opinion about Romney ’s religiosity than the president ’s ( 47 % vs. 87 % ) .
Far smaller numbers view Democrats John Edwards ( 28 % ) and Barack Obama ( 24 % ) as very religious ; still , more people view each of these candidates as highly religious than say that about any other Republican candidate except Romney .
Fewer than one - in - five says that John McCain ( 19 % ) , Fred Thompson ( 16 % ) and Rudy Giuliani ( 14 % ) are very religious , based on those expressing an opinion , though most see them as at least somewhat religious .
Fewer people view Hillary Clinton as very religious than say that about other leading Democrats ( 16 % ) .
In addition , 31 % of Americans view Clinton as not too religious or not at all religious — the highest percentage for any leading candidate in either party .
The perception that Clinton is not very religious is widespread among Republicans ( 55 % ) ; among Democrats , by contrast , nearly nine - in - ten see Clinton as religious ( 25 % very religious , 62 % somewhat religious ) .
Opinions about Clinton ’s religiosity have changed little over the past decade .
A 1996 Pew survey found that of those who could rate Clinton ’s religiosity , 14 % described her as very religious , 56 % as somewhat religious , and 31 % as not too or not at all religious .
Democrats are substantially more likely than Republicans to describe John Edwards as religious , but even among Republicans nearly three - in - four ( 73 % ) say Edwards is religious .
Partisan differences are smaller for the other candidates ; among those who could rate the religiosity of the candidates , overwhelming majorities in both parties describe Obama , Giuliani , Romney , McCain and Thompson as at least somewhat religious .
Overall views of the presidential candidates are linked with views of their religiosity ; those who perceive a candidate as being very religious tend to express the most favorable overall views of each candidate , followed by those who perceive the candidate as being somewhat religious .
Those who view candidates as being not too or not at all religious , on the other hand , are much less likely to express favorable views .
This pattern holds for Republican and Democratic candidates alike .
Among those who describe Giuliani as being very religious , 76 % express a favorable view of him , as do 73 % of those who view him as being somewhat religious .
Among those who say Giuliani is not too or not at all religious , by contrast , just 43 % say they hold a favorable view .
Similarly , 87 % of those who describe Clinton as very religious and 72 % of those who describe her as somewhat religious express a favorable view of the New York senator ; among those who say she is not too or not at all religious , just 22 % express a positive view .
While being perceived as highly religious is an asset for candidates , the greatest differences in favorability are between people who view them as at least somewhat religious and people who view them as not too or not at all religious .
By contrast , being seen as very religious provides a smaller boost for candidates .
Thompson ’s favorability rating , for instance , is 30 points higher among those who see him as somewhat religious than among those who see him as not too or not at all religious , but his favorability rating rises only another two percentage points among those who see him as very religious .
Similar patterns are seen for the other candidates .
The link between views of a candidate ’s religiosity and overall views of the candidate persists regardless of one ’s own party affiliation .
While Republicans and GOP leaners are much less likely than Democrats to express favorable views of Clinton , members of both parties are much more likely to hold a favorable view of Clinton if they see her as at least somewhat religious .
Four - in - ten Republicans and Republican leaners who say Clinton is very or somewhat religious express a favorable view of her , compared with only 8 % among Republicans who see Clinton as not very religious , a difference of 32 percentage points .
Likewise , Clinton ’s favorability rating is 28 points higher among Democrats and Democratic leaners who say she is religious ( 90 % ) than among those who say she is not religious ( 62 % ) .
A similar pattern is seen in both political parties for other candidates .
Notably , even people who themselves are not particularly observant have a more positive opinion of candidates they believe are at least somewhat religious .
Among people who attend religious services infrequently — those who attend a few times a year or less often or never — majorities who see all of the candidates as religious have a favorable opinion of them .
But fewer than half of infrequent church - goers who see the candidates as not religious express favorable opinions of them .
Romney and Religion
Romney , more than any other candidate , is viewed as highly religious .
Yet the political benefit he stands to gain from being perceived as very religious is limited by the reservations that some Americans have about voting for a Mormon .
Among Republican and Republican - leaning registered voters , Romney ’s overall favorability rating , though high at 75 % , is significantly lower than the favorability ratings of Giuliani ( 84 % ) and Thompson ( 88 % ) , and roughly equal to the favorability rating for McCain ( 71 % ) .
Romney ’s standing relative to the other candidates is particularly poor among those who say they would be less likely to vote for a Mormon ; among this group , Romney ’s favorable rating ( 54 % ) is substantially lower than those for Giuliani ( 76 % ) , McCain ( 72 % ) and Thompson ( 82 % ) .
Romney ’s relative standing is much better among Republican and Republican - leaning voters who do not express reluctance about voting for a Mormon ; indeed , among this group , Romney ’s favorability rating ( 81 % ) is significantly better than McCain ’s ( 71 % ) , while somewhat lower than Giuliani ’s ( 86 % ) and Thompson ’s ( 90 % ) .
While 25 % of Americans say they would be less likely to vote for a Mormon for president , 45 % express reluctance about voting for a Muslim and 61 % say they would be less likely to support a candidate who does not believe in God .
Far fewer express reservations about voting for an evangelical Christian , a Jew , or a Catholic .
Moreover , about as many people say they would be more likely to vote for an evangelical Christian or a Jew as say they would be less likely , and about twice as many people see being a Catholic as an asset as see it as a liability ( 13 % vs. 7 % ) .
By comparison , just 5 % say they would be more likely to vote for a Mormon , though two - thirds ( 66 % ) say it would make no difference in their vote .
The Parties and Religion
The Republican Party continues to be seen as more friendly toward religion than the Democratic Party , though the number who see the Democrats as unfriendly toward religion has declined slightly since 2006 .
Currently , half of the public ( 50 % ) says the Republican Party is friendly toward religion , about the same as it has been since 2003 .
Roughly a quarter ( 23 % ) say the party is neutral toward religion , and just 9 % says it is unfriendly toward religion .
By contrast , just three - in - ten ( 30 % ) say the Democratic Party is friendly toward religion , up slightly from last year but still 10 points lower than in August 2004 , during the last presidential election .
Even though most people do not see the party as friendly toward religion , they do not see it as particularly unfriendly either .
Just 15 % say the party is unfriendly , with 37 % saying the party is neutral .
After respondents were asked about the friendliness of each party to religion , they were asked : “ In your view , is this a good thing , a bad thing , or does n’t it matter to you ? ”
Friendliness toward religion is clearly valued as a good thing : half of those who say the Democratic Party is friendly toward religion believe this is a good thing ( 15 % out of the total 30 % who saw the party as friendly ) , and hardly anyone says it is bad .
The same pattern holds for the Republican Party ( 23 % of the total 50 % ) .
But importantly , neutrality towards religion by either party is not perceived negatively by most Americans .
Although the Democratic Party continues to be seen as less friendly to religion than the Republican Party , fewer people today than in 2005 believe that liberals who are not religious have too much control of the Democratic Party .
In the current survey , 37 % say this is true ; in 2005 , 44 % felt this way .
The number of people who say secular liberals have too much control over the party has declined within most of the major religious traditions , though a majority of white evangelicals ( 52 % ) continues to feel this way .
It also is down nine points among independents and 11 points among Democrats themselves .
Currently , about a third of independents ( 34 % ) and one - quarter of Democrats ( 23 % ) say secular liberals have too much control over the party .
Notably , though , Republicans today are only slightly less likely than they were two years ago to express this opinion ( 58 % now vs. 60 % in 2005 ) .
As was the case two years ago , a small plurality ( 43 % ) agrees with the statement that “ religious conservatives have too much control over the Republican Party , ” while 41 % disagree .
About half of white mainline Protestants ( 49 % ) think religious conservatives have too much sway over the party , but just 27 % of white evangelicals feel this way .
Fewer white Catholics today express this view than did so in 2005 ( 41 % now vs. 50 % in 2005 ) , but the proportion of people who have no religious affiliation agreeing with this has increased by seven points ( 63 % now vs. 56 % in 2005 ) .
Religion and Politics
Americans continue to be generally comfortable with a role for religion in politics , though these views are not unanimously held .
Most want a president who has strong religious beliefs , and most think it is proper for journalists to ask politicians about their religion .
Similarly , only a small minority says that there has been too much expression of religious faith and prayer by political leaders .
But the public draws a clear line against the active involvement of churches in election campaigns , with a solid majority ( 63 % ) opposing churches endorsing specific candidates .
The vast majority ( 69 % ) of Americans agree that it is important for a president to have strong religious beliefs .
However , there are important political and religious differences in the degree to which Americans agree with this view .
Republicans are much more intense in their view that the president should have strong religious beliefs than are Democrats or independents ( 44 % vs. 26 % and 23 % completely agree , respectively ) .
Most white evangelical Protestants ( 54 % ) and black Protestants ( 43 % ) strongly agree that a president should have strong religious beliefs compared to only 21 % of white mainline Protestants and 22 % of white non-Hispanic Catholics .
The religiously unaffiliated are the only group where the majority ( 62 % ) disagrees that a president should have strong religious convictions .
While the public wants a president with strong religious beliefs , many people are resistant to too much display of religiosity by politicians .
More than four - in - ten ( 43 % ) say that it makes them uncomfortable when politicians talk about how religious they are , a number that is little changed since the heat of the presidential campaign in 2004 .
However , most people do not currently feel that political leaders are crossing the line .
Just 27 % in the poll say that there has been too much expression of religious faith and prayer by political leaders .
A similar number ( 26 % ) says there has been the right amount of religious expression , and nearly four - in - ten ( 38 % ) would like to hear more talk about religion from politicians .
Only among white evangelicals ( 57 % ) and black Protestants ( 59 % ) do majorities say they want to hear more expression of faith and prayer from political leaders .
A majority of Americans see nothing improper with journalists asking politicians how their religious beliefs affect their opinions on issues of the day — 58 % of those polled say it is proper for them to do so , while 37 % say it is improper .
Even among religiously unaffiliated individuals , 53 % think it is okay .
Only among older respondents ( those 65 and older ) is there an even division of opinion on the question ( 45 % say it ’s proper , 45 % say it is improper ) .
There has been no change in views on this question over the past four years .
While most Americans accept a role for religion in politics , a sizable majority ( 63 % ) opposes churches endorsing candidates during election campaigns .
Just 28 % say churches should come out in favor of candidates , but that number has grown slightly since 2002 when only 22 % held this opinion .
There is majority opposition to churches endorsing candidates among people of all religious traditions , including 68 % of white mainline Protestants and white non-Hispanic Catholics , 58 % of black Protestants , and 53 % of white evangelicals .
Even among conservative Republicans , a group that tends to be friendly to religious involvement in politics , 52 % oppose churches endorsing candidates .
Issues : Stem Cell Research
After showing consistent increases between 2002 and 2005 , the survey finds that support for stem cell research has declined slightly since then , from a peak of 57 % in July 2005 to 51 % today .
Roughly one - third of the public ( 35 % ) opposes stem cell research , saying that protecting the potential life of embryos is more important than conducting the research .
The issue of stem cell research continues to divide Americans along political fault lines .
Majorities of Democrats ( 60 % ) and political independents ( 55 % ) say it is more important to conduct stem cell research that might result in new medical cures than it is to avoid destroying the potential life of human embryos , but only 37 % of Republicans agree .
And nearly twice as many self - identified liberals ( 69 % ) and moderates ( 61 % ) support stem cell research as conservatives ( 35 % ) .
The differences between religious groups are also quite large .
Solid majorities of the religiously unaffiliated ( 68 % ) , white mainline Protestants ( 58 % ) and white non-Hispanic Catholics ( 59 % ) support stem cell research ; however , support for stem cell research is much lower ( 46 % ) among white non-Hispanic Catholics who attend religious services at least weekly .
A majority ( 57 % ) of white evangelical Protestants say that it is more important to avoid destroying potential human life than to conduct stem cell research , a view that is particularly pronounced among white evangelicals who attend church at least weekly ( 68 % ) .
Black Protestants remain split over the issue of stem cell research , with 40 % favoring it , 40 % opposing it , and 20 % undecided .
As in past years there continues to be an important link between the public ’s knowledge about the stem cell debate and support for conducting research .
Overall , 45 % say they have heard a lot about the issue , while 43 % have heard a little ; just 12 % have heard nothing at all .
Public awareness of the debate has not changed much in recent years .
Among those who say they have heard a lot about the debate fully 62 % support conducting research , compared with just a third ( 33 % ) of those who have heard nothing at all about the stem - cell debate .
Issues : Gay Marriage
Attitudes toward gay marriage have remained virtually unchanged since July 2006 , with 36 % of Americans favoring it and 55 % expressing opposition to allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally .
As is the case with other social issues , opinions about this issue are closely linked with partisanship , ideology , and religion .
Support for gay marriage is highest among liberal Democrats ( 71 % ) and lowest among conservative Republicans ( 11 % ) , with other ideological and partisan groups falling in between .
Among religious groups , evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly oppose gay marriage , including 81 % of white evangelicals and 79 % of black evangelicals .
A large proportion in both groups — 55 % of white evangelicals and 48 % of black evangelicals — say they strongly oppose gay marriage .
White mainline Protestants and Catholics are more evenly divided on the issue .
The religiously unaffiliated are the only group in which a majority ( 60 % ) expresses support for gay marriage .
Overall , those who attend church weekly or more are significantly more opposed to gay marriage ( 73 % ) than those who attend church less often ( 43 % ) .
These differences extend across a variety of religious groups , including white evangelicals ( among whom weekly church attenders are 19 percentage points more opposed to gay marriage compared with less frequent attenders ) , white mainline Protestants ( among whom there is a 14 percentage point gap ) and white non-Hispanic Catholics ( 17 - point gap ) .
Issues : Abortion Opinion Stable
The poll finds that a majority ( 52 % ) of Americans express support for legalized abortion in most ( 35 % ) or all ( 17 % ) cases , while 43 % oppose legalized abortion in most ( 26 % ) or all ( 17 % ) circumstances .
These findings are consistent with the results from other surveys over the past few years .
Women are slightly more likely than men ( 21 % to 14 % ) to say that abortion should be legal in all cases .
College graduates are significantly more likely than those without any college education to say abortion should be legal ( 62 % vs. 46 % ) .
Among major political groups , liberal Democrats are by far the most supportive of legalized abortion , with 85 % saying it should be legal in all ( 35 % ) or most ( 50 % ) cases .
Majorities of moderate and liberal Republicans ( 54 % ) , political independents ( 54 % ) , and moderate and conservative Democrats ( 58 % ) also say abortion should be legal .
Among conservative Republicans , by contrast , 69 % say abortion should be illegal in most ( 42 % ) or all ( 27 % ) cases .
Among religious groups , white evangelical Protestants are most opposed to abortion .
Less than a third ( 31 % ) believes that it should be legal , while two - thirds believe it should be illegal in most ( 39 % ) or all ( 26 % ) cases .
Majorities in most other major religious groups support legalized abortion , including white Catholics ( 51 % ) , white mainline Protestants ( 63 % ) , black Protestants ( 60 % ) and the unaffiliated ( 68 % ) .
Since the Supreme Court upheld the congressional ban on partial birth abortion earlier this year , views of the procedure have remained relatively stable .
An overwhelming number of Americans ( 75 % ) favor keeping partial birth or late term abortion illegal .
Even among those who say abortion should be legal in all cases , almost half ( 49 % ) believe that partial birth abortion procedures should be illegal .
Overall , only 17 % of Americans say that partial birth abortion should be legal .
Issues : Death Penalty
More than six - in - ten Americans ( 62 % ) favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder .
Opinion about the death penalty has remained fairly steady in recent years , though there is less support now than during the 1990s ( 78 % in 1996 ) .
Support for the death penalty is particularly high among Republicans ( 80 % ) , while smaller majorities of independents ( 60 % ) and Democrats ( 52 % ) also support capital punishment in murder cases .
White evangelical Protestants support the death penalty at slightly higher rates than do white mainline Protestants ( 74 % to 68 % ) , while about half ( 51 % ) of black Protestants oppose it .
Among white non-Hispanic Catholics , 66 % support capital punishment , but support is significantly lower among weekly attending white Catholics ( 55 % ) than among those who attend church less often ( 73 % ) .

The builders lavished attention on every last detail .
First they constructed the house , then they decorated and fitted it out it to the highest specification .
But to the thousands of people who thronged to see this astonishing building in northern Poland , it looks as if a crucial fact escaped their attention .

Perched precariously on its roof , the house is , very definitely , upside down .
Thankfully , the spacious abode is not a building project gone wrong but Poland 's latest tourist attraction and has already drawn throngs of people to the tiny village of Szymbark .

Crowds flocked to its opening earlier this week and then queued for hours to troop through the confusing , disorientating rooms .

Rather than simply being a bizarre tourist attraction , the house is also meant to be a profound statement about the Communist era and the state of the world .

This statement by Senator Hillary Clinton was not ( as commonly assumed ) addressed to the general public , but rather to a group of relatively well - to - do Democrats attending a June 2004 fundraiser for California senator Barbara Boxer .
Her statement specifically referred to a desire to repeal tax cuts that had recently been enacted by the Bush administration , cuts which many Democrats had criticized as favoring the wealthy :
Headlining an appearance with other Democratic women senators on behalf of Sen. Barbara Boxer , who is up for re-election this year , Hillary Clinton told several hundred supporters — some of whom had ponied up as much as $ 10,000 to attend — to expect to lose some of the tax cuts passed by President Bush if Democrats win the White House and control of Congress .

“ Many of you are well enough off that … the tax cuts may have helped you , ” Sen . Clinton said .
“ We ’re saying that for America to get back on track , we ’re probably going to cut that short and not give it to you .
We ’re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good . ”
“ It ’s time for a new beginning , for an end to government of the few , by the few , and for the few …
And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity . ”
This entry is a pieced - together passage from a 29 May 2007 economic policy speech given by Senator Clinton on the subject of “ Modern Progressive Vision : Shared Prosperity . ”
The supposedly “ Marxist ” nature of this statement is undercut when the sentences that immediately followed it ( affirming support for a free market economy ) are included for context :
It ’s time for a new beginning , for an end to government of the few , by the few and for the few , time to reject the idea of an “ on your own ” society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity .
I prefer a “ we ’re all in it together ” society . , time to reject the idea of an “ on your own ” society .
I prefer a “ we ’re all in it together ” society .
Now , there is no greater force for economic growth than free markets , but markets work best with rules that promote our values , protect our workers and give all people a chance to succeed .
When we get our priorities in order and make the smart investments we need , the markets work well .
“ ( We ) … ca n’t just let business as usual go on , and that means something has to be taken away from some people . ”
“ We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own in order to create this common ground . ”
“ I certainly think the free - market has failed . ”
The above three statements are all out - of - context passages taken from a 4 June 2007 CNN “ Presidential Forum “ conducted with three Democratic presidential hopefuls , senators John Edwards , Barack Obama , and Hillary Clinton .
The second statement was part of a straightforward expression of the need to for people to reach a consensus ( through metaphorically giving up some of their political “ turf , ” not literally giving up their possessions ) on how to proceed in order to tackle an issue such as universal health insurance , while the first statement is another pieced - together quote that omits the contextual references to the issues of health care , dependence on foreign oil , and climate change :
We can set the vision .
We can even work to articulate the goal .
But the pathway is extraordinarily complicated because of how we live today and
how we think of ourselves in relation to our fellow citizens .
We can set the vision .
We can even work to articulate the goal .
But the pathway is extraordinarily complicated because of how we live today andhow we think of ourselves in relation to our fellow citizens .
Take health care .
I think we could get almost unanimous agreement that having more than 45 million uninsured people , nine million of whom are children , is a moral wrong in America .
And I think we could reach that agreement , and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured , because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person .
I mean , that is a fact .
So , what do we do ?
We have to build a political consensus .
And that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf , in order to create this common ground .
The same with energy — you know , we ca n’t keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil , and the need to deal with global warming , and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God ’s creation , and just let business as usual go on .
And that means something has to be taken away from some people .
The third statement was part of a passage in which Senator Clinton listed a number of entities ( including churches , schools , and the government , as well as the free market ) that she felt had failed in helping young people to make responsible decisions ( particularly in reference to abortion ) :
Q : Could you see yourself , with millions of voters in a pro-life camp , creating a common ground , with the goal ultimately in mind of reducing the decisions for abortion to zero ?
Q : Could you see yourself , with millions of voters in a pro-life camp , creating a common ground , with the goal ultimately in mind of reducing the decisions for abortion to zero ?
A : Yes .
Yes .
And that is what I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years , going back , really , at least 15 years , in talking about abortion being safe , legal , and rare .
And , by rare , I mean rare .
And it ’s been a challenge , because the pro-life and the pro-choice communities have not really been willing to find much common ground .
And I think that is a great failing on all of our parts , because , for me there are many opportunities to assist young people to make responsible decisions .
There is a tremendous educational and public outreach that could be done through churches , through schools , through so much else .
But I think it has to be done with an understanding of reaching people where they are today .
We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture , and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make .
And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people .
I mean , I think that we have failed them in our churches , our schools , our government .
And I certainly think the , you know , free market has failed .
We have all failed .
We have left too many children to sort of fend for themselves morally .
“ I think it ’s time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in ( the ) entire economy that they are being watched . ”
This passage was taken from a 2 September 2005 appearance by Senator Clinton in front of constituents in Elmira Heights , New York , where ( in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina ) she expressed her opinion about the need for federal regulatory oversight of the oil industry in order to curb high gasoline prices and U.S. dependence on foreign oil :
The anxiety and anger felt by motorists was evident at nearly every turn in her travels throughout the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York .
She made clear she shared the concern .

She made clear she shared the concern .
“ I think it ’s time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they ’re being watched , ” she said in explaining her call for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission .
“ I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible , and that ’s what you need a government regulatory system for : to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair , to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage . ”
Clinton criticized the new energy bill , which she opposed , as inadequate to solve the country ’s long - term energy problem .
She said the United States has regressed over the past three decades , since the first oil shocks of the early 1970s .
“ We ’ve had 30 years to do some things we have n’t done , ” she said .
“ In fact we ’ve gotten , we ’ve gone backwards in many respects .
“ I am tired of being at the mercy of people in the Middle East and elsewhere , and I ’m tired frankly of being at the mercy of these large oil companies , ” Clinton said .

Mackay Base Hospital has successfully used alcoholic beverages to treat a 24 - year - old Italian tourist who ingested litres of a poison commonly found in anti-freeze .
After running out of pharmaceutical - grade alcohol used to help stop the poison turning toxic in the stomach , staff of the north Queensland hospital had to give the man rounds of rum , scotch and vodka .
Dr Todd Fraser says while unconventional , the patient was given three standard drinks every hour for three days .
" Fortunately for him he was in a medically induced coma for a good portion of that , " he said .
" By the time he woke up I think his hangover would have well and truly gone . "
It is being reported the US may have moved a step closer to military action against Iran , but there has also been a change in the potential target .
A new report suggests the target of any attack would be Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , rather than the country 's nuclear facilities .
Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Seymour Hersh has been writing about the possibility of a US strike on Iran for the past 18 months .
In his latest article for The New Yorker magazine and in a TV interview , he has gone on to claim that Australia has " expressed interest " in the concept .
Public unconvinced
In his latest article for The New Yorker he argues the Bush administration has acknowledged the American public is not convinced Iran poses an imminent nuclear threat .
At the same time , he says there is a renewed focus on the increasing number of attacks on coalition forces in Iraq , and claims that Iranian munitions are playing a key role .
This was part of a speech by President George W Bush in late August .
" The attacks on our bases and our troops by Iranian supplied munitions have increased in the last few months , despite pledges by Iran to help stabilise the security situation in Iraq , " Mr Bush said in the speech .
" I will take actions necessary to protect our troops , I have authorised our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran 's murderous activities . "
Mr Hersh cites this rhetoric as evidence of the changing tone coming out of the Bush administration .
" The name of the game used to be that they 're a nuclear threat , Iran is going to have a bomb soon , we have to do it , sort of the same game we had before the war in Iraq , " he said .
" What 's happened is that in that last few months they 've come to the realisation that 's it 's not selling , the American people are n't worried about Iran as a nuclear threat , certainly as they were about Iraq , there 's just some scepticism .
" So they 've switched , really . "
Mr Hersh says he believes there is now a consensus within the American public that if the Iranians are actively pursuing plans to develop a nuclear weapon , they are at least five years away from their goal .
He says that has tipped the shift in the administration 's approach .
" Instead of trying to sell it , not only to the American people but to its allies , the notion of a massive bombing against the infrastructure , what they call counter - proliferation against the infrastructure of the Iraqi bomb , hitting the various facilities that we know exist - instead , they 've now decided that they 're going to hit the Iranians , payback for hitting us , " he said .
" They 're going to hit the Revolutionary Guard headquarters and facilities , they 're going to tone down the bombing , they 're going to shift it .
It 's going to be more surgical . "
Mr Hersh says the new strategy involves a subtle change of targets .
" We 're threatening Iran , we 've been doing it constantly , but instead of saying to the American people and instead of saying internally , ' It 's going to be about nuclear weapons ' , it 's now going about getting the guys that are killing our boys , " he said .
" We 're going to hit the border facilities , the facilities inside Iraq that we think are training terrorists , we 're going to hit the facilities we think are supplying some of the explosive devices into Iraq .
" This is the administration 's position . "
Australia on board ?
He also claims the Bush administration 's new focus is getting support from its allies , including Australia .
" The Brits are interested in this idea , there have been expressions of interest from Australia , other countries , the Israelis of course have gone bananas , they 're very upset about the idea of not going , " he said .
" If you 're going to go into Iran , the Israeli position is very firm , they want us to go , and they want us to hit hard .
...
An Israeli told me , if you run into a lion , you either shoot it , or ignore it , you do n't pluck out its eyebrows .
" Going in and taking out the Revolutionary Guard and not taking out the nuclear facilities , for the Israelis is it a non-starter .
" But that 's the plan , the plan is to be more surgical , more careful , and they 're getting some of their allies on board . "
Last week , Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said he called on Iran to stop supplying weapons to militias in Iraq during a recent bilateral meeting with Iran 's Foreign Minister .
A spokesman for the Minister 's office declined to respond to Mr Hersh 's latest claims .
' The opening gambit '
Dr Michael McKinley , a senior lecturer in International Relations and Strategy at the Australian National University , says a US attack would lead to war .
" If the United States was to engage in surgical strikes , as some people are once again talking about , you would have to say that Iran could very well behave in such a way , and there 'd be a broad scope of possibilities here , where a widely escalated war would need to ensue after that , because I cannot imagine that Iran would just allow itself to be attacked without taking some sort of forceful reaction , " he said .
He is unconvinced an attack on Iran would stop with ' surgical strikes ' .
" You have to challenge the logic of it , because if you attack Iran because it seems to be supporting activities inside Iraq , then by the logic that everybody in the decision - making framework seems to have , Iran would then speed up its alleged nuclear weapons program , " he said .
" That would be the logical way of regarding an Iranian reaction , which would then of course require a further and much stronger reaction on its nuclear sites from the United States .
" So this would appear to be only the opening gambit , rather than a one - off , if you take everybody 's logic at face value . "
Dr McKinley says he believes there there is a disposition in the US administration to take some form of military action against Iran .
" I would be more surprised rather than less surprised if there was not an attack sometime before the Bush administration leaves office , " he said .
Mr Hersh agrees .
" What I do know , is he wants to do something , " he said .
" He will not leave Iran in a position to be a nuclear power and a position to be a threat . "
Visit Lobelog.com for the latest news analysis and commentary from Inter Press News Service ’s Washington bureau chief Jim Lobe .
This is just to assure readers of the site that I am still alive ( having been first on a family vacation and then down with the flu ) , although I learned this week that I am once again persona non grata ( PNG ) at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) .
The first time I was declared unwelcome there resulted from my appearance on BBCâ€™s weekly public - affairs â€ œPanoramaâ€ television program , â€ œThe War Party , â€ that aired in May 2003 and covered the neo- conservativesâ€™ role in promoting the invasion of Iraq .
( AEIâ€™s Joshua Muravchik later assailed the program in an article in the September 2003 Commentary , â€ œThe Neoconservative Cabal , â€ in which , among other things , he noted , curiously , that â€ œ [ Lobe ] look ( ed ) as Jewish as his name sounds .â€ I am indeed Jewish . )
I have since attended several AEI events without incident , but last week , when my colleague , Eli Clifton , was registering for the â€œNo Middle Way : Two Reports on Iraqâ€ event September 6 , he was taken aside by AEIâ€™s communications director and told that AEI knew that he worked with me and that , while he was welcome to attend the forum that day , I was still PNG .
In a subsequent phone call with Eli , she re-affirmed that I was unwelcome at Washingtonâ€™s most prominent and influential neo-conservative think tank because I had allegedly made false accusations about and mounted ad hominem attacks against its scholars .
Although requested , no specifics were forthcoming , and I remain in the dark about what she â€ ” or those who informed her â€ ” have in mind .
Of course , my writings about AEI and its associates are on the record , and readers can reach their own conclusions as to the merits of its allegations and the appropriateness of its remedy .
But it is remarkable that an institution that prides itself on promoting freedom around the world and on defending â€œopen debateâ€  and â€ œthe competition of ideas , â€ as its mission statement asserts , would seek to restrict access to its policy forums in this way .
Eli , incidentally , is leaving the Washington bureau for a masterâ€™s program in international relations at Elliott Abramsâ€ ™ alma mater , the London School of Economics , as is another valued colleague , Ellen Massey .
( Ah , youth ! )
I have no doubt they will perform brilliantly in their studies and perhaps find some time to continue to contribute to IPS as well .
I hope to catch up quickly on recent events in the coming days and resume posting more frequently next week .
It seems to me that looking at the most - alarmist writings of the incumbent political party 's ideological adversaries and noting that their concerns seem overstated is a solid " evergreen " story idea , so I do n't bregrudge Noemie Emery and The Weekly Standard for taking a stab at it .
But as Gene Healy notes she sure did pick a strange lede :
The fascists are coming !
Or rather , they 're already here , installed in the White House , planning like mad to subvert the Constitution and extend their reign in perpetuity , having first suppressed and eviscerated all opposition and put all of their critics in jail .
Thus goes the rant of America 's increasingly unhinged left .
If only , sigh many Bush partisans , wondering when this administration will get out of the fetal position and show some fighting spirit .
This is the kind of thing that gets people nervous .
Meanwhile , I would note that whether or not one thinks it likely that Bush will start ordering his political opponents to be not so much put " in jail " as abducted off the streets and then held incommunicado in secret foreign facilities for an indefinite span of time during which they 'll be tortured until , eventually , their coerced confessions as used as evidence for never releasing them , the point I would make is that Bush really has asserted his constitutional right to do this and the main opinion leaders on the right have agreed that there should be no meaningful constraint on his ability to behave in this manner .

HOUSTON , Texas -- Six - year - old Valentin Marroquin went from being apparently healthy one moment to battling leukemia the next .
As his mother Rosario Marroquin started searching for answers , she kept coming back to their Houston , Texas , neighborhood , and the stench that often envelops it .
Valentin Marroquin of Houston , Texas , was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of six .
" We 're the stinky neighborhood , " she said .
" But we 've gotten so used to it that we do n't know that 's just how we smell . "
The Marroquin family lives in the Manchester area of Houston , next to the Houston ship channel , the largest petrochemical complex in the United States .
Day after day , oil refineries and petrochemical companies pump hazardous pollutants , including known cancer - causing chemicals like benzene and 1 - 3 butadiene , into the air .
" I 'm not ignorant , " Rosario told CNN .
" Kids get sick in the country in the fresh air , but this had something to do with it . "
See the source of the smell they fear »
No one can say for certain that Valentin 's illness was caused by the air he breathed , but earlier this year , the University of Texas released a study showing that children who live within two miles of the ship channel have a 56 percent greater chance of getting leukemia than kids living elsewhere .
It 's the first study showing an association between the channel 's air quality and childhood leukemia .
The health risks from the shipping canal are not limited to cancer .
The chemicals in the air can cause other serious health problems , such as respiratory diseases and birth defects .

Tom McGarity , a professor of environmental law at the University of Texas , believes such conditions are allowed to persist because 90 percent of the people who call the ship channel home are Hispanic and many of them are poor .
" If these plants were omitting these kinds of levels in River Oaks , it would n't be happening , I promise , " he said .
River
Oaks is one of the more affluent communities in Houston .
The connection between poverty and poor environmental conditions is not limited to Texas .
In many of the countries visited for CNN's " Planet in Peril " documentary , such as Cambodia , Thailand , Madagascar , Chad , China and Brazil , it is the poor and disenfranchised who bear the brunt of environmental burdens .
A similar dynamic plays out in the United States , where class and very often race can determine where one lives .
In 2005 , for example , The Associated Press reported blacks were 79 percent more likely than whites to live in neighborhoods where industrial pollution was suspected of posing the greatest health danger .
" It 's really mind - boggling that we could kind of write off , you know , a whole section of our society , " said Majora Carter , founder of the Sustainable South Bronx , which fights what Carter calls " environmental racism " in New York and around the country .
" No one should have to bear the brunt of environmental burdens and not enjoy any environmental benefits , and right now race and class ... really determine the good things like parks and trees or the bad stuff like waste facilities and power plants , " she said .
Michael Honeycutt , chief toxicologist for the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality , says progress has been made in reducing toxins around the Houston Ship Channel .
There is " one third less pollution in the Houston Ship Channel this year , compared to last year , because of our approach of bringing companies in , telling them what we want , " Honeycutt said .
" And we 're seeing those reductions . "
" Our job is to protect human health and the environment , " he said .
" What 's happened is it 's issues of timing -- what 's a safe level , what 's not a safe level . "
Honeycut said scientists are generating new data all the time and that certain emissions or areas formerly thought to be safe may no longer appear to be .
Houston Mayor Bill
White has pledged to reduce the level of air toxins for communities along the ship channel .
" We will have both the political and legal battle with the industry until we get widespread agreement to do so , " White said .
A Rice University study released in 2006 showed that Houston has a higher concentration of benzene and 1 - 3 butadiene than anywhere else in the United States .
The annual average of 1 - 3 butadiene , a carcinogen , was at least 20 times higher than any other city in America .
Companies in the ship channel told CNN they 've started voluntarily limiting their emissions .
They also point out that they have n't broken any laws .
There are no laws in either Texas or at the federal level that limit the amount of hazardous air pollutants these companies pump into the air .
There is an effort under way to get a law passed in Texas , but Professor McGarity said it 's going to be an uphill battle because the oil and chemical industry has deep roots in Texas .
" That 's going to be reflected at the top among the political appointees who are more part of this , shall we say ' Wild West ' culture , where anything goes , " he said .
Now 10 years old , Valentin 's cancer is in remission , and he and his family still live in the neighborhood they think poisoned him , but they are speaking out about their experience .
The Maroquins say they have n't left because they can't afford to go anywhere else .
" When you 're sitting out there , when you 're watching them playing , you think , is it going to happen ? " Rosario asks .
" Are they breathing it now ? " E-mail to a friend

The owner of Book Revue did absolutely nothing wrong .
This needs to be made very clear .
NEITHER DID THE police .
I spoke with the book store owner today personally and he wants everyone to know the following :
" I would like to make our position at Book Revue clear as regards Sean Hannity , Marc Levin and the event here last Saturday night .
Both of those gentlemen are welcome here .
Always have been and always will be .
So are Rosie O'Donnell , Jane Fonda and Cindy Sheehan .
We are merchants .
We sell books , we do n't take political positions in our professional capacity as booksellers .
Our personal political views are just that - personal .
We are not in business to take sides and we certainly do not want to get caught in the crossfire .
We provide a forum and we sell books .
To my knowledge , no one on our staff made any comments about anyone on Saturday night .
I have spoken to each of them and no comments were made .
We are all aware that our personal politics are our own business and are not to mix our personal beliefs with our professional lives . "
I personally think we need to admire people who do n't bring their political views ( whatever they are ) to their businesses .
This is a family owned bookstore with a stellar reputation and the fact that they are equally accommodating to Sean Hannity and Cindy Sheehan is something we all should accept , liberal or conservative .
First let me clear up some loose ends .
We live in a society of laws and although street justice and raw emotions are a part of us , I remained respectful and very calm and cool under a tense , pressure filled situation .
I 'm my own harshest critic but I handled myself superbly , maturely , and lawfully .
Second , many of you asked , What did Dave accomplish ?
The answer is a million times more than I ever thought I could and I 'm only getting started .
Now almost all of the credit in the world goes to Phil Boyce for a braincramp meltdown but nevertheless , here is what I 've accomplished so far .
A. I 'm exposing Boyce and Hannity for their true colors .
B. I 'm exposing the Hannity audience for their true colors .
C. The next time Faux News claims Democrats can't handle questions , we can all laugh because they are afraid of a 6 foot 3 oaf whose 30 pounds past his better days .
D. I have an iron clad claim against them which they caused by their utter stupidity , malice , and meanness .
Now here 's what stupid would look like .
A. Trying to go back into the store after Boyce has committed the tort .
Is it really worth it of me ?
Of course not .
B. Not reaching a gentleman 's agreement with the store owner .
The store owner did NOT kick me out .
We just agreed mutually that I would not go back in that evening .
The tort has already happened , why do anything to undermine it ?
C. Not cooperating with the cops .
The cops received a call and I was the subject of the complaint .
They do NOT know at the time that it's a bogus phone call made by a Brownshirt trying to censor someone 's speech .
They do NOT know at the time that the store approved of my presence and that no one had asked me to leave .
The cops had EVERY right to escort me out of the store to question me as humiliating as it was for me .
They got the truth and I was let go .
The claim of false imprisonment .
I was detained against my will for 15 minutes because of Boyce , who was actually or apparently operating under the direction of Sean Hannity and WABC Radio .
I had NO CHOICE to leave .
False imprisonment can be for 5 seconds .
In my case it was 15 minutes .
It 's a rock solid case .
Next , I do n't believe in spray and pray legal theories .
I stick to the claims I have , not the ones my raw emotions wish could be there .
I do not get to decide whether Boyce should be arrested for I am not the police .
I know the elements
Where I am at
I have counsel within the firm I work for , am doing all the grunt work myself , and I 'm gathering all my information , some of which I can't share with you because it 's part of classified legal research .
The tort of false imprisonment has a 1 yr statute of limitations in New York so I 'm in no rush to file the summons and complaint and serve Hannity , Boyce , and WABC .
The S + C will be filed on my timeline and they will be served on my timeline .
You will all learn about it right after it happens ( I promise ) but not before .
I have done a lot of the work that needs to be done .
I will be thorough .
Legal actions are different from political actions .
There are damages involved for falsely imprisoning someone and humiliating them .
Those are compensatory damages .
I have an idea what they 're worth here but in reality , that 's up to a jury .
There are also punitive damages and making bogus phone calls to police when the police could have been out there doing something else to protect the public is something our society wants to discourage .
Only a jury can put a dollar figure on that .
Legal actions involve reason .
If the lawyers at WABC have brains and realize the situation , they may want to come to a reasonable and mutual conclusion to the matter .
If we reach an agreement that 's fair , I wo n't pursue it further .
However , this is a unique case because it is very public already and going to get more public .
99.9 % of the time you do n't broadcast lawsuits or your legal intentions .
Thus , the circumstances of a settlement could include creative solutions but from my point of view , it would also have to include some admission of wrongdoing / personal accountability on their part .
Legal Offense Fund -
I still have to think this through .
I appreciate the support and suggestions but since I would actually do 95 % of the legal work , this raises red flag ethics issues to me .
I have to sort these out first and have yet to do so .
This is where we stand .
I 'll answer questions in the thread but I am working .
Researchers from Duke University and the University of Cambridge think there is a way to determine whether some black holes are not actually black .
Finding such an unmasked form of what physicists term a singularity " would shock the foundation of general relativity , " said Arlie Petters , a Duke professor of mathematics and physics who worked with Marcus Werner , Cambridge graduate student in astrophysics , on a report posted online Monday , Sept. 24 , for the research journal Physical Review D .
" It would show that nature has surprises even weirder than black holes , " Petters added .
Albert Einstein originally theorized that stars bigger than the sun can collapse and compress into singularities , entities so confining and massively dense that the laws of physics break down inside them .
Astronomers have since found indirect evidence for these entities , which are popularly known as black holes because of the " cosmic censorship conjecture . "
This conjecture is that " realistic " singularities -- meaning those that can be formed in nature -- must always hide within a barrier known as an " event horizon " from which light can never escape .
That makes them appear perpetually black to the rest of the universe .
But cosmic censorship is " an open conjecture that is very difficult to prove , and very difficult to disprove , " said Petters .
And , despite the general support for the universality of black holes , Kip Thorne and John Preskill , two experts in the cosmology of relativity at the California Institute of Technology , have suggested for more than a decade that naked singularities could exist in certain instances .
Now Petters and Werner have devised a way to test for their presence .

Astronomers cannot say for sure whether all black holes are actually black , having never fully penetrated the obscuring outward matter surrounding such objects , Petters said .
As their main evidence , scientists can only point to effects that the massive gravitational pull of certain unseen entities exert on surrounding matter .
Those effects include emissions of highly energetic radiation , or the extreme orbits of nearby stars .
Petters is an expert in " gravitational lensing , " another effect of relativity that permits massive sources of gravity to split light from background astronomical features into multiple images .
In earlier reports in the November , 2005 and February , 2006 issues of Physical Review D , he and Charles Keeton of Rutgers University suggested a way to use gravitational lensing to show whether cosmic censorship can ever be violated .
However , that evaluation was limited to non-spinning singularities that are considered only theoretically possible .
The suspected singularities astronomers have found in space so far all appear to be rapidly spinning , sometimes at more than 1,000 times a second .
So Petters and Werner teamed up to see if they could generalize such an application of gravitational lensing to all realistic spinning singularities .
Their surprising result was yes , Petters said .

In work supported by the National Science Foundation in the United States and the Science and Technology Facilities Council in the United Kingdom , the pair employed a finding that a black hole could be shed of its event horizon and become a naked singularity if its angular momentum -- an effect of its spin -- is greater than its mass .
That would translate into a spin of a few thousand rotations a second in the case of a black hole weighing about 10 times more than our Sun , said Werner .
In the event that the required conditions were met , Petters ' and Werner 's calculations show that a naked singularity 's massive gravitation would split the light of background stars or galaxies in telltale ways that are potentially detectable by astronomers using existing or soon - to - be instruments .
Those possible ways are outlined by six different equations in their study that connect a singularity 's spin to the separations , angular alignments and brightness of the two split images .
" If you ask me whether I believe that naked singularities exist , I will tell you that I 'm sitting on the fence , " said Petters .
" In a sense , I hope they are not there .
I would prefer to have covered - up black holes .
But I 'm still open - minded enough to entertain the ' otherwise ' possibility . "
George Bush has used " snowflake babies " - extraneous fertilized eggs from fertility treatments that were adopted ahead of already - living kids that need a home , but hey , these kids are all white - to make his stem cell policies unassailable , during the Social Security debacle a while back there was a 9 year old who traveled the country speaking at events to try and convince people to destroy the program , etc .
Not one blogger - NOT ONE ! - " visited " that kid's family at home , or looked into their finances .
Not one blogger has searched out these " snowflake babies " to see what lives they 're living .
In fact , I 've been surprised at the restraint the media has had regarding George Bush 's kids .
Chelsea Clinton was never spared any insult the Right Wing Hate Machine could spew out .
If the Bush twins could have just behaved themselves a bit a few years ago , we would have never heard anything about them .
Why ?
Because there is simply no organization , no group , no ethos on the American Left which considers its political philosophy so important and inherently moral that this nation 's laws and normal ethics do n't apply .
There is no such thing as a Left - wing radio host with a program based upon insults and hatred .
There are no Left - wing TV show hosts who get on every night and lie lie lie like Bill O'Reilly , Glenn Beck , Scarborough , Matthews , Russert and all the other hacks and flacks on TV .
I 'm not trying to say that all liberals are super - good and moral people , nor can every conservative be characterized as the opposite .
But the movements are entirely different .
Moveon.org puts an ad in the New York Times using a nickname from General Petraeus ' own career - General Betrayus - and the Right goes nuts .
Rush Limbaugh had used that smear against Chuck Schumer months ago , calling him Senator Betrayus in counterpoint to Gen. Petraeus ' then - upcoming testimony .
Nothing was done .
The above example is just par for the course .
The Left in this country is routinely portrayed as being angry , bitter , unhinged .
But what proof is there of that ?
Just like with the fabricated spitting on Vietnam vets incidents , proof of a rabid , angry and deranged Left in this country simply is n't around .
But there is an entire media industry that garners a majority of its profits from the perpetuation of that very myth while ignoring the quite real examples of extreme Right - wing fanatics who do commit violence .
Violence such as bombing women 's health clinics ( they usually are n't the clinics that offer abortions ) and shooting doctors who perform abortions , like posting journalists ' personal information and calling on people to teach their children - there 's the children as targets again - a lesson for publishing photos of Dick Cheney 's and Donald Rumsfeld 's vacation homes , never mind that they had permission .
Invasions of privacy , smears , lies , all piped into the homes of millions of Americans simply because someone got on their bad side , or happened to be around when the GOP desperately needed a distraction from the corruption and incompetence that has so taken hold of the party structure and leadership .
I can tell you this :
If Michelle Malkin - or anyone else - trespassed on my property in order to harass my family about stuff that 's none of her business , I 'd smack the hell out of her and be fully within my rights .
This is one liberal who , when it comes to his kids , makes the proverbial she - bear protecting her cubs look like an arthritic toy poodle .

We brought the news to you first just a week ago and even made fun of it earlier today , but now it 's official — here in Frankfurt , Lamborghini just rolled out its first entry in the seven - figure car sweepstakes .
To be dubbed Reventon , it 's based on the Murcielago LP640 , and it'll cost a breezy one - million euros .
Only 20 are set to be constructed , and all have been already betrothed to high rollers who 've reportedly ponied up more than $ 300,000 each as a deposit .
Rumors had indicated the car was inspired by jet fighters , a prospect bourne out by the greenish dash cluster .
It even has a gauge to track G forces , just in case you were n't busy enough making that sweeping left hander off the back straight on track day .
The official rollout will take place at the show tomorrow .

America ’s culture of marketing provided inspiration .
Ben Casnocha surveyed his future customers and asked them what services they needed and how much they were willing to pay .
He also had to persuade people to do business with a teenager .
He had no formal education in marketing but , as a suburban American youth , he was exposed to intense commercial marketing every day .
He decided to become an entrepreneur at the age of 12 , he says , after being struck by the Apple “ Think Different ” ad .
Critics contend that corporate selling and advertising are dumbing down America ’s young .
But marketing often motivates or instructs young people .
In addition , it can teach them how to think about marketing messages more critically .
The fact that American schooling is less disciplined than that in other countries gives young creators the time and the energy to accomplish something outside their formal education .
Despite his intellectual talents , Ben , in his book , admits that he received indifferent grades and had little emotional attachment to most of his formal schooling .
Whenever he could , he used sick days to set up meetings for his business .
The longstanding criticism of the American school system is that even in the better schools , too many students just “ get by ” rather than engage in a rigorous curriculum .
This academic leniency is bad for many average or subpar students , but it also allows some students to flourish .
Relatively loose family structures have similar effects ; American children are especially likely to be working on their own projects , rather than being directed by parents and elders .
Compared with those in other countries , American children play a much more influential role in society and enjoy a remarkable degree of autonomy .
American fast food , with its fatty , sweet and bland tastes , is geared toward children , as are many American movies and television shows .
Teenagers receive higher allowances , have greater access to credit cards , and have more money to spend on culture , or , in some cases , to spend on starting a business .
American labor markets are flexible enough to create a large number of jobs at the lower end of the wage scale .
Teenagers are more likely to acquire work experience , and they are more likely to earn a small amount of capital for financing a start - up enterprise .
It is a common American dream to want to start one ’s own business , and this cultural influence spreads to the young .
It sometimes replaces school and family as a driving force .
Ben , in an e-mail message , cited the openness of American culture .
“ If starting a business was n’t ‘ cool , ’ ” he wrote , “ I doubt very many teens would partake . ”
In the relatively nonegalitarian United States , almost everyone likes a winner .
Ben also cited outsourcing , in this case the ability to buy cheap programming from abroad , as helping business start - ups .
John Edwards followed Coulter a day later and said that we need to fight back against attacks like Ann's on Hardball .

JOHN EDWARDS : I applaud Elizabeth .
I think that when people like Ann Coulter — and it ‘s not just her , unfortunately , it ‘s her and people just like her , Karl Rove and all those people .
I mean , when they engage us in this kind of hate - mongering , you have to stand up to them .
You have to stand up to them .
They start this fight , but we have to be willing to be strong and to fight back because if we don‘t , Chris , what happens is all the important things — men and women dying in Iraq , those who do n‘t have health insurance , et cetera , their issues do n‘t get heard .
Instead , it ‘s this — it ‘s this low - level dialogue with this name - calling , which is what we see .
( full transcript below the fold )
MATTHEWS : OK .
Yes , Senator Edwards now , I guess the question last night was why did n‘t you make the call , rather than Elizabeth , to Ann Coulter on the HARDBALL set ?
JOHN EDWARDS ( D - NC ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
Well , the simple answer to that is Elizabeth , I guess , heard her and knew she was on and called in .
So I thought it was appropriate that I come on today .
MATTHEWS : OK .
Did you talk with your wife , Elizabeth , beforehand about this , her decision to call in to the program ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Elizabeth made this decision on her own to call in , I guess based on what she was hearing from Ann Coulter and I think something Ann Coulter had said a couple of days before .
MATTHEWS : Right .
Well , what is your reaction to what you heard last night and heard today about what happened last night ?
JOHN EDWARDS : I applaud Elizabeth .
I think that when people like Ann Coulter — and it ‘s not just her , unfortunately , it ‘s her and people just like her , Karl Rove and all those people .
I mean , when they engage us in this kind of hate - mongering , you have to stand up to them .
You have to stand up to them .
They start this fight , but we have to be willing to be strong and to fight back because if we don‘t , Chris , what happens is all the important things — men and women dying in Iraq , those who do n‘t have health insurance , et cetera , their issues do n‘t get heard .
Instead , it ‘s this — it ‘s this low - level dialogue with this name - calling , which is what we see .
MATTHEWS : Well , what do you make of the role of trash talk in politics generally , this willingness on the part of partisans to enrage the other side by going over the top ?
I mean , is that a smart tactic ?
Does it work ?
Does it debase the politics ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Oh , it clearly debases the politics .
There ‘s no doubt about that .
It makes it very difficult to talk about issues that affect people ‘s day - to - day lives .
And it ‘s why , when this kind of hate - mongering and this hate language is used — and I just — I feel the need to point out this woman did n‘t just use it against me .
I mean , the things she said about Senator Obama , the things she said about Senator Clinton , they all fall in the same category .
And they ‘re calculated to create an emotional response .
They ‘re calculated to make people hate .
And if you do n‘t speak out against it , then that means you ‘re tolerating this kind of language and it means you think it ‘s OK .
It ‘s not OK .
MATTHEWS :
What do you make of someone who‘s a person who writes a column , went to Michigan Law School , has a fine education , apparently , from what I can tell , is quite a writer , a good writer , uses comments like , I hope that the terrorists kill this guy , things like that ?
What do you make of that stuff ?
Where does it come from ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Well , it means a couple things .
Number one , she ‘s smart enough to know better .
She knows exactly what she ‘s doing .
She ‘s not alone .
I mean , if you look at what she ‘s doing and you look at what ‘s happened in the past , for example , the Swift Boating of Senator Kerry , I mean , I think a lot of this is very coordinated , very calculated .
They intend to create a result .
And what they hope is that we wo n‘t say anything , we‘ll just let them continue this hateful dialogue .
And we‘ll try and hope that the country will hear us talk about important things , issues that affect the lives of Americans every single day .
But we have to fight back , Chris .
We have to be strong .
We have to speak up .
That ‘s what Elizabeth did yesterday , and I ‘m proud of her for it .
MATTHEWS : Elizabeth had one — I think Elizabeth may have made one strategic error last night .
That ‘s assuming that she could get Ann Coulter to express shame .
JOHN EDWARDS : Yes , I do n‘t think she has any shame .
There ‘s no doubt about that .
And her response to any effort to raise the dialogue , to talk about things that people care about , is to attack in a mean , hateful , mean - spirited way .
I think that ‘s just the way she behaves .
That ‘s who she is .
And I think that ‘s a lot of what we see from these people who are just — that are crazy .
I mean ...
MATTHEWS : Yes .
JOHN EDWARDS : ... there ‘s nothing remotely mainstream about them .
And normal people are repelled by them .
MATTHEWS : Well , how do you explain the fact that you see people with good educations walking around the streets of New York and Wall Street , people with big business jobs in equity firms — hedge fund people — all buying books by Ann Coulter ?
How do you explain the fact that even last night ‘s fight involving your wife , Elizabeth , and Ann Coulter probably helped her sell some more books to these kind of guys ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Because I think there is a segment of the population that responds to this sort of hateful craziness .
It ‘s always been true , Chris .
It ‘s been true my whole lifetime .
When I was young , growing up in the South , people were very responsive to name - calling of African - Americans , prejudice and discrimination against African - Americans .
And people would say the most outrageous , demeaning things about good human beings .
And there would be a response .
And so there ‘s always been hateful language , hate - mongering in this country .
It ‘s been true for as long as I ‘ve been alive and it ‘s still true today .
But that does n‘t mean we have to tolerate it .
We have to speak out about it .
We have to stand up .
MATTHEWS : Can you dismiss this as hate speech and negativity and debasing of the political process and at the same time have your campaign use the comments made by Ann Coulter to raise money ?
It ‘s clearly part of your Web site e-mail campaign solicitation effort now .
Two e-mails have gone out now to raise money off of Ann Coulter ‘s attacks on you and your family .
Do you think you can do both , attack her and exploit her ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Here ‘s what I think .
I think that we can say to America that we ‘re not going to tolerate this kind of behavior , we ‘re not going to tolerate this kind of hate language and we ‘re going to stand up and we ‘re going to fight .
And if we ask Americans , other good Americans to join us in standing up and being strong , there ‘s nothing wrong with that .
And that ‘s exactly what we ‘re asking them to do .
And I hope there ‘ll be lots of people who will join us in standing up and doing the right thing .
MATTHEWS : Have you raised a great deal of money ?
There was a report today that you ‘ve had your best , most successful e-mail hitting back at Ann Coulter that you ‘ve had so far .
JOHN EDWARDS : We are raising money .
I do n‘t know the numbers .
I hope they go up .
I hope we get more and more people who join us in this cause because this is important .
MATTHEWS : Do you think people should buy Ann Coulter ‘s books ?
JOHN EDWARDS : No .
MATTHEWS : OK .
We ‘ll be right back .
That ‘s a good answer .
John Edwards .
We ‘ll be right back with John Edwards , who ‘s coming on tonight to follow up on that incident here last night involving Ann Coulter and her very strong words , many people believe over the line , against the Edwards family .
We ‘ll be right back with John Edwards .
Snow says ' people ought to learn ' from Fox News Ron Brynaert
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This According to former White House spokesman Tony Snow , critics of Fox News would be better off " learning " from the controversial 24 - hour news network than sniping at it .
The former Fox pundit 's comments came during a conversation with People Magazine 's managing editor Larry Hacket at the American Magazine Conference in Boca Raton , Florida on Sunday , as related by Conde Nast blogger Jeff Bercovici .
" There 's perceived bias on the part of Fox because they do n't treat conservatives as knuckle - dragging morons ....
I think the rap on Fox having a bias is an unfair one , " Snow reportedly said .
" My sense is rather than grousing with a winning formula , people ought to learn from them . "
Think Progress takes
Snow to task for claiming that his former boss , President George W. Bush , is " not the type to dis the press , " by reprinting an old picture of Bush holding a copy of " Bernard Goldbergs anti-media screed Bias , which Bill Press said at the time was " a message to the media . "
According to Media Bistro , Snow " remained remarkably on - message " during the interview .
The site reports , " A magazine vet who currently heads up corporate communications at a major media conglomerate marveled to us after the interview , ' I was fascinated by all the questions to which [ Snow ] said , ' I do n't know . '
In communications , you 're supposed to have the answer for everything . '
To us , Snow 's question marks made him seem uninformed like a fox . "
Further excerpts from Bercovici's column : #
On the effects of the 24 - hour - news cycle on journalism : " There are structural problems right now that make it very difficult to cover the White House the way it should be covered .... People are trying to keep up with the electronic media .
So what happens is you end up thinking , what can I do quickly and what can I do that people are going to watch ?
.... If you 're doing it in real time , you can get real stupid . "
On David Sanger of The New York Times : " I call him ' Secretary of State Sanger ' because he 's got a certain confidence in his views . " # Full article at Portfolio.com 's Mixed Media .
Further excerpts from Media Bistro column : #
On the media 's political leanings : " The Washington press corps is the most reliable Democratic voting bloc . "
Hackett : " Is the Democratic race over ? " Snow [ immediately ] : " Yes . "
Hackett : " Why ? " Snow : " Because it is . "
Audience Q : How much did you interact w/ vice president Dick Cheney ?
Snow : [ In meetings , Cheney ] " does n't speak up unless it 's vital to do so . "
On how Snow thinks his replacement Dana Perino handled communicating to the press exactly when former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez gave notice : " I have not spent a lot of time watching press briefings since I left . "

This is the moment when the growing tension between Britain and Russia became almost tangible .
Bombers approached British airspace at the weekend - and defence chiefs scrambled supersonic Eurofighter Typhoon jets to counteract the potential threat .
The close encounter follows an announcement from Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president , that bombers should resume the tactics of the Cold War , when incursions by long - range Soviet bombers
testing UK air defences were a familiar routine .
Scroll down for more ...
Yesterday , the Ministry of Defence released the picture of a Typhoon intercepting the Russian Bear - H bomber as proof of the Russian spy flights .
It is the first time the Typhoon , Britain 's most advanced warplane , has been seen in action against a potentially hostile target .
The MoD would not specify the number of bombers , although there were thought to be more than one .
Scroll down for more ...
The Russian planes had been detected approaching British airspace on Friday across the North Atlantic , at high altitude .
Unlike commercial airliners , they filed no flight plan in advance .
And as ground controllers grew increasingly concerned about their intentions , two Tornado fighters took off from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire , armed with air - to - air missiles .
But the Russians refused to leave the area and the Tornadoes , running short on fuel , were replaced by a second pair .
Then two of the Typhoons , from XI Squadron at RAF Coningsby , Lincolnshire , were sent up .
Eventually , the Russian aircrew turned for home - without crossing the line into UK air space .
Scroll down for more ...
One RAF insider said : " It seems to be largely political - almost a statement of pride by the Russians , or Putin telling us not to take him for granted .
" It 's an old , old game which we played for years during the Cold War and now we 're playing it .
You can glean a certain amount of information about our defences this way , particularly if some helpful Russian chap stands outside the wire at Leeming or Coningsby and notes what time our aircraft take off .
" Quite how all this really helps the Russians is another matter , but we take it seriously . "
The first known incident of this type in recent years was in May , when Russian spy planes flew from their base at Murmansk to watch a Nato naval exercise off the Scottish coast .
Scroll down for more ...
Typhoons recently took over the role of providing Quick Reaction aircraft for the southern half of the UK - including reacting to hijacked airliners trying to mount suicide attacks against British cities .
Jets and pilots are at constant readiness to take off .
Moscow chose the anniversary of " Prague Spring " to warn Czech leaders not to allow the U.S. to deploy their missile defence shield on its soil .
Yuri Baluyevsky , Russia 's military chief , said yesterday that it would be a " big mistake " if Prague gives the Bush administration 's plan the go - ahead .
Scroll down for more ...
The date for what diplomats saw as a " warning " could not have been more symbolic for the Czech leadership and people .
Thirty - nine years ago , thousands of tanks from Warsaw Pact countries entered Prague to overthrow the progressive government of Alexander Dubcek , which Moscow believed posed a threat to the Communist axis .
The warning was seen as an indication of Mr Putin 's desire to return to the days of Soviet military might .
The Czech Republic is considering whether to accept a radar station which would form part of a
U.S. missile shield , which Moscow sees as a threat to its security .

Researchers have found that proteins may use a divide - and - conquer strategy to fold into their native states in mere microseconds .
The physical strategy , called “ zipping and assembly ” ( ZA ) , can increase the speed at which supercomputers predict protein folding structures , greatly increasing scientists ’ understanding of these building blocks of life .
The scientists , Banu Ozkan , Albert Wu , John Chodera , and Ken Dill from the University of California at San Francisco , have published their research in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Their results show that the ZA search strategy provides a physics - based model of protein folding that could lead to advances such as computer - based drug discovery and genetic engineering .
“ Our research has two significant points , I believe , ” Dill told PhysOrg.com .
“ First , it shows that all - atom physical force fields are pretty good ( but not perfect ) , and may be useful for protein structure prediction .
And second , it proves that zipping and assembly is a highly efficient conformational search method , and supports the view that ZA may be the physical mechanism of protein folding . ”
Proteins , which consist of an unstructured linear chain of amino acids , can fold into complex 3D structures within microseconds .
On the other hand , high - speed supercomputers might take tens of years to compute the correct structure due to the vast assortment of possible forms the protein could take .
When folded incorrectly , proteins can cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and mad cow disease .
How proteins fold so quickly is a mystery that researchers are approaching from many different angles , including , for example , physics - based force fields .
By assigning force fields to different parts of the protein , computers can track the movement of each individual part .
Using the ZA strategy , Ozkan , Wu , Chodera and Dill have sped up the rate at which computers using force fields can predict protein structures .
In the ZA model , the first step that proteins ( or computers ) take is breaking the amino acid chain into 8 - 12 fragments to search for a very small fraction of favorable folding points ( traditional methods usually search the entire chain ) .
“ The speed gain in our method comes from not exploring all possible folding routes , but instead from following only those routes that entail small conformational search steps , ” Dill explained .
“ This reduces the search problem , in principle , from one that grows exponentially with the chain length to one that , instead , grows only as the first or second power of the chain length .
While we have n't actually proven that quantitatively , it is clear that the method is much faster than brute force Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics . ”
For the fragments that contain stable hydrophobic contacts ( which cause the protein to fold ) , the protein / computer enforces these contacts and adds more residues to enlarge these points .
If new hydrophobic contacts are formed again , the process continues until no more contacts are found .
“ The protein does n't ‘ know ’ it has the right starting points at the early stages , ” Dill explained .
“ It explores many possible avenues .
But , we find that when the chain pieces have reached roughly the 16 - to - 24 - mer stage , then the differences in free energy begin to become compelling , and structures begin to emerge fairly clearly . ”
In some cases , this zipping procedure alone is enough for a protein to reach its native form .
For other cases , the ZA algorithm switches to the assembly procedure , combining two or more fragments to form additional structures until the native form is achieved .
The ZA method was tested on nine small proteins , eight of which closely matched the experimental results of samples in the Protein Data Bank .
The greatest sign that the ZA method is on the right track is its speed .
For example , using ZA , protein G could fold in about 1 CPU year on a 2.8 - Ghz Xeon Intel machine .
“ We do n't know exactly what the speed gain is , ” Dill said .
“ Our largest protein studied is a 112 - mer ( subsequent to the PNAS paper ) .
Currently the most extensive all - atom physical simulations on Folding@Home , with 100,000 processors , or IBM 's Blue Gene , built for this problem , are on smaller proteins , typically in the range of 20 - 40 amino acids long .
However , those simulations are also more directed at physical questions of folding , rather than at protein structure prediction , so it 's hard to make a direct comparison . ”

More than 100 big name firms have a Second Life presence
Take a trip to an inner-city market stall and there 's a good chance that you will be able to pick up a watch or a pair of sunglasses , being passed off as made by Rolex or Oakley .
The goods will invariably be cheap and , almost certainly , bootleg - or fake - versions of the real thing .
Now go on a shopping spree in the virtual world of Second Life - the 3D world populated by on - screen representations ( avatars ) of real life people , and you will see a similar phenomenon .
Here , the possessions do n't physically exist .
They are computer - generated adornments for your avatar , in the game .
But products like these are appearing - often without the permission of the brand owner .
Legal presence
The design of Second Life means that players , or rather residents , can make and sell goods in exchange for the world 's currency , the Linden Dollar , which has an exchange rate with the US dollar .
Currently $ 1 will buy about 240 Linden Dollars .
And commerce is booming , with transactions worth about $ 1.5 m in real money taking place every day .
Creating a virtual presence can be expensive
Firms are clamouring to get involved with more than 100 big brand names having a presence - from Coca - Cola and Microsoft to BMW and the fashion designer Jean - Paul Gautier - as well as thousands of smaller traders .
But when they do get on board , some are finding that their intellectual property ( IP ) - typically brands and content they own - are already there .
So perhaps it is inevitable that one of Second Life 's newest residents is a UK law firm .
Rip-offs
Inside the virtual world , visitors to the swish offices of Field Fisher Waterhouse see floor - to - ceiling glass windows , fish tanks built into the walls and can meet representatives of the firm .
In part , it sees its arrival as another means of promoting the company and attracting potential employees .
And by hosting a real - world , real - time conference in its virtual office , attendees from around the world can participate , all at little cost .
But , says partner David Naylor , it is also positioning itself to drum up some business - advising on legal matters which crop up in the virtual world .
" Second Life 's technology makes it as easy for users to create infringing contents and assets as it is to create original , non-infringing items . "
SECOND LIFE FACTS Registered users ; 8.7 m Active users : 1.7 m Amount spent a day : $ 1.5 m Source : Linden Labs
" Often the people buying it wo n't be able to tell it is a rip - off and probably do n't care .
But the sellers are cashing in on the goodwill that has been built up in the real world by these brands for their own gain .
" It 's a frontier - like environment and the economics of piracy - related activities are too compelling for some . "
While nothing is certain in the rapidly developing environment of the virtual world , Mr Naylor feels it is inevitable that the situation will come to a head at some stage .
" Given the increasing amounts at stake , the real question might not be whether we see IP infringement - related actions brought in connection with virtual world activities , but how will they play out , " he says .
Setting bad example
A Second Life resident himself , Mr Naylor 's avatar is called Solomon Cortes , a dapper chap , whose wardrobe includes a smart suit he bought in - world to customise his appearance .
There is little to stop an offender creating another avatar - or character - and start infringing again
David Naylor , Field Fisher Waterhouse
While his clothes have come from " official " outlets , not all people who should know better are so scrupulous .
" There are some companies , even quite high profile ones , which have created virtual replicas of real world buildings or deck out their Second Life offices with designs , artwork and virtual furniture which are blatantly infringing copyright , " he says .
" So when you consider that even they are doing it , it 's no wonder there 's a problem . "
Second Life has about 8.7 million users worldwide - though only about 1.7 million have accounts used in the past three months .
Many regularly spend a few Linden Dollars on things which boost their enjoyment of the environment from trips to a bar to buying a replica football kit .
Until recently , they could also indulge in a little gambling at a casino , though these were banned last month .
Users can also buy vehicles as a means of travelling around Second Life .
These include cars , sold by dealerships set up by real - life motor firms .
Other sellers flog unauthorised versions of the same cars .
David Naylor , aka Solomon Cortes , dresses to impress potential clients
Buying something branded without the authorisation of the company concerned not only means it misses out on revenue - but - Mr Naylor argues leaves them open to the risk of damaged reputation .
In the case of Mercedes , the firm has built a race track where users can test drive its latest models .
" They will have spent a lot of time and money on doing that , " Mr Naylor says .
" If someone comes along with a fake Mercedes car which does not work well or looks like an old version of a vehicle , or underperforms against Mercedes own virtual cars , then you can see why the company might be unhappy . "
Cinema sessions
As more businesses move in to the virtual environment , it is also becoming increasingly possible to buy real world goods from Second Life 's virtual stores .
Dell , for example , allows users to customise a PC within the virtual world and have the real thing delivered to their doorstep .
" That this is happening makes protecting your brand in - world even more important , " Mr Naylor argues .
Many firms already anxious about IP abuse in the virtual world are already facing the situation elsewhere on the internet .
While music and film companies battle against illegal downloading and the plethora of their copyrighted material on websites such as YouTube , Second Life is equally full of such content .
A visit to in - world cinemas will allow you to watch releases including the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film to The Simpsons movie , while the bars play hits from Rhianna to the Rolling Stones .
However despite what seem to be legitimate legal concerns - and the presence of lawyers such as Mr Naylor - it is not always clear what action , can be taken .
not least because avatars mean that real identities are kept secret
Companies are adding unusual features to their virtual offices
" Finding out who is behind illegal practices could be a drawn out process , potential requiring legal action forcing the identity of the perpetrators to be revealed , " Mr Naylor adds .
" And even if successful , there is little to stop an offender creating another avatar - or character - and start infringing again . "
Then there is the problem of establishing under which jurisdiction the offence is committed .
Is it in the country where the perpetrator is based ?
Or perhaps in San Francisco where the Linden Labs ' servers are located ?
Despite the difficulties , Mr Naylor feels that there will become a need for advice to be offered to those firms which choose to get involved in virtual worlds .
This could range from what rights you have over land in - world to the employment law implications of hiring another resident in your virtual business .
" There are definitely risks for firms which get involved in virtual worlds , but there also great opportunities too . "
South Carolina Inmate Hits Michael Vick With '$ 63,000,000,000 Billion Dollar ' Lawsuit Alleging Al Qaeda Ties

Embattled NFL quarterback Michael Vick , facing federal charges related to his alleged participation in dogfighting , has been hit with a " $ 63,000,000,000 billion dollar " lawsuit filed by a South Carolina inmate who alleges the Atlanta Falcons star stole his pit bulls and sold them on eBay to buy " missiles from Iran , " FOX News has learned .
Jonathan Lee Riches filed the handwritten complaint over " theft and abuse of my animals " on July 23 in the U.S. District Court in Richmond , Va .

Riches alleges that Vick stole two white mixed pit bull dogs from his home in Holiday , Fla. , and used them for dogfighting operations in Richmond , Va .
The complaint goes on to allege that Vick sold the dogs on eBay and “ used the proceeds to purchase missiles from the Iran government . ”
The complaint also alleges that Vick would need those missiles because he pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in February of this year .
“ Michael Vick has to stop physically hurting my feelings and dashing my hopes , ” Riches writes in the complaint .
Riches wants $ 63 billion dollars “ backed by gold and silver “ delivered to the front gates to the Williamsburg Federal Correctional facility in South Carolina .
Riches is an inmate at the facility serving out a wire fraud conviction .
FOXNews.com attempted to contact Vick , but neither he nor his spokesman could be reached for comment .
FOX News ' Ian McCaleb contributed to this report .
“ They had to put [ the new DVD ] out because they ’ve been selling out of the other one and so Universal ’s like ‘ So , let ’s do another one ’ .
And now … there ’s now a chance there ’s going to be another movie . ”
was a massive flop in theaters , but could big DVD sales for the box office bombed film be enough to resurrect the franchise ?
Alan Tudyk thinks so and he ’s excited about it , even if his character is dead .
According to the guys over at Moviehole , Tudyk told them that a sequel could be happening .
Alan says , That ’s great news if you ’re a Browncoat or , like me , a sensible person who simply loves a great science fiction movie .
What ’s more , the way Tudyk talks it sounds like the entire cast would be more than willing to come back .
That includes Nathan Fillion , the crew ’s intrepid Captain Tightpants .
Except the question is n’t so much about whether the cast will be back , but where we ’ll be watching them .
With the film ’s box office numbers as bad as they were , it might make sense for the studio to push a sequel out the door as a direct - to - DVD sequel .
If you ’re a fan ofyou ’ll probably be happy to have the crew back in just about any form , I just hope if it comes to that it does n’t end up a low budget feature that sacrificed quality in the name of saving a buck .
Come on , that ’s usually what happens with these things .
On the other hand , started out as a TV series called .
If franchise creator Joss Whedon can make it work inside a TV budget , he should have no problem doing it on a direct - to - DVD one .
Meanwhile , those of you starved for more from the Serenity ’s crew can catch Alan Tudyk hitting Luke Wilson with a shovel in .
He ’s also in the hilarious comedy .
It ’s starting to look like Tudyk , not leading man Nathan Fillion will be Serenity ’s breakout star .
Kleiman :
I understand Mukasey is supposed to be a reasonably good guy , by comparison with the run of Bush appointees .
But if Mukasey wo n't say that waterboarding is torture and claims that the President has some undefined power to violate statute law even criminal laws , such as the ban on torture and other war crimes under his " Article II powers , " then why should the Senate Judiciary Committee even bring his nomination to a vote ?
If he says he has n't read the latest torture memos or decided whether waterboarding is torture , Sen .
Leahy ought to tell him to read the memos and observe a waterboarding session and come back when he 's done his homework .
Matt calls him " completely unacceptable . "
Having read the testimony , I 'm afraid I have to abandon my early hopes and agree .
An attorney general who believes a president has a permanent right to ignore the rule of law because peacetime is now wartime for ever , is an attorney - general defending the rule of one man over the rule of law .
If I were a Senator , ( heh , indeed ) I 'd vote no .
This is the faultline of our time .
If we are redefining war as a permanent state of being , and redefining presidential authority to give him / her extra-legal and extra-constitutional power to what s/he wants anywhere in the world , including the United States and to its citizenry , then American liberty is in extreme peril .
To approve an attorney general who does not dissent from this position is a terrible precedent .
Do n't people see that this is what Cheney is doing ?
He is setting precedent after precedent for totalist , secret executive power .
And with each precedent for unchecked , uncontrollable executive power - including the power to detain and torture within the United States - the America we have known is being surrendered .
This is the other war - a constitutional war at home against American liberty and the Constitution - as dangerous in a different way as Islamism .
One attacks our freedom from the outside ; the other hollows out our freedom from within .
The fight against both is the calling of the time .
I think we 're in denial about this .
Following Mukasey 's statements with confirmation would set a precedent we may well deeply regret .
Think of another terrorist attack .
Think of the Cheney precedents .
Think of Giuliani in the White House .
Now think of what would be left of democracy and the Constitution the day after .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
A declassified version of a new National Intelligence Estimate regarding the threat to the U.S. by terrorism was made public today , concluding that radical Islamic fundamentalist plotters are still out there and some jackasses inside the country could get radicalized enough to launch small scale attacks .
An advanced class of 7th graders with access to the internet could have collectively written a more incisive report relying simply on open source documents .
Danger Room ’s Noah knows it and ABC ’s Brian Ross sees the same thing .
In fact , what ’s most notable about the report outside of its inanity , is that one single word is repeated continually through the report .
That word is " Homeland . "
Take for example , this sentence :
We assess that al - Qa’ida ’s Homeland plotting is likely to continue to focus on prominent political , economic , and infrastructure targets with the goal of producing mass casualties , visually dramatic destruction , significant economic aftershocks , and / or fear among the US population .
Overlook , if you will , the absolute banality of the observation that Al Qaeda wants to hit prominent targets in the United States with a devastating attack .
( It ’s about the equivalent of writing a news story that geeks with money like and buy gadgets . )
Instead , think about the use of the word " Homeland " to describe the United States .
The estimate repeats the term 11 times in its meager two pages of " key findings " .
That repetitions signals more than anything that this report is a document crafted for political purposes by an apparatus with a dangerous world view or at least by an apparatus headed by folks who hunger for a conflict .
People who write and think of their country as the Homeland with a capital H tend to think that they can redefine torture , ignore international treaties , fund disinformation efforts to keep morale high , launch wars based on hunches and emphasize the power of the executive branch because they consider themselves the good guys who are the only ones who know what ’s right for the country .
They only want to protect the Homeland , do n’t you see ?
The vocabulary is symptomatic of a rigid , nationalistic world view .
There is no such thing as a Homeland .
The United States is not Franco ’s Spain , the National Socialist Party ’s Germany , or Mussolini ’s Italy .
We do not face imminent destruction of our country or way of life .
Al Qaeda is not Nazi Germany .
They are a rabid , fundamentalist religious cult that wants to roll back the modern world for the comfortable certainty of a militant religion , and the movement woos converts by exploiting legitimate and fabricated grievances against Muslims around the world .
The group is fighting a rear - guard and ultimately doomed fight against the onslaught of modernity and its squadrons of lattes , fashion trends and cultural dislocations .
While Al Qaeda ’s rabid and utterly predictable response to modernity was falling out of favor with most Muslims and Muslim - dominated governments throughout the Nineties , it has been re-fueled by this Administration ’s historically ignorant , testosterone - and - ego - driven post 9/11 foreign policy .
Any fool can see this Administration ’s imperial ambitions repeat the mistakes of colonialism .
The National Intelligence Estimate , at least the unclassified version , does n’t come out and say it , but this Administration has been feeding the animals .
In fact , by using the vocabulary of Fascism , the Intelligence Community itself feeds the animals .
So please stop it already .
This is n’t the Homeland .
This is the United States of America .
Change the words and the policy will follow .
by
H.R. 811 , the e-voting bill originally introduced by Rep. Rush Holt , is reportedly up for a vote of the full House of Representatives tomorrow .
Passing the bill would be an important step in securing our elections .
I have supported H.R. 811 from the beginning , and I am still firmly behind it .
I hope it passes tomorrow .
H.R. 811 gets the big issues right , requiring a voter - verified paper ballot with post-election audits to verify that the electronic records are consistent with the paper ballots .
The bill is cautious where caution is warranted .
For example , it gives states and counties the flexibility to choose optical - scan or touch - screen systems ( or others ) , as long as there is a suitable voter - verified paper record .
Though some e-voting activists want to ban touch - screens altogether , I think that would be a mistake .
Touch screens , if done correctly – which no vendor has managed yet , I ’ll admit – do offer some advantages .
Federalism makes sense here : let localities make their own choices , as long as basic standards , such as the paper - trail and audit requirements , are met .
Down the road , we may be glad that we left room for better touch - screen systems to develop .
The current version of the bill allows inferior paper - trail systems , such as ones storing ballots on a continuous reel of relatively fragile thermal paper , to be used through 2010 , in places where they were already in use .
The full requirement of a durable , permanent , privacy - preserving paper record takes effect everywhere in 2012 , but starts immediately in places not already using a paper trail .
Though less than ideal , the grace period is the best reasonable choice under the circumstances .
A change of this magnitude takes time , so some kind of grace period is necessary .
We could argue over whether it should be two years or four years , but at this point the most important thing is to start the clock ticking , by passing a bill .
If your representative is on the fence , this is a good time to call and urge a vote for H.R. 811 .
[ UPDATE ( Sept. 6 ) : The schedule has slipped so the bill will not be up for vote today .
So there ’s still time to call your congressperson . ]
In 1980 , Congress passed the Bayh - Dole Act , which allowed universities to own intellectual property arising from federally financed research .
The result was an explosion of innovation .
The number of universities and colleges receiving patents more than doubled from 1983 to 2003 ; the number of patents awarded to schools grew by over 600 percent .
Today , royalties from patents and licenses bring in millions of dollars for many academic institutions .
And the universities ’ gains have redounded to the advantage of many regional economies , in the form of spin - off companies , jobs , and income growth .
To help move research discoveries into the marketplace , more than 200 universities have created offices of “ technology transfer . ”
Unfortunately , many of the offices have become ponderous bureaucracies .
Worse still , seeking to maximize profits for the schools , they have frequently contravened contractual agreements to assert ownership over research that a company has sponsored and expects to profit from .
Businesses seem to be taking notice .
Over the last 50 years , industry - funded basic research in universities generally had kept pace with all categories of R&D , even outstripping basic research performed in companies ’ own labs .
And in the mid-1990s , with the explosion of transdisciplinary fields such as biotechnology , corporations began funding basic research at universities at a blistering pace : such investment grew 45 percent from 1995 to 2000 , much faster than the growth of total R&D funding .
But in 2000 , industry abruptly reversed course .
From 2001 to 2004 , the most recent year for which data are available , corporate funding of basic research in American universities declined in each consecutive year — the longest period of contraction since data collection began .
The contraction ca n’t be explained by the economic slowdown of 2001 – 02 ; harsher periods of slow growth have seen industry - funded research at universities keep expanding .
The likeliest reason for this worrisome trend is that many companies are tired of haggling over intellectual property rights — and in a world of globalized R&D , they no longer have to .
IBM , Hewlett - Packard , Baker Hughes , Intel , Texas Instruments , and Microsoft , to name just a few major firms on a growing list , are now shifting research funding to universities in England , India , Russia , and China , where they have access to top scientists and often face fewer intellectual property hurdles .
A 2006 survey found that most global firms anticipated their R&D expansion to take place in China and India ; by the end of this year , 31 percent of R&D employees worldwide will work in one of those two countries , up from 19 percent in 2004 .
As one corporate official observes : “ Not only is the cost significantly less , there is no doubt that at the end of the day we own the intellectual product . ”
A study published last year in Science found that the location of multinational R&D turns more heavily on the ease of collaboration with university faculty than on cost .
And make no mistake : universities abroad are eager for partnerships with American firms .
In many fields , the technological edge appears to be shifting along with industry - supported research to foreign institutions such as the University of Beijing .
“ We went there for the cost , but we stay for the quality , ” says one American executive .
One striking example is the rise of Siberia ’s “ Silicon Forest , ” centered in Novosibirsk State University , where such firms as Intel , IBM , and Schlumberger have growing R&D investments .
While the U.S. remains the leader in R&D and university science , its position may be slowly eroding .
Universities do n’t bear full responsibility for this decline — other factors , such as restrictive immigration laws , have helped push research overseas — but their part in it is undeniable .
And as the quality of universities in emerging economies increases , they may encourage an even greater migration away from American campuses .
It may be unwise , therefore , for regions to rely on universities as primary engines of growth and innovation .
But local governments might pursue a strategy of urging universities to pool their commercialization efforts .
As Bob Litan , William Baumol , and I have suggested in our recent book Good Capitalism , Bad Capitalism , “ One of the reasons technology transfer offices fail to generate a profit for their universities . . . is that they can neither reach a size sufficient to realize economies of scale nor attract licensing and other personnel with expertise comparable to that available in the private sector . ”
If a region ’s universities — at the very least , its public universities — were to combine their resources into a single technology transfer office , they might solve both problems .
I ’ve commented in past posts that it is becoming an increasingly common practice for police officers to simply use form or template arrest reports in drunk driving cases — what I have referred to in my books as " xeroxed " reports .
( See Police Using Pre-Written DUI Reports . )
In other words , rather than going to all the " trouble " of writing a report of the actual investigation and arrest , cops are using pre-written reports — and then changing a few details to fit the defendant .
This is bad enough , as the reports are supposedly signed under oath and subject to perjury charges .
But it beecomes particularly serious when you realize that very few officers can remember the details of a given case when testifying months later .
In almost all cases , the officers read their own reports before taking the stand — and then testify essentially to what they read in the report .
And in DUI cases , they are increasingly testifying based upon a fictional " xeroxed " case .
For example , California attorney Jon W. Woolsey recently got a court order requiring the California Highway Patrol to turn over any templates or forms used by the officer who arrested his client for DUI .
The following is the template that was used :
FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS
All FST ’s were explained and demonstrated .
I asked Name if he / she understood each test completely and he / she stated that he did .
All tests were performed on a Location dirt / asphalt Parking lot / Shoulder that was free of debris .
The weather was cool , clear / cloudy , and daylight / dark .
1 ) Horizontal Gaze Nystagamus :
Name eyes showed lack of smooth pursuit , distinct nystagmus at the extremes and an onset prior to 45 degrees .
Name ’s eyes showed vertical gaze nystagmus .
2) One leg stand : Name lifted his / her right / left foot and dropped it immediately on the count of 1000 .
3 ) Romberg : Name estimated 30 seconds in 0000 seconds .
Name body swayed in a circular motion 1 to 2 inches from center of mass .
4 ) Finger Count : I explained the test to Name
5 ) Preliminary Alcohol Screening Device :
I admonished Name regarding the Preliminary Alcohol Screening Device ( PAS ) and he / she agreed / refused to take the test .
I administered the PAS to Name at 0000 and 0000 hours with BAC results of .000 % and .000 % .
Other Factual Information :
All times are approximate and may vary from the times on the Preliminary Alcohol Screening Device , the breath test and times provided to me by dispatch .
First Observations :
On 0-00 - 07 I was on routine patrol in a fully marked CHP patrol vehicle , with my partner officer nnn .
I was traveling
Observations After Stop : I contacted the driver and advised him / her the reason for the stop .
As I spoke with the driver I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his / her breath .
I noticed that the driver had red watery eyes , as well as slow and slurred speech .
I asked the driver for his / her driver ’s license , which he / she provided me .
I identified the driver using his / her California Driver ’s License as John Doe 00 - 00 - 00 .
I asked the driver if he / she had anything to drink and he stated , “ –. ” I asked the driver to exit his / her vehicle and meet me at the right front of my patrol vehicle .
I noticed that as the driver walked he had an unsteady gate .
As I spoke with the driver I noticed that he / she had an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his / her breath and person .
I also noticed that the driver was unsteady on his / her feet swaying in a circular motion 1 to 2 inches from center of mass , he / she had slow slurred speech , and red and watery eyes .
I advised the driver that I smelled a strong odor of alcohol emitting from his / her breath and asked him / her how much he / she had to drink and he / she stated , “ — -. ” I explained and demonstrated several FST ’s to Name , which he / she could not complete as explained and demonstrated .
Arrest : Based on my observations of Name ’s driving , Name ’s objective signs of alcohol intoxication , and his / her performance on the FST ’s , I formed the opinion that Name was driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and unable to safely operate a motor vehicle .
I placed Name under arrest for 23152 ( a ) CVC at 0000 hours .
I advised Name of implied consent and he / she chose the blood / breath test .
I booked Name into the Sonoma County Jail .
Recommendations :
I recommend a copy of this report be forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney ’s for review , and that Name be prosecuted for violation of 23152 ( a ) CVC driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage , and _____
Basically , the report tells the officer what he should have seen — not what he actually saw .
And as any honest cop will tell you , drunk driving cases rarely follow such a neat , pre-described script .
But it is convenient .
And avoids messy complications – like the actual facts .
One size fits all .
Software developers are n't typically known for their superior levels of physical fitness .
I 'm not overweight , exactly , but I do n't think I 'll be pursuing that dream career in male modelling anytime soon .
I charitably call myself an indoor enthusiast .
At the risk of generalizing -- yes , I know you happen to be the exceptionally fit software engineer that proves the rule -- being tethered to the machines we love so much often leads to a sedentary lifestyle for programmers , and a high occupational correlation with obesity .
But it does n't have to be that way .
If we can whip computer software and hardware into shape , we should be amply equipped to whip the body 's software and hardware into shape , too .
Consider the advice of John Walker :
I 'm an engineer by training , a computer programmer by avocation , and an businessman through lack of alternatives .
From grade school in the 1950's until 1988 I was fat -- anywhere from 30 to 80 pounds overweight .
This is a diet book by somebody who spent most of his life fat .
The absurdity of my situation finally struck home in 1987 .
" Look , " I said to myself , " you founded one of the five biggest software companies in the world , Autodesk .
You wrote large pieces of AutoCAD , the world standard for computer aided design .
You 've made in excess of fifty million dollars without dropping dead , going crazy , or winding up in jail .
You 've succeeded at some pretty difficult things , and you can't control your flippin ' weight ? ''
Through all the years of struggling with my weight , the fad diets , the tedious and depressing history most fat people share , I had never , even once , approached controlling my weight the way I 'd work on any other problem : a malfunctioning circuit , a buggy program , an ineffective department in my company .
John compiled his advice into something he calls The Hacker 's Diet .
According to John , all we need is :
An eye firmly fixed on the goal .
Will power .
A high tolerance for pain .
In other words , we are so totally screwed .
Jeremy Zawodny used the Hacker 's Diet as a template , and came up with this kinder , gentler set of diet advice that 's a bit less intimidating :
If you 're seriously thinking about trying to lose weight , give this a shot .
It 's one of the easiest non-fad and non -gimmick plans you 'll run across , mostly because the " plan " is very simple and tangible .
It 's not quite " the simplest thing that could possibly work " but it sure comes close :
Small changes have a major impact on weight loss because they 're compounded over time .
It 's just like saving for retirement .
The sooner you start doing just a little bit every day , the better off you 'll be .
Anyone can do this .
Anyone .
The process is self - reinforcing once you start to see real results .
That means you need to commit to a month - - a very difficult month .
After that first month , though , it 's easy .
And the more weight you have to lose , the easier it is .
During that first month , you 'll be developing three new habits .
Only one of them is likely to conflict with an existing habit .
The other two will consume maybe 5 minutes of your daily routine .
Like any proper geek diet program , Jeremy 's is powered by a spreadsheet .
In the end , it 's basic math -- calories in minus calories out .
Since programmers are legendarily obsessive , tracking everything we eat is a natural fit for us .
But reducing calorie intake through diet is only half of the equation .
The other half is increasing calorie burn by exercising , or at least staying moderately physically active .
A contributor to OmniNerd wore a heart rate monitor and measured exactly how many calories he burned during typical daily activities :
100 calories burned per hour sitting in a chair " working "
5 calories burned riding an elevator up twenty - seven flights
100 calories burned per hour watching TV or surfing the Internet at home
750 calories burned for eight hours of sleeping
220 calories burned in twenty minutes walking 11/4 miles downhill to my bus ( +50 calories burned " cooling " )
60 calories burned walking one New York City block ( west- east ) ( +10 calories " cooling " )
25 calories burned walking up five flights of stairs ( +35 calories burned " cooling " )
315 calories burned walking 11/4 miles uphill from my bus ( +75 calories burned " cooling " )
150 calories burned walking a dog for twenty minutes ( Note : It was a slow walk , the dog is very old . )
660 calories burned in forty minutes of weightlifting
900 + calories burned in fifty minutes on an elliptical trainer
It 's a reasonable set of advice : eat less , exercise more .
We may do it more analytically than the average joe , but it 's nothing you have n't heard a dozen times before .
The problem is getting off our collective butts to do it .
It 's difficult to get motivated , particularly when exercise almost by definition draws you away from your obsession .
But what if we could combine our computing obsession with exercise ?
Now we 're talking .
The geek - a- cycle may look vaguely ridiculous .
Still , I 've often wondered if there was some way to combine all that time I spend sifting through content on the internet with some kind of physical exercise , instead of passively sitting in a chair .
It 's an interesting concept .
Greg used a similar recumbent trainer arrangement to lose weight while playing the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft .
Greg calls this " Warbiking " .
It 's a clever symbiosis of carrot and stick that really worked for him .
One of the bad parts of Warcraft is it can really suck you in - I tend to lose track of time and get pretty unaware of anything but the game .
It 's addictive as hell !
One of the bad parts of doing Cardio is that it is very boring , so I tend to be very aware of how much I 'm not enjoying it and how slow time seems to get .
And I hate doing it !
Warbiking is the best of both worlds .
I get to do 2 + hours of cardio without being aware that I 'm really doing it .
And as I can only play Warcraft while doing cardio ( that 's a self imposed rule - no cardio , no Warcraft ) , it 's self regulating .
No way am I going to play for 6 hours ; my legs would n't do it .
I did hit 4.5 hours one insane Sunday afternoon , but I wo n't be doing that again any time soon .
If you 're more of a console gamer , there 's the Gamercize .
You insert the device between your controller and your console .
The device monitors your physical activity , and will disconnect your controller if you fail to sustain a certain minimum level of physical activity .
The gamercize is appealing because it 's universal .
It works with any game , but it 's not exactly interactive .
Perhaps the best example of a game that integrates physical activity with actual gameplay is Dance Dance Revolution .
DDR is one of the few games my wife enjoys playing with me .
It 's available on every platform under the sun , and even has a free open source PC equivalent in StepMania .
The songs have a wide selection of skill levels , from ultra - klutz to ninja .
If you can get past the natural aversion most people have to making themselves look ridiculous while doing something approximating dancing , it 's really quite entertaining .
And it 's definitely a workout .
You might argue that none of this is really necessary .
Would n't it be easier to drop all the diet spreadsheets and electric exercise contraptions and cultivate a traditional physical activity as a hobby ?
Say , something like soccer , or tennis , or cycling ?
Sure .
It would be easier -- if do n't you mind losing all your geek street cred in the process .

The woman who took a picture in Morocco of a small girl with striking similarities to Madeleine McCann said today : ' It sent shivers down my spine '
Interpol detectives were today scrutinising the photograph of the child , who can be seen in the clutches of a group of Moroccans .
The grainy image , taken only four weeks ago , shows a blonde youngster being carried on the back of a dark - skinned woman in traditional North African dress with companions carrying their worldly possessions along a dusty roadside near Tangiers .
Scroll down for more
It is the fourth reported sighting of the missing four - year - old in Morocco , the first two having come only six days after she disappeared .
Her anguished parents insisted they would not raise their hopes until forensic analysis had strengthened or ruled out suspicions that it could be her .
The existence of the picture was revealed on a Spanish radio station by the woman who took it near the northern town of Zinat , just south of Tangiers , on August 31 .
Spaniard Clara Torres and her partner spotted the likeness after taking what they thought would simply be a colourful shot of Moroccan life .
They were immediately suspicious that a blonde , pale - skinned , European - looking child should be with the group of wanderers .
When they heard about other sightings in Morocco they emailed it to the Spanish national police , who forwarded it to Interpol .

It will be analysed by experts , possibly from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre who have used state - of - the - art facial recognition computer software to study thousands of pictures sent in by holidaymakers who were in Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished on May 3 .
Mrs Torres told the Spanish radio station COPE : " As soon as I took the photo we were struck by the little girl , who was very blonde .
" The truth is we said the name of the girl , but we could n't believe it could be her , it was just impossible that it was her . "
She added that it was not until the couple arrived back in Spain and examined the picture that they realised it could have been Madeleine .
" It sent shivers down my spine .
Either it 's her or she 's got a twin , " she said .

She explained how the photo was taken : " I was with my family and my partner , we were going from Chaouen to Tetuan .
On the road , in a town called Zinat , I was taking photos of everything we saw , and we saw a group of people and took a photo .
" As soon as I took the photo we were struck by the little girl , who was very blonde .
I was on a trip in Morocco and took many pictures , just random ones .
This was one of those pictures .
I remember being struck by her and even mentioned the name Madeleine to my boyfriend .
" But I did n't think too much of it at the time because although it is uncommon it is not unusual to get blonde people in that part of the world .
Also , I did n't think Madeleine could be in Morocco .
" It was only when I got home and saw the news on Monday about two possible sightings of Madeleine in Morocco that I remembered the picture and went through my photos .
When I saw it for the second time and focused in on the child 's face , I realised it could be her .
Mrs Torres said they called their local police in Albacete , near Valencia , who came and took copies .
She said she went to the British embassy yesterday and spoke to the McCann family 's legal team .
She said : " The police told us they would take 10 to 15 days to get the results back from the photos so I took it to the British Embassy in Madrid yesterday to hurry things along .
I felt it was too important to wait around . "
The first reported sighting in Morocco was by Norwegian tourist Mari Pollard , who said she saw a girl who looked like Madeleine with a man at petrol station in Marrakesh on May 9 .
A British holidaymaker later reported seeing a youngster with a strong likeness on the same day outside the Ibis Hotel in Marrakesh , which is virtually opposite the garage .
The third sighting came around three weeks later when a Spanish woman contacted Portuguese police to say she had seen someone she thought looked like the missing girl in Zaio , in the north of Morocco .
She said she saw a " sad and scared " blonde girl being dragged across a street by a woman in a Muslim headscarf .
She told how she and her husband were driving when the Muslim woman walked out into the road in front of them , " walking very fast and dragging a young blonde girl with her " .

" I saw her face very clearly from close up and I know it was Madeleine , " she said .
" She looked very sad and scared , and was wearinga skirt and a sleeveless top and her blonde hair tied up . "
The woman , who refuses to be named , called police from her home in Melilla that night .
Detectives are said to have dismissed the sighting saying they believed she was already dead .
Kate and Gerry McCann believe Portuguese police have virtually given up the hunt to find their daughter .
The couple have brought in private investigators to search for any trace of her .
But senior police and judicial figures have now warned that the McCanns and their team of ex-SAS advisers could face prosecution if they interfere .
In Portugal private detectives are banned from working on criminal investigations by obstruction of justice laws .
A Policia Judiciaria official said : " If they come here they will be running a serious risk of being arrested . "
Carlos Anjos , head of the Portuguese police federation , said the investigators were part of " another McCann strategy " to divert attention away from themselves .
" This can only be another diversion tactic from the McCanns . "
Possible sightings have come in from all over the world in the months since Madeleine vanished , including Belgium , Malta and Australia .
The McCanns , both 39 , travelled to Morocco in June to appeal for help in the hunt to find Madeleine .
Mrs McCann has told friends she believes there is a strong chance her daughter could have been taken into Africa , which is easily reached from Portugal and Spain .
Mr McCann 's brother John said of the latest Moroccan sighting : " We hope the Portuguese police will investigate this and that it will prove more profitable than their current line of inquiry . "
Jose Herrero Arcas , the Spanish government 's representative in Albacete , said : " The national police received a photograph by email taken by a young Spanish couple who believe it shows Madeleine McCann .
" The quality of the photograph is not very clear , and it was taken from around 200 metres away .
" However , the national police are taking the claim seriously enough to have sent it on to their colleagues at Interpol . "
• Friends of the McCanns faced fresh allegations yesterday after it was claimed that sniffer dogs had found the ' scent of death ' on one of them .
The same police dog which reacted to Mrs McCann 's clothes - first causing suspicion to fall on her - was alleged to have smelled ' death ' on one of the friends who had dinner with the couple the night Madeleine vanished .
Police sources briefed a Portuguese newspaper that two police dogs from South Yorkshire , trained to detect corpses , human remains and microscopic traces of blood , had reacted to some items of clothing .
Family spokesman Clarence Mitchell denied categorically that any such procedure had happened .
Detectives are writing to British police asking them to re-interview the seven friends .
The newspaper did not reveal which of the friends ' clothing was meant to have triggered the reaction .
Police in South Yorkshire refused to comment .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Ancient bacteria are able to survive nearly half a million years in harsh , frozen conditions , researchers said on Monday in a study that adds to arguments that permafrost environments on Mars could harbor life .

The findings also represent the oldest independently authenticated DNA to date obtained from living cells and could offer clues to better understand ageing , said Eske Willerslev , a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who led the study .
“ When it can live half a million years on Earth it makes it very promising it could survive on Mars for a very long time , ” Willerslev said .
“ Permafrost would be an excellent place to look for life on Mars . ”
The international team , which also included researchers from the United States , Canada , Russia and Sweden , tested the microbes living up to 10 meters deep in permafrost collected from Northern Canada , the Yukon , Siberia and Antarctica .
When a cell dies , its DNA fragments into pieces but the samples the researchers studied were all very long strands -- evidence the cells were able to continuously repair genetic material and remain alive , said Willerslev , whose findings were published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences .
“ These cells are active cells repairing DNA to deal with continuous degradation of the genomes , which is the genetic material that is key to life , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ It is the same thing with humans . ”
The scientists do not yet know the mechanism driving the continuous repair but Willerslev said the cells survived by eating nutrients like nitrogen and phosphate lodged in the permafrost .
This is interesting because the temperature on Mars is much colder with more stable temperatures , representing an even better environment to sustain this kind of life , he added .
While most scientists think our neighbor in the solar system is lifeless , the discovery of microbes on Earth that can exist in environments previously thought too hostile has fuelled debate over extraterrestrial life .
Researchers had known these microbes could survive for a long time without food but until now there was little agreement on how long they could live , Willerslev said .
Knowing this , and eventually pinpointing the key to this longevity , may also help scientists better understand the ageing process , he added .
“ It is interesting to see why some cells can survive for a very long time , ” he said .
“ That can be a key for understanding ageing . ”
I ’m just back from Providence , Rhode Island , and a stimulating two days co-hosting BIF - 3 , the third annual summit of the Business Innovation Factory .
Presenter after presenter , from all walks of life , told remarkable stories about reinventing a police department , rethinking national security , even redesigning the lowly nail , to make it more resistant to hurricanes .
If there was one theme that tied together the diverse presentations , it was simply this :
How hard ( bordering on impossible ) it is for companies to keep new products simple and to focus their innovations on simplifying existing products .
On this score , one of the stars of the gathering was Jason Fried , founder of a red - hot Web outfit called 37signals .
Fried ’s company , based in Chicago , has distinguished itself by making products that are shockingly easy to use , and that have avoided the “ bloatware ” and “ feature creep ” that infects so much of the software industry .
When my cohost , Wall Street Journal tech pundit Walt Mossberg , asked Jason how his company resists the seemingly irresistible lure of complexity , the young CEO had a simple answer : “ We are enemies of mediocrity .
And if you try to make everyone happy with your products , you end up with mediocrity .
Our company has opinions , and we build products based on those opinions .
We need more opinionated companies . ”
Well said .
I ’ve seen that same point of view expressed in so many of the maverick companies I ’ve gotten to know .
If you ’re going to do something original , something distinctive , something great , then almost by definition you ’re not going to be right for everyone .
The worst thing a CEO or the head of engineering can do is to overreact whenever a customer , even an important customer , demands a new feature or insists on a new service — especially if that new feature or service risks cluttering the simplicity of the offering .
In other words , one of the most important jobs of a leader or an entrepreneur is knowing when to say no —even to important constituencies .
The folks at Southwest Airlines , the great innovators in the sky , really get this point .
Back in September , Southwest announced that it was going to retain its controversial policy of not assigning specific seats to passengers .
Instead , it was going to make minor adjustments in its first - come , first - served policy to cut down on mad rushes at the gate .
The media coverage was enormous .
And what was interesting was how eager newspapers were to find passengers who hated Southwest ’s open - seating policy and were disappointed that the airline did n’t adopt a more conventional ( and complicated ) process .
But this negative reaction was n’t a sign of problems , as many of the articles suggested .
It was a sign of strength .
Great brands , by definition , are n’t designed to appeal to everyone .
Not all customers are created equal — and in the case of Southwest Airlines , customers who value more of the amenities , policies , and procedures of the legacy carriers are n’t ever going to be passionate about Southwest .
Customers who are passionate about Southwest do n’t just value the low fares that open seating supports , but have come to expect and enjoy the organized chaos that the experience involves .
One test of how committed a company is to keeping its offering distinctive and simple is how fearless it is about ignoring ( even offending ) vocal customers whose needs do n’t conform to the core mission .
Arkadi Kuhlmann , founder and CEO of ING Direct , the company that has almost single - handedly made Internet savings a mainstream sensation , has built the fastest - growing bank in the United States around that same attitude .
Everything about the ING Direct experience is absurdly simple .
The bank offers a few savings accounts , a handful of certificates of deposit , maybe 10 different mutual funds .
And that ’s it .
Credit cards ?
No way .
Online brokerage ( now that it has five million Internet - based customers ) ?
Perish the thought .
ING Direct even simplifies the kinds of customers with whom it does business .
The bank has no deposit minimums .
( You can literally open an account with one dollar . )
But it has unofficial deposit maximums .
You want to open an account with a million dollars ?
Please find another bank .
“ Rich Americans are used to platinum cards , special services , ” Kuhlmann told me .
“ The last thing we want in this bank is to have rich people making special demands .
We treat everybody the same , which is how we keep things simple . ”
That kind of attitude does n’t always make you popular — but it ’s the edgy attitude required to make you successful .
( Jason Fried of 37signals has also learned how to say no to potential investors .
In the eight years since his company ’s inception , he has declined more than 30 offers of venture capital . )
“ Your company has to have opinions that people care about , ” Fried told the audience at BIF - 3 .
“ Our company has those opinions .
That means some people love us , and some people hate us .
But very few people ignore us . ”
Is my argument too simple ?
Sure it is .
But hopefully that ’s what makes it interesting too .

Update - July 2007 : We 've launched a new film about why nuclear power can't stop climate change and how a combination of renewables , efficiency and combined heat and power can : watch The Convenient Solution .
Decentralised energy .
It can double the efficiency of our power stations .
It 's helped Woking Council cut its carbon emissions by 77 per cent .
It already provides over 50 per cent of Denmark 's electricity supplies .
But what is it ?
And why are n't we using it ?
What on earth are we waiting for ?
Let Clive Anderson explain ( it 's well worth the 18 minutes ) :
Download it : Broadband ( 60 mb ) | Dial - up ( 4.6 mb ) | Podcast ( 60 mb , MP4 )
If it strikes home , please help us spread the word ; the UK can slash its carbon emissions ( without the need for dangerous and costly nukes ) .
Digg this page , add it to del.icio.us , blog it , tell your MP ...

They say that your whole life flashes before your eyes when you ’re about to die , and I ’m here to tell you that it ’s true .
A few months ago , I fell off a thousand - plus - foot - high sheer granite face that had earned a 5.14d rating on the Yosemite Decimal System index — meaning that it is one of the most difficult climbs known to man .
Whether this classification is accurate or not I have no idea , as my fall happened when I was just going for a really long walk .
All I remember is wondering when the hiking trail I was on would start to feature a less strenuous , “ downhill ” grade .
I was still puzzling over this during my first .025 seconds of unhindered free fall .
You notice the oddest little things when you ’re nine hundred and fifty feet above the ground , having just stepped off the business side of a man-killing mountain .
Things like :
— Lichen .
— The almost laughable ineffectiveness of “ wind resistance ” in the real world , despite its being such a bugaboo for designers of cars and gay - looking competitive bicycle clothes .
— “ Does that ant realize he ’s eight hundred and fifty feet off the ground , or does he think that he’s on the ground and he ’s wondering why I ’m falling sideways ? ”
Halfway through that last thought , I was jolted out of my ruminations by a tree branch slapping me in the face .
Which , honestly , I could have done without .
Very shortly thereafter , I remember falling past an actual mountain climber — his belt heavy with pitons or spitons or whatever they ’re called — who watched me pass and exclaimed , “ What the f --- ? ”
At this point , I realized that I was about to die , and that ’s when my whole life flashed before my eyes .
It seemed to go chronologically , but super - sped up .
I saw my first dog , Steven , when he was just a puppy .
He was also falling through the air at a hundred and thirty - five miles per hour next to me , which seemed an unnecessarily cruel trick of the mind , considering that Steven had died a peaceful death of barking - induced throat cancer back around the time that my stepdad got wrongfully arrested for dog-kicking .
Then I saw my first girlfriend , and then my first girlfriend ’s mother ( who was even hotter than the girlfriend ) .
Then my first car .
This was odd , considering that I ’ve never actually owned a car — but I did distinctly see an ’89 Toyota Corolla , which , now that I think about it , must have been my first rental , that weekend when I flew to Phoenix for a college friend ’s ill - advised wedding .
Between five hundred and four hundred and fifty feet above the ground , I saw the entirety of the movie “ Arthur 2 : On the Rocks , ” and had time to note , wistfully , that it was much funnier than I had remembered .
Around four hundred feet or so , I was struck by another metaphysical conundrum :
What kind of person climbs four hundred feet up a sheer granite face just to write “ You suck !
Bababooey ! ” on an otherwise pristine boulder ?
In the next .00075 seconds of free fall , I saw the rest of my life flash before my eyes .
Everything up to and including the moment when I thought , Hey , if I turn around and retrace my steps right now it ’ll all be downhill from here , and I can — oops !
What the —
At this point , I realized that it was time to calm what they call the “ monkey mind , ” a concept I read about once in an in - flight - magazine article about meditation , and how it can help prevent the “ non-useful ” feelings that lead to incidents of air rage .
I needed to make something positive of this experience .
For instance , I could think up advice for the living from one who is about to die and is watching his life flash before his eyes .
Here ’s what I came up with :
There are lots of boring parts in even the most interesting life .
So get in the habit of sleeping with the TV on , so that eventually — when you have to watch your whole life flash before your eyes — you ’ll have something to look at during those long , dull hours when you ’re doing nothing but lying in bed asleep .
Encourage every person who shares your bed to sleep nude , on top of the covers .
You ’ll never get tired of looking at your exes in the nude .
Trust me .
Do n’t go to see bad movies that you know are going to be bad just to laugh at them .
They ’re never as funny the second time around , when you ’re falling through the air and your friends are n’t around to laugh along with you .
Give a thought to switching up your bathroom technique every now and then .
When everything is sped up enough , life can start to seem like one long toilet - sit , periodically interrupted by tentative journeys out of the bathroom , which inevitably end in a return to the bathroom .
Around this point — a hundred feet above the ground — I realized that my death was imminent .
I tried to rerun my favorite parts of my life one last time , but all that flashed before my eyes was everything that had happened during my last nine hundred feet of free - falling .
Imagine my surprise when my fall was broken by a band of nature enthusiasts , who were gathered around a patch of lichen , fighting over who ’d get to look at it next through the magnifying glass .
I ca n’t even begin to imagine how fast each of their lives must have flashed before their eyes .
( Except for the one who survived for a while and was medevaced to a treatment facility , where he expired ; he had a good two hours to linger over everything that had flashed before his eyes . )
As for me , I did n’t come out of this experience unscathed .
I am in one of those full - body casts which you usually see only in comedies that involve skiing , and I ’m writing this with my tongue — which probably explains why my prose has been so erotically charged .
I apologize for that .
A near - death experience makes you realize just how short life is .
As soon as I can get hold of a remote control that does n’t taste like other people ’s hands , the first thing I ’m going to do is reprogram my TiVo ’s Season Pass and WishList settings , to make sure that I do n’t waste another precious moment watching a Discovery Channel special about people building a megabridge in Singapore or whatever . ♦

At issue : Clinton 's vote in support of a recent Senate amendment .
And this time Edwards ' criticism stirred some clear anti-Clinton sentiment .
The amendment –sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , I - Connecticut , and Jon Kyl , R- Arizona–calls for labeling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
The former North Carolina senator first commended senators Joe Biden , D - Delaware , and Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut , for voting against it , but he then added , " Sen. Clinton voted ' yes . ' "
That statement was followed by an immediate round of booing .
Edwards claims the amendment would " pave the way for Bush to continue to march forward on Iran . "
" I did n't understand it , " Edwards said .
" And then I saw a story in the New York Times [ that ] quoted some of her supporters explaining why she did it , and the explanation was –I want to get this right –that she was moving from primary mode to general election mode . "
A New York Times article from October 14 claimed Clinton 's backers have said privately that she is now switching to general election mode , which would imply she 's running as the presumptive nominee .
That prompted one supporter to shout , " Like hell ! "
It seems like people in Iowa , like the people I saw this weekend at the War protest , are not comfortable with someone who is going to vote for more war .
And whether it was Senator Clinton 's intention to embolden Bush to push for more aggressive actions towards Iran or not , DOES NOT MATTER .
What matters is that she is voting with the neo cons for pro war bills when she should be joining Dodd on the FISA fillibuster , or HOW ABOUT INTRODUCING BILLS TO END THE WAR ?
It does n't matter if they will get the 60 votes or not , it will at least get the focus off of Bills to censure Pete Stark and Move On and away from Bills like Lieberman Kyl .
At a political meeting , this week I had a former Republican who still in touch with his old friends tell me that one of his associates had been approached about BEING SELECTED FOR THE NEW DRAFT BOARD .
At the war protests , I actually had Ron Paul activists tell me that Ron Paul is the true anti-war candidate , because Clinton is supporting Bush .
That is right , Clinton 's vote is being interpreted as the Democratic agenda , because she is the ' frontrunner . '
I say no thank you to that .
As for why Kos is wrong , when Edwards took public financing , Kos said it was ' dangerous ' to support Edwards , because he would n't have the money that other candidates ( like Clinton ) would have .
All along , I have maintained , as others have from our collective experience with the Kerry - Edwards campaign , you can have all the money in the world , but if you do n't have ideas and leadership , you wo n't win .
Question -
For the bloggers out there , some people have said taking public finance is a bad thing , what do you have to say about public finance ?
A - It is very hard to say you are for public finance and then reject it .
It is a matter of principle .
I have plenty of money to run my campaign .
I think we need to have an election not an auction .
Who raises the most money does not make the best president .
part 1
I think what makes a good president is having the ideas and the capacity to lead .
That is what made the most sense to me .
What matters more - Hillary Clinton 's money or her decision to support Lieberman Kyl and emboldened the neocons ?
I do n't care if every poll in the nation says Hillary is going to be the president , votes like that and her dismissive attitude to us , the actual democratic voters ... is what should matter to us more .
Rolph was surrounded by reporters and said he felt the need to stand his ground when Clinton challenged him : " She tried to ... accuse me of using someone else 's words and being stupid .
And that offended me .
I felt the need to defend myself in view of that kind of comment . "
( It is interesting to note , that John did not know I was interviewing him at first , and if you watch , as he approaches me , he is just a genuinely concerned person and that does not change even after he knows he is on camera . )
More from Edwards on the folly of aligning with the Neo-cons :
I believe this war in Iraq needs to be brought to an end , that means an end to combat missions in Iraq .
Senator Clinton believes we should continue combat missions in Iraq .
Her explanation for this is that there terrorists are operating in Iraq .
That sounds strangely familiar to me .
We have a president who says the same thing .
This is an argument between more war and less war .
I want the argument ( in the debates against the republican in the general ) to war versus no war .
On Lieberman Kyl :
You can guess who wants the Iranian Guard designated a terrorist organization ?
George Bush .
Biden and Dodd , to their credit , voted no .
I was strongly opposed to it .
How long does it take us to learn our lesson about George Bush ?
You give this guy an inch , he will take a mile .
Senator Clinton voted Yes ,
What I am worried about - so in 6 months when George Bush invades Iran , are going to hear ( her say )
" if I only knew then what I know now . "
On changing the world for the better and to build goodwill :
Instead of 500 billion in Iraq , we could give primary education to 100 million children in the world who do n't have any education at all , in Africa , Latin America , the Muslim world , all for 3 billion a year .
If we just promoted sanitation and clean drinking water , things we all take for granted - I have seen firsthand from the work I have done in Africa , how much difference that would make in stopping the spread of disease .
Today , there is an entire generation all around the world sitting on the fence .
On one side , there is Bin Laden , Al Qaida , Islamic Jihad , Hezbollah , and on the other side is America .
Which way do they go ?
That depends on us .
On Bush and Cheney :
I listen to George Bush - about as little as I can get away with , but here is what I hear ...
Stay home , watch television , go shopping .
me and Dick Cheney , we 'll take care of ya '
I do n't want that crowd taking care of me !
I do n't trust em ' , that is not America !
We are not a country that cowers in the corner waiting for someone to watch over us .
We are strong , we are courageous , we are out there pushing the envelope .
And by the way , when I 'm the president of the United States of America , DISSENT WILL ONCE AGAIN BE PATRIOTIC !
Now that sounds like leadership to me .
Someone who tells it like it is , whether he is talking to you as an individual , a small crowd , or in front of a national audience .
Not someone showing you one side in person , but really thinking of triangulating to appeal to some neo-con ideology .
We can not afford to pass up this chance to make our candidate answer to we the people .
I for one , have not worked this hard in spite of this administration , just to have a DINO take me and our votes for granted .
That is why I am voting for someone who listens to US !
John Edwards for President .
Just last week , an article by Seymour Hersh , the respected US investigative reporter , which claimed that the war against Iran 's proxy Hizbullah was a premeditated US - directed warm - up for an attack on Iran itself , stoked fears in Tehran that a US air assault on its nuclear facilities , even regime change , are moving to the top of the agenda .
Officials in Tehran worry that , after Afghanistan and Iraq , Iran is seen by Bush as " unfinished business " - and that , urged on by Israel , he is determined to destroy what both countries see as the looming threat of an " Islamic bomb " .
They hear Bush 's talk of " Islamic fascists " - and wonder whether he will soon be gunning for them .
There is a way out .
Tomorrow the Iranian government will present its long - awaited response to the west 's last - ditch compromise offer on nuclear power .
This package , belatedly backed by the US , offers Iran a range of incentives from implicit security , territorial guarantees and an end to sanctions , to new commercial and technological collaborations .
But first , Bush insists , Iran must suspend all uranium enrichment operations , which Washington believes are connected to its attempts to acquire bomb - making capability .
So far , Iran has insisted that it will not accept any such pre-conditions .
Officials say they are willing to resume negotiations with the west - but on equal terms .
So when Ahmadinejad delivers Iran 's formal reply at a Tehran press conference , the stage will be set for an epic clash that could reverberate across the Middle East and far beyond .
So far , the story has mostly been reported from the outside , and from a western perspective .
But what are the prospects for war and peace as seen from inside Iran ?
For the past two weeks the Guardian has been given unprecedented access to explore what ordinary Iranians think about the most pressing issue facing their country - and what some of the country 's most powerful men believe will happen next .
' Diplomatic chess '
In a high - ceilinged , thick - carpeted inner sanctum of Iran 's fortress - like Supreme National Security Council building in central Tehran , Ali Larijani patiently spells out the factors that will play a part in Iran 's decision .
The CIA would dearly love to penetrate inside these walls .
Perhaps it already has ; visitors ' mobile phones and other electronic devices are confiscated .
Larijani is an important man in Iran .
As secretary of the security council and chief nuclear negotiator , it is he , and his predecessor , Hassan Rowhani , who have by turns tantalised , teased and infuriated the west during three years of discussions on the nuclear dossier .
Iran plays a long and astute negotiating game , which Larijani likens to " diplomatic chess " .
Officials say they learned at the feet of masters : the European powers who exploited Persia during the 19th century " Great Game " .
Britain is still referred to as the " Old Fox " .
Larijani has a daunting reputation as the dour former head of state television whose programme schedules were both morally edifying and utterly tedious .
His appointment by Ahmadinejad was seen in the west as representing an ominous shift towards recalcitrance .
But in person he is charming and courteous .
" There are many reasons why Iran is seeking nuclear power , " he says .
" The history of our nuclear activity dates back 45 years to the time of the ex-shah 's regime .
But after the Islamic revolution , some western countries condemned Iran and cancelled their nuclear agreements with us .
For example , the Americans had concluded an agreement for a research reactor in Tehran and also to provide the fuel .
But they cancelled the agreement and did not give back the money .
The Germans did the same .
So the lesson was : we have to be self - sufficient , to provide fuel for ourselves . "
He continues : " We do n't see why we should stop the scientific research of our country .
We understand why this is very sensitive .
But they ( the west ) are categorising countries .
Some countries can have access to high nuclear technology .
The others are told they can produce fruit juice and pears !
They say : ' Do n't seek a nuclear bomb . '
We do n't have any objection to that .
But unfortunately officials of some countries such as the UK say , ' We do n't want you to have the knowledge for nuclear technology ' .
This is not logical .
And we do n't pay attention to this . "
The Americans ' contradictory impulses are to blame for the standoff , he says .
" After September 11 2001 , they faced a problem in Afghanistan .
They requested assistance from Iran and we gave it .
But after the problem ended in Afghanistan , they called us the ' axis of evil ' .
This paradox has always been their way .
They want to kiss one side of our face , but at the same time they also want to slap the other side . "
Iran is still willing to negotiate , Larijani concludes , but it will not give up its nuclear power programme .
Nor will it yield to preconditions such as Bush 's demand for an immediate suspension of uranium enrichment .
" If they are going to seek an imposed agreement by putting pressure on us , we will not accept it .
If the atmosphere is not proper , we may delay our reply .
If you try to cultivate a flower in salty land , it does not grow . "
For Larijani , the bottom line is respect .
And the evident lack of it in Washington , magnified by loose talk of enforced regime change , is one of many reasons why Iran is going nuclear .
A changing society
Tehran is a city of elegant parks .
And none is more serene than Saee Park , off Vali Asr Avenue , one of the capital 's main thoroughfares .
Known as the " lovers ' park " , it is where young and not - so - young couples sit at dusk beneath a canopy of fragrant chinar , cypress and pine trees , exchanging gossip and intimacies , sharing ice creams and swapping phone numbers .
According to Reza , 27 , and his girlfriend , things are more easy - going socially than they were 10 years ago .
They attribute the change to the presidency of Mohammad Khatami , Ahmadinejad 's reformist predecessor .
Despite Ahmadinejad 's conservative instincts , the new government has been unable to put the street culture genie back in the bottle , Reza says .
" There 's more personal freedom .
You do n't get harassed like you used to .
The young people are changing the older people 's attitude .
They have to accept it - they have no choice , so they go with the flow . "
And in a country of 70 m , where two - thirds of the population is under 30 , the trend appears irreversible .
The present hardline government is not popular among many inhabitants of Saee Park .
They complain about its failure to expand and diversify an economy that is roughly 80 % state - controlled .
Younger people worry about careers and jobs , about the difficulties of foreign travel and internet censorship , about the lack of things to do and places to meet .
Leila , 27 , says she would like to go to parties , to clubs ; she would like to sing .
" But they wo n't allow female singers , did you know that ?
Female vocalists are banned .
They say they are too alluring to men .
Poor men !
They have weak brains ! "
Yussuf , 63 , has a different perspective .
" I was a metallurgist until I retired .
I trained in the US during the Shah 's time .
I worked all my life .
But now I have to take part - time jobs because my pension is n't enough .
This government is no good , they 're all no good . "
Yussuf has another complaint : the government is sending money to Hizbullah in Lebanon that would be better spent at home , he says .
" First you must look after your own people . "
His friend , Ali , agrees .
He wants to know into whose pockets Iran 's record oil revenue is going .
" Some of them [ the governing elite ] are buying cars for $ 100,000 .
Think of that !
Did they get that money by working ? "
All the same , Ahmadinejad 's personal brand of nationalist populism , typified by his defiant handling of the nuclear issue , has many admirers in Saee Park and beyond .
" Why do n't they just leave us alone and let us live under our own rules ? " asks a 32 - year - old engineer .
" Iran has the right to nuclear power , " chanted a crowd in Ardabil , in northern Iran , last week .
During a series of nine rallies addressed by Ahmadinejad , the sentiments expressed by ordinary people are the same .
Western attempts to deny Iran nuclear technology are " an obvious attempt to keep us down , like they want to keep all the developing countries down , " says Majid , a 30 - year - old teacher in Tehran .
" We do n't want nuclear weapons .
But we want to build our country .
What 's wrong with that ? "
Iranians may be cut off from the modern western world in many ways , but they are well versed in the long history of western intervention in Persia .
From the Treaty of Golestan in 1813 , by which Russia took control of Iran 's Caucasus territories , to the 1953 CIA - led coup that toppled Iran 's democratically elected prime minister , Mohammad Mosaddeq , from the US embassy hostage siege to the Iran - Contra scandal , a tale of national subjugation and degradation forms the context in which Iran looks at the west .
And Iranians hear , in derogatory western talk of " mad mullahs " , an echo of a 19th - century British diplomat 's sneering reference to " incomprehensible orientals " .
It smacks of disrespect .
And now , with Washington 's neo-conservatives on one side and Ahmadinejad 's neo-conservatives on the other , this mutual antagonism and misunderstanding is coming to a head .
In some analyses , it has brought the two countries to the brink of military conflict .
If the US attacks , experts say it is likely to take the form of " precision strikes " on the four main nuclear facilities and possibly Iranian armed forces and Revolutionary Guard bases , too .
But Pentagon planners know Iran has the potential to retaliate , as the unexpected success of Hizbullah in Lebanon has shown .
This week the US ambassador to Iraq highlighted what he said were Iranian attempts to push Shia militants into attacks on coalition forces in Iraq .
And Baghdad is only one possible theatre for Iranian reprisals should the US pull the trigger .
Mohammad Saeidi is a practical man .
Sidestepping the political , ideological and historical aspects of the nuclear dispute with the west , the vice - president of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organisation is focused on a set of problems that must be solved logically if the country and its people are to develop to their full potential .
" The country 's oil and gas reserves will last a maximum of another 25 or 30 years , " he says .
" Therefore we have to provide other resources . "
About 7,000 people work in Iran 's atomic establishment - principally in Tehran and at the Bushehr , Arak , Isfahan and Natanz complexes .
Saeidi says there are plans to build 20 nuclear power stations in all , at a cost of $ 24 - $ 25 bn .
The first , at Bushehr , built with Russian help , is expected to come on stream next year .
Saeidi says that in going nuclear Iran is only following the example of other countries with growing populations and rising energy demand .
Nuclear power is cheaper , and its raw component , naturally occurring uranium , is in plentiful supply in Iran 's central deserts .
It is the cascade of 164 centrifuges constructed at Natanz that has drawn most international attention since Ahmadinejad announced last April that Iran had mastered the processes for uranium enrichment .
It was Natanz that finally prompted the US to join with European negotiators in offering the compromise incentives package that is now on the table .
But like Larijani , Saeidi stresses the research stage nature of this work - and the ongoing inspections of Natanz and other plants by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
To try to divert nuclear material for bomb - making purposes without the UN knowing would be " impossible " , he says , and if a deal is struck , Tehran would be ready to reintroduce spot checks .
But , in any case , bomb - making is not Iran 's aim , Saeidi says - even if it had the capacity , which it does not .
Overall , independent experts tend to agree that , at present , Iran does not have the wherewithal to build a nuclear weapon .
But that does not mean it will not in future .
Saeidi denies that Iran kept its facilities at Natanz secret , as claimed in 2003 by the Bush administration .
He says there was no legal necessity to notify the IAEA before nuclear material had entered the plant .
" Natanz is a very large factory .
You can not hide it .
It was n't secret . "
He also denies receiving help from Pakistan , now or in the past , despite a spate of disclosures concerning the proliferation network run by the Pakistani scientist , AQ Khan .
" We do n't have any relation to Pakistan on the nuclear issue .
All the equipment and components we are using are made by Iranian companies and factories . "
Needless to say , such statements are disputed by the US and other western governments who suspect that Iran may be running a hidden , parallel uranium enrichment programme using more advanced centrifuges .
They worry it is also experimenting with plutonium reprocessing .
But all such claims are met with a flat denial .
" We do n't have any secret programme .
We do n't have any secrets , " Saeidi says .
Iran does not want the bomb , he and other officials insist ; and it has no plans to build one .
What it does want is a plentiful future supply of nuclear energy to fuel the rise of a new , more powerful nation - and in this ambition , it will brook no obstacles .
Ahmadinejad 's vision
The man who could make all the difference is Ahmadinejad himself .
He insists that Iran 's intentions were not to make a bomb - " Iranians have mastered the complete cycle of uranium enrichment by themselves .
But we will use it for peaceful purposes , for nuclear power .
This is our right and no one can take this right away from us . "
But the man best known in the west for his desire to " wipe Israel off the map " and his questioning of the Holocaust , this blacksmith 's son who rose to be mayor of Tehran before unexpectedly winning the presidency a year ago this month , is a controversial figure inside Iran , too .
Many people , largely among the working class and in rural areas , adore him .
Others , particularly among the intellectual elite of Tehran , fear his devout Islamic beliefs and his conservative political instincts will further isolate the country .
For Iran 's president is a true believer .
He maintains that the 1979 revolution that overthrew the shah was besmirched and betrayed after the death of its leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , by pragmatists and corrupt mercantilists , by pro-western compromisers and reformists .
Ahmadinejad 's famously humble lifestyle , emphasised by his rumpled jackets and unkempt beard , offers but one clue to the fundamentalist spirit that moves him .
Tehranis say his vision is a return to the ideals of 1979 , including a reinvigorated social conservatism , a revived popular piety , and a principled rejection of the Christian and Zionist " crusader " west .
Many political moderates , western diplomats and ordinary citizens say Ahmadinejad 's vision is to turn the clock back to a more honest and more dutiful time .
And what better way to demonstrate the uplifting virtues and potency of this religious retrenchment than defiance of the west over the nuclear issue ?
Here is a golden opportunity to re-affirm Iran 's compromised independence and dignity - and restore both the international respect and the religious values that Ahjmadinejad believes the revolution has squandered since 1989 .
This is Ahmadinejad 's chance .
It may be naive to believe that Iran 's government , surrounded by nuclear - armed neighbours and directly threatened by the US , is not seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability .
" The Americans have been seeking regime change in Iran ever since the victory of the revolution , " say Larijani .
Given such widespread convictions , and the example of several other countries that have built atomic weapons without facing serious penalties , Iran 's leaders might be thought remiss in not seeking to arm themselves .
But more naive , perhaps , and potentially even more destabilising , is Ahmadinejad 's apparent belief that by confronting the west over the nuclear issue , he can revive the purist , Khomeini - era ideal of fundamentalist Islamic revolution in a country that is changing rapidly .
Most Iranians support the government 's pursuit of nuclear power .
But most oppose the intolerant theocracy that is Khomeini 's legacy .
In his brilliant new book , Confronting Iran , Ali Ansari portrays the growing " secularisation " of Iranian society as an unstoppable force .
" Fewer and fewer people show an interest in organised religion , " he writes .
And in Tehran the evidence of that is everywhere .
Iran is a rich country , poorly run .
Slowly but surely its people are demanding and obtaining change .
Iran does seem destined once again to be a great regional power , but that destiny is likely to be attained despite its religious leadership - and despite the Bush administration 's counter - productive bullying .
Ahmadinejad , the articulate champion of Iran 's national rights , is a potent figure .
But Ahmadinejad , the would - be visionary leader of a resurgent revolution awaiting the coming of the Hidden Imam , is living a dangerous illusion .
And it is Iranians , not the US air force , who should be allowed to shatter his dream .
Whenever I am involved in any programmer hiring decisions , I will always ask for a portfolio .
Lots of people wo n't have it , and that will say a lot about them - namely , that it is likely they did not write anything worth carrying with them .
I will also ask what they hack for fun .
If the answer is " nothing " , the liklihood that they are a workaday programmer or a larval manager is very high .
Speaking of managers , there is a corollary for them .
Managers accumulate people as they work .

Media Matters has put together a mashup of FOXNews ' attacks on Air America Radio and their new show FreeThought Radio , a show aimed at atheists and the growing number of Americans who take issue with organized religion .
In what is surely a warm up for FOXNews ' annual War On Christmas crusade , they not only attack atheists , but take their shots at science and evolution .
Using religion has always been one of Fixed Noise 's weapons of choice .
But cowards that they are , in promoting the story , they use photos of favorite liberal targets Janeane Garafalo and Al Franken , neither of whom actually work for Air America or have anything to with Free Thought Radio .

Several months ago , Tyng - Ruey , Chin-Lung , and I were working on some ideas in which we needed to compute the intersection of two regular expressions ( REs ) .
The traditional approach is to convert them to finite state automata , take the intersection , and convert the result back to a RE .
The disadvantage is that the structure of the original REs would be lost .
We therefore tried to perform the intersection directly on the REs .
The result was not satisfactory , however .
Regular expressions can be represented by the following algebraic datatype :
> data RE = Z -- Empty > | E -- Epsilon > | L Token -- Literal > | RE :+ RE -- Plus > | RE :.
RE -- Times > | S RE -- Star > deriving Show > type Token = Char > la = L 'a ' > lb = L 'b ' > lc = L 'c '
At one point we will need to determine whether an expression is nullable .
The following function nullable actually computes the intersection of the input with epsilon :
> nullable :: RE -> RE > nullable Z = Z > nullable E = E > nullable ( L _ ) = Z > nullable ( r :+ s ) = nullable r .+ nullable s > nullable ( r :. s ) = nullable r . : nullable s > nullable ( S r ) = E
I defined some “ smart ” constructors doing some minimal simplification for plus and times :
> Z .+ r = r > r .+ Z = r > r .+ s = r :+ s > Z . : r = Z > r . : Z = Z > E . : r = r > r . : E = r > r . : s = r :. s
Now , here comes Brzozowski ’s derivative of regular expressions .
Intuitively speaking , d a e yields a regular expression resulting from extracting a prefixing token a from the regular expression e .
Brzozowski actually defined derivative with respect to strings rather than just tokens .
> d :: Token -> RE -> RE > d _ Z = Z > d _ E = Z > d a ( L b ) | a == b = E > | otherwise = Z > d a ( r :+ s ) = d a r .+ d a s > d a ( r :. s ) = ( d a r . : s ) .+ ( nullable r . : d a s ) > d a ( S r ) = d a r . : S r
The interesting case is probably r :. s .
To extract a from r :. s , we either extract a from r or , if r is nullable , extract a from s .
Now let us consider how to define intersection .
The intersection of any expression with the empty set Z yields Z .
Intersection with epsilon has been defined as nullable above .
> Z `cap` _ = Z > _ `cap` Z = Z > E `cap` E = E > E `cap` r = nullable r > r `cap` E = nullable r
The case for literals is defined below .
Again the interesting case is the one regarding r :. s :
> L a `cap` L b | a == b = L a > | otherwise = Z > L a `cap` ( r :+ s ) = ( L a `cap` r ) .+ ( L a `cap` s ) > L a `cap` ( r :. s ) = ( L a `cap` r . : nullable s ) .+ > ( nullable r . : L a `cap` s ) >
L a `cap` S r = L a `cap` r
The cases for plus is simple :
> ( r :+ s ) `cap` t = ( r `cap` t ) .+ ( s `cap` t )
The case for :. is the most difficult .
We have to do case analysis on the left side of :. :
> ( Z :. s ) `cap` t = Z > ( E :. s ) `cap` t = s `cap` t > ( L a :. s ) `cap` t = L a . : ( s `cap` d a t ) > ( ( r :+ s ) :. t ) `cap` u = ( ( r . : t ) `cap` u ) .+ ( (s . : t ) `cap` u ) > ( ( r :. s ) :. t ) `cap` u = ( r . : ( s . : t ) ) `cap` u > ( S r :. s ) `cap` t = ( s `cap` t ) .+ ( ( r . : ( S r . : s ) ) `cap` t)
The case ( Z :. s ) `cap` t should be Z because ( Z :. s ) is Z , while ( E :. s ) `cap` t is s `cap` t because ( E :. s ) simplifies to s .
The intersection of ( L a :. s ) and t is a cons the intersection of s and d a t .
If it is not possible to extract a from t , the expression collapses to Z .
The case for :+ is given by distributivity , the case for ( r :. s ) :. t by associativity .
The case for ( S r :. s ) `cap` t actually comes from expanding S r :. s to s :+ ( r :. S r :. s ) .
This may have contributed to the non-termination we will see later .
Finally , the case for ( S r ) `cap` t results from expanding S r to E :+ ( r :. S r ) :
> ( S r ) `cap` t = E `cap` t .+ ( ( r . : S r ) `cap` t)
Unfortunately , cap does not always terminate when star is involved .
In some cases it works well :
* Main > S la `cap` lb Z * Main > S la `cap` ( la :+ lb ) L 'a' * Main >
S la `cap` S lb E
In some cases it loops .
For example , consider S lb `cap` S lb .
We get
b* cap b* = e cap b* + bb* cap b* = e + b ( b* cap d b b* ) = e + b ( b* cap b* ) = e + b ({-- loop --} )
We could probably try to capture the recursive pattern in , perhaps , a fold .
But we were then distracted by other topics and did not explore further .
Is it possible at all ?
Popular culture quickly embraced flying saucers
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
It 's 60 years since the term flying saucer was coined and the most celebrated " extraterrestrial " episode - Roswell .
Alien believers are dismissed as cranks , but even the earthly explanations of objects in the sky are fascinating .
Sixty years ago Kenneth Arnold saw something which changed his own life and the lives of millions of others , and impacted on popular culture like a shockwave .
Flying his plane near Mount Rainier in the US state of Washington , he observed a line of strange objects either crescent - shaped or disc - like , flying with the motion of a saucer skimming on water .
Arnold 's sighting , quickly picked up by the press , was followed a fortnight later by the revelation of perhaps the most notorious episode in the history of UFOs , at Roswell in New Mexico .
FAMOUS SIGHTINGS 1980 , Rendlesham Forest : US airbase staff see strange lights in woods 1957 , RB - 47 encounter : US jet followed by UFO for 700 miles 1979 , Livingston : Forestry worker sees dome - shaped object 1950 , McMinnville : Farm couple photograph saucer 1961 , Betty and Barney Hill incident : Couple see UFO and under hypnosis describe abduction
Having announced it had recovered a " flying disk " , the Army airfield backtracked and referred only to a weather balloon .
What followed was perhaps one of the greatest conspiracy theories of all time , involving post - mortem examinations of swollen - bellied grey aliens , the cloning of sophisticated extraterrestrial technology and an epic cover - up .
Or not , as the case may be .
In the 60 years since 1947 's first major wave of sightings , thousands of ordinary people have claimed to have seen inexplicable objects in the sky .
When the Ministry of Defence released papers on its own investigations into the phenomenon in 2006 , it was revealed more than 10,000 eyewitness accounts had been collected .
And for every sceptic who prefers explanations of weather balloons and freak atmospheric conditions there is someone who genuinely believes intelligent life is visiting the planet .
Alien belief
A national newspaper survey in 1998 suggested 33 % of men and 24 % of women thought aliens had already visited the earth .
Such polls are testament to the powerful impact of six decades of media coverage , disputed science , heated mythology and Hollywood films .
We have now completed six decades of projecting our hopes and fears onto the UFO phenomenon .
Many UFO images are less than overwhelming
David Clarke , a lecturer in journalism , has spent 30 years studying UFOs and the sociology of the flying saucer sighting .
He is no believer in little extraterrestrial men , but believes mainstream scientists should recognise the rational explanations for sightings are themselves worthy of study .
" They would n't touch it , " he says .
" It 's got such a bad press .
Anything that people do n't have an immediate explanation for - it must be little green men . "
The " ufologists " who study the phenomenon comprise both sceptics and believers .
They seek to " resolve " each incident , explaining away each aspect .
And there is a wealth of explanations for most sightings that is as fascinating for sceptical enthusiasts as the notion of space visitors .
Cold War projection
Sundogs , or strange refractions of the sun in another part of the sky , burning space debris , weather balloons , ball lightning , meteors , disc - shaped or lenticular clouds , mirages , even the planet Venus low in the sky , are all classic methods of resolving UFO sightings .
But underlying them is a need also to explain people 's desire to believe that a UFO sighting can be explained by alien activity .
The timing of the start of the golden age of the UFO , in a Western world recovering from World War II and gearing up for the start of the Cold War , is significant .
" We were projecting things to reflect our fears and concerns about the Cold War , " Mr Clarke says .
EXPLANATIONS
Sundogs : Refracted image of the sun Space debris : Burning satellites or rocket fragments Meteors : Such as bolides or fireballs Clouds : Lenticular or disc- like Mirages :
Hot or cold - air induced images Stars / planets : Such as Venus Planes : Such as experimental aircraft Ball lightning : Unpredictable brilliant spheres Weather balloons : Classic explanation Hallucination : Viewer under stress Mass hysteria : Early explanation Earthlights : Caused by electromagnetic fields in seismic activity areas
" Organised religion was in decline but when worried or concerned it is comforting to feel there is a greater power looking after us .
It is quite nice to think there is another civilisation that has been able to overcome the things destroying our civilisation . "
The UFO phenomenon is also linked with the modern reliance on conspiracy theories , a mixture of a need to believe in something more than the mundane in an increasingly rational world and an all - pervading distrust of authority .
As the Fortean Times , which this month dedicates an entire issue to the UFO anniversary , puts it : " UFOs fill a niche in the human spirit that thrives on wondrous ideas . "
Earlier generations had also seen UFOs but without the term flying saucer in existence , they were labelled as other things .
UFO students say there are peaks and troughs in sightings that are probably based on cultural , social and political trends .
Golden age
Expert Paul Devereux says a new golden age during the 1990s , particularly after the broadcast of the cult television series the X - Files , has given way to a current wave of indifference .
Mr Clarke concurs , suggesting : " It could be the case that post - 9/11 people are more concerned about the threat from terrorism or the environment . "
US military said a crashed weather balloon explained Roswell
Mr Devereux has drawn on the work of controversial Canadian academic Michael Persinger and believes many unresolved UFO sightings can be explained by " earthlights " , clouds of plasma being charged by strong electromagnetic fields occurring in areas of seismic activity .
Having witnessed a UFO that could not initially be explained , Mr Devereux has dedicated his life to research .
" It bugged the hell out of me , almost gave me a mental breakdown .
I could n't make it fit into the everyday mundane world view . "
Pilot Ray Bowyer was the principal witness to the most recent publicised UFO sighting in the UK .
Flying a commercial plane from Southampton to Alderney in the Channel Islands in April this year , Mr Bowyer saw two objects up to a mile across in the sky over Guernsey .
" I saw a bright yellow object , a light in the sky some miles ahead .
I could see this specific shape of a flattened disc , like a CD on its edge , slightly tilted . "
Many UFO enthusiasts believe governments hide the truth
He says some of his passengers , as well as another pilot , saw the objects and he has been told they were picked up on radar .
Mr Bowyer 's sighting may be a prime candidate for the " earthlights " theory , coming just days before the Dover earthquake .
He accepts this as a possible explanation .
" I 'm open - minded about everything .
It would be a fairly perverse universe if we were the only inhabitants . "
Despite the drop - off in interest in UFOs , the ufologists and their acolytes carry on their work , and the UFO - loving public continues to believe in conspiracies .
" No matter how much material the authorities produce and release the people who want to believe a conspiracy to hide aliens will never be satisfied , " Mr Clarke says .
" It is such an emotional thing .
They are convinced they are here , that they are walking among us . "
Mobile phones are near - useless for snapping UFOs on account of their wide angle lens , tiny CCD sensors and poor resolution .
The point about satellites warding off UFOs is a good one , though ...
Michal , Warsaw , Poland
Two mile - wide UFOs are seen by pilots near Guernsey .
Not clouds , balloons , geese , etc .
I really do think it 's time for the authorities to own up about what they know or do n't know .
The objects were on radar for nearly an hour .
I hope the story does not get the usual treatment .

About 10 years ago , I was woken by my father ( I was at home during university vacation ) telling me to look out of my bedroom window .
He was already at the window , filming with hs video camera .
What we saw can only be described as large , white , the shape of a teardrop on its side , and flying very fast .
At that time , we lived in southwest Cornwall , and watched as it flew behind St Michael 's Mount , and reappeared the other side after a second or so .
My father got all of this on video , and had it analysed by several experts shortly after .
The results were inconclusive , but we were advised categorically that it was not a cloud , and that it was , indeed , very large , some way in the distance , and travelling at great speed .
As it happens , we were n't the only witnesses to this , and a large feature appeared a week later in the local paper .
Certainly changed me from a die - hard disbeliever into your common or garden sceptic !
Kay , Plymouth , UK
I note the Roswell ' Cover Up ' quoted that the debris contained indestructable , light as a feather material .
If it was so light and indestuctable how come it crashed into the ground leaving debris ??
It should still have been perfectly formed if it was indestructable !!
Mark , London
I have actually seen the electromagnetic discharge about 5 minutes before the earthquake that was centred around Clun in Shropshire struck in the early nineties and it did n't look like no UFO .
It just looked like all the air surrounding me just lit up .
I walked for one building to the other , heard a rumble , looked out of the window and the ground just looked like a series of waves running towards me then the building shook .
Pablo , UK
I saw a huge black triangle over a Roman town called Vienne in France .
Using crude estimations with a tv aerial as point of reference , I guess it was perhaps 3-400 metres across .
It was silent , moved very slowly and blocked the stars out as it passed over .
It was very chilling indeed
Rene Pasini , Hammersmith
I find it strange that the UFO over Singapore in the 1970s never gets a mention in lists of sightings .
It was around for days and thousands of people must have seen it , so why are the reports supressed ?
John , Chesterfield , England
I personally doubt that we 've been visited , because even if there is a possibility of other life in the universe , you have to reduce that possibility to life existing within a reasonable distance of earth , say 500 light years .
On the other hand , a recend drying up of sightings could be due to an increase in the number of satellites that look down , ie .
observe the skies and ground beneath them .
This might cause an investigating visitor keep to a distance higher than satellite orbits , which would have a knock - on effect of reducing accidental naked - eye observations .
Luke , London
Pretty much all sightings are explainable , which leaves some which are " unidentified flying objects " .
Just because they 're unidentified it does n't mean they 're alien spaceships - by definition they 're unexplained .
They could be spaceships but there 's no way of knowing .
If you want a real conspiracy theory try this one : the furore around government cover-ups of UFOs to make us think they 're from another world is to divert us away from what they 're really up to - and heaven alone knows what thet might be !.
Mark Grady , Southampton , UK
Yesterday evening at exactly 18.06:06 hrs I was walking on the Great Orme in Llandudno when to my amazement I saw a very strange object in the skies over the Irish sea .
The object was shaped similar in configuration to a crucifix , as if you were looking at it side on but with a slight tilt , it also appeared to have a green symbol / shape on the side of it .
The symbol / shape looked something like this : Ryanair .

My wife and her parents were scared by a low flying very fast UFO one night in South Yorkshire over 20 years ago .
Last year I had my wife carefully draw what she saw then I loaded up google ... what she saw was an F - 117 stealth fighter years before the US admitted they existed .
I suspect most of the ' credible ' UFO sightings are new , top secret military aircraft .
Peter , Nottingham
I do n't know if UFOs are real but it seems pretty obvious that intelligent life must exist elsewhere in the universe .
I remember reading that scientits had calculated that with the number of stars in our galaxy , the milky way alone must contain at least 100,000 advanced civilisations .
People who say extra terrestrial life does n't exist seem to be the crank to me .
It 's like claiming the earth is flat , because it looks that way from our perspective on the ground .
On the other hand , there is no guarantee that they will be friendly .
Andrew , Edinburgh
I 've always found it fascinating that UFO images are so rubbish , when people are regularly taking pictures of aircraft etc that look just fine .
The western world now seems to have a camera in every pocket ( camera phones ? ) and yet there have been no new photos for years .
Military video allows us to see missiles slamming into bunkers in great detail but no UFOs with the same detail .
Perhaps .... because they simply do n't exist ?
Now open the lines to the conspiracy theorists ...
" Of course that 's what THEY want you to think ! "

Another attempt at debunking .
One of the leading officers who organised the Roswell ' Cover Up ' recently died , but wrote an afadavit to say that he saw the craft debris , handled the material which was silver , indestructable and as light as a feather .
He also organised the local undertaker to supply four child sized coffins for the UFO occupants and oversaw the entire weather balloon story .
This was in a recent Daily Mail spread about the Roswell Truth .

I served with the UK forces in the Falklands in the 90s and from our hill top perch one night , the 3 of us saw a bright blue light moving fast over the water in the distance ( map showed about 50 miles away )
You could see the blue reflecting off the sea .
We reported it and had to fill out a classified report ..
2
Phantom jets were scrambled and we confirmed the light had also been picked up on a radar station .
They followed the light for a while as we watched ...
It travelled up Falkland sound then just switched off leaving the jets flying in circles looking for it .

If there are aliens amongst us they can't be very intelligent , otherwise they would have started an immediate cull of the most destructive life form in the universe - humans !
Mike Preston , Blackpool
The idea that aliens would bother to travel across vast reaches of time and space to buzz grannies in cars , experiment with farmers in the mid-west of the USA and emit some kind of ray that only produces ambiguous grainy images on cameras is just - rediculous .
David Case , Westgate on Sea
Strange with the advent of digital phones with cameras and videos that UFO sightings have dried up .... isn't it ?
Puggy , Glasgow
With everyone these days carrying a camera in their mobile phones surely we should have a half decent photograph of a UFO by now .
Or have the aliens stopped coming becouse the weather is so bad ?
TeeGee , Belfast
If you type Area 51 itno Google Earth you will see an amazing area which does get the imagination going .
Whether or not the Government knows about it , the chances of ' others ' are very high .
If we have evolved and survived this long , there are bound to be others .
We may never see or hear from them but to think we are the sole beings in the universe is a bit naive .
Lewis , Portsmouth
I read about all these sceptics saying 80 % or 90 % or 99 % of sightings are earthlights , or moonlight on geese or the planet Venus - and they quietly do n't mention that fact that still leaves more than a few sightings that are n't explained .
Does n't it worry anyone that there are things in the sky and we do n't know what they are ?
I 'm not saying they 're aliens , just that these sightings should be studied properly , not swept under the carpet and dismissed as cranks or drunks or idiots not be able to recognise a plane when they see it .

Virtually all relationships can use a little improvement , even if they are going along great .
Bad relationships may need some serious changes before they can improve , while good relationships can always use a few small changes to make them even better .
On the other hand , as has been said many times before , it ’s the small things that add up and determine the quality and character of the relationship .
So even if your relationship can’t exactly be described as a good one , making it a habit to do the small things listed in this article and others like them may bring it back from the brink , and turn it from lead to gold .
Let ’s just get started , then , so you can get started on figuring out how to use these ( or coming up with more … if you do , please comment ! ) 7 small things you can do to improve your relationship :
Say “ I love you ”
You do love them , and they know it , but that does n’t mean they do n’t need to hear it .
I generally find that the amount I tell my wife that I love her varies directly with how close I feel to her… though I think it ’s the being close that causes me to tell her more , rather than the other way around .
Either way , it lets her know that I am thinking about her right then .
One thing to watch out for , though , is overdoing it , especially if your significant other is not feeling particularly close to you at the moment .
Drop Everything
You can really show how much you love someone by dropping everything that you ’re doing to go give them attention .
This works especially well if you do it right when you see them after being apart , such as right when they come home .
There ’s very little that makes me feel better than when my wife drops whatever she ’s doing when I come home and meets me at the door , throwing her arms around my neck .
This is another one of those whose effectiveness varies considerably depending on the recipient ’s mood , however .
Pay Attention
It feels good when somebody notices what you ’ve been working on … so pay attention and see where they ’ve been spending their time , energy , and attention .
You should notice when your significant other gets a new item of clothing , a new haircut , a new scent ( ie perfume / cologne ) , or anything else that changes .
Let them know you noticed , especially if it ’s something they did for you ( like if they bought that new item of clothing because they know it ’s something you like ) .
It does n’t hurt to thank them , either , when it ’s something for you , or even something that ’s not for you , but IS something you appreciate .
Let Them Know When You Are Impressed
This one is actually a big deal , though in my experience it seems to be a bigger deal for men than for women .
It does n’t really matter how small the thing is that impressed you , everyone likes to know that they did something that you find remarkable … it could be that you threw something to them and they caught it , in spite of it not being the greatest throw , all the way up to them getting a promotion or a new job .
There ’s a corollary to this , as well … let them know when you are proud of them .
If your significant other spends a significant amount of time and energy on something , and achieves a significant results , such as losing a lot of weight , completing a long and involved project , overcoming their anger , or something else involving a difficult accomplishment , let them know that you are proud of them for what they ’ve done and for sticking with it … it will make them feel much better and provide more motivation for their next serious effort .
Remember Special Moments … And Share
When you ’ve been together for a while , even a short while , you will have special moments together .
As you ’re together longer , you will pile up more and more of these , and while some of the initial , lesser , special moments may fade , you will always have a collection of these moments .
While going through your daily life , it ’s quite likely that something will make you remember one of these special moments … when it does , take a moment to really remember it .
If you are with your significant other , share the memory right then .
If not , try to remember the circumstances … what brought up the memory , how it made you feel , etc. , and tell them later .
Buy Them Something Small Spontaneously
This is always easy … pick up something small for them that they like , for no reason .
Buy your wife flowers ( or chocolates … as long as she ’s not working hard to lose weight … if she is it will make her love you AND hate you ) , your husband a new gadget , or whatever it is that they like .
Your definition of small may vary … to me something small is something that costs less than $ 20 .
If you make more money than me , that might be $ 1,000 … if you make less it might be $ 5 .
Whatever amount small is to you , it ’s just something to show that you were thinking about them and willing to go out of your way in order to get them something they like .

A flying saucer which glides up to 10 metres off the ground and carries two people could be yours for £ 65,000 .
The saucer is powered by eight engines and can reach speeds of over 50 mph as it moves gracefully through the air .
The bizarre flying pod , which is the size of a small car , is even able to land on skyscrapers - should the need arise .
Scroll down for more
It can take off and land vertically , like a helicopter , but it is almost noise - free and has been described by passengers as being " like a magic carpet ride . "
US company Moller International has begun manufacturing the flying saucer and says it has completed more than 200 successful test flights .
The firm is so confident in its flying ability that it says it welcomes " potential military and / or para- military applications " and also thinks the saucer could be used for border patrol .
Company founder Dr Paul Moller calls the craft " the ultimate off - road vehicle " as it is able to travel over any surface .
" It 's not a hovercraft , although its operation is just as easy , " he added .
" You can speed over rocks , swampland , fences , or log - infested waterways with ease because you 're not limited by the surface . "
The flying saucer is designed to fly at an altitude of up to about ten metres , where it benefits from extra lift created by a cushion of air - known as ground effect .
Things I ’ve Learned About Money by Not Having a Lot of It .
Last week I told you about my biggest financial success : becoming a stay - at - home mom .
Today I ’d like to expand upon the things I ’ve learned along the way .
When I quit my job a month before our first child was born , nearly half our income went away .
We were left with $ 19,000 a year to live on .
Yes , $ 19,000 .
Right now you might be saying that me quitting my job was possibly the stupidest thing I could have done .
But I think it was a smart decision .
I learned really quickly that I had to prioritize financial obligations .
Sure , it would have been nice to have lived in a single family 3 bed / 2 bath home with a big yard .
Instead we chose a single wide manufactured home in a park .
The price was right , and the park was family friendly .
Yes , we lived near a rock quarry , but when my daughter became a toddler , she LOVED looking at the trucks from our kitchen window .
Having a nice new 4 door car or SUV would have been nice .
A triple digit car payment was out of the question , though .
Instead , I drove around in a 1990 Toyota Celica .
Yes , it only had two doors , but we managed to fit a carseat safely in the back , and we made do with what we had .
And that Celica was a blast to drive !
I also learned that it ’s OK to accept help , and it ’s important to give back when you can .
I received a lot of hand - me - downs that first year of being a stay - at - home mom .
I think I bought maybe a half a dozen outfits for my daughter , most from a consignment store .
She had plenty of clothes , thanks to the generosity of our friends with older children .
At times it was humbling to accept help from others , but through that experience I became more sympathetic toward people who do n’t have a lot of resources .
I was fortunate to have a large network of friends and family .
Some people are n’t so fortunate .
Even though my husband and I are currently going through some rough financial times , I think it ’s still important for us to give as much as we can .
If we do n’t have extra money , we can give our children ’s outgrown clothes or our time .
No matter how badly off I think I am , there ’s always someone who needs more than me .
By helping others , I have learned to become more mindful of the blessings in my own life .
One of the most important things I have learned as a stay - at - home mom is to ignore peer pressure .
Just because my friends are all driving newer cars does n’t mean that ’s the best choice for me .
A few years ago , my husband and I considered buying a home .
In some ways we felt like we should , because all of our friends own their homes .
Still , we sensed the timing was n’t right , and we passed .
It ’s a good thing we did , because we ’d certainly be in foreclosure by now had we moved ahead in buying a house .
Instead , we continue to rent our terribly outdated little duplex .
I will admit that this place gets on my last nerve from time to time .
I hate the kitchen cabinets .
I hate that the washer and dryer are in the kitchen .
I hate the bland “ rental cream colored ” walls .
But we have everything we need , and we can afford to live here without busting the budget .
So we count our blessings and do n’t worry about the fact that everyone else seems to be ahead of us in the financial game right now .
Our time will come .
And if it does n’t , so what ?
It ’s not the end of the world .
Finally , I have learned that money is n’t the most important thing in life .
Relationships are the most important thing in life .
My relationship with God , my relationship with my family , my relationship with my friends , and how I treat other people … that ’s important .
If I live my entire life without a lot of money , I will consider my life a success if other people see the love of God through me .
So now that I ’ve gone on about how little money we ’ve had over the years ( and do n’t worry … that $ 19,000 annual income has increased over the years ) , why do I consider being a stay - at - home mom my biggest financial success ?
Simple .
Because being a stay - at - home mom has taught me how to manage my money well , and it ’s forced me to have a proper perspective on money in light of the more important things in life .

Few words in the Anglo - American academic lexicon cause more confusion on the Anglo side than " commencement " .
It 's what the Americans call " graduation " .
And it takes place , midsummer , between the end of May and the beginning of June .
For four weeks , there are more mortarboards than skateboards on campus .
The word " commencement " invariably wrinkles British brows .
The psychology 's wrong .
We think of graduation as something concluded .
Americans , more optimistic by nature , see it as life 's starting blocks .
To instill that up and at 'em spirit , American universities and colleges recruit " commencement speakers " .
If you follow this back to colonial times , one can see it as originating in the inspiring sermon that accompanied the solemn ceremony of academic completion .
The first commencement speakers were all clergymen .
The earliest speaker I have identified was the Rev LT Chamberlain , who gave the address at the University of Connecticut , then an agricultural school , in May 1882 .
It was a somewhat anti-climactic affair .
None of the students had completed the requirements for graduation and no diplomas were awarded .
After the ceremony , students conducted laboratory practice demonstrations .
It 's different today .
Commencement is the splashiest public event of the academic calendar .
But shreds of that pioneer piety and sermonising still remain in the ten - minute address .
Bill Clinton ( who 's doing the rounds of six campuses this summer , Hillary - preoccupied with fund - raising - is doing only two ) puts it this way :
" I always urge them to have dreams that are both timely and timeless , to try to live their dreams knowing that life 's real regrets are more rooted in not trying than in not succeeding , and to find joy in the effort . "
Dream the impossible dream - where have I heard that schmaltz before ?
Addressing the most venerable of African - American campuses , Howard University , on May 12 , Oprah Winfrey , " commencement oratrix " , told her ecstatically cheering , begowned audience : " I stand here as a symbol of what is possible when you believe in the dream of your own life . "
With that sublimely meaningless platitude Dr Winfrey , who has honorary degrees like Imelda Marcos had shoes , received another PhD in humanities .
She may also have received a hefty fee .
Or not .
Universities are chary about revealing how much they pay their speakers : it rather takes the bloom off the platitude .
Over the last three decades , commencement speaking has become big business .
Katie Couric , a TV news anchor , is speaking this year on June 3 , at Williams College , in Massachusetts .
It 's not reported how much they 're coughing up .
But last year Dr Couric cost Oklahoma a cool $ 110,000 ( £ 55,360 ) .
According to the Washington Post , she informed the new graduates : " Not only do I like spunk , but you 've got to have it . "
Worth a hundred grand of anyone 's money .
The going rate for top - drawer speakers is said to be half Couric's .
But for that you probably wo n't get the stars : Bill Cosby , Maya Angelou , or the late Kurt Vonnegut .
Cosby , who 's done 21 commencements in the last five years , probably needs a small warehouse for his scrolls and plaques .
And a Brinks van for his payments .
The hypocrisy beneath the commencement flummery can be breathtaking .
Barack Obama , for example , in his address at Southern New Hampshire University on May 19 , enjoined the 1,000 new graduates to " resist the money culture " .
This from a candidate who , for the previous six months , had been shaking down donors for his presidential bid as single - mindedly as Paulie Walnuts doing the rounds for Big Tony .
Between January and the end of April , Obama raised $ 25 m from 100,000 supporters .
Not much resistance to the money culture there .
John Edwards , Obama 's rival , spoke to students at the University of California at Davis in January on the rousing topic , " Poverty , the Great Moral Issue Facing America . "
His fee ?
$ 55,000 ( £ 27,700 ) .
Edwards gave the commencement address at New England College this May .
" The irresistible power of America lies in your hands , " he told the new graduates .
How much flowed back into his hands is unreported .
Perhaps nothing .
Nor , I suspect , will the owner of Microsoft expect any addition to his trillions this summer .
Bill Gates is speaking at Harvard this June .
He could buy the place - and it must be a good feeling .
He 's the university 's richest dropout , having left in his second year to make his first million .
Only schmucks hang around for graduation .
Somehow , though , I expect there will be more platitudes about dreaming the dream .
Politicians love the commencement podium .
Even if , like Bill Clinton , they ostentatiously decline money , there 's always a payoff .
They look distinguished in their academic finery , the graduands and their proud parents are the friendliest of audiences .
And , most importantly , commencement speeches are reported nationally .
George W Bush rotates his commencement duties among the military academies .
This year on May 23 , it was the US Coast Guard academy , and he used the event to stress the ongoing threat of the evil ones : stand by your boats , men , Osama is coming back .
Dick Cheney spoke at Brigham Young University , the Mormon institution generally regarded as the most conservative university in the nation .
It still imposes strict regulations on " modesty attire " .
Alas , even in this Republican stronghold , there were campus demonstrators ... modestly attired .
Generally speaking , high - ranking government politicians , still in office , are not welcome in campuses that - unlike the US Coast Guard academy - offer easy access to the public .
As his popularity sagged , in the early 1990s , George H Bush did a round of commencement addresses .
But the vast presidential security apparatus ( bulletproof screens on three sides of the podium ) rather took the fun out of the event .
As their offspring went up for their scroll , parents were uneasy at the thought that their pride - and - joy was in the crosshairs of half a dozen highly trained marksmen .
Who chooses ?
It used to be the senior faculty .
Increasingly it 's student advisory committees which have the clout .
When Rice University , in 2005 , decided for the first time to have a serving woman professor on their own staff give the commencement address , the students went ballistic .
They wanted Lance Armstrong , Robin Williams , or Bill Gates .
Bill Cosby gave the address in 2002 .
That had gone down very well .
The institution 's argument that " With a typical commencement speaker 's fee of between $ 25,000 and $ 35,000 , you could hire an assistant professor for a year " cut no ice whatsoever with graduating seniors .
" If I had wanted to hear her speak , " snarled one , " I could have gone to her class . "
This year , Rice has John Doerr - described as " the single best venture capitalist in the world . "
That 's more like it .
Commencement speaking has n't caught on in the UK , and perhaps never will .
But , rest assured , one Briton ( and probably his wife ) will be doing the circuit next year .
Look to your laurels , Cosby : the Blairs are coming .
· This article was amended on Friday June 1 2007 .
We wrongly stated that Bill Cosby gave the commencement address at Rice University " two years running , in 2001 - 02 . "
Mr. Cosby has presented only one commencement address at Rice - in 2002 .
Civil rights attorney Morris Dees gave the commencement address in 2001 .
This has been corrected .
The other day , I got snagged by the headline Flektor Case Study : Counter to prevailing Web 2.0 wisdom .
Hey , I ’m a sucker for contrarian articles .
I also like and understand the Web 2 dot oh .
Yet …
I think the whole industry needs to , as they say in Hollywood , “ pull it back a little ” .
I ’m not hot on the whole widgets thing , but I do have some friends here in the valley that are in that industry ( RockYou ! , slide , and Meebo ) .
So I gave it a read .
After a few paragraphs it got even more interesting .
These guys were game developers and they used that development style / methodology to produce their product .
They focused on several things .
First , they focused on quality and had a large QA staff for a company that size .
Second , they made their app creation tools super simple to use .
The product managers and the designers could turn around new products very quickly .
The analogy used in the article is that of level editing on top of a game engine .
Neat .
As I read on , it was mentioned that the founders were Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin .
Aha !
Of course !
These were the guys that made Crash Bandicoot .
They were Naughty Dog software , which was purchased by Sony .
These guys are Lisp hackers .
They were a poster child for the Franz Lisp company .
I always thought it was cool that these ex-MIT hackers used Lisp to build great console games .
Dynamic languages and garbage collection are n’t supposed to work in the console world .
I searched my blog for the old post I had on GOOL .
I thought I posted about their technology before , but I ca n’t find the post .
Essentially , they had a great Lisp derivative and runtime that ran on the console .
The system would allow for hot code replacement right from Franz Lisp / emacs / whatever .
Essentially , you could imagine having a character on the screen doing their death sequence .
Then you change some code / state and bring them back to life .
Real RAD development for gaming .
Something that would be really really hard to do in MSVC .
Not only that , but the system was fast .
For example , their language also allowed you to tie cpu or gpu registers to variables .
Very good tech and very good games .
Who knows if they used Lisp at Flektor , but I definitely need to check out their product now to see what the quality level is like .
Anyways , there it is again .
That pattern .
Certain people who do extraordninary things tend to continue to do extraordinary things .
If I were an investor , I would place a lot of value on this team .
These guys really know how to execute .
Update : Got a few comments about GOOL .
When I read the papers back then , their language was called GOOL .
I think it was 1998 or earlier .
It was the Oopsla conference in San Jose when Anomorphic Systems got bought by Sun .
The newer language GOAL was created for the PS2 when they did Jax and Daxter in 2001 .

The Culture Company said it was an " astonishing feat of engineering , which will stun audiences . "
We suggest not rotating it when it 's raining though .
There 's little doubt Vista is the most secure version of Windows , even as new vulnerabilities surface .
When we talk about security in Windows we usually mean what Microsoft is doing — or not doing — to keep us safe .
But it 's also true that Microsoft intends to vigorously safeguard its own interests .
That means Vista will also be the hardest Windows to counterfeit .
Microsoft is serious about piracy .
It likes to refer to the Business Software Alliance — " the voice of the world 's commercial software industry " — which maintains that " 35 % of the software installed on personal computers world - wide in 2006 was illegal . "
Windows Genuine Advantage , part of Microsoft 's antipiracy program , has been in a kind of beta since 2004 , but now appears to be ready for prime time :
" Technology built into Vista allows Microsoft to periodically evaluate the OS to make sure it is legitimate , rather than just having one opportunity , when the product key is first entered at activation . "
Certainly Microsoft has a right and , its shareholders would say , a duty to protect its intellectual property .
The key is going to be how well activation schemes work .
How often is " periodically ? "
Will routine maintenance performed by corporate IT technicians trigger it and perhaps cause a failure ?
Glitches are sure to occur .
Minimizing glitches will be the key to success .
Microsoft says it validated 300 million copies of Windows since July , 2005 , with a failure rate of " approximately one in five . "
" Most failed validations , approximately 80 % , are caused by a misused or stolen volume license key .
The remaining 20 % of the failures have a variety of causes , including tampering , hacking , and working around product activation .
Across the more than 300 million validations , only a small percentage of validation failures were found to be in error . "
When you start at 300 million and go up , even a small error rate means a lot of customers .
The average Joe can tough it out and , perhaps , forget about it .
But if the MCPs in the trenches can't figure out which activation key will work this time and CIOs start seeing the total cost of ownership start to creep up , you can expect Microsoft reps to get an earful over activation .

On Friday 's " Countdown " Keith talks to the founder of Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America , Paul Rieckhoff , about the latest developments surrounding the death of Pat Tillman .
We 've known many of these facts , but there 's something about actually seeing the gory details that adds a whole new level of sadness and outrage to this national tragedy .
Ah , but the fun does n't stop with Pat Tillman .
Rieckhoff points out that during his press conference on Friday , President Bush channeled Geraldo by giving out sensitive information about the locations of American military posts around Baghdad .

" One of the things that did happen today that concerned me was that during Bush 's press conference he actually showed a graphic that showed 24 urban military outposts in downtown Baghdad .
I would argue that showing that to the world and potentially to our enemy might compromise moral - might actually compromise operational security . "
" Our enemies are n't stupid .
They can look at that and figure out a grid coordinate and try and drop mortars on those exact locations .
I mean , this is like a Geraldo moment during the invasion when Geraldo started drawing troop operation movements in the sand .
I mean , this is unprecedented in my experience and maybe I 'm missing something , but this is a real worry and I would n't go throwing this out on the airwaves for everybody to see if I were the President . "

Magazine When She Graduates as He There 's a battle brewing at the Seven Sisters over the growing population of transgender students .
The question at its core :
What kind of women 's college awards diplomas to men ?
Mt. Holyoke junior Kevin Murphy is one of a handful of transgender students changing the face -- and the soul , some say -- of elite women 's colleges .
Though born a girl , raised a girl , and now attending a womens college , Isaiah Bartlett didnt feel quite right being female .
Old pictures show a very feminine , rosy - cheeked Allison Bartlett with chin - length dark brown hair .
Yet every time her mother coaxed her into a dress for one of those photographs , Allisons skin would crawl and her mind would race with insecurities .
Even coming out as a butch lesbian in her freshman year at Mt. Holyoke College  and getting rid of those dresses for good  didnt seem to solve the problem .
Not long after Allison enrolled , in the fall of 2005 , she shaved most of her hair into a mohawk and picked up a few pairs of boxer shorts .
Soon she started binding her breasts with an Ace bandage every day before going out .
After a year of struggling in school and a semester off to sort out her emotions , the popular 20 - year - old psychology major returned to school and went to a talk by fellow student Kevin Murphy .
Then things began to make sense .
Allison realized that though she was a biological woman , she wanted nothing more than to be a man .
She adopted the name Isaiah .
 When I heard Kevins story , his talk about struggling with coming out as a lesbian , then realizing that he really wanted to be a man , I felt as if he was telling bits of my own story ,  Bartlett says one October afternoon in his room in Mt. Holyokes Buckland Hall dormitory , just before a friend comes barreling up in a robe and a green face mask to offer a quick hug and some dish .
 Soon after , I came out as a transman .

This is the latest subculture to emerge at the elite womens colleges in the Northeast known as the Seven Sisters  young women , some still teenagers , who , like Bartlett , are exploring the possibility of growing up to be men .
And its creating a social upheaval at these historically all - female enclaves as they wrestle with what to do about all this gender bending .
The Seven Sisters colleges were founded in the 19th century , and famous graduates have ranged from anthropologist Margaret Mead ( Barnard ) to actresses Stockard Channing ( Radcliffe ) and Meryl Streep ( Vassar ) to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ( Wellesley ) .
Vassar started accepting male students in 1969 , and Radcliffe officially merged with Harvard College in 1999 , leaving just five sisters 
Mt. Holyoke , Bryn Mawr , Smith , Barnard , and Wellesley .
But the same empowerment and opportunity for self - discovery that an all - female school provides may also make survival as single - sex institutions that much harder for the remaining sisters .
After all , the real challenge that transmen are forcing womens colleges to face is an ideological one :
Is it still a womens college when some students who were female as freshmen are male by graduation day ?
The term transman is a relatively new one .
It originates from transgender ,  which generally describes people who feel that the gender they were born into is at odds with their true identity .
Coined in the late 1970s , transgender is now often used in place of transsexual ,  which describes a person who has had sex reassignment surgery or who lives as a member of the opposite sex .
Most transmen begin their transition with masculine dress , adopting the pronoun he ,  and taking on a male name .
After counseling , some transmen start taking the hormone testosterone , known in the community as  T ,  which deepens the voice , causes facial hair to grow , enlarges the clitoris , and reduces breast size .
If he decides to go further , a transman may undergo a double mastectomy , hysterectomy , and ovary removal .
The final frontier is penis construction surgery .
From a medical point of view , Isaiah Bartletts story reflects the classic traits of gender identity disorder as defined in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ,  the bible of the mental health professions .
At the same time , while no one knows exactly how common it is , advocates and many professionals who work with the trans population believe transgender people should be reclassified , because gender variation is normal across the human spectrum .
It does seem that most transmen start to feel male at a young age .
A study conducted two years ago by researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Pennsylvania State University asked transmen , transwomen , genderqueers   who consider themselves beyond or between genders  and people with other gender - diverse identities about their experiences .
Roughly 3,500 people responded to the survey , sent to transgender support groups throughout the country and to self - identified transgender individuals found online .
Of the 807 respondents who were female at birth but who now identify as male , transgender , or other ,  86 percent said they began to question their gender identities before age 12 , and all but 2 percent before 19 .
In addition , researchers believe that more young people than ever before are acting on those feelings .
 It used to be that transitioning was a midlife process , but the Internet has changed a lot ,  says Brett - Genny Janiczek Beemyn , one of the lead researchers in the UMass - Penn State study .
 With the click of a mouse , more and more young people can find others going through what they re going through and have a stronger sense of themselves at a younger age .
Beemyn , who also directs the UMass - Amherst Stonewall Center , an educational resource center for gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender students at the school , believes that in the coming years the number of young people who are out as transgender will only grow .
Advocates think that s a good thing :
A number of studies have found that the earlier an individual undergoes sex reassignment , beginning with hormones , the easier it is for that person to pass as someone of their transitioned gender , and that passing is key to a transitioned persons long - term happiness .
Though a successful transition can certainly be a liberating experience , the growing transman population at all - womens colleges has created some unique problems , too .
While both Mt. Holyoke , in South Hadley , and its rival school , Smith College in Northampton , cultivate what transgender students say is an open and accepting environment that allows them to find their true selves  including their gender identities  there are new rivalries developing .
 No parent is surprised anymore when their daughter goes to an all - womens college and then comes out as a lesbian ,  says Kevin Murphy , the 21 - year - old junior whose talk inspired Isaiah Bartlett .
 But once you get into this , within the community , theres a lot of competition .
Who goes on T first .
Who is taking more T . Who gets top surgery first .
Sitting in a dimly lit bar after playing a club hockey match against Smith  club teams arent covered by the NCAA regulations that ban college players from taking testosterone 
Murphy is practically indistinguishable from a very small , fairly handsome young man .
He has deep brown eyes and , having been on T for the past two years , an even deeper voice , as well as a beard that is filling in nicely .
A year ago , he used his own money to pay for a double mastectomy .
Today he strolls into the bar , flashes his ID , and sits down to a Corona without a hesitating glance from anyone , including the bartender , who might have noticed that Murphys drivers license still lists him as female  something he can legally change in Massachusetts , thanks to his surgery .
Yet for all his confidence , Murphy , who is majoring in psychology and religion , is still figuring things out .
 When I go out with my friends , Im the guy in the group , and when I go out with their boyfriends , I m the most feminine guy ,  he says .
 Im really trying to form friendships with biological men because I want to be accepted , and I was never allowed to when I was younger . 
Beginning in high school , when Murphy came out as gay , a fairly typical transgender progression followed : dressing in drag , adopting a male haircut , and breast - binding .
Kevin was still Caitlin when he enrolled at Mt. Holyoke in 2003 .
After about two years , Murphy decided to make the leap .
 I wanted to be a guy ,  he says .
So Caitlin started taking T , legally changed her name , and began looking for surgeons .
Murphy insists he will never regret his decision to become male , though the process hasnt been entirely easy .
 I cried the day after I woke up and found my breasts gone ,  he says .
 With each stage , I feel like Ive been losing my lesbian identity , and that s hard to give up . 
Therapists , doctors , and college administrators are concerned about students who decide to transition based on what sometimes seems to be shaky logic : growing pains such as insecurity or peer pressure , childhood trauma , depression , or even just the need to rebel .
They tend to be cautious about their clients  transitions , but many counselors ultimately feel that even young adults should be able to make their own decisions .
 Of course , any compassionate therapist might be concerned about a young person making such a permanent decision .
 What if this person could make a mistake ?
What if I make the wrong decision in giving the OK for this person to transition ?   says Arlene Istar Lev , a family therapist and adjunct professor of social welfare at the State University of New York at Albany who specializes in transgender issues .
 But heres the catch :
We know that a certain percentage of the population is transgender , and we know the research on transitioning and age .
At this point , we have no evidence of any young people regretting these decisions .
And the other thing :
We all have to live with decisions .
Young people drop out of high school , even when counselors say ,  Dont do that . 
People get pregnant and have babies or get abortions .
All you can do is give the best assessment at the time . 
A Smith School of Social Work student , Shannon Sennott , has started a nonprofit called Translate , to provide training and seminars for womens colleges .
Sennott believes that the schools should offer hormone counseling and advocacy as transgender students make crucial decisions about their lives .
 Any person that age needs direction , and my concern is that they re not receiving it ,  Sennott says .
 Someone needs to say ,  OK , you want to be a transman , let s discuss these options .
Or , OK , you want to remain genderqueer and use female pronouns the rest of your life , that s just great , too .  
It s not that there arent any resources for students .
At Mt. Holyoke , theres True Colors , a student organization that runs a community center ; the group arranges movie nights , mixers , and panel discussions and seminars for lesbian , bisexual , and transgender students on subjects such as coming out as transgender at work .
There is also a designated adviser for transgender students on campus , an associate director of residential life who is a gay man .
At Smith , similar services and groups are available .
But at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania , the transgender community remains so nascent , there are few resources .
 There are 1,300 [ undergrad ] students here .
It s a tiny population  I know all of the trans students ,  says Lindsay Gold , 21 , who guesses that the campuss transman population is between six and 12 students .
The would - be senior majoring in computer science left school in December because she wasnt feeling in the academic spirit ,  she says .
Gold is now living in an apartment near campus and trying to sort out two big hurdles : finishing college and being transgender .
 Everyone is accepting , but there are no resources .
People come to me asking where they can go to get help .
In an e-mail , assistant dean Christopher MacDonald - Dennis writes :  This is an issue we are only now beginning to talk about .
. . .
We realize that our other sisters have been dealing with this , so we are looking to them to help us be as supportive as we can .  the trans population at smith has seen the most public attention , and probably the most public debate , too .
Former student Lucas Cheadle helped bring widespread attention to the issue by being profiled , along with three other transgender students , in a multipart documentary called TransGeneration that aired on the Sundance Channel in 2005 .
Before that , it was a major victory for trans activists on Smiths campus when , in 2003 , all references to she and her in the student constitution were changed to  the student . 
Students say another fight over the pronouns used in the constitution looks to be rekindled in the coming year , and every so often , members of the trans - friendly and not - so - trans - friendly communities exchange heated words on the public website smith.dailyjolt.com .
A recent anonymous posting about an annual event formerly known as Celebration of Sisterhood , renamed Celebration in 2003  though there is debate as to why  reads :  Yeah , God forbid anyone include the word  sisterhood  . . . because a handful of trans students somehow feel oppressed , despite the fact that they chose to attend a womens college . 
The reply :  Let the transphobia debate begin again . 
One first - year student who didnt want her name , major , or hometown used for fear her views would provoke hostility from fellow students , says she has witnessed conflict offline , too .
 Ive heard some of the most liberal people  feminists and even gays and lesbians  say adverse things toward trans students at Smith ,  she e-mails .
 One of my friends , who is a lesbian also , expresses anger toward trans - identified students because she thinks they are giving up their womanhood .
Although I do not agree with these opinions , I can see where they come from . 
Another camp worries that as the school makes room for transgender students , it will be forced to start accepting transmen who began their transition in high school and biological males making the transition to female .
Or worse yet , it might , they say , become coed .
 Taking T and planning to transition doesnt go with the mission of Smith College ,  writes Nicole , a junior who doesnt want to share her last name or her major because she thinks her views will be thought politically incorrect .
A member of Smiths Republican Club and editor - in - chief of its conservative newspaper , junior Samantha Lewis , 20 , doesnt mind speaking on the record .
 I think its ironic that there are Smithies who do not want to be women , and , to be completely honest , it seems to me that it defeats the purpose of being at a womens college . 
While Nicole guesses that the trans population at Smith is 30 out of about 2,500 undergraduates , Lewis thinks that the number is at least twice as big .
 The first person I met on campus was a man ,  Lewis says .
 He said ,  Hi , Im Ethan , and I use male pronouns .  
The administration paints the conflicts as healthy , lively , debate .
 Questions about what it means to be a woman or a feminist are not new to the college discourse , whether at Smith or many other leading institutions ,  writes Maureen Mahoney , the college dean , in an e-mail .
She adds that Smith recently opened a Center for Sexuality and Gender as a student resource and for years has allowed students to request the name they desire on their diplomas .
 For the most part , these are issues of diversity , and diversity has clear educational benefits .
As one of our student leaders noted in an address to her peers , what she learned at Smith is , great minds dont think alike . 
No , clearly , they dont .
 The students here try very hard to be accepting of almost anything , and its really difficult for us to say ,  Hey , you dont really belong here ,   says Nicole .
 It s not a matter of discrimination or approval , its a question of that persons goals and the overall goals of the university .
I personally dont think trying to pass as a man and having Smith College on your diploma gives you the chance to have a stable career .
And there are those of us who are investing in Smith , and in 40 years , we want Smith to be greater as a womens college than it is now . 
Meanwhile , back at Mt. Holyoke , Isaiah Bartlett remains in gender limbo .
 Although my decision to have surgery is nt dependent on my parents  approval , more of a support system from them would help a lot ,  he says .
As far as starting testosterone , Bartlett thinks about it , but ultimately demurs .
 Im not ready to make that kind of a decision yet . 
But at Bryn Mawr , Lindsay Gold cant wait to begin to transition and started seeing a gender therapist last month .
 I feel like other transmen accept or validate you based on where you stand in your transition ,  Gold says .
 I dont want to be sneered at for still having a womans body . 

President Ahmadinejad 's contention during a speech at Columbia University that there are no homosexuals in Iran drew a swift rebuke from human rights organizations , with one activist challenging the president to explain how he , a gay Iranian , exists .
Taking questions from Columbia faculty and students who attended his address yesterday , Mr. Ahmadinejad answered a query about the treatment of gays in Iran by saying : " We do n't have homosexuals like in your country .
We do n't have that in our country .
We do n't have this phenomenon ; I do n't know who 's told you we have it . "
The executive director of the Toronto - based Iranian Queer Organization , Arsham Parsi , had a question for the president yesterday .
" Who am I ?
Who am I , if we do n't have any queers in Iran ? "
Mr. Parsi said , noting that in 2005 he had had to flee Iran to escape arrest .
A spokesman for the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission , Hossein Alizadeh , said that , in Iran , there is a " constant fear of execution and persecution and also social stigma associated with homosexuality . "
Mr. Alizadeh , who said he is gay and moved to America from Tehran in 2000 , added that the commission , which is based in New York , has documented numerous cases of gay persecution , including executions , in Iran .
It is difficult to know for certain the number of Iranians executed because they are gay , as the government refuses to disclose the real reasons that lead to arrests , he said .
The director of the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch , Scott Long , said Iranians arrested on suspicion of being gay are routinely tortured .
Mr. Alizadeh , who said he was not openly gay in Iran , said there are many cases of Iranians in America and other countries who are seeking asylum because of their sexual orientation , noting that he himself was granted asylum on that basis .
Backed by the White House , corn-state governors and solid blocks on both sides of Congress ’s partisan divide , the politics of biofuels could hardly look sunnier .
The economics of the American drive to increase ethanol in the energy supply are more discouraging .
American corn - based ethanol is expensive .
And while it can help cut oil imports and provide modest reductions in greenhouse gases compared to conventional gasoline , corn ethanol also carries considerable risks .
Even now as Europe and China join the United States in ramping up production , world food prices are rising , threatening misery for the poorest countries .
The European Union has announced that it wants to replace 10 percent of its transport fuel with biofuels by 2020 .
China is aiming for a 15 percent share .
The United States is already on track to exceed Congress ’s 2005 goal of doubling the amount of ethanol used in motor fuels to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012 .
In his State of the Union speech in January , President Bush set a new goal of 35 billion gallons of biofuels by 2017 .
In June , the Senate raised it to 36 billion gallons by 2022 .
Of that , Congress said that 15 billion gallons should come from corn and 21 billion from advanced biofuels that are nowhere near commercial production .
The distortions in agricultural production are startling .
Corn prices are up about 50 percent from last year , while soybean prices are projected to rise up to 30 percent in the coming year , as farmers have replaced soy with corn in their fields .
The increasing cost of animal feed is raising the prices of dairy and poultry products .
Days after Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei made his most recent " confidential " report to the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the Cheney Cabal sycophantic editorialists at the Washington Post charged ElBaradei with being a " Rogue Regulator , " behaving as if he was " free to ignore " the Board , using his IAEA Secretariat to " thwart " the will of leading members of the IAEA " above all , the United States . "
Well , obviously these rogue editorialists havent read or dont comprehend ( a ) the IAEA Statute or ( b ) Chapter VII of the UN Charter or ( c ) the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or ( d ) the Iranian Safeguards Agreement or ( e ) any of the recent IAEA Board of Governors resolutions dealing with Iran or ( f ) the recent Security Council resolutions dealing with Iran or ( g ) any of ElBaradeis recent reports to the IAEA Board .
The IAEA  whose General Conference currently comprises 144 member - states  has as its primary mission the facilitation throughout the world of the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes .
The IAEA Board of Governors has the authority to carry out the functions IAEA in accordance with the IAEA Statue , subject to its responsibilities to the General Conference .
The IAEA may conclude one or more legally binding Safeguards Agreement with a nation - state , wherein IAEA " inspectors " are authorized access " at all times to all places and data and to any person as necessary to account for source and special fissionable materials " subject to the Safeguards Agreement , for the exclusive purpose of determining " whether there is compliance with the undertaking against use in furtherance of any military purpose . "
On May 15 , 1974 , Iran entered into such an agreement with the IAEA  to remain in force as long as Iran remained a party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  wherein all Iranian “ source or special fissionable materials ” and activities involving them were to be made subject to IAEA Safeguards “ with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful purposes . ”
ElBaradeis most recent report has once again verified to the Board , to the IAEA General Conference , to all NPT - signatories and to the Security Council " the non-diversion of the declared nuclear materials " by Iran .
That s wonderful !
Even though the United States egregiously fails to honor its legally binding commitments made pursuant to the NPT and IAEA Statue , as best ElBaradei can determine , Iran continues to honor its commitments .
So why are Cheney Cabal media sycophants so upset ?
Well , on February 4 , 2006 , under extreme pressure by the United States , the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an outrageous resolution in which it concluded that for “ confidence ” to be built “ in the exclusively peaceful nature of Irans nuclear program ” it was “ deemed necessary ” for Iran to , inter alia ;
" implement transparency measures , as requested by the Director General , including in GOV / 2005 / 67 , which extend beyond the formal requirements of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol , and include such access to individuals , documentation relating to procurement , dual use equipment , certain military - owned workshops and research and development as the Agency may request in support of its ongoing investigations . "
Did you get that ?
The IAEA Board deems it necessary for ElBaradei to satisfy himself of the exclusively peaceful nature of Irans nuclear program , past and present .
And the UN Security Council subsequently agreed , applying sanctions on Iran until such time as ElBaradei so satisfies himself .
So , if Iran doesnt ( a ) suspend indefinitely its uranium - enrichment activities , ( b ) ratify the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement , or ( c ) cancel the construction of a heavy - water moderated reactor at Arak , as far as the IAEA Board and Security Council resolutions are concerned , it doesnt matter so long as ElBaradei so satisfies himself !
Far from being a " Rogue Regulator , " behaving as if he was free to ignore the IAEA Board and the Security Council , ElBaradei has just done what he was told to do , concluding an agreement with the Iranians which he believes  if implemented  will satisfy him whether or not Iran intends to build nuclear weapons .
" For the first time , we have agreed , with the Iranians , to a sort of roadmap , a schedule , if you will , for clarifying the outstanding issues .
We should know by November , or December at the latest , whether the Iranians will keep their promises .
If they do n’t , Tehran will have missed a great opportunity  possibly the last one . "
But members of the Cheney Cabal  in and out of government  have charged that Irans roadmap agreement with ElBaradei is " a transparent attempt to distract from its true intentions and from its continued development of the capabilities to produce a nuclear weapon . "
" Obviously we are all pushing for the same strategic goal : That Iran should not get nuclear weapons .
" We consistently searched for evidence that Iran intends to build nuclear weapons .
We found suspicious signs , but no smoking gun .
We could now make some progress in setting aside these suspicions by thoroughly inspecting the Iranian facilities and learning details about their history .
" We expect information about the scope and nature of its uranium enrichment program and its statements about certain suspicious studies we have .
" The most decisive element in our assessment will be whether Iran cooperates with us completely and actively . "
Now , it needs to be emphasized that Iran is under no obligation to comply with ElBaradeis requests " which extend beyond the formal requirements of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol , and include such access to individuals , [ and ] documentation relating to procurement , dual use equipment , certain military - owned workshops and research and development . "
But , Iran has agreed to try to satisfy ElBaradei , issue by issue .
According to ElBaradeis latest report , some of the issues have already been decided to his satisfaction , for example Irans explanation for its experiments with plutonium .
But ,
" I am not [ yet ] willing to state definitively whether Iran is following up its promises with actions .
I just do n’t want to lose the opportunity to find out for myself .
The UN sanctions against Tehran will remain in place in the interim .
" It ’s important to exert pressure .
But in addition to sanctions we must also have incentives to encourage Iran to take a new direction .
Yes , that ’s my opinion .
If someone comes to me and says , I want to work with you now , then I have to examine his offer to make sure it has substance .
We must see all the documents , be able to talk to anyone and have unfettered access to all facilities .
" We are talking about two or three months .
Then we ’ll know more . "
Stay tuned .
White House : Fake FEMA news conference wo n't happen again David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This White House Press Secretary Dana Perino assured reporters today that the staged news conference organized on Tuesday by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) would not happen again , and said the White House would never employ such tactics at its own press briefings .
" It is not a practice that we would employ here at the White House or that we -- we certainly do n't condone it , " said Perino .
According to a report in the Washington Post , FEMA had instructed its own public relations staff to pose as reporters when no legitimate members of the media arrived in time for a hastily arranged briefing about the California wildfires .
" We had been getting mobbed with phone calls from reporters , and this was thrown together at the last minute , " a FEMA deputy director of public affairs told the Post .
" We pulled questions from those we had been getting from reporters earlier in the day . "
Perino said FEMA alone was responsible for the decision to go ahead with the event .
" FEMA has issued an apology , saying that they had an error in judgment when they were attempting to get out a lot of information to reporters , who were asking for answers to a variety of questions in regard to the wildfires in California , " she said .
" It 's not something I would have condoned .
And they , I 'm sure , will not do it again . "
FEMA Deputy Administrator Harvey Johnson , who fielded questions from the stand - in " reporters , " issued a statement today claiming an " error in judgment . "
" Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received , " he said .
" We are reviewing our press procedures and will make the changes necessary to ensure that all of our communications are straight forward and transparent . "
Among the questions Johnson answered from FEMA employees was a query about the agency 's performance during the fires : " I 'm very happy with FEMA 's response so far , " Johnson told his fellow FEMA employee .
" This is a FEMA and a federal government that 's leaning forward , not waiting to react .
And you have to be pretty pleased to see that . "
A full list of questions asked during the briefing is available at MSNBC's First Read .
The following video is from MSNBC's News Live , broadcast on October 26 , 2007 .

Some of the homeowners would claim that drywall screws are far better than nails , and even some experts would agree to this .
This is due to the screws ’ ability to hold even stronger and more secure than the nails .
However , the battle is far from over when you see things from a different angle and acknowledge the several advantages that using nail provides to you .
The drywall repair in Washington DC and most probably in other areas will offer you different ways of how would you like your drywall to be put .
Here are a few important things to think about when choosing between screws and nails during drywall installation .
Screws Vs. Nails
There are two advantages of nails , and these are what give them the edge .
Firstly , nails are way cheaper than screws .
Although the price is also dependent on the size , brand , and quality , screws are expensive regardless of these factors mainly because of their highly - specialized structure and form .
This is also affected by the tools needed to effectively put in the screws .
Nails only need a hammer while screws need a screw gun .
Secondly , nails are easy to put manually since it may only need a hammer , while you need to screw and move the screwdriver in a counterclockwise motion .
This method can be a little bit tedious .
However , both are convenient when you have the necessary mechanical tools like a nail and / or a screw gun .
There is no more need for manual labor , although both tools imply more expenses .
You also need to consider the fact that when installed properly , both offer secure hold of your drywall .
Lengths
When it comes to the proper size of the nails or screws , it is important to note that you need at least 1 1/ 4 inches long screws or nails in a 1/2 inch drywall .
When you opt for nails , make sure that you choose those that can securely attach your drywall with less chance of popping .
Putting Them in Securely
Again , both drywall ’s screws and nails can offer secured hold .
However , this is dependent on several factors like the quality of the materials as well as the methods and tools used for pounding or securing .
Generally , screws offer a stronger hold as it attached themselves on the wall due to its structure that provides friction inside the wall and hold the drywall ’s fibers securely .
On the flip side of the coin , nails can be as secure as screws provided that you choose the right nails for the walls , which features contain a frictive surface that holds the drywall more strongly .
Which is Better ?
Depending on what is more important for you like cost , labor , and hold , both can be advantageous for drywall .
Nails are cheaper but they can also be a bit expensive when you choose those that are specialized for a stronger hold , while screws can be cheaper too provided that you will need to take extra manual labor to avoid the costs of the screw gun .
It is important to consider different factors before you decide on things .
Also , make sure that you consult professionals for advice .

His outspoken remarks , which drew a parallel between Iran and Iraq , appeared to take aim at the US and Britain .
They followed comments on Sunday night by the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , who said : " We have to prepare for the worst , " adding " the worst is war " .
" I would not talk about any use of force , " Mohamed ElBaradei told reporters at the International Atomic Energy Agency headquarters in Vienna .
" There are rules on how to use force , and I would hope that everybody would have gotten the lesson after the Iraq situation , where 700,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons . "
There has been a string of reports out of Washington that the Bush administration is running out of patience with diplomacy and is intensifying its plans for air strikes as a means of halting Iran 's disputed nuclear programme .
UN officials said Mr ElBaradei , an Egyptian diplomat who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2005 , was attempting to slow down what seemed to be an accelerating march to war .
" There 's a strategic reason for doing these things , " one official said .
" He really is alarmed .
He sees this thing going out of control .
The feeling around here is that this looks like the run-up to the Iraq war . "
Last month , the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , sparked a heated political debate in Paris when he called the Iranian stand - off " the greatest crisis " of current times , saying the world had " a catastrophic alternative : an Iranian bomb or the bombing of Iran " .
Following Mr Kouchner 's comments , Tehran yesterday denounced France 's stance on the nuclear issue , which has toughened since Mr Sarkozy 's election in May .
Iran 's state - owned news agency IRNA published an editorial accusing Paris of " extremism " and pandering to Washington .
" The new occupants of the Elysée want to copy the White House , " it said , accusing Mr Sarkozy of taking on " an American skin " .
Iran insists on its right to run a comprehensive nuclear programme , including the enrichment of uranium , which it says is intended for peaceful electricity generation .
The US has called a meeting of senior European and Russian officials in Washington on Friday to discuss the deepening crisis over Iran .
Britain , the US and France are likely to push for more sanctions over Iranian defiance , while Russia and China are expected to resist , pointing to a deal Mr ElBaradei struck with the Iranian government last month , in which Tehran agreed to answer unresolved questions over its nuclear programme .
The US , Britain , France and Germany complained to Mr ElBaradei that they had not been consulted and that the agreement did not mention the UN Security Council 's demand that Iran suspend uranium enrichment while its programme is assessed .
In their eyes , the deal gave Tehran a means of stalling new sanctions while continuing to produce nuclear fuel .
France is determined that if the UN is unable to agree on a new round of sanctions against Iran , the European Union should impose its own .
Mr Kouchner said leading French companies such as Total and Renault had been urged not to sign new contracts with Iran , and he flew to Moscow to try to persuade Russia to accept a toughening of the embargo .
Meanwhile , the French prime minister , François Fillon , yesterday tried to play down the talk of war , saying that everything must be done to avoid a conflict , but he added that Mr Kouchner was right to stress the danger and seriousness of the Iranian stand - off .
A British official said yesterday that when the French foreign minister had raised the spectre of a conflict , he was " stating the obvious " .
" The worst case scenario is a war with Iran , but meanwhile we are seeking a diplomatic solution , " the official said .
The French Socialist leader François Hollande yesterday called for an immediate parliamentary debate on Iran , demanding to know if the government had new intelligence on Iran 's nuclear intentions .
After talks with Mr Kouchner in Paris yesterday , the Dutch foreign minister Maxime Verhagen said the Netherlands would support EU sanctions if the UN Security Council failed to agree new measures .
Mr ElBaradei , the director general of the IAEA , has been increasingly at odds with Washington and London , who believe he is straying beyond his job description and freelancing as an independent statesman .
Japan has recently expanded its whaling programme
A UK conservation group said last week that Japan 's research programme was landing so many whales , unwanted meat was being turned into dog food .
But the Institute of Cetacean Research ( ICR ) in Tokyo said less than 100kg of a species not covered by a global ban was sold to a pet food manufacturer .
The ICR said Japan does not have a glut of whale meat .
In a statement issued on Thursday , the ICR 's director general criticised claims made by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) and the media 's reporting of them .
" This is an indictment on western media who do not question the information they receive on whaling and instead further reinforce falsehoods and wrong assumptions , " said Dr Hiroshi Hatanaka .
The angry response follows widespread coverage of WDCS findings that surplus whale meat was ending up as pet food .
At the time , Mark Simmonds , director of science at WDCS , said : " We have heard many arguments from Japan over the years about why whaling is necessary to them , but they have never stated that they needed to kill whales to feed their dogs . "
Dr Hatanaka said the meat in question was less than 100kg of small intestine from Baird 's beaked whale , a creature not regulated by the global ban , or part of the ICR 's research programme .
" To suggest that fine cuts of whale meat from Japan 's research programmes are being turned into pet food because Japan has a glut of it is not true . "
A global moratorium on commercial hunting of " great whales " , including the blue , sei and Bryde's , has been in place since the 1980s .
But hunting them for " scientific research " is permitted under the rules of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) .
The hunting is condemned by most conservation groups on the grounds that it is inhumane , unnecessary and may harm fragile populations .
In addition , IWC regulations cover a minority of cetacean species , and the Baird 's beaked whale is one which Japan maintains is outside its remit .
Hunting for science
Where great whales are concerned , Japan and Iceland run scientific programmes hunting predominantly minkes , while Norway lodged a formal objection to the moratorium and maintains an openly commercial operation .
A number of indigenous peoples are also allowed to hunt under tight restrictions .
The sheer volume of Japan 's operations has made it the principal target for the wrath of conservation groups .
It latest scientific programme , JARPA - 2 , will remove 935 minkes and 10 fin whales each year ; while its other programme JARPN takes 100 sei whales , 100 minkes , 50 Bryde 's whales and five sperm whales annually from the north Pacific .
The IWC obliges countries practising scientific whaling to process what they catch , and the meat from Japan 's programmes has always found its way into restaurants .
Last year , it initiated a scheme to distribute whale meat to schools , and a fast - food chain began selling whale burgers .
The WDCS says demand from Japan 's human population is running some way behind the recently expanded supply .
The conservation group quotes research showing that the price of meat from Bryde 's whales has halved over the last five years , with other species falling as well .

" With the new proposal , Japan will increase its annual take ... to levels approaching the annual commercial quotas for Antarctic minke whales that were in place prior to the moratorium , " they declared .
In January a group of 17 countries , including the UK , mounted a formal diplomatic protest .
" The UK is totally opposed to any activity that undermines the present moratorium on commercial whaling , " said Britain 's fisheries minister Ben Bradshaw at the time .
" We urge Japan to reconsider its position and end this unjustified and unnecessary slaughter which is regarded by many countries and their public as a means to bypass the IWC moratorium . "
Japan maintains that hunting is part of its cultural heritage , which other nations have no right to condemn .
( CNN ) -- Sara Hammon saw some of her sisters pulled out of school to be married to men they did n't know .
She dreaded a similar fate .
And so , she ran away from home before she was old enough to drive legally .
Sara Hammon says the prospect of an arranged marriage was " like marching to the guillotine . "
She left behind 19 mothers , 74 siblings , and a father she says could never remember her name , even though he repeatedly molested her .
And , she left behind a culture she says was oppressive for young women .
Hammon recently gave CNN a deeply disturbing account of her life inside the polygamous sect whose leader , Warren Jeffs , goes on trial this week in Utah .
Jeffs is accused of being an accomplice to rape .
The charge stems from his alleged practice of arranging polygamous marriages between child brides and older male followers .
Hammon is not directly involved in the charges against Jeffs , which concern an arranged marriage between a girl , 14 and her 19 - year - old cousin .
She left the sect before she could be placed in an arranged marriage .
But she is one of its most outspoken former members .
Watch Hammon describe her escape from a closed world »
" Probably the worst part of the whole theology , " she said , " is the treatment of women and teaching women that they are not equal to men . "
" They have to have a husband in order to get to the highest degree of heaven , and not only a husband but they have to allow the husband to have two other wives , " she added .
Hammon was born in Hilldale , Utah , and raised in Colorado City , Arizona , towns where followers of Jeffs -- the President and Prophet , Seer and Revelator of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) -- freely practice polygamy .
Hear the words of the prophet »
The FLDS broke more than a century ago from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , based in Salt Lake City , Utah , over the practice of polygamy .
The Mormon church , which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago , has renounced Jeffs ' group .
Hammon was the first 14 - year - old girl to successfully leave the FLDS , she said .
Almost 20 years later , she recalls the time she spent inside the compound as being filled with fear .
She speaks out as part of her work with The Hope Organization , a non-profit group based in St. George , Utah , that assists victims of abusive polygamous relationships .
" There was a tremendous amount of abuse in our home , " Hammon said .
" It happened on a daily basis and there was all kinds : sexual , physical , emotional , mental .
My brothers were sexually abusive .
Some of my mothers were physically abusive . "
But it was her father -- an FLDS church leader -- who terrified her .
He began sexually abusing her before she turned 5 , Hammon said .
He even tried to molest her on his deathbed when she was 13 , she said .
" For me , he was a very mean person .
I did n't know him while we lived in the same house for 13 years and he had to ask me my name every time he saw me .
" In fact , the question he would ask is , ' What is your name and who is your mother ? ' and that was the only way he could identify that I was his child , " Hammon said .
Three of her older sisters were placed in marriages before they finished high school , including one who was 16 when she married a 62 - year - old man , Hammon said .
She recalled that one sister had two days notice before her wedding .
Hammon said girls in the compound were prepared for a similar destiny all their lives , but she knew from a young age she did n't want any part of it .
" It was like marching to the guillotine because I saw pictures of my mother before she got married and she was just so confident .
" Her posture was just excellent and she had a beautiful face and smile ... and then I watched her deteriorate after she got married and I watched her go through so much emotional pain and that was what I felt was in store for me if I got married , " she said .
Hammon described her father 's wives as second - class citizens in the household who became shells of themselves the moment he came into the room .
She called it mind control .
Her mother had more than two dozen nervous breakdowns , she said .
" I do n't know how a woman can allow another woman to come into her home and cook some supper up with the family for her and go to bed with her husband that night and respect herself .
" I do n't see how that is possible .
You have to let a part of yourself go .
A part of something in you , you have to squash that down in order to live with that every day , " she said .
It was a fate Hammon escaped with the help of a family she 'd been babysitting for outside the compound .
About a year after her father died , she asked them if she could stay and they agreed .
Hammon says her mother did n't believe she could stop her .
Almost two decades later , the memories of her childhood haunt her .
Hammon said she does n't date much .
" I watched my mom just die emotionally and I relate that to marriage , " she said .
Still , she does n't entirely blame Jeffs for what she went through inside the FLDS community .
" I think that Warren Jeffs is the fall guy for something that has been going on for generations , " Hammon said .
" Warren Jeffs is just a person to focus on .
This system is a well - oiled machine , there 's always going to be somebody to step up and take his place .
What he has done is terrible ... but I know a lot of other men who were out there and in charge who did some pretty terrible things too .
Nobody was paying attention then , " she said .
Jeffs was captured August 28 , 2006 , in a traffic stop near Las Vegas , Nevada .
At the time , he had been on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted List for months .

1943 : The Battle of Kursk begins .
It features the largest tank engagement in history and is , in purely military terms , the most decisive battle of the European war .
After Kursk , the defeat of Nazi Germany is certain .
Following their catastrophic defeat at Stalingrad five months earlier , the Germans lacked the strength to attack along the entire Eastern Front .
The high command chose to focus on a salient near Kursk , where there was an opportunity to encircle and destroy a dozen Soviet armies .
Following the elimination of that pocket , the Germans would strike at Moscow .
The operation , about which even Hitler expressed misgivings , was given the code name Zitadelle .
The Germans prepared deliberately for this attack , committing nearly a million men , 2,700 tanks and 2,000 aircraft .
They would be facing a Russian force of 1.3 million , backed by 3,600 tanks , 2,400 planes and more than 20,000 artillery pieces .
The battle that unfolded around Kursk was the apogee of tank warfare .
The Russians were equipped with probably the war 's most consistently efficient tank , the T - 34 , which had given the Germans a nasty shock early in the eastern campaign .
The Germans also possessed some excellent tanks – on paper at least – particularly the Panther , which had been designed specifically to take on the T - 34 .
The heavy Tiger I also fought at Kursk , although the bulk of the German armor was composed of up - gunned Panzer IIIs and IVs .
The decisive engagement was fought at Prokhorovka on July 12 , with German and Russian tanks blasting away at each other from point - blank range .
Although the Russians suffered considerably heavier losses , overall German strength was ebbing fast .
With the Allied invasion of Sicily on July 11 and a new Soviet offensive beginning in the north , Hitler called off Zitadelle on July 13 .
Kursk was where the operational initiative on the Eastern Front passed to the Red Army .
No longer able to dictate the course of the war to an enemy that was only growing in strength , and with its own dwindling forces being siphoned off to meet threats in other theaters , Germany 's fate was sealed .

For those paying any attention , the recent Republican presidential candidate debate in New Hampshire was an eye - opener .
No , there were no surprise announcements or gaffs from the so - called front - runners .
Romney , Giuliani , and McCain came off predictable and scripted in their replies to questions ; yawn , yawn .
The real fireworks , instead , came from 10 - term congressman Ron Paul who showed up to debate , yes actually debate , U.S. foreign policy .
Unlike the other Republican candidates for president , Paul has always opposed the U.S. war in Iraq .
He voted against the war resolution in 2002 ; he opposes the " surge " and would withdraw ALL U.S. troops immediately from the Arabian peninsula .
The other candidates giggled as Representative Paul explained his non-interventionist positions to debate moderator Chris Wallace .
Given the frequent audience cheers to Paul ’s arguments , however , they had best stop giggling and listen up .
The mainstream media has pretty much decided that the " Republican " position on the war is identical to the Bush administration ’s position : Iraq is a part of the war on terror and the U.S. military must " win " so that Iraq ’s various factions can establish a viable democracy .
Now that ’s a real cute story , and perhaps all of the Republican big - whigs really believe it ; but in my judgment it is emphatically NOT what many rank and file conservative Republicans believe at all .
Indeed , my guess is that many rank and file conservatives believe that nation - building is not an appropriate activity for our government and military , that " democracy " there is an impossibility , and that the U.S. occupation in Iraq is a tragic mistake and not worth one more American life .
We need some history here .
The Eisenhower / Goldwater / Reagan school of Republican conservatism held that individual liberty was the highest political goal and that the federal government was generally inept at managing the economic and social affairs of society .
This is why old fashioned conservatives believed in free enterprise , tax cuts , balanced budgets , and school vouchers , and why they were skeptical about government regulation and interventionism , including and especially foreign military interventionism .
Even George W. Bush ran in 2000 on a basically conservative platform but he abandoned the bulk of that platform when the looney neo-conservatives hijacked U.S. foreign policy .
Both Eisenhower and Reagan may have carried a big " stick " but they never fired many shots , never started a foreign war and never attempted to invade and " nation build " an occupied Arab country .
Indeed , both were extremely leery of any Middle East military adventure involving U.S. combat troops .
When push came to shove in places such as Suez or Beirut , both U.S. Presidents decided ( correctly ) that a direct long - run military confrontation was ill - advised .
After all , protracted wars meant higher taxes , mountains of red-ink federal debt , and a larger " military industrial complex " and these results were impossible to square with basic conservative principles and a minimalist reading of the Constitution .
Ron Paul ’s chances of becoming President are thin ; nonetheless , his candidacy of ideas is a stark reminder that to be a conservative Republican is not necessarily to be " pro-war . "
As our heavily mortgaged economy slides into recession and as the quagmire in Iraq continues , Paul ’s " peace and freedom " libertarian supporters may well provide the crucial swing vote in the presidential election of 2008 .

By killing Che Guevara , the Bolivian army and its American advisers have done more than cut short the guerrilla movement in Bolivia .
Certainly the small surviving band of Bolivian guerrillas , who have lost their local leaders as well as Guevara , will not now be able to carry out their hopes of bringing the “ armed struggle ” from the countryside into the towns and mining areas .
But Guevara 's death will also wreck his grander strategy of using Bolivia as the focus from which rebel activity would radiate across the South American continent .
He had seen Bolivia as the first of the “ many Vietnams ” that would sap the morale of the United States in Latin America , and would destroy those regimes which he considered as Washington 's pawns .
A group of Bolivian rangers ( the anti-guerrilla forces ) caught up with the guerrillas on Sunday .
There seems no doubt that the man whom they killed and whose body they afterwards displayed to journalists , intelligence agents and others , is the elusive Dr Guevara , the presiding genius of the Latin American guerrilla movement .
His death is a considerable coup for the Bolivian army , which used to have the reputation of being one of the most inefficient in Latin America .
It reflects on the skill and thoroughness of the American anti-guerrilla school in the Panama Canal Zone which has in the past few years perfected its methods of instructing Latin American armies in its techniques .
Many Latin Americans will go on believing the legends that will be spun round his Pimpernel existence
This blow at the guerrilla movement in Bolivia follows on its destruction in Peru and its near - destruction in Colombia and Venezuela .
It is a major strategic reverse for the “ armed struggle . ”
But there are signs that what may happen now is that the focus of guerrilla activity will move from South America to Central America and the Caribbean .
In Matagalpa province in Nicaragua insurgents have become increasingly active this year , while to the north , in Guatemala , the guerrillas , though hard pressed , are continuing to be quite a problem for the government .
In Haiti the guerrilla movement is gradually co-ordinating itself , while in the Dominican Republic Dr Juan Bosch 's party this month split itself into violent and non-violent factions .
Compared with the great South American dream , this is all small and fairly unimpressive fry for the guerrilla movement .
But it would still be premature to say that the death of Guevara means the death of armed insurgency in Latin America .
Che Guevara 's name is already being classed with that of the Liberator , Simon Bolivar .
Latin America 's marxist “ liberation ” has yet to look even likely , but Guevara has died with his reputation intact .
From his middle - class Argentinian youth , he became a revolutionary by conviction and profession .
With the two Castro brothers he invaded Cuba in the cockleshell Granma , stayed on to help run revolutionary Cuba as minister of industry , then , perhaps growing bored , took his leave of Cuba on a dedicated secret mission to set the continent alight .
He failed .
But many Latin Americans will go on believing that the legends that will be spun round his Pimpernel existence may one day lead to his picture being hung beside that of the Liberator in Latin American halls .
Carl Lewis recently found an old but still interesting piece by Dennis Forbes about the tradeoffs of code reuse .
Lewis elaborated a bit on one of the more controversial concepts from Forbes ' blog entry : that contrary to conventional wisdom of code as an asset , code has very little value outside the immediate context of the organization that created the code in question .
Forbes goes on to assert that if the code asset has not been explicitly engineered for generality , code reuse even within the same organization is also problematic when reuse is attempted across projects .
Forbes attacks the tendency of many in - house dev teams to spend a lot of time building in - house frameworks and libraries intended for reuse across projects :
The greater the bulk of code you accumulate , the more intrinsically you tie yourself to your current developers ( and the more they occupy their brain with information that is only applicable in one organization or team ) , and the more difficult it will be to bring new developers online .
Such frameworks and libraries often come with enormous learning curves for new hires - especially as documentation is virtually always ignored - and they can seldom be reused for anything else without significant refactoring ( because they likely were n't truly designed for reuse , or they were in only the most arbitrary and superficial of ways …
… The question every organization needs to ask itself , then , is what value they could sell their " reusable code " for - what , realistically , would competitors and new entrants in the field offer for it ?
The answer , in almost every case , is $ 0 , and they would n't want it even at that price .
There is extraordinarily little code theft in this industry ( even though we 're in the era of burnable DVDs and USB keys ) because most code - above and beyond the industry - wide frameworks and libraries - has no value at all outside of a specific project with a specific group of developers .
Trying to use it for other projects is often worse than starting with nothing at all .
Forbes concludes that because properly abstracted and generalized frameworks are more expensive to design and develop than one - off solutions , and since the time and cost for a developer to absorb the complexity of a new framework is rarely taken into account when doing a code reuse cost benefit analysis , it makes sense to reuse code a lot less often than one would think .
It is notable that Forbes is not against reusing code and frameworks altogether ; he is much more positive about reusing code in industry standard libraries for instance .
In fact , Forbes advocates the adoption of broad industry - standard frameworks ( such as open source ) that by necessity have the proper abstraction and encapsulation boundaries built in as an alternative to complex internally developed frameworks .
In Carl Lewis ' post on the subject he highlights Forbes ' $ 0 value assessment of most codebases .
Lewis shares just one example of when he has encountered an organization that has an inflated sense of the value of their code , calling them “ jealously protective ” of that code .
Predicatively , when Lewis flew thousands of miles to be onsite so that the code would n't have to leave the premises , Lewis found that the actual codebase being jealously protected was pretty bad .
Due to examples like this Lewis believes that " in many cases , the risk of [ code theft ] happening is much less than is generally thought , " and so companies should n't be afraid to share their code in cases where it may make sense .
And so Lewis and Forbes present an interesting reality check for us with regard to the value of our code assets , because as Lewis says :
It seems very counterintuitive that something that is so difficult and expensive to create can have so little value .
I guess that 's why so many organizations like to pretend that their code is much more valuable than it really is .
It has no cgi.rb
It has a clean room implementation of ActionPack
It is threadsafe with configurable Mutex Locks ( Routing is also threadsafe )
It has been designed favoring simplicity and clarity over magic
A light core framework easy to extend through hacks
No auto - render .
The return value of your controller actions is what gets returned to client .
You have to explicitly call a render method if you want it .
Merb 's render method just returns a string , allowing for multiple renders and additional flexibility over similar functionality in Rails
PartControllers allow for encapsulated apps without big performance cost
Docs , specs , tutorials
Rubinius compatibility
More profiling and optimizations
More tools and creature comforts
Using Evented Mongrels with Merb gives you the best bang for the buck overall when high concurrency is expected [...] be sure you understand your application 's usage patterns and not over - engineer your solution .
In most cases , running Rails with a standard Mongrel cluster may be just fine for you .
There have been long debates on Rails performance .
Rails can really slow down when your application deals with a lot of File exchange or concurrent connections .
That is what Merb has been designed for .
Ezra Zygmuntowicz , from Engine Yard , started working on Merb ( Mongrel + Erb ) 10 months ago and gave a presentation this month about it at Ruby Hoedown .
Ezra originally tried to optimize Rails to make it more threadsafe , but at the end it was easier to make a new framework than trying to change ActionPack , ( the View and Controller parts of Rails ) .
Merb is similar to Rails in many ways .
What differentiates Merb from Rails is : The key differences are : sample Merb application by Zack Chandler is available .
Merb v0.4
Core is quite complete and Ezra promised it would stay light , with additional features provided by plugins .
What 's in the pipeline for next releases ?
Concerning performance , Phil Misiowiec released an exhaustive comparison of Rails , Merb performance ( using Swiftiply and Nginx ) .
Phil 's goal was to test real world clustering configurations .
He looked at how concurrency affected the application running Rails vs Merb with various session management options ( Disabled , Database stored , Memcached ) , and logging .
In all tests , Merb performs better than Rails , and depending on the App Server and HTTP Server , it outperformed Rails by 5 % - 20 % .
Phil draws the conclusion :

When you are reading or writing a program that includes a loop , and you are trying to figure out how the loop works , do you do so by tracing its execution in your head ?
Many programmers do just that :
They say something like , " Well , the first time through the loop , iter is equal to c.begin ( ) , so the loop must be working on the first element of c , " and so on .
Many programmers also make off - by - one errors in their programs , particularly when they think about whether to use < or <= in loop conditions .
We believe that these two facts are connected .
Mentally tracing through a loop may help convince you that each iteration is doing approximately the right thing , but getting the details exactly right is hard especially the crucial detail of whether the loop starts and ends where it should .
Off - by - one errors come from missing such details .
There is a technique for thinking about loops that we believe makes off - by - one errors much easier to avoid .
The technique is to find an appriopriate loop invariant , a term that we suspect scares some people off because it sounds so theoretical .
Despite its sound , the notion of loop invariants ( and invariants in other contexts as well ) can make programs easier to write , read , and understand .
When you are writing a program and thinking about what form a loop should take , you can often simplify your task by thinking about the invariant at the same time .
When you are trying to figure out what a loop in someone else 's program is doing especially when you suspect that the loop is not doing what it should you can form a sharper picture of the loop 's workings by asking what the loop invariant is or should be .
In effect , an invariant is a way of formalizing our thinking about part of a program 's design .
We often find that writing down the invariant that corresponds to part of a program helps us sharpen our thinking about how that part of the program should work , and makes the actual implementation much easier .
Just about any loop has an invariant that will help describe it .
Sometimes , the loop 's author will have thought explicitly about the invariant , and even been considerate enough to mention it in a comment .
More often , programmers do n't bother to think about invariants until they are trying to understand code that someone else has written .
Accordingly , our discussion of invariants and the code to which those invariants apply will be intertwined , as code and invariants usually are in real life .
What is an Invariant ?
An invariant is a claim about the state of a program that is true every time the program 's execution reaches a particular point .
That point is often the beginning of a loop .
For example , suppose we wish to set the variable sum to the sum of the integers from 0 through 100 , inclusive .
We might write a program fragment that looks like this :
int n = 0 ; int sum = 0 ; while ( n != 100 ) { ++n ; sum += n ; }
The form of this loop may be slightly surprising :
Why are we incrementing n at the beginning rather than at the end ?
Why does the loop use != for its comparison even though we specified that 100 should be included in the sum ?
The answer to both of these questions is that we thought about the invariant first , and then based the loop on the invariant .
The most straightforward way to use an invariant to write or understand a loop is to think of the loop this way :
<i>establish the invariant </i > while ( < i>condition </i > ) { < i >
Perform a computation that will < /i > eventually cause the condition to become false while keeping the invariant true }
When the while terminates , the condition is false .
Because the invariant was true at the beginning of the loop , and each trip through the loop causes the invariant to remain true , the invariant must still be true after the loop finishes no matter how many times the loop executes .
When we want to find an appropriate invariant for a loop , one way of doing so is to look for a claim that :
Involves a variable ( or variables ) that change (s ) during the loop .
Can be made to be trivially true before the first trip through the loop .
Is equivalent to our problem being solved as soon as the variable 's value makes the condition false .
Let 's apply this technique to our summation loop .
When we 're done , we want sum to be the sum of the integers from 0 through 100 .
We need an invariant that uses a variable , so a reasonable first try is to use that variable in place of one of the constants .
Accordingly , it makes sense to try " sum is the sum of the integers from 0 through n , inclusive " as our invariant .
It is trivial to make this invariant true by setting both sum and n to zero .
If we make our condition n != 100 , then when the loop finishes , n will be 100 ; and if the code correctly corresponds to the invariant , sum will have to be the sum of the integers from 0 through 100 .
The remaining problem , then , is how to write a loop body that will :
Leave the invariant true , assuming that it was true to begin with .
Change the state of the program in such a way that the loop 's condition will eventually become false .
Notice that there is no requirement that the invariant remain true while the loop body is executing ; the invariant is associated only with the beginning of the loop .
We begin by setting n to 0 , and we would eventually like n to be equal to 100 .
The easiest way to achieve this state of affairs is by adding 1 to n in the loop body .
Of course , once we have done so , the invariant is no longer true because we have changed the value of n .
The former value of n is now n- 1 , which means that sum is no longer the sum of the integers from 0 through n , but rather the sum of the integers from 0 through n - 1 .
We can remedy this state of affairs by adding ( the new value of ) n to sum , because n+( the sum of the integers from 0 through n - 1 ) is the sum of the integers from 0 through n .
This reasoning gives us the body of the loop :
++n ; sum += n ;
Because the loop maintains the invariant , it is easy to understand the loop 's behavior :
When it finishes , n must be equal to 100 , so the invariant forces sum to be the sum of the integers from 0 through 100 , inclusive .
The more usual form of this loop looks like this :
int n = 1 ; int sum = 0 ; while ( n <= 100 ) { sum += n ; ++n ; }
However , when we tried to find an invariant that corresponds to this version of the loop , we realized that the version we actually chose had a simpler invariant and was easier to explain .
We leave it as an exercise to write down the invariant for this alternative version of the loop , and use it to convince yourself that the program works correctly .
Linear Search
Let 's apply the idea of an invariant to help us understand a piece of code that finds the first element in a sequence with a given value .
We realize that the Standard Library find algorithm solves this problem for us , but it is useful to examine an explicit , concrete solution to better understand how invariants work .
Suppose c is a sequential container ( vector , list , deque , or a user - defined container that behaves like one of these ) , it is an appropriate iterator for this container , and x is a value to be sought in c .
Then after executing
it = c.begin( ) ; while ( it != c.end ( ) && * it != x ) ++it ;
the value of it is the first element of c that is equal to x .
If there is no such element , it is equal to c.end ( ) .
How can we convince ourselves of this claim without stepping through the loop in our heads ?
As before , the strategy is to come up with an invariant that :
Involves at least one variable that will change in the loop .
Is easily made true at the beginning of the loop .
Gives us what we want when the loop 's condition becomes false .
In this case , what we want is for one of two conditions to hold : for * it to be equal to x or for it to be equal to c.end ( ) .
But the while condition already gives us that !
So why do we need to bother with the invariant at all ?
The answer is that the loop 's condition assures us that if the loop terminates , one of the two conditions will be true .
However , it does not assure us that the loop will terminate , nor does it assure us that the loop will find the first element of c that is equal to x .
After all , if we had written the loop this way :
// This program does not work it = c.begin ( ) ; while ( it != c.end ( ) && * it != x ) { /*
Do nothing */ }
the condition would be the same , but the loop would terminate only if c happened to be empty or its first element happened to be equal to x .
So we have two tasks before us .
First , we must convince ourselves that the loop terminates .
Second , we must show that when it does terminate , it has found the first element equal to x .
It is easy to see that the loop must terminate because the loop 's body increments it .
If you initialize a variable with c.begin ( ) and increment it enough times , you will eventually reach c.end ( ) .
But how do we know that this loop will find the first element of c that is equal to x ?
For that matter , how do we know that the loop will find an appropriate element of c at all ?
To answer that question , we must find an invariant that we can use to prove that the loop does indeed find the first element of c that is equal to x .
We can do so by using the notion that " None of the elements in the range [ c.begin ( ) , it ) are equal to x . "
Here , we are using the unbalanced brackets [ ) in the usual way , to denote a range that includes the first given element and excludes the second .
By this definition , initializing it to c.begin ( ) makes the invariant trivially true :
The range [ c.begin ( ) , c.begin( ) ) has no elements at all , so it cannot contain any elements that are equal to x .
As before , our problem is to verify that if the invariant is true at the beginning of the loop body , it is still true at the end .
In this case , all the loop body does is increment it .
Doing so appends one element to the range [ c.begin ( ) , it ) , namely the element at * it .
The first part of the while condition , it != c.end ( ) , assures us that this element actually exists ; the second part , * it != x , assures us that the element is not equal to x .
Therefore , the invariant is still true :
No element equal to x can be found in the range [ c.begin ( ) , it ) .
Accordingly , because we have shown that the code maintains the invariant , we have assured ourselves that when the loop terminates , as it must , either * it is the first element that is equal to x or it is equal to c.end ( ) .
Generalizing Invariants
The examples that we have seen so far are nearly trivial .
In practice , the notion of an invariant applies to more than just loops .
Another common use for invariants is to help us think about data structures .
For example , suppose we have a function named compute that takes a long time to execute .
We might decide to try to make our program run more quickly by storing values that compute yields in an associative array named cache , so that we can fetch them again without having to recompute them .
In order for this strategy to work , we have to know that whenever cache[ x ] is defined that is , whenever cache has an element with a key equal to x , the value of cache[ x ] is the same as the result of compute ( x ) would be .
Therefore , we can use exactly that claim as our invariant .
We will expect this invariant to be true at any point at which we attempt to use our cache .
Therefore , if the cache is to work correctly , we somehow have to ensure that no operation that anyone performs on the cache will ever cause the invariant to be false .
One way to ensure that the invariant remains true is to find every place in the program that refers to the cache and verify that all references are appropriate .
A better way , however , is to hide the existence of the cache so that only a small part of the program is even capable of accessing it .
For example , suppose that compute accepts an int and returns another int .
Then we might hide the cache as part of its implementation :
int compute ( int n ) { //
Invariant : If cache [ i ] is present , // its value is equal to what compute ( i ) would return .
static map<int , int > cache ; map<int , int>:: const_iterator it = cache.find(n ) ; if ( it != cache.end ( ) ) return * it ; int result ; //
Do the computation here cache [ n ] = result ; return result ; }
In order to verify that the invariant remains true , we need only inspect the body of the compute function itself , because no one else is able to touch the cache .
Moreover , the invariant makes it relatively easy to understand what operations we can safely perform on the cache .
Are we allowed to remove cache elements to save space ?
Yes , because the invariant talks only about values of elements that exist .
What if something causes compute ( n ) to return a different value than it did previously ?
Then the invariant is no longer true , and we must make it true by removing the appropriate element from the cacheand so on .
This example is still pretty simple , but nevertheless it illustrates an important point :
Thinking explicitly about the invariant for our cache encourages us to think about what conditions are necessary to keep the invariant true .
In particular , the invariant helps us realize that we need to defend against the possibility of someone changing the cache behind our backs .
Class Invariants
It is often useful to associate an invariant with a class .
When we do so , we effectively use the same invariant for every publicly accessible function that operates on objects of that class , be they public member functions or friend functions .
Every such function can assume that the invariant is true when the function begins execution , and is responsible for ensuring that the invariant is true again when the function is about to return .
For example , one fairly common C++ programming technique is to use two classes to define a reference - counted data structure .
There are many variations on this technique ; one variation uses a nested class to hide the data representation from the users :
class
Thing { private : struct Data { size_t refcount ; // ... } ; Data * dp ; // ... } ;
Here , the type Thing : : Data is private , so it is accessible only to members and friends of Thing .
Every
Thing object contains a pointer to a Data object , and every Data object contains a count ( in its refcount member ) of the number of Thing objects that refer to it .
One problem that some C++ programmers find confusing is how to write the constructors , copy constructor , destructor , and copy assignment operator for such a class so as to be assured of maintaining the reference counts correctly .
You will not be surprised to learn that we think that an appropriate class invariant will make it easier to handle the reference counts .
We can think of two plausible ways to implement such a class , each of which has its own invariant .
The simpler of the two invariants has two parts :
The dp member of every completely constructed Thing object points to a Thing : : Data object .
member of every completely constructed object points to a object .
The refcount member of every Thing : : Data object is equal to the number of completely constructed Thing objects that point to it .
The more complicated design allows a Thing object to have a zero dp member ; we have left it as an exercise to find the corresponding invariant .
We can assume that the class invariant is true at entry to every member of Thingeven constructors because of the " completely constructed " caveat .
For example , consider how we might use the invariant to help us write the Thing copy constructor :
Thing :: Thing ( const Thing& t) { //
We need to figure out what to do // here }
We know that the formal parameter t is a ( const ) reference to the Thing object that is to be copied .
Because this object has already been completely constructed ( or so we must assume ! ) , we know that :
t.dp points to a Thing : : Data object .
points to a object .
This object includes a refcount member that counts the number of Thing objects that refer to it .
Our job is to ensure that when the constructor finishes , these two claims will still be true .
To do so , we must initialize this -> dp to point to a Thing : : Data object .
Because we are implementing a reference - counted data structure , we probably want to use the same Thing : : Data object as the one to which t-> dp points , so it suffices to initialize this -> dp as a copy of t-> dp .
This initialization satisfies the first claim .
We still need to deal with the second claim , because when our constructor returns , the object will become completely constructed .
Accordingly , we must adjust the refcount member of this -> dp to account for the new Thing object that is pointing to it .
In short , we can satisfy both claims by writing a copy constructor that looks like this :
Thing :: Thing ( const
Thing& t ) : dp( t.dp ) { //
We can do whatever else we need to // do here ++dp->refcount ; }
Alternatively , we might decide that we do not want to initialize this -> dp to point to the same object as t.dp but instead make it point to a newly created copy of the object to which t.dp points .
We can do so this way :
Thing :: Thing ( const
Thing& t ) : dp(new Thing :: Data(*t-> dp ) ) { // We can do whatever else // we need to do here dp -> refcount = 1 ; }
We leave it as an exercise to verify that this variation still preserves the invariant .
We can use the invariant in a similar way to help us implement all of the other copy - control members : the other constructors , destructor , and copy - assignment operator .
Moreover , if we decide to add features such as copy - on - write , the invariant will help us keep our bearings .
Discussion
It is a common misconception that an invariant is something that is always true .
In fact , an invariant is intended to be true only at a specific point or points in a program 's text .
For an invariant to be useful , it should be associated with a part of the program that can be executed more than once , particularly a loop or a procedure .
Understanding an invariant often helps us understand the corresponding program .
The reason is that the invariant corresponds in a deep way to the purpose of that part of the program .
So , for example , we saw that in a linear search , we could use the invariant to express the notion that we intend for the search loop to find the first element of a container that has a particular value , rather than finding any such element or skipping over an element even if it is there .
In our reference - counted data structure , we saw that we could use an invariant to make a clear claim about what conditions have to occur in order for us to consider the data structure to be valid .
Moreover , we saw how the importance of maintaining an invariant leads to the notion of hiding from users code that might be able to falsify the invariant .
We do not pretend that invariants will somehow make all programming problems trivial to solve .
However , we have found that when we have a piece of code that we can't quite get to do what we want , we can often sharpen our understanding by asking ourselves : " What is the invariant ? "
The familiar old script that Linux is only for geeks has been largely rewritten recently with the arrival of Ubuntu , a version of Linux for the average user .
In its three years on the scene , Ubuntu has quickly gained a reputation for being easy to configure and use .
On Thursday , Canonical , the London - based company which acts as Ubuntu 's commercial sponsor , released version 7.10 of the software .
This latest release , dubbed " Gutsy Gibbon , " proves that Ubuntu Linux can compete with and , in some cases , trump Windows as an everyday desktop system when it comes to pure usability .
Gamers and hardcore media hounds may still feel left out – DVDs were a little bit tricky , and the lack of support for popular games , a long - time Linux gripe , is still evident here – but we found playing music and watching movies in the new Ubuntu to be every bit as pleasant as it is under OS X or Windows .
Gutsy Gibbon is certainly easier to install and set up than Windows Vista , and it's very close to matching Mac OS X when it comes to making things " just work " out of the box .
Wi - Fi , printing , my digital camera and even my iPod all worked immediately after installation – no drivers or other software required .
As with previous versions , Gutsy Gibbon ships as a " live CD , " which means you can boot from your DVD drive and test Ubuntu without touching your existing system .
If you like what you see , committing to Ubuntu is just a matter of clicking " Install . "
From there , Ubuntu will lead you through the process of installing the OS .
If you choose to dual boot with Windows , you can tell Ubuntu to import all your settings and files .
This is what most new Ubuntu users will be doing , so I tried it .
Including the importing , installation took under 20 minutes .
My testing was done on a Toshiba laptop using the final release candidate for Gutsy Gibbon .
Canonical says that , if all goes well , there will be no difference between the candidate and Thursday 's final release .
Once Ubuntu was installed , it rebooted , immediately recognized my laptop 's Wi-Fi card and automatically joined my local network using my imported settings .
It even defaulted to Wi-Fi Protected Access encryption , something that required additional configuration in previous versions .
Music management is good enough with the built - in Rhythmbox player , though I did have to install additional codecs to get MP3 and Windows Media Audio support .
However , the process has been improved since Feisty Fawn , the 7.04 release .
Rhythmbox imported all my music from a Windows XP partition without issues , and had no trouble uploading music to my iPod Shuffle .
DVD playback was a slightly different story .
The Totem media player , Ubuntu 's default DVD player , lacked the necessary codecs out of the box , but helpfully offered to fetch them .
Unfortunately , even after the codecs were installed , I was unable to get any of my Netflix DVDs to play .
This is n't a new experience , as I was never able to get DVDs to play under either of the previous two versions of Ubuntu using Totem .
Luckily , finding and installing the more robust MPlayer DVD player through the Add / Remove programs panel is easy , and DVD playback in MPlayer worked without a hitch .
When it comes to finding and installing applications , the Add / Remove Programs feature in Ubuntu surpasses both Windows and Mac OS X .
Whereas Windows and Mac users usually need to comb the web for popular applications for their newly installed systems , Linux users simply turn to the package management program , which makes it easy to browse and install software without scouring Google .
Open up Install / Remove Applications and you 'll see all the available software listed in one easy - to - browse panel .
Ubuntu will also inform you any time there are updates available – something that just is n't possible on Windows or a Mac without a third - party utility .
There 's also a similar component for installing add - ons in Firefox , Ubuntu 's default web browser .
Other notable changes in Ubuntu 7.10 are the latest GNOME Desktop , which provides much improved drag - and - drop support to the user interface , and Compiz , the whiz - bang 3 - D desktop effects package , which is enabled by default .
Ubuntu and the GNOME Desktop team have put considerable effort into improving the user experience for accessing many of Linux 's under - the - hood options .
A new graphical interface makes it much easier to make adjustments to monitor settings and set up a dual - monitor workstation – both of which previously required using the command line .
Beyond these key enhancements , Gutsy Gibbon incorporates some of Mac OS X's most useful desktop traits to improve the user experience .
New to this release is fast user - switching , a mimic of the same feature in OS X for switching between user accounts without logging out .
Another nod to Apple is the improved Spotlight - like applet designed to search the hard drive and act as an application launcher .
Printing has also been overhauled , and each print dialog now features a default virtual " PDF printer " which allows any application to output PDF files , something Mac OS X users will recognize .
If you 've been considering making the switch from Windows or Mac , Ubuntu makes the process painless .
It 's ability to seamlessly import your settings , music and data from a Windows partition erases one of the most pressing barriers for new users .
And once you 're in , the learning curve is minimal .
In fact , besides requiring a little futzing to get multimedia playback set up , Gutsy Gibbon is about as easy as Linux gets .
How learning Python made me a better C++ programmer
This post on the Raganwald blog spurred me to write about something I 've been thinking about for a while : how learning Python has made me a better C++ programmer .
The short answer is , it convinced me to start using the boost libraries ( and the Loki library ) .
I 'd seen these libraries before , and thought that they looked pretty neat , but that most of them looked too esoteric to be really practical .
But that was really a failure of imagination .
Learning Python taught me the value of programming at a higher level .
Things like using boost : : signals to break up dependencies ; boost : : bind and boost : : function to use functions as first - class objects ; boost : : foreach to separate iteration from the algorithm ; boost : : any for generic data types ; and much more .
Kind of ironically , Python also taught me the value of using a functional programming style in C ++.
I say ironically because Python is n't a functional language ( although it supports a functional programming style ) .
It was reading the book Text Processing in Python ( David Mertz ) that showed me the value of this style ; then as I got more into TDD , the value of this style became clearer .
Today , I could n't imagine not programming at a higher level in C ++.
My C++ code is now shorter , easier to understand , and has fewer bugs and platform dependencies .
But I might have never moved to this new level if Python had n't shown me the way .
There is method to the White House madness of treating every legitimate function of government like abandonware .
Theyâ€™re trying to drown the economy in the bathtub .
The goal is simple : to aggrandize the overprivileged few , and multinational corporations , against the mass of the population .
This has been the Bush - Cheney goal from the start , and every splashy â€˜valuesâ€™ struggle over abortion or stem cell research or religious language in public buildings , etc. , has been largely smokescreen .
Regardless of the efforts of a few headline - grabbing and well - funded televangelists , the real darkling plain here is the one on which administration policy makers , their allies in the media , and lobbyists collide at some point with anyone working in any way for the public interest .
One irony in the GOPâ€™s targeting â€˜trial lawyersâ€™ is , as Iâ€™ve said before , that the relationship between this administration and the public resembles that of a bad lawyer to his client .
Attorneys are not all alike , and the worst lawyer is one who cheats his own clients .
The game plan is simple : if the goal is cheating , then every mistake , every accident , becomes a tactic .
Not that all of a bad lawyerâ€™s acts and omissions rise to the level of â€˜conspiracyâ€™ in the sense of a well - oiled machine .
Not every mistake is deliberate ; not every lie was carefully plotted out months in advance ; not every misfeasance was malfeasance .
But both mistakes and tricks become tactics in the over - all strategy of the lawyerâ€™s working for his own advantage rather than the clientâ€™s .
Why ? --
Because a losing client is in poor position to file a complaint .
A complaint by a losing client will be dismissed as dissatisfaction with the outcome .
Logically , in other words , the bad lawyer who does poor work also has an incentive to lose his clientâ€™s case .
Same with the Bush administration .
The unqualified Bush team with its reverse - Robin - Hood economics and its top - dollar militarism has no vested interest in strengthening the polity .
Quite the contrary .
Take the â€œwar on terror.â€ 
People unqualified for their jobs will not necessarily be conscious of their inadequacies .
Nobody conspires to be mediocre .
But Bushâ€™s downgrading the position of National Security Advisor , when he came into office , and upgrading the Deputiesâ€™ committees was no accident , nor was appointing several Deputies who were known â€ ˜Second Pearl Harborâ€™ types .
The consequence of these structural and personnel changes was an administration focused on conquest and dominion , in Samuel Johnsonâ€™s words , and not focused on taking care of the most ordinary security needs .
Strengthening the cockpit doors of jumbo jets , pulling in visa holders who displayed the characteristics of â€œintending immigrants , â€ and stopping a cohesive group of young Middle Eastern men who bought one - way tickets are only a few in the long list of ways that 9 - 11 could have been prevented .
Failing that , the tragedy could have been treated afterward as the mass murder it was , and investigated .
Instead , we have governments of nations that produced and supported the suspects acting in secret league with the White House .
The Bush administration misused the metaphor â€œharboringâ€ to go after Afghanistan and then used the catch - 22 â€œdisarmâ€ to go after Iraq , both Muslim nations it had already targeted .
Instead of an investigation , we got a war â€ “ one that Bush already wanted .
â€ œWeâ€™re at war , â€ Bob Woodward quoted Bush as saying on 9/11 .
There has been blatantly inadequate follow - up of the â€œmoney trail .â€ 
Ways to streamline and facilitate the financial investigation , which would also clarify and simplify our tax code , lie ready to hand .
We could eliminate legal gimcracks such as â€ œLimited Liability Companies , â€ against which even investors who use them warn the public .
Genuine environmental clean - up would diminish potential security breaches in the nuclear energy , petroleum , and chemical sectors .
But genuine remedies have been little applied .
Neither â€œpreventionâ€ nor â€œinvestigationâ€ has been made even fractionally the watchword that â€œterrorâ€ has been .
This is the very opposite of working for the common weal .
Following is a condensed version of a blog I posted more than a year ago .
Regrettably , it is as current now as it was then :
To sum up the past four years , we have an administration aggressively covering up 9 - 11 and preventing genuinely expert research into it , even when such research would rebut some nonsensical conspiracy theories .
White House stonewalling on 9 - 11 investigation continues even while the White House milks those dreadful events for political benefit , simultaneously advancing an agenda of US colonialism in the Middle East , generating hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts for friendly companies and their management , and even making money off the twin industries of â€˜defenseâ€ ™ and â€˜securityâ€™ for relatives and cronies of George W. Bush .
Move over , 98 % of the U.S. population , those of youâ €” those of usâ € ” who grew up aiming for good health , an education , a house , the freedom and ability to bring up children according to the lights of the parents , and relatively secure elder years .
You are being brought ever closer to that half of the global population with little expectation or hope of such blessings .
Had the acts and omissions of the years since 9/11 been even slightly different , the above statement would sound like exaggeration .
But given the events , theyâ€™re not .
Nineteen scantily armed hijackers have been treated as though they were the late Soviet Union .
The administration has invaded the Middle East wholesale , something it wanted to do not only before 9/11 but also before the 2000 election .
Genuine security experts in aviation security and elsewhere have been replaced by PR appointees with backgrounds in communications or in politics .
Genuine diplomats and other personnel with experience abroad have been replaced by appointees who are an insult to world opinion .
The invasion of Iraq has turned into a bloody pork barrel .
U.S. military and security spending have turned into a giant slush fund , almost unhindered by Congress .
All of this has one central effect : the destruction is by no means complete , but the U.S. â€˜peace dividendâ€™ is being swept off the table , and democracy is being turned into a harpiesâ€™ banquet .
A group of the greediest , most self - satisfied , least competent , and least inspiring gobblers at the public trough the world has ever seen in the United States has achieved their central aim .
They have found something to replace their dream days of fantasy bloodshed and genuine avarice , bogus anti-Communism and actual self - aggrandizement in the Cold War with something equally good â€ “ the â€˜war on terror.â€ ™
Actually , for their purposes , itâ€™s better than the Cold War .
The Soviet Union was an actual power , with a findable , limited location .
Guerrilla tactics by young males around the world are an imprecise , diffuse Enemy that you can project anywhere .
And just in case the present supply runs short , the administration is moving aggressively to make as many new enemies as possible .
Look at the destruction of educated , sane people in Iraq , including the assassination of Iraqi college professors under the CPA ; look at the continuing deaths of Afghan elders â€ “ the very individuals with the capacity for local self - governance whose resistance to their Soviet invaders made them targets for the new Western invaders as well .
Their deaths began immediately after Massoud was assassinated and continue to this day .
But the destruction is wrought here at home as well as halfway around the world .
The trillion or so spent on the â€˜war on terrorâ€™ is subtracted from U.S. domestic stability .
Pensions in business are becoming a thing of the past , while the government fund protecting what pensions are left is in perilous condition .
Health insurance is no longer an expectation even with a â€˜goodâ€™ job , and the insurance companies are often not held to any standard of coming through with actual coverage anyway .
Our hospitals are merging and consolidating like our airlines and our mass media , and health care providers are forced to fork over ever higher premiums for malpractice â€˜insurance , â€™ even while the carriers use taxpayer - funded federal courts to try to deny claims and coverage .
Move over , middle class .
Your confident hope of health , education , housing and individual prosperity is â€ “ not to put too fine a point upon itâ€ ” a threat to a small , grasping , ignorant caste of well - placed louts .
A trend away from genuine productivity and economic self - determination for the overwhelming majority , and toward watering the dollar , allowing layoffs of thousands of workers while failed CEOs walk away with millions , and weakening contractual good faith , is not happenstance .
They call it â€ ˜conservatism , â€ ™ but its real name is dispossession .
Here is the Nation article with Grover Norquistâ€™s famous phrase :
â€ œMy goal is to cut government in half in twenty - five years , â€  he says , â€ œto get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.â€ 
Norquist misstated , of course .
â€ ˜Governmentâ€™ doesnâ€™t get more powerful than by invading other countries and breaking into peopleâ€™s homes , the aspects of government most buttressed by the current administration .
Itâ€™s not the â€˜governmentâ€™ theyâ€™re drowning in the bathtub .
Itâ€™s the economy , stupid .

The Bush administration ’s mishandling of the Hurricane Katrina housing crisis has often looked like an attempt to discourage survivors from applying for help .
The House has taken an important step toward reversing this policy with a bill that would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to issue tens of thousands of new housing vouchers under the Section 8 program , which allows low - income families to seek homes in the private real estate market .
Many of these families would have long since found permanent homes and settled into new lives had the Bush administration brought HUD  which was created to deal with these kinds of situations  into the picture at the very start .
But Hurricane Katrina arrived just as the administration had made up its mind to cripple HUD and the successful Section 8 program , partly as a way of offsetting tax cuts for the wealthy .
The administration instead rigged up a confusing and inflexible housing program and put the Federal Emergency Management Agency in charge .
FEMA frustrated landlords and Katrina ’s victims alike .
Last year , one federal judge likened the convoluted application process  which too often led vulnerable families to lose aid without knowing why or having reasonable recourse to appeal  to something out of a horror story by Kafka .
With thousands of families scheduled to lose their temporary aid by September , the Senate should move quickly to pass this much - needed legislation .
Hurricane Katrina ’s victims should not have to keep paying the price for the administration ’s misplaced animosity toward low - income housing .
Coming off the Iowa Straw Poll the momentum for the Ron Paul 2008 campaign continues to build .
Congressman Ron Paul has finished in the top 5 in 16 of the last 17 straw polls and can claim 1st place victories in New Hampshire , North Carolina , Washington , and Alabama .
In comparing results head - to - head , Congressman Paul has blown away most of the field , defeating Rudy Giuliani in 15 of the 17 polls and John McCain in 15 of the 16 polls .
There are straw polls coming up all across the country so be sure to check in with your local GOP to find out when you can vote for Ron Paul next .

What ’s up with all the camouflage folks ?
Everywhere I go , it is camouflage pants , skirts , caps , tops , backpacks , jackets , headbands , snow suits and dog leashes .
Grandmas , school children , middle aged pot bellies –name a demographic–and you will see them sporting their earthy tones .
You know your country is at war when the most popular fashion statement around is combat apparel .
Does this mean that everyone who wears camouflage supports Canada ’s mission in Afghanistan ?
I doubt it .
The latest polls certainly suggest otherwise .
So as a fashion statement ( or is that “ fascist ” statement ? ) , you are , ah , trying to blend in with the plastic foliage in the shopping mall ?
I do n’t get it .
After all , the idea of camouflage is to make one ’s self the same as the surrounding environment .
Then again , at this rate , the growing sea of green , brown , tan , grey and black splotches may soon turn out to be weirdly analogous to the garb once worn by crowds at Grateful Dead concerts : everyone wore tie - dye and everyone blended in .
But that did n’t make everyone a hippie — especially so - called “ Deadhead ” Ann Coulter .
Wearing camouflage used to signify one of two things : the person was either in the armed forces or was setting out on a different sort of mission that involved drinking tons of beer and killing furry creatures in a forest somewhere .
But nowadays , the whole idea of hunting ( humans or animals , that is ) , has been demoted by those who dress like G.I .
Joe just because they are out hunting for a latte or an Ipod .
Grow a brain , people .
This is all about the militarization of our culture .
This past summer I considered buying a new Wilson tennis racquet to replace my old “ Hyper Hammer 5.2 ” frame .
But when I went shopping I was informed that the latest incarnation of my old racquet is now called the “ Surge . ”
Is it just coincidence that this corporate branding coincided with the name of Bush ’s plan to increase the number of American troops deployed to the Iraq War ?
I think not .
I found a new version of my old racquet online .
Somehow it sounds more benign .
Along with camouflage , Canada is now beset by an overabundance of “ Support Our Troops ” ribbons , t- shirts , bracelets and mugs .
You ca n’t go anywhere without seeing the telltale yellow ribbon on cars .
Come to think of it , some are camouflaged .
It is high time that the elephant in the room is asked the obvious question that polite Canadians would rather avoid :
What does “ Support Our Troops ” really mean ?
Those who decorate their vehicles thusly would have us believe that the decals are politically neutral symbols of support for soldiers overseas .
This is nonsense and they know it .
The intended audience are those of us who forego yellow ribbons .
If you think about it , the phrase “ Support Our Troops ” is sort of bossy , like a drill sargent ’s snarl .
This is known in grammatical circles as the “ imperative mood . ”
Therefore the directive to “ Support Our Troops ” comes off like an order , but with a somewhat fuzzy meaning :
What exactly am I supposed to do ?
Buy a ribbon , I guess .
Yet the context is obvious .
This is all about the Afghan War and nothing else .
The yellow ribbon campaign has succeeded in convincing at least eighteen Canadian municipal and local governments to affix the decals to police cars , ambulances , fire trucks , buses and other municipal vehicles .
Since this is all public property , this is a divisive move , not an inclusive one .
Why this cause , but no others ?
Why not “ Support Our Cancer Patients ” or “ Support Our Single Moms ” ?
Are they less worthy ?
Pretending the yellow ribbon is neutral means pretending that everyone supports the troops .
But if you stop to think about it , this is neither true nor possible .
One can not “ support the troops ” but not their mission because that is a logical inconsistency .
If you want to see the combat mission ended and Canada ’s soldiers brought home as soon as possible , then you really do not support them because a good part of their current mission is to kill or be killed .
For the record , I have no grand scheme , nor any simple answers to end the latest Afghan quagmire .
In fact , nobody does , including those who obediently support military missions that have no exit strategy .
One can debate the need for security first as a means to development and stability , versus the need for development as a means to security , but what should be obvious is that occupation and counter - insurgency have terrible track records historically .
As noted in the Toronto Star recently , according to Thomas Johnson , professor of national security at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California , “ Since World War II , is there one successful counter - insurgency ?
The answer is none .
This war will never be won militarily . ”
For this reason , Canadian Pulitzer Prize - winning photo journalist Paul Watson wants to ask a few questions of his old high school friend , Prime Minister Stephen Harper :
“ I would beg him , as a former friend and someone who has access to intelligence that I do n’t , to explain to me why we ’re putting soldiers ’ lives on the line and asking them to kill civilians to defend themselves when all the military people I ’ve spoken to admit that there is no military solution in Afghanistan , ” said Watson .
Actually , efforts to negotiate by bringing in all sides — various Pashtun tribal leaders , Taliban and other insurgent groups , and the government in Kabul , as well as in Islamabad — are ongoing .
In fact , according to The Nation , a major English - language newspaper in Pakistan , secret talks began there in August between U.S. officials and the Taliban .
Oddly enough , the two sides have at least one thing in common : both are split along fractious lines .
The renewed Taliban is divided between moderates and extremists , while the Bush administration appears to be divided on whether or not to launch a preemptive strike against Iran .
One may well ask : where should Canada ’s foreign policy priorities be right now ?
Tied down in Afghanistan , begging NATO allies for more help in what looks more and more like an intractable military stalemate ?
Or , working through diplomatic channels to try to prevent a global conflagration between the US and Iran that could even go nuclear ?
It ’s time to ditch the camouflage and put on your thinking caps .

PANAMA — Eduardo Arias hardly fits the profile of someone capable of humbling one of the world ’s most formidable economic powers .
A 51 - year - old Kuna Indian , Mr. Arias grew up on a reservation paddling dugout canoes near his home on one of the San Blas islands off Panama ’s Caribbean coast .
He now lives in a small apartment above a food stand in Panama , the nation ’s capital , also known as Panama City .
But one Saturday morning in May , Eduardo Arias did something that would reverberate across six continents .
He read the label on a 59 - cent tube of toothpaste .
On it were two words that had been overlooked by government inspectors and health authorities in dozens of countries : diethylene glycol , the same sweet - tasting , poisonous ingredient in antifreeze that had been mixed into cold syrup here , killing or disabling at least 138 Panamanians last year .
Mr. Arias reported his discovery , setting off a worldwide hunt for tainted toothpaste that turned out to be manufactured in China .
Health alerts have now been issued in 34 countries , from Vietnam to Kenya , from Tonga in the Pacific to Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean .
Canada found 24 contaminated brands and New Zealand found 16 .
Japan had 20 million tubes .
Officials in the United States unwittingly gave the toothpaste to prisoners , the mentally disabled and troubled youths .
Hospitals gave it to the sick , while high - end hotels gave it to the wealthy .
The simmering tensions in Turkey 's Kurdish southeast are not only playing out along the country 's border with Iraq , where the military has amassed tens of thousands of troops following renewed clashes with Kurdish rebels holed up in Iraq 's mountainous north .
They 're also spilling onto the streets of European cities from Berlin to Brussels to Innsbruck , Austria .
This weekend , authorities are braced for another round of protests in the German capital , where two weeks ago Turkish ultranationalists attacked a Kurdish cultural center , wielding machetes and injuring dozens of people .
Last weekend , some 600 mainly Kurdish protesters returned to Hermannplatz – a square in Berlin 's heavily immigrant Neukölln district – to inform the public of their view : that Turkey is still repressing the Kurdish people .
" It 's been going on for years .
The recent threat of Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq to attack us is just the last straw , " says Ahmed , a young man handing out pro-Kurdish leaflets .
With 2.5 million residents of Turkish origin , including an estimated 400,000 who identify themselves as Kurdish , Germany is home to the largest expatriate community from Turkey and is perhaps the most visible European arena for Turkish - Kurd tensions .
The expat violence has prompted politicians including the German interior minister to warn against the Kurdish conflict spilling over to Germany and other European countries .
So far there has been no indication that the clashes were planned .
But that does not mean that no group has an interest in using them for their purposes , says Süleyman Bağ , Berlin correspondent for Zaman , a conservative daily newspaper in Turkey .
In particular he refers to the Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) , an organization outlawed in Turkey and Germany and classed by the US and the European Union as a terrorist group .
Taking a softer stand on Kurdish interests than previous administrations , Turkey 's ruling Justice and Development party ( AKP ) has made unprecedented gains in Kurdish strongholds in recent elections at the expense of Kurdish parties .
The trend extends to Kurdish rebel groups such as the PKK , which has become a lot less popular with Kurds , maintains Mr. Bağ .
By " internationalizing " the Kurdish conflict the PKK hopes to mobilize new support , he says .
Meanwhile , Kurdish representatives in Germany charge that German - Turkish politicians are doing Turkey 's bidding .
Some of them have used the clashes in Berlin for one - sided and unwarranted attacks on the PKK , says Ayten Kaplan of Germany 's Federation of Kurdish Clubs , referring to statements of a prominent member of Germany 's Green party .
" I would have hoped these politicians exert a moderating influence instead of polarizing further , " she says .
In Turkey 's capital , Ankara , the clashes in Germany have so far met with a muted response from Turkish politicians .
While Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is arguably more occupied with the conflict in northern Iraq , his government is likely to follow closely what happens on the streets in Germany for another reason .
Talks over Turkey 's possible accession to the European Union ( EU ) are presently close to a standstill and popular opinion in a number of large EU countries including Germany is less than enthusiastic about Turkey becoming an EU member .
Turks and Kurds battling it out on the streets of EU capitals would make things worse .
" Ankara has no interest in seeing these tensions escalate , " says Faruk Sen , director at the Center for Turkey Studies at the University of Essen in western Germany .
But even if they do , he says , the real losers will be Turks and Kurds in Germany .
In a country that has seen heated debates over immigration for years , further violence " would play right into the hands of those who are convinced that all efforts to integrate people of Turkish origin into German society have been a complete failure . "
The squirrel had " eyes bigger than its stomach "
A resident in Christchurch , Dorset alerted the RSPCA after finding it stuck in the peanut - filled feeder .
Insp Graham Hammond said that the squirrel had " eyes bigger than its stomach " and had lost its figure while feasting in the wire - frame last week .
He said it was " quite an unusual rescue " .
" I think this squirrel had eyes bigger than its stomach but after it had stuffed itself with nuts , it had a stomach too large to escape the feeder - one which ironically , was designed to be squirrel - proof , " he said .
Insp Hammond said he managed to widen the gaps between two of the bars with the aid of a crow - bar and a grasper - to release the squirrel , which was not hurt .
" As soon as the gap increased he shot off .
I was slightly insulted , " he added .
Implementing threads in javascript
Neil Mix implemented a cool solution to do threading in javascript .
It achieves a specific kind of multi- threading , with voluntary yielding and interleaved execution , which is different than what C++ , Java or C# offer ( preemptive multi- threading ) .
The idea is that the code for each " thread " needs to voluntarily interrupt its processing flow to let another thread execute for a while .
When a thread suspends its execution , its state is saved .
When the thread is later awoken , it continues its processing from where it stopped .
To understand Neil 's library , you first need to learn how to use generators .
Generators are a new construct in javascript 1.7 ( available in Firefox 2.0 ) which let your write a piece of code returning a sequence of results , pausing its execution for each result and restarting from its paused state to compute the next result .
Normally , a function that receives execution control keeps it until it returns .
But with generators , the execution control can be given up in the middle of the routine and later restored .
One way to look at it is that the code in the generator is dependent on the caller to call repeatedly to activate each " segment " of the processing .
Some sample code will help you grop generators ( taken from Brendan Eich 's quick description of generators ) :
" yield " in a function makes a generator :
function count( n : int ) {
for ( let i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)
yield i ;
}
A generator function returns an iterator , which exposes a method called " next " :
var gen = count ( 10 ) ;
gen.next ( ) ; // returns 0 ;
. . .;
gen.next ( ) ; // returns 9
gen.next ( ) ; // throws StopIteration
Iterators also support " send " and " throw " methods :
gen.send ( value ) ; // passes value back to yield
gen.throw ( exception ) ; // throws exception from yield
As you can see , generators offer much of what 's needed to let our " threads " relinquish control , pause and restart , at least if our threads are single functions .
But if you need to have sub-functions called as part of the thread , generators fall short .
As Neil puts it : " generators are unable to yield across multiple frames in the callstack " .
This is where his library comes in .
It lets you write generators which call sub- generators , and it saves the state of an entire thread , when it gets paused , as a stack of paused generators .
The framework takes care of adding a new stack frame when a generator returns a sub-generator , lets the sub - generator segments get executed , and passes the value or exception returned by the sub - generator back to the calling frame ( see gen.send ( value ) function above ) .
This is called trampolining generators .
Here 's a code example for a thread , when using the library .
Note that " sleep " " waitForInput " and " animateUI " are themselves generators ( ie . they use the " yield " keyword ) .
function myThreadedCall ( ) {
while ( ! ready ) {
yield sleep ( 100 ) ;
}
yield waitForInput ( ) ;
if ( ( yield post ( getInput ( ) ) ) != null ) {
yield animateUI ( ) ;
}
}
Obviously , making use of this multi- threading technique comes with a peculiar coding style , where you have to indicate explicit yield points .
This approach does however avoid some of the more complex concurrency problems ( atomic operations on shared state ) .
It is good to see how the limits of javascript getting challenged with every incremental feature added to the language .
And even though I have n't used this approach and I do n't know if I 'm going to use it any time soon , the technique is fascinating and definitely great mental exercise .
The library code is pretty small , about 150 lines of code , and is worth reading to get a better sense of the trampoline design .

Several details of its dentition place the ape in a class of its own
The ancient ape appears to be a close relative of the last common ancestor of gorillas , chimps and humans , according to a Kenyan - Japanese team .
The lower jaw bone and 11 teeth , found in volcanic mud deposits in northern Kenya , are unveiled in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Fossils from this critical time period in primate evolution are very rare .
Genetic studies suggest that the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees went along their separate pathways of evolution about five million to seven million years ago .
We have an extra piece in the puzzle of what was going in ape evolution
Prof Fred Spoor
But until now there has been very little fossil evidence unearthed in Africa from the middle - to - late Miocene Epoch ( 12 to 7 million years ago ) , when gorillas , chimps and humans shared a common ancestor .
This has led some experts to propose that apes migrated out of Africa to Europe and Asia , only returning much later .
Study leader Yutaka Kunimatsu of Kyoto University 's Primate Research Institute said the latest findings contradicted the so - called " out of Europe " theory .
" Now , we have a good candidate in Africa , " he said .
" We do not need to think the common ancestor came back from Eurasia to Africa .
I think it is more likely the common ancestor evolved from the apes in the Miocene in Africa . "
Hard diet
The team plans to return to the eastern edge of the Rift valley in Kenya next year to search for more fossils .
Two of the fossil teeth
" The teeth were covered in thick enamel and the caps were low and voluminous , suggesting that the diet of this ape consisted of a considerable amount of hard objects , like nuts or seeds , and fruit , " said Dr Kunimatsu .
" We only have some jaw fragments and some teeth ... but we hope to find other body parts in our future research , " he added .
Professor Fred Spoor , an anatomist at University College , London , UK , said that knowledge of great ape evolution had been hampered by a lack of fossil evidence .
" We have an extra piece in the puzzle of what was going in ape evolution , " he told BBC News .
" Perhaps we might start to understand a little more about the common ancestor of African great apes and humans and whether it lived in Africa or Eurasia . "
The new species has been christened Nakalipithecus nakayamai .
It is the second rare fossil discovery from Africa announced in recent months .
In August , an Ethiopian - Japanese team announced the discovery in Ethiopia of 10 - million - year - old teeth from a previously unknown species of great ape , Chororapithecus abyssinicus .
In a small still mostly segregated section of rural Louisiana , an all white jury heard a series of white witnesses called by a white prosecutor testify in a courtroom overseen by a white judge in a trial of a fight at the local high school where a white student who had been making racial taunts was hit by black students .
The fight was the culmination of a series of racial incidents starting when whites responded to black students sitting under the " white tree " at their school by hanging three nooses from the tree .
The white jury and white prosecutor and all white supporters of the white victim were all on one side of the courtroom .
The black defendant , 17 year old Mychal Bell , and his supporters were on the other .
The jury quickly convicted Mychal Bell of two felonies - aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery .
Bell , who was a 16 year old sophomore football star at the time he was arrested , faces up to 22 years in prison .
Five other black youths await similar trials on attempted second degree murder and conspiracy charges .
Yes , you read that correctly .
The rest of the story , which is being reported across the world in papers in China , France and England , is just as chilling .
The trouble started under " the white tree " in front of Jena High School .
The " white tree " is where the white students , 80 % of the student body , would always sit during school breaks .
In September 2006 , a black student at Jena high school asked permission from school administrators to sit under the " white tree . "
School officials advised them to sit wherever they wanted .
They did .
The next day , three nooses , in the school colors , were hanging from the " white tree . "
The message was clear .
" Those nooses meant the KKK , they meant ' Niggers , we 're going to kill you , we 're going to hang you till you die , ' " Casteptla Bailey , mom of one of the students , told the London Observer .
The Jena high school principal found that three white students were responsible and recommended expulsion .
The white superintendent of schools over - ruled the principal and gave the students a three day suspension saying that the nooses were just a youthful stunt .
" Adolescents play pranks , " the superintendent told the Chicago Tribune , " I do n't think it was a threat against anybody . "
The African - American community was hurt and upset .
" Hanging those nooses was a hate crime , plain and simple , " according to Tracy Bowens , mother of students at Jena High .
But blacks in this area of Louisiana have little political power .
The ten person all - male government of the parish has one African - American member .
The nine member all - male school board has one African American member .
( A phone caller to the local school board trying to find out the racial makeup of the school board was told there was one " colored " member of the board ) .
There is one black police officer in Jena and two black public school teachers .
Jena , with a population of less than 3000 , is the largest town in and parish ( county ) seat of LaSalle Parish , Louisiana .
There are about 350 African Americans in the town .
LaSalle has a population of just over 14,000 people - 12 % African - American .
This is solid Bush and David Duke Country - GWB won LaSalle Parish 4 to 1 in the last two elections ;
Duke carried a majority of the white vote when he ran for Governor of Louisiana .
Families earn about 60 % of the national average .
The Census Bureau reports that less than 10 % of the businesses in LaSalle Parish are black owned .
Jena is the site of the infamous Juvenile Correctional Center for Youth that was forced to close its doors in 2000 , only two years after opening , due to widespread brutality and racism including the choking of juveniles by guards after the youth met with a lawyer .
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the private prison amid complaints that guards paid inmates to fight each other and laughed when teens tried to commit suicide .
Black students decided to resist and organized a sit - in under the " white tree " at the school to protest the light suspensions given to the noose - hanging white students .
The white District Attorney then came to Jena High with law enforcement officers to address a school assembly .
According to testimony in a later motion in court , the DA reportedly threatened the black protesting students saying that if they did n't stop making a fuss about this " innocent prank ...
I can be your best friend or your worst enemy .
I can take away your lives with a stroke of my pen . "
The school was put on lockdown for the rest of the week .
Racial tensions remained high throughout the fall .
On the night of Thursday November 30 , 2006 , a still unsolved fire burned down the main academic building of Jena High School .
On Friday night , December 1 , a black student who showed up at a white party was beaten by whites .
On Saturday , December 2 , a young white man pulled out a shotgun in a confrontation with young black men at the Gotta Go convenience store outside Jena before the men wrestled it away from him .
The black men who took the shotgun away were later arrested , no charges were filed against the white man .
On Monday , December 4 , at Jena High , a white student - who allegedly had been making racial taunts , including calling African American students " niggers " while supporting the students who hung the nooses and who beat up the black student at the off - campus party - was knocked down , punched and kicked by black students .
The white victim was taken to the hospital treated and released .
He attended a social function that evening .
Six black Jena students were arrested and charged with attempted second degree murder .
All six were expelled from school .
The six charged were : 17 - year - old Robert Bailey Junior whose bail was set at $ 138,000 ; 17 - year - old Theo Shaw - bail $ 130,000 ; 18 - year - old Carwin Jones - bail $ 100,000 ; 17 - year - old Bryant Purvis - bail $ 70,000 ; 16 year old Mychal Bell , a sophomore in high school who was charged as an adult and for whom bail was set at $ 90,000 ; and a still unidentified minor .
Many of the young men , who came to be known as the Jena 6 , stayed in jail for months .
Few families could afford bond or private attorneys .
Mychal Bell remained in jail from December 2006 until his trial because his family was unable to post the $ 90,000 bond .
Theo Shaw has also remained in jail .
Several of the other defendants remained in jail for months until their families could raise sufficient money to put up bonds .
The Chicago Tribune wrote a powerful story headlined " Racial Demons Rear Heads . "
The London Observer wrote : " Jena is gaining national notoriety as an example of the new ' stealth ' racism , showing how lightly sleep the demons of racial prejudice in America 's Deep South , even in the year that a black man , Barak Obama , is a serious candidate for the White House . "
The British Broadcasting Company aired a TV special report " Race Hate in Louisiana 2007 . "

The Jena 6 and their families were put under substantial pressure to plead guilty .
Mychal Bell was reported to have been leaning towards pleading guilty right up until his trial when he decided he would not plead guilty to a felony .
When it finally came , the trial of Mychal Bell was swift .
Bell was represented by an appointed public defender .
On the morning of the trial , the DA reduced the charges from attempted second degree murder to second degree aggravated battery and conspiracy .
Aggravated battery in Louisiana law demands the attack be with a dangerous weapon .
The dangerous weapon ?
The prosecutor was allowed to argue to the jury that the tennis shoes worn by Bell could be considered a dangerous weapon used by " the gang of black boys " who beat the white victim .
Most shocking of all , when the pool of potential jurors was summoned , fifty people appeared - every single one white .
The LaSalle Parish clerk defended the all white group to the Alexandria Louisiana Town
Talk newspaper saying that the jury pool was selected by computer .
" The venire [ panel of prospective jurors ] is color blind .
The idea is for the list to truly reflect the racial makeup of the community , but the system does not take race into factor . "
Officials said they had summoned 150 people , but these were the only people who showed up .
The all - white jury which was finally chosen included two people friendly with the District Attorney , a relative of one of the witnesses and several others who were friends of prosecution witnesses .
Bell 's parents , Melissa Bell and Marcus Jones , were not even allowed to attend the trial despite their objections , because they were listed as potential witnesses .
The white victim , though a witness , was allowed to stay in the courtroom .
The parents , who had been widely quoted in the media as critics of the process , were also told they could no longer speak to the media as long as the trial was in session .
Marcus Jones had told the media " It 's all about those nooses " and declared the charges racially motivated .
Other supporters who planned a demonstration in support of Bell were ordered by the court not to do so near the courthouse or anywhere the judge would see them .
The prosecutor called 17 witnesses - eleven white students , three white teachers , and two white nurses .
Some said they saw Bell kick the victim , others said they did not see him do anything .
The white victim testified that he did not know if Bell hit him or not .
The Chicago Tribune reported the public defender did not challenge the all - white jury pool , put on no evidence and called no witnesses .
The public defender told the Alexandria Town talk after resting his case without calling any witnesses that he knew he would be second - guessed by many but was confident that the jury would return a verdict of not guilty .
" I do n't believe race is an issue in this trial ... I think I have a fair and impartial jury ... "
The jury deliberated for less than three hours and found Mychal Bell guilty on the maximum possible charges of aggravated second degree battery and conspiracy .
He faces up to a maximum of 22 years in prison .
The public defender told the press afterwards , " I feel I put on the best defense that I could . "
Responding to criticism of not putting on any witnesses , the attorney said " why open the door for further accusations ?
I did the best I could for my client , Mychal Bell . "
At a rally in front of the courthouse the next day , Alan Bean , a Texas minister and leader of the Friends of Justice , said " I have seen a lot of trials in my time .
And I have never seen a more distressing miscarriage of justice than what happened in LaSalle Parish yesterday . "
Khadijah Rashad of Lafayette Louisiana described the trial as a " modern day lynching . "
Tory Pegram with the Louisiana ACLU has been working with the parents for months .
" People know if they do n't demand equal treatment now , they will never get it .
People 's jobs and livelihoods have been threatened for attending Jena 6 Defense meetings , but people are willing to risk that .
One person told me : ' We have to convince more people to come rally with us ..... What 's the worst that could happen ?
They fire us from our jobs ?
We have the worst jobs in the town anyway .
They burn a cross on our lawns or burn down my house ?
All of that has happened to us before .
We have to keep speaking out to make sure it does n't happen to us again , or our children will never be safe . ' "
Whites in the community were adamant that there is no racism .
" We do n't have a problem , " according to one .
Other locals told the media " We all get along , " and " most blacks are happy with the way things are . "
One person even said " We do n't have many problems with our blacks . "
Melvin Worthington , the lone African American school board member in LaSalle Parish said it all could have been avoided .
" There 's no doubt about it , " he told the Chicago Tribune , " whites and blacks are treated differently here .
The white kids should have gotten more punishment for hanging those nooses .
If they had , all the stuff that followed could have been avoided . "
Hebert McCoy , a relative of one of the youths who has been trying to raise money for bail and lawyers , challenged people everywhere at the end of the rally when he said " You better get out of your houses .
You better come out and defend your children ... because they are incarcerating them by the thousands .
Jena 's not the beginning , but Jena has crossed the line .
Justice is not right when you put on the wrong charges and then convict .
I believe in justice .
I believe in the point of law .
I believe in accepting the punishment if I 'm guilty .
If I 'm guilty , convict me and punishment , but if I 'm innocent , no justice ... " and the crowd joined with him and shouted " no peace ! "
What happened to the white guys ?
The white victim of the beating was later arrested for bringing a hunting rifle loaded with 13 bullets onto the high school campus and released on $ 5000 bond .
The white man who beat up the black youth at the off - campus party was arrested and charged with simple battery .
The white students who hung up the nooses in the " white tree " were never charged .
The people in Jena are fighting for justice and they need legal and financial help .
Since the arrests , a group of family members have been holding well - attended meetings , and have created a defense fund - the Jena 6 Defense Committee .
They have received support from the NAACP , the Louisiana ACLU and Friends of Justice .
People interested in supporting can contact : the Jena 6 Defense Committee , PO Box 2798 , Jena , LA 71342 jena6defense@gmail.com ; Friends of Justice , 507 North Donley Avenue , Tulia , TX 79088 www.fojtulia.org; or the ACLU of Louisiana , PO Box 56157 , New Orleans , LA 70156 www.laaclu.org or 417.350.0536 .
What is next ?
The rest of the Jena 6 await similar trials .
Theodore Shaw is due to go on trial shortly .
Mychal Bell is scheduled to be sentenced July 31 .
If he gets the maximum sentence he will not be out of prison until he is nearly 40 .
Meanwhile , the " white tree " outside Jena High sits quietly in the hot sun .

I reported the other day that your cell phone records are on sale online for anyone to buy , without your permission .
Well , this morning AMERICAblog bought former presidential candidate , and former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO ( SACEUR ) , General Wesley Clark 's cell phone records for one hundred calls made over three days in November 2005 , no questions asked .
( Clark 's cell phone provider is Omnipoint Communications , which seems to be related to T - Mobile . )
All we needed was General Clark 's cell phone number and our credit card , and 24 hours later we had one hundred calls the general made on his cell phone in November .
The calls included a number of calls to Arkansas , to foreign countries , and at least one call to a prominent reporter at the Washington Post .
To ensure that we actually had General Clark 's correct cell phone number , we called the number this morning and the voice mail recording that answered said :
" Hi , this is Wes Clark , leave a message [ unintelligible ] . "
We have subsequently called that number and spoken to a real person to confirm its authenticity , and to make sure General Clark was aware of this issue and what we were doing .
This is clearly outrageous .
But let me first say , as an aside , that I bought my own Cingular Wireless phone records this past weekend and reported on it on AMERICAblog .
I would n't do this to any other public person without first doing it to myself .
But even after reporting on this gross violation of my ( and your ) personal privacy , Congress , the Administration , and the phone companies have yet to act effectively .
( And they have known about it since at least this past July when the Washington Post reported on it . )
So we decided to attempt to buy the records of a celebrity , so to speak .
And we unfortunately succeeded .
I also want to say a quick aside about General Clark .
I was a big fan of his presidential campaign , and he was the first candidate I supported .
This effort was not meant in any way as a slight to the general .
We wanted to see if it was possible to buy the phone records of someone high profile in order to prove that this is a problem with serious national security implications , and frankly , we did n't want to pick a Republican since we thought such a choice would be perceived as partisan or mean - spirited , and that is not our intent for exposing this .
Our intent is to get this problem fixed so that we all can benefit .
I bought my records via the Web site LocateCell for $ 110 .
We bought General Clark 's records via the Web site CellTolls for $ 89.95 .
It is possible that both sites are run by the same company .
Interestingly , we tried to get the cell phone records of other high - profile Washingtonians like ABC's George Stephanopoulos , the Washington Post 's Dana Milbank , and the New York Time 's Adam Nagourney , but LocateCell was unable to provide me with their records ( possibly because those three use Verizon as their cell phone service , or possibly because LocateCell was on to me ) .
We are in the process of trying to obtain additional records .
The following is the list we received from CellTolls detailing 100 consecutive phone calls either placed or received on General Clark 's cell phone from November 15 to 18 , 2005 .
The company only gives you 100 calls , then you have to pay more for additional calls .
We have blacked out all but the last two digits of every phone number , including General Clark 's cell phone number , in order to protect his privacy and the privacy of anyone he has been in contact with .
This will permit General Clark , and at least one Washington Post reporter , to confirm that the record is legit .
The only question now remaining is why President Bush , our leaders in Congress , and our wireless phone companies ( at the very least T - Mobile and Cingular , whose customers ' records are available online to anyone ) have known about this problem for at least six months but have yet to fix it .
PS CBS News is going to report on the cell records privacy scandal tonight ( 1/12/06 ) on their evening news broadcast .
