It may have taken Ridley Scott 30 years to come around to the idea of revisiting Alien , but he certainly seems to be focused on the task in hand .
Earlier this week , at the Hero Complex festival in Los Angeles , Scott confirmed that he is planning two prequels to his 1979 slasher - in - space , with both most likely to be shot in 3D .
And he talked a little more about the previously - revealed focus of the two films : the mysterious giant " space jockey " , long since dead and wrapped in an ivory - like suit or exoskeleton , which the doomed crew of the Nostromo walk by as they are investigating the planetoid in the iconic first movie .
" I sat thinking about the franchise , which died on the road way back and was lying in the dust , and I thought , ' What I should do is go back , ' " said Scott during an on - stage interview at the event .
" In the first Alien , when John Hurt climbed up and over the top of the rise there was a massive giant lying in a chair .
The chair was either a form of engine or some piece of technology , and I always thought : no one has ever asked ' Who was the space jockey ? '
Inside the suit is a being .
" What we 're going to try to do is squeeze in two prequels … because if you explain who [ the space jockey ] was and where he came from , then you may want to … go to the place where his people came from . "
All of which sounds suitably intriguing , particularly when coupled with suggestions that the prequels will focus on the terraforming of new worlds : was the space jockey on some sort of mission to transform the planetoid into a suitable environment for his people ?
And could the xenomorphs have been bred as the perfect killing machines designed to wipe out current occupants as part of this process ?
Scott has theorised previously that the crashed ship explored by the Nostromo crew might have been a weapons carrier capable of dropping Alien eggs onto a planet so that the Aliens could use the local life forms as hosts , which would tally .
Of course , there are a number of issues here .
James Cameron has proved with Avatar that you do n't have to use human protagonists to keep people interested in the motivations of your central characters .
And yet the idea of making the space jockey race integral to the plot does seem tonally inappropriate .
If the new films are to feel like Alien movies , they surely need to maintain the atmosphere of claustrophobic uncertainty and suspense that made the first two films such masterful works .
Spinning off into a galaxy - wide saga to investigate the origin of various races feels more like Star Trek or Star Wars to my mind .
Plus , the CGI work required to create the creatures and their world would be astronomical - the concept seems like a hugely ambitious venture that risks falling into the kind of territory George Lucas struggled with in the disappointing prequels to his trilogy .
The technology may exist now for us to paint entirely new worlds on the big screen , but nine times out of 10 they end up looking pretty ropey .
On the other hand , if Scott were to use the humans who originally crash - landed on the planetoid as the basis of the storyline , he runs straight into the main obstacle of making a prequel : we already know what happens ( everybody dies ) .
The film - maker has said that the central figure in the first film will once again be human ( and female ) : but how much fun will it be to watch a movie in which the Ripley character must inevitably end up getting slaughtered ?
Right now , we have to trust Scott to do the right thing , and , at the very least , he 's already been thinking hard about how to shoot in stereo without losing the dark visual tone of the original film ( decent 3D is notoriously hard to achieve in low levels of light ) .
Head on over to Ain't It Cool , who grabbed six minutes with the director after his Hero Complex appearance , for all the techy details – but suffice to say , Scott reckons he can darken the picture in post - production to create an appropriately gloomy visual experience .
According to the film - maker , the screenplay for the first Alien prequel is complete , and I 'm most definitely intrigued to see what he and his team have come up with .
I 've already mentioned that the movie needs to look like an Alien film , but , on the other hand , it needs to avoid becoming a shallow retread of the original .
One last thought before I leave you to your own speculation : HR Giger , the Oscar - winning Swiss artist who played such a huge part in the design of the original alien and its lair , is still alive , aged 70 , although he apparently retired from painting a couple of years ago .
For a truly spectacular reimagining , and a chance at adding some genuine originality to the new films , would n't it be worth Scott giving him a call ?

Dennett – Religion Is An Excuse To Stop Thinking ( Video )
Dan Dennett talks about how religions offer a “ goldenplated excuse to stop thinking ” and that people have got to stop playing the “ faith card ” in debates .
I think he puts it brilliantly .

The great kingdom of “ Palestine ” once existed within Syrian and Turkish boundaries , a University of Tennessee professor claimed in a statement released Tuesday .
Prof. J. P. Dessel , who is a member of the Tell Tayinat archeological digs in Turkey and who presided at the Haifa University Ancient East Research Conference , asserted that the commonwealth had been located between the cities of Aleppo , Hama and Antakya , and the Turkish - Syrian border in the 12th and 11th centuries BCE .
The find is significant because it indicates that the ancient Philistine empire was not limited to the lands of Canaan .
Following the collapse of the Hittite dynasty in the 13th century BCE , smaller states sprung up in areas that had previously been underHittite rule – one of which was Palestine .
In his lecture , Desselexplained that this had been concluded from newfound evidence unearthedin the Tell Tayinat excavations .
Hittite hieroglyphics were found on the Antakya site , reading “ Palestine . ”
Similar hieroglyphics were found in Aleppo and Hama .
“ This is a significant discovery which shows that the Philistines didnot just hold land in Israel , but in Syria as well , ” said HaifaUniversity Prof.
Gershon Glil , the conference coordinator .
' Divided ' Katy Perry steps out in half - and - half rubber flag dress as she splits her World Cup support
It must have been difficult for Katy Perry to decide who to cheer for during England 's World Cup match against the USA yesterday .
As an American , but with a British fiancé in the form of comedian Russell Brand , her loyalties were clearly divided .
So instead of choosing to back one side or the other , Katy Perry showed her support for both teams when she stepped out wearing a rubber dress which had one half made from a Union Jack flag and the other from an American Flag .
' Divided ' : Katy Perry shows her loyalties as she steps out in a half - and - half rubber dress made of a Union Jack and American flag in London last night
Excited :
The singer tweeted after England 's first World Cup match that she was pleased with the 1 - 1 draw result
The 25 - year - old star showed off her amazing figure in the super tight outfit as she left her hotel in London after watching the show to head over for an interview on James Corden 's World Cup Live chat show .
However , before leaving the hotel , Katy was thrown into a panic when she was told the specially - made dress was on a flight which had been delayed .
She tweeted : ' Another amazing race for a dress has happen again .
Important dress .
It 's on a plane now , but plane had 2 emergency stop cuz someone passed away mid flight !
So sad !
' So we 'll see if the dress makes it in time ...
If not , my world cup convo is gonna take a beating on the chat show . '
Tight :
The unforgiving rubber dress showed off Katy 's amazingly toned figure
But clearly the dress arrived in one piece , as Katy stepped out looking thrilled with her new outfit last night .
And she was equally excited by the 1 - 1 draw score between England and America , tweeting : 'EVERYBODY WINS !!!
I LIKE THAT !
( Plus as an american marrying a englishman ... I am DIVIDED ) '
Katy is currently in the UK promoting her new album , as well as preparing for her role as guest judge on The X Factor .
Talent show bosses confirmed on Friday that Katy would be one of the four celebrity judges standing in for Dannii Minogue , who is in Australia preparing for the birth of her first child next month .
Geri Halliwell has already presided over the Glasgow auditions , Natalie Imbruglia will step in at Birmingham this weekend , with Pixie Lott and Perry expected at either the Dublin , Cardiff or Manchester auditions later this month or in early July .
The world ’s largest technology company by market capitalization may soon rival the National Security Agency in its ability to track Americans using their cell phones .
Apple Inc. is now tracking the “ precise , ” “ real - time geographic location ” of iPhones , iPads and Macintosh computers — and has unwittingly gotten its customers to sign off on their being tracked by making a little - noticed modification to the language in its apps store .

The company ’s “ partners and licensees ” will now be able to collect and store data about your location .
Apple ’s new privacy policy comes in the wake of a new “ Find my iPhone ” app the company approved which allows users to recover their lost phones using AT&T ’s location services .
Tracking digital consumers by location is nothing new .
Websites routinely receive information about their users ’ locations in order to serve relevant advertising .

But Apple ’s new terms and conditions allow it to store information about users ’ exact locations , a level of privacy intrusion not heretofore seen .
Websites can tell users ’ locations down to a zip code , generally speaking , but they neither store nor track exact locations — which Apple and AT&T can do using triangulation down to about ten feet .
( AT&T , if you remember , was a participant in the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping program , which allows the US government to track the phone numbers called by its citizens abroad .
A whistleblower said that AT&T in fact had its own spy room in San Francisco for the government . )

Adds The Los Angeles Times :
The company says the data is anonymous and does not personally identify users .
Analysts have shown , however , that large , specific data sets can be used to identify people based on behavior patterns .
An increasing number of iPhone apps ask users for their location , which is then used by the application or even uploaded to the app ’s maker .
Apps like the Twitter application Tweetie and Google Maps make frequent use of location data , either to help the user get oriented geographically or to associate the user ’s action with a specific location ( as when a tweet is geotagged ) .
Apple says in its privacy policy that it uses personal information to “ improve our services , content , and advertising . ”
On Monday , Apple also rolled out its new advertising platform , iAd , for the latest version of its iPhone operating system ( iOS 4 ) .
The company may well be integrating the location information into its advertising system — for instance , to help local shops sell coupons to users in the neighborhood .

Ron Frazier , pro and amatuer boxing trainer at the Las Vegas Xtreme Couture was recently interviewed by FightHype.com on a wide variety fo subjects
Percy Crawford : Diego Sanchez is a guy that ’s never looked too healthy at 155 to me , but he ’s always looked too small at 170 .
He fought a young and hungry guy at UFC 114 .
He ’s in a tough situation , but what weight class would you like to see him fight at ?
Ron Frazier : Unfortunately for Diego , I think he ’s a tweener .
I do n’t think he has the skill set to keep pace with the A - level 55 er ’s .
I think you will see the same things happen to him that happened against BJ Penn .
Maybe not as dramatic , because BJ has so much power , but those guy ’s skill set are better than his at 55 .
It ’s a big cut for him , but he ’s not a big 170 - pounder .
He ’s fighting guys there that are coming down from 190 , so he ’s at a big strength disadvantage there .
He ’s probably a guy that would be best between 160 and 165 , but unfortunately for him , they do n’t have that weight class .
PC : Ron , you ’re an African American trainer and that ’s rare in itself in the sport of mixed martial arts .
This past event saw , for the first time , two African American fighters headline a UFC event .
Do you think we will see more of this with up - and - coming stars like Anthony Johnson and Jon Jones on the horizon ?
RF : We ’ll see .
A couple of years ago , I did an article , and I think ESPN did it during Black History month , talking about black fighters in MMA .
Rashad and Rampage was kind of the watershed moment to have them headline the main event .
We will see what the numbers are .
We ’ll see how many fighters will come after them and hopefully they will .
MMA is still going to be a college man ’s sport ; a guy that went to college and wrestled and kind of found himself fall into mixed martial arts .
Bottom line is MMA is not a poverty sport like boxing is .
That ’s why you ’re going to see , unfortunately , a lot of Latin fighters , black fighters and poor white fighters in boxing because they have no other options .
In boxing , you do n’t have to have a whole lot of money .
To do MMA , you have to have 3 to 4 different disciplines .
You have to have boxing , which is the cheapest of it .
You gotta learn wrestling , which is not an inexpensive thing , and neither is Jiu Jitsu .
We ’ll see .
I think you ’re going to see …when it is a black fighter , it ’s not going to be the Mike Tyson type of fighter who came up from the hood and came up the hard way .
You have Rampage and a couple of other ones , but for the most part , a lot of the guys you see , whether black or white , in mixed martial arts have gone through college .
But if you look at Rashad , Jon Jones , Josh Koscheck , Anthony Johnson and Frank Trigg … although I do n’t know if we should count him as black because he ’s some of everything ( laughing ) .

One of the duties of a superpower is playing the role of therapist for your friends — which is precisely the task the U.S. performed this week to lower the temperature in a crisis between two crucial allies , Israel and Turkey .
The counseling began before dawn on Monday , shortly after Israeli commandos boarded a flotilla of six ships trying to run a blockade to deliver supplies to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , and killed eight Turks in the ensuing fracas .
The ...
Are you ready for interesting times and an exodus from the United States ?
A possibly apocryphal ancient Chinese curse goes “ May you live in interesting times . ”
Those words may derive from an authentic Chinese proverb : “ It is better to be a dog in a peaceful time than be a man in chaos . ”
Either way , the message is easy to understand for anyone living in the summer of 2010 .
As I look over at Lucky , my golden retriever whose only concerns are when do we eat and when do we go back in the ocean to play ball , I can see the advantages of being a dog .
But as a man I know it is time to defend my freedom and secure my wealth for myself and for my posterity .
The U.S. is wandering through a fake recovery , an expanding sovereign debt crisis , a stock market downturn and a double - dip real estate collapse .
Meanwhile , the Swiss franc is moving to historic highs to the euro .
And what does the conventional press want to tell us about ?
The “ strong ” dollar , who ’s to blame for the oil disaster , the newest episodes in a host of foreign and domestic political soap operas and — a fresh diversion — which politicians are telling the biggest lies about their military records .
Welcome to the Fake , Jobless Economic Recovery
Last Friday , The Feds announced that the U.S. economy has added 431,000 jobs .
The boldest spokespersons tried to announce this as good news , but the details revealed that only 40,000 of the total are private - sector jobs — the kind that produce things people want and are willing to pay for .
The rest are little more than assignments in make - work projects designed to buy votes and beef - up the statistics on a fake recovery .
The American financial press asks hourly , “ Will the euro survive as a currency ? ”
And every time , the question is a prelude to “ Again the dollar ’s strength indicates it remains the world ’s safe - haven reserve currency . ”
My response is , “ Oh , really ? ” This is just more lies from Washington and Wall Street that you believe at your peril .
“ Lies , damnable lies and statistics . ”
It ’s an expression attributed to Benjamin Disraeli , one of my favorite British historical figures .
He was prime minister twice , but in his early years he had been a stock promoter .
When a boom in South American mining stocks collapsed in 1825 , he lost everything , much as a later Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , did in 1929 .
Both Disraeli and Churchill turned to writing to repair their finances ( Disraeli also married a rich widow many years his senior ) .
Again like Churchill , Disraeli went into politics with success , and both secured loans from the Rothschild banks .
Interesting to some , though perhaps not to others .
But British history over the last century is a worthwhile topic for all of us .
It ’s a model of what happens when an empire reaches its pinnacle and then slides into decline .
It ’s a model of what is happening to America today .
The Swiss Franc Benefits
As I ’ve written before , the Swiss National Bank tries to keep the franc aligned with the euro , in order to protect cross - border financial relationships and trade .
If the dollar goes down , usually the euro and Swiss franc both go up .
If the dollar goes up , both the euro and Swiss franc go down , although not always at the same rate .
Just days ago the Swiss franc hit an all - time high verses the euro , so although both have lost some value relative to the dollar , the franc ’s retreat is more modest .
The real challenge for the Swiss National Bank is to limit the franc ’s appreciation when billions of investor euros are flooding into Switzerland and bidding for the local currency .
Contrary to what you ’ll read in the American financial press , the smart money is moving into Switzerland in big volume .
Exodus Then & Now
The establishment media have been covering the challenges to Israel ’s Gaza blockade with references to the excellent 1960 epic / propaganda film , Exodus .
There are quite a few similarities between the British blockade of Palestine in 1947 and what Israel is doing now , including forced boarding in international waters , resistance by ship passengers , the death of Americans , a widely published film record of events and complaints of excessive use of force .
If it ’s presented artfully , overreaction by those in power can feed public support for the target and sometimes allows the weaker party to prevail .
The image of Gandhi and his followers being imprisoned by the British for harvesting salt from the ocean supported the formation of the state of India .
The story of the SS Exodus and the British Navy sending Holocaust survivors back to Germany helped bring about the establishment of Israel .
Pictures of “ Bull ” Connor attacking civil rights protestors in Birmingham , Alabama led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
Whether the Palestinians and their allies will succeed in playing the victim card , time will tell .
The British resistance to the 1947 Exodus demonstrated how incompetent and cruel a collapsing empire can be .
While this might be news to the general public , it is n’t news to freedom - loving entrepreneurs who are making plans to avoid the turmoil , taxes and terror coming from our desperate politicians in Washington .
Hence the exodus from America of productive , innovative Americans acting to get themselves and their wealth out before it is too late .
This outflow of talent and wealth does n’t get much coverage in the establishment news media .
The media are too busy with the pushing and shoving in the Middle East , the sovereign debt problems in Europe , the volatility of the U.S. markets and the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Those things are important ( the oil trail from the Gulf may eventually run past my home in the U.S. , which is on a coastal island ) .
But an exodus from the Land of Immigrants is a far bigger story .
Saving what is left of the American Dream calls for you to get at least your wealth outside the disaster zone of Washington incompetence , as one remarkable American is now doing .
The New American Exodus Begins With Entrepreneur Steve Wynn
On May 28 , Steve Wynn , the entrepreneur who led the rebirth and explosive expansion of the Las Vegas Strip in the early 1990 ’s , made it clear that he ’s had enough of the United States government .
To listen to his astounding CNBC interview , Click Here .
In just 4 minutes , Winn lays out a shocking indictment and heartfelt critique of the failures of Washington and the U.S. political system .
Here are some excerpts :
“ The climate for business is frightening here , ” he says , and that ’s why he ’s moving half his operation to Macau .
“ Common sense has disappeared in Washington DC . ”
“ There ’s more stability and predictability in China than in Washington these days . ”
“ Those hypocritical SOBs in Congress , the one thing they did n’t do in the new healthcare law was to control frivolous lawsuits . ”
“ We ’re on our way to Greece , in the hands of a confused , foolish government .
It ’s got to stop .
It ’s got to stop . ”
That ’s the verdict from the 468th richest man in the world .
The successful , the best and the brightest are heading to the lifeboats .
Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild boasted , “ I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets .
The man that controls Britain ’s money supply controls the British Empire , and I control the British money supply . ”
What Rothschild said about England is just as true today in the United States .
All political offices , from prime minister to president , congress and parliament , can be vacated by election , threat , bribe or scandal .
The incumbents all serve at the pleasure of international monetary elites and their allied interests ; an officeholder is merely a front man on a long leash .
He has plenty of freedom to pursue pet projects and policies as long as he does n’t stray from the reservation and threaten key policy and legislative goals .
Most economic , political and military events are just business as usual for financial elites and the industries beholden to them .
They take advantage of real or contrived economic crises , military operations and foreign conflicts the way stockbrokers churn stocks to generate commissions .
The collateral damage , causalities , wealth transfers , confiscation and mass hardship are just tricks of the trade .
Steve Wynn did n’t become the 468th richest man in the world without knowing the odds and understanding that the house always wins .
If he thinks the game is rigged here in the U.S. , I suggest you join him by cashing in your chips and securing your wealth so that one day you can play again in a game with reasonable odds and fair returns .
It ’s time to head for the cashier window , settle up and get out of the American casino .

Two prominent climate experts , including one from the University of Arizona , are calling for a " no- regrets " strategy for planning for a hotter and drier western North America .
Their advice : use water conservatively and continue developing ways to harness energy from the sun , wind and Earth .
Jonathan Overpeck , principal investigator with the Climate Assessment for the Southwest at the UA , and Bradley Udall , director of the Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado , write in the June 25 issue of the journal Science that such an approach is necessary for coping with a wide range of projected future climate changes in the West and Southwest .
In their overview of shifting climate in the region , Overpeck and Udall cite published findings of prevalent signs of change : rising temperatures , earlier snowmelt , northward - shifting winter storms , increasing precipitation intensity and flooding , record - setting drought , plummeting Colorado River reservoir storage , widespread vegetation mortality and more large wildfires .
" The West , and especially the Southwest , is leading the nation in climate change -- warming , drying , less late - winter snowpack and drought -- as well as the impacts of this change , " said Overpeck , a UA professor of geosciences and atmospheric sciences and co-director of the Institute of the Environment .
In the past 10 years , temperatures in almost all areas in western North America have surpassed the 20th century average , many by more than 1 or even 2 degrees Fahrenheit .
The warming has decreased late - season snowpack , which serves as a water reservoir , as well as the annual flow of the Colorado River , the researchers said .
Those reductions , combined with the worst drought observed since 1900 , have n't helped matters ; water storage in Lakes Powell and Mead , the largest southwestern water reservoirs , fell nearly 50 percent between 1999 and 2004 and has not risen significantly since .

In addition to water , vegetation is feeling the effects of climate change .
Work by UA 's David Breshears and colleagues have already showed that more than 1 million hectares of piñon pine have died in the Southwest in the last few decades from a lethal combination of record - high temperatures and uncommonly severe drought .
In addition , the frequency of large wildfires has increased as snowpack has decreased .
While researchers are confident that the higher temperatures and resulting changes in snowpack , Colorado River flow , vegetation mortality and wildfires are human - caused , they do n't know whether the drought that has plagued the West for the last 10 years -- the worst since record - keeping began -- is because of humans , Overpeck said .
" It 's critical to determine the causes of the observed change , including the drought , because then we will have a much improved ability to say what 's coming next , in the future , " Overpeck said .
To complicate issues , studies published to date suggest that Colorado River flow could continue to decrease by 20 percent by 2050 , with severe implications for cities served by Colorado River water and for agricultural production .
" One thing is for sure , " Overpeck said .
" The best strategy now -- the no-regrets strategy -- is to prepare for a hotter and drier West , Southwest and Arizona , and to make sure we do n't commit water to things now in ways that could make water shortages in the future more difficult to deal with . "
Fortunately , Overpeck said , scientists have a better understanding about potential future climate change in western North America than for many other regions around the globe , making it easier for policy makers to plan coping strategies .
The researchers also point to the region 's potential wealth of solar , wind and geothermal renewable energy production .
" That offers a way to make up economically for the costs that will be incurred in adapting to the warmer , drier conditions , " Overpeck said .
" And it will have the side benefit of decreasing the chances , through reducing greenhouse gas emissions , for potentially greater human - caused climate change . "
More than 1000 people have gathered at a park in Sydney to voice their support for Israel and the country 's " fight against terrorism " .
The pro-Israeli rally follows protests across Australia denouncing Israel 's killing of nine people aboard Turkish aid ships bound for Gaza earlier this month .
Demonstrators in Sydney and Perth , as well as internationally , have also expressed their outrage over Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
Others have come out in support of Israel , and " for peace of democracy in the Middle East " .
Speaking in North Bondi on Monday , protest organiser Natalie Green said about 1200 people had gathered at Barracluff Park to show " the Australian community stands in solidarity with Israel " .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
If the euro ’s potential as a perfect “ anti- dollar ” in world currency reserves has been stunted by an existential euro zone debt crisis , more radical rethinking of the global monetary system may now gain momentum .

Governments around the world have for decades bristled at U.S. “ seigniorage ” from providing the world ’s de facto reserve currency -- what France ’s Valery Giscard d’Estaing in the 1960s called America ’s “ exorbitant privilege . ”
China , Russia , Brazil and the International Monetary Fund now all want a greater use and sponsorship of Special Drawing Rights -- a basket of dollars , euros , yen and sterling that acts as a claim on the IMF and its 186 member countries and a supra-national reserve asset .
In essence , reserve status -- however well earned -- allows the U.S. to simply print more dollars to buy dollar - priced global goods such as oil and commodities .
And any resulting drop in its exchange rate earns U.S. entities a tidy margin on overseas assets while foreigners ’ dollar reserves are devalued .
Fear of this potential conflict of interest between the domestic and international policy obligations of the reserve currency country , the so - called Triffin Dilemma , has intensified in recent years as global hard - cash reserves soared past $ 8 trillion ( 5.44 trillion pounds ) and U.S. deficits ballooned .
The euro , which cut the dollar share of world reserves by almost 10 percentage points to 62 percent since launch in 1999 , held out some chance of dividing the risks .
But if the euro , which now accounts for more than a quarter of world reserves , has been hit by at least a temporary roadblock , then what next ?
Few policymakers , including many in the United States , want to rebuild a uni-polar system that has fostered a timebomb of global imbalances between America and the developing world -- imbalances at least partly for to blame for three years of devastating financial crises .
What is more , the dollar - centric system has periodically led to acute dollar shortages in global banks still heavily dependent on dollar funding .
Even U.S. Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke last month said foreign banks may need to be weaned off their over - dependency and said the Fed should not necessarily provide a “ permanent service ” of pumping dollars overseas .
China -- which alone holds more than a quarter of world reserves -- and other developing countries remain anxious of the scale of their collective $ 4 trillion exposure to U.S. fiscal and monetary probity .
But with euro angst a new backdrop , more finance chiefs from the world ’s top 20 economies -- meeting in South Korea this week -- may think beyond even the dual - currency setup .
SUPRA -NATIONAL RESERVE ASSET
Just over a year ago , China ’s central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan put the case for developing the SDR -- currently only 4 percent of world stockpiles -- as a reserve asset and advocated inclusion of its yuan in the basket , a five - yearly review of which is due later in 2010 .
A month after Zhou ’s paper , and after a gap of 30 years , the unit was revived as a tool to ease the financial raging crisis and the IMF transferred an allocation of $ 250 billion in SDRs to all members based on their quotas at the Fund .
Paulo Nogueira Batista , who represents Brazil and eight other countries at the IMF board , told Reuters last week this could be used again in a fresh bout of stress .
One advantage of the SDR is that , as an IOU , it need not be realized unless the reserves themselves have to be spent .
Given much of the buildup of reserves has been far in excess of what would be required in any emergency , use of the SDR as an asset could have a less distorting impact on capital flows than requiring the creation of more and more dollar and euro assets .
Its big disadvantage , at least for the 43 reserve managers polled by Central Banking Publications late last year , is that issuance requires political agreement and liquidity is questionable due to a lack of use in the private sector .
Independent analysts reckon the dollar ’s primary status should not nor could not vanish over a few years .
But many see gradual development of the SDR alongside the existing world currencies as desirable over the decade ahead .
One proposal this week from the World Economic Forum ’s year - long Global Redesign programme was to make SDR allocations on a regular basis in amounts to satisfy on - going demand for official reserves .
It suggested $ 200 billion per year .
A report led by think tank Chatham House in March detailed measures to expand SDR usage , including an independent IMF body to decide on new issuance ; creation of an IMF substitution account where countries can swap constituent currencies for SDRs ; and encouragement of private use by allowing SDR securities and settlement systems to be created .
Big banks too see the argument strengthening .
“ Providing more SDR assets would spread out the gains from seigniorage more broadly and also reduce the structural risks associated with requiring the U.S. to pump out more dollar assets for the still - growing stock of overall reserves , ” Goldman Sachs said last week .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner accused an Iranian bank and 22 energy and insurance companies today of " helping Iran finance nuclear and missile programs and to evade international sanctions . "
Geithner banned American individuals and companies from doing business with companies identified as aiding Iran 's nuclear program and ordered their U.S. assets frozen .
The U.S. action is meant to bolster last week 's decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose the " toughest sanctions ever imposed on the Iranian government , " Geithner said .
He indicated there will be more to come .
" In the coming weeks , we will continue to increase the financial pressure on Iran , " Geithner said .
" We will continue to target Iran 's support for terrorist organizations . "
Iran will " scramble " to evade the sanctions by " hiding behind front companies , doctoring wire transfers , falsifying shipping documents , " predicted Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey , a Geithner deputy who joined his boss in the White House briefing room today .
To foil those efforts , Levey announced the appointment of a veteran diplomatic hand , Robert Einhorn .
He 'll be charged with ensuring that the United States and its allies effectively step up the financial pressure on Iran .

The Anatomy of an Underdog : Serbia at the World Cup 2010
Which country at the World Cup can say that it has at its helm one of only two people to manage both Real Madrid and Barcelona ?
Someone who also played for the ever fashionable Luton Town in the 80s , this bloke really knows how to travel does n’t he ?
The country is Serbia , the man is Radomir Antić , and under his leadership Serbia have assembled an underrated team which , according to Antić has “ fantastic team spirit ” .
The authors of Soccernomics , using a formula that would cause even the most statistically minded football fans a headache , predict that Serbia will make it to the final , but will subsequently lose to Brazil .
These predictions may not endear the authors to your stereotypical English “ Eleven against Eleven , anything can happen ” commentator .
They use logarithms based on a formula combining population , GDP per capita and experience to predict the result of games and I would n’t attempt to explain it to the car flag flying , England shirt wearing hoards who seem to have no tactical awareness beyond ‘ get in their faces ’ .
Indeed , the Serbia squad are very capable of causing an upset .
The blend is well balanced and exciting ; a strong defence in Vidić , Ivanović , Subotić and Kolarov ( a Mourinho target no less ) and a dogged , but talented midfield with strength in the centre and creative wide men .
In particular Miloš Krasić , a player reminiscent of Pavel Nedvěd , in playing style , aspiration and his flowing golden locks , offers great pace and a fantastic delivery into the forward line , as witnessed during Serbia ’s 6 - 1 win over Bulgaria with his hat - trick of assists .
I just hope he takes his mother ’s old oversized pudding bowl with him wherever he goes after this World Cup .
He reminds me of the rough kid you played against once ; who you suspect had a rather harsher upbringing .
Krasić ’s strengths are complimented by Serbia ’s options in attack .
Antic prefers to play two strikers ; Marko Pantelić , and Nikola Žigić , an absolute obelisk with the ability to score both in , and outside the box .
Nikola made his name for Red Star scoring 47 in 79 games , and his potential was reflected in a transfer to Valencia for € 20 million , although his stock has fallen recently moving to Birmingham City for just £ 6 million , he still possesses formidable talent .
The team is strong , direct and look to exploit space behind the opposition ’s defence , as well as offering a great threat from set - pieces .
A classic example is the goals scored in the 5 - 0 and 3 - 2 games against Romania in qualifying , where every goal was produced through Krasić ’s invention or from a set piece delivery .
In both games , they played in their preferred 4 - 4 - 2 formation which relies on a strong midfield to distribute the ball quickly to Jovanović or Krasić .
Jovanović offers a different threat , looking to move into channels between the right - back and centre - back .
He uses his pace to attempt to break through the defence and either have a shot or pull the ball back .
Krasić often moves inside to help with defending and then proceeds to isolate the full - back and run behind him with a quick one - two and burst of pace into the space on the flank which he has created .
Without the ball , Serbia operate very narrow , with Krasić ( marked in red ) often helping out the central midfield ( Milijaš marked yellow ) .
From here he then attempts to exploit the space made from his movement inside , where the Romanians have followed his movement .
This worked exceptionally well in both the home and away fixtures against Romania .
Up front it is clear that Žigić ( blue line ) drops deeper to help defensively whilst Pantelić looks for direct ball from the midfield to either run on to , or to hold up for the deep - lying Žigić who as the cliché goes , has a good touch for a big man .
Žigić often then plays it to the onrushing Jovanović ( brown ) or Krasić ( red ) , as they move into space .
Serbia have a well - organised team with a formidable defence and four pivotal players in attack .
They are more than capable of scoring goals , only three teams ; Spain , England and Germany scored more in qualification .
They should progress past the group stages even though they have quite a tough group with Ghana , Australia and Germany .
I am quite tempted to agree with the Soccernomics prediction , though they are rank outsiders .
Serbia Squad List

We kept to our dedication and our missions .
By these will the State be judged , by the moral character it imparts to its citizens , by the human values determining its inner and outward relations , and by its fidelity , in thought and act , to the supreme behest : " and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . "
Here is crystallized the eternal law of Judaism , and all the written ethics in the world can say no more .
Now that the trackball is connected and tested you can move to the display connector .
Now you do not want to directly solder to the OLED display since it uses a serial connection to communicate with the Arduino and you want to be able to upload new sketches to the Arduino after you have completed the build ( only one serial connection at a time allowed ) .
Use a Dremel ( or other cutting tool ) to cut off one of the pin slots on the Connector Housing 6 pin housing to make it a 5 pin housing .
Also you can cut down the height of the housing so that it does not stick into your wrist as much .
Take the 5 wire piece of the IDE cable from the " Parts Layout " step and crimp the wires into the female pins and insert in the housing .
To increase the strength of the connector ( especially if you cut the height down ) add a hot glue to where the wires come out of the housing .
Solder the other side of the wires to the Arduino as specified in the pin diagram from the " Soldering Connections Diagram " step .
At this point you can use the Arduino Watch software to test the setup .
Upload the software with the display disconnected , then disconnect the power and connect the screen .
You can then power the watch with either the battery or the FTDI .
If everything is working right you should be able to navigate the displays with the trackball and run the programs from the menu screen .
The time screens will just display 0:00 in their various formats .
Moshe Yatom , a prominent Israeli psychiatrist who successfully cured the most extreme forms of mental illness throughout a distinguished career , was found dead at his home in Tel Aviv yesterday from an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound .
A suicide note at his side explained that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who has been his patient for the last nine years , had “ sucked the life right out of me . ”
“ I ca n’t take it anymore , ” wrote Yatom .
“ Robbery is redemption , apartheid is freedom , peace activists are terrorists , murder is self - defense , piracy is legality , Palestinians are Jordanians , annexation is liberation , there ’s no end to his contradictions .
Freud promised rationality would reign in the instinctual passions , but he never met Bibi Netanyahu .
This guy would say Gandhi invented brass knuckes . ”
Psychiatrists are familiar with the human tendency to massage the truth to avoid confronting emotionally troubling material , but Yatom was apparently stunned at what he called the “ waterfall of lies ” gushing from his most illustrious patient .
His personal diary details the steady disintegration of his once invincible personality under the barrage of self - serving rationalizations put forth by Netanyahu .

Former Dexter executive producer / showrunner Clyde Phillips has inked a two - year , seven - figure overall deal at Lionsgate TV .
For Lionsgate , this marks a rare pact with a writer - producer not tied to one of the company ’s flagship series , like Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner , who is under an overall there , as well as Weeds creator Jenji Kohan and her top lieutenant on the show Matthew Salsberg .
But Phillips ’ work on Showtime ’s Dexter , which he joined after the pilot , as well as his background in both comedy and drama ( Phillips also created the Fox dramedy Get Real and created the NBC comedy Suddenly Susan and the Fox half - hour Parker Lewis ) were a major draw , Lionsgate TV president Kevin Beggs said .
“ These days comedy and drama are overlapping on the best cable series , ” Beggs said .
“ And Phillips is the real deal ; it ’s hard to find people who are not only brilliant writers but can also manage a production . ”
Phillips left Dexter following the record - breaking season four finale in December to spend more time with his family in Connecticut .
During each of the four years at the helm of the Showtime series , Phillips spent nine months in Los Angeles , where the show is produced , and three with his wife and his daughter , who is now 13 .
“ I was working so hard on Dexter to support a lifestyle that I was n’t able to live , ” Phillips said in a phone interview from his Connecticut home .
“ I needed to be back here . ”
But he did n’t take a long vacation , instead working on feature and TV ideas and meeting with TV studios interested in bringing him onboard .
“ Lionsgate was the place I wanted to go – they are an aggressive and dynamic company , and I love the stuff they produce : they ’ve always been classy and gracious and courageous . ”
Any series Phillips develops for Lionsgate would be shot on the East Coast , which will keep him close to home ( but out of the house where he ’s been based for the past six months ) .
“ I do n’t think my family would mind me going back to work , ” Phillips quipped .
Such setup would also work for Lionsgate , which has two series , Showtime ’s Nurse Jackie and Fox ’s Running Wilde , filming on the East Coast and has been looking to build a bigger talent roster there .
As for leaving Dexter , CAA - repped Phillips admits it will be strange watching the show as a fan this fall .
“ I can feel it ’s kind of my magnetic north , I feel it ’s pulling at me .
I wish them all well . ”
* Relocation project called unprecedented in scope
* Wildlife officials target 700 to 800 turtle nests
* Eggs to be trucked hundreds of miles to Atlantic Coast ( corrects first name of professor in 16th paragraph )
LOS ANGELES , June 28 ( Reuters ) - U.S. wildlife experts are preparing to collect tens of thousands of endangered sea turtle eggs and move them hundreds of miles away in an unprecedented bid to protect them from the BP Plc BP .
NBP.L oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Plans call for relocating 700 to 800 clutches of eggs left newly buried on the sandy beaches of Alabama and northwestern Florida -- accounting for the bulk of turtle nests in the northern Gulf , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Charles Underwood said on Monday .
“ Relocating sea turtle nests on occasion , nest by nest , in very small numbers , has been done before ( but ) nothing has even been considered at this massive scale , ” Underwood told Reuters .
“ It ’s never been attempted anywhere in the world . ”
Most of the nests designated for removal are those of the loggerhead turtle , the world ’s largest hard - shelled turtle , growing to an average adult weight of 250 pounds ( 113 kg ) .
The loggerhead is the most prevalent of five species of threatened or endangered sea turtles that inhabit the U.S. Gulf Coast .
The project , developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service , the National Marine Fisheries Service and the state of Florida , also will include a handful of nests from other species -- Kemp ’s ridley , leatherback and green turtles .
Concerns about the well - being of turtles have run especially high since the spill began because it coincided with the reptiles ’ breeding season .
While the strategy is largely untested , the grave consequences of leaving the nests undisturbed are certain .
If allowed to hatch on their own without being moved , the baby turtles emerging from those nests would likely swim directly into the mass of crude oil spewing into the Gulf since late April from a ruptured BP well and now encroaching on Alabama and the Florida panhandle .
‘ DEATH SENTENCE ’
“ It ’s almost certainly a death sentence , ” Underwood said .
“ We ’d expect to lose most , if not all of them . ”
Later this month , wildlife teams will begin the painstaking process of digging up eggs from the nests , placing them in special containers covered with sand and shipping them by truck to the Atlantic coast of central Florida .
There the eggs will be kept in temperature - controlled holding facilities until their incubation is complete and they begin to hatch .
The hatchlings will then be carried by hand to the beach and released near the water ’s edge , Underwood said .
At least 50,000 baby turtles are expected to emerge , assuming roughly 70 eggs from each of 700 nests survive the transfer and incubation period .
The clutch size , or number of eggs per nest , generally vary from 100 to 126 eggs , each laid by a single female turtle who may come ashore to nest as many as four times during the spring .
Some 4,000 - plus turtle nesting sites along the beaches of southwestern Florida and the Florida Keys are being left undisturbed because the spill poses a far smaller threat to them , Underwood said .
The success of the relocation remains to be seen , but biologists are taking care to improve the turtles ’ odds such as placing the eggs in storage as closely as possible to their exact orientation in the nests , Underwood said .
According to the Fish and Wildlife Service , more than 550 sea turtles have been found dead and debilitated along the U.S. Gulf Coast to date , about double the number reported a month ago when the agency first began posting daily tallies .
Many were found without visible signs of oil exposure , and further tests are necessary to determine if oil was a culprit , said Dr. Michael Ziccardi , a professor at the University of California at Davis who heads the Oiled Wildlife Care Network .
He has overseen rescue efforts for sea turtles and marine mammals throughout the Gulf since the spill .
One potential spill - related cause of turtle mortality that has raised alarms but remains unconfirmed is the controlled burning of patches of oil slick at the Gulf surface .
Ziccardi said some turtles had “ likely ” perished in the process but “ we do n’t have any evidence to prove it one way or the other . ”
As a precaution , wildlife observers are being assigned to work with the controlled - burn teams to look for and collect turtles around parts of the slick before they are set ablaze , he said .
And no burning is allowed in areas where turtles and other wildlife have been spotted .
The controlled burns are still widely regarded as preferable to letting the slick wash into sensitive coastal areas where they do greater environmental harm , he said .
“ There are trade - offs , ” he said .
“ The Coast Guard has been extremely cooperative on the things we ’re attempting to do to get turtles out of harms ’ way , if possible . ”
" It 's Day 71 of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
They just did a poll that says only 6 percent of Americans have a favorable view of BP , to which I say , 6 percent of Americans have a favorable view of BP ?
That 's 18 million people .
Is it possible that 18 million Americans do n't know what the word favorable means ? "
– Jimmy Kimmel
" BP is running with this , I guess .
Their company newsletter has an article that says most Gulf residents are n't upset with BP because their cleanup crews have boosted the local economy .
BP taking credit for boosting the economy in the Gulf is like Al Qaeda taking credit for creating jobs in airport security . "

– Craig Ferguson
" This Tony Haywire guy , whatever his name is , he told the BBC on Sunday that he believes the new oil cap that they 've installed will eventually capture the vast majority of oil spewing from the well .

how priests handle customer complaints
A satirical customer complaint about prayer shines a light on the problem with telling people you can speak to a deity able to grant your desires in return for obedience and reverence .
Illustration by Koren Shadmi
If you ’ve ever worked in any capacity requiring you to handle customer complaints , you know that quite a few of the requests you ’ll be handling might not be reasonable or valid .
That ’s why sites like Not Always Right post a flood of stories from store clerks , helpdesk operators and retail managers about customers whose demands are probably best left unmet .
To be fair , it seems to me like many of the tales on the site are exaggerated by a person who ca n’t pick up sarcasm or lacking a sense of humor , if not outright fictional for the sake of topping an already posted story .
But there is an interesting story of a complaint about God made to a priest , one we should probably consider a very good question rather than a story about an unreasonable customer .
You see , his issue is very simple .
Why does he keep coming to church if he can’t actually see or talk to God himself ?
Think about it .
He comes to a church every week , a place often called the House of God in Christianity , so one would think that he could at least get a sneak peek at the deity itself and be able to pass along a request .
If an incredibly busy and famous celebrity visits your city , she ’ll at least sign a few autographs or do an interview on the radio or a local news channel , right ?
Why could n’t a deity with an army of middle managing angels do the same thing and descend to its congregations once in a while ?
It would strengthen their beliefs , give hope to those losing their faith , and almost immediately do away with atheism and agnosticism .
In this context , the big complaint about not seeing a God in a place called the House of God makes prefect sense , while the priest ’s patronizing reply seems like a flimsy excuse of a bouncer at a nightclub who ’s trying to explain why two skinny , barely legal girls in skimpy clothing showing off their significant bosoms did n’t have to pay a cover charge and were whisked to the front of the line , and knows not to state the obvious as not to compromise his job .
But as the visitor asks away , the priest is forced to admit that he is not really in direct communication with God and his qualification is being able to pray and read the Bible .
In other words , an employee at a book store has more sway to communicate a customer ’s concerns to the company ’s CEO than a priest can to God .
Then , you are generally expected to fork over around 10 % of your income in donations to an institution which claims that it can put you in touch with God but actually has no power to do so ?
The closest analogy to that in a business setting would probably be P2P networks charging you to download pirated music and movies while claiming that this fee will allow you to communicate with your favorite CGI entertainers like the Gollum , the Na’vi , or Eve and Wall - e .
Why would n’t you want to complain about that ?
Maybe , instead of treating his visitor as if he ’s just crazy or incompetent , then submitting the story to a site cataloguing some people ’s inability to turn on a TV or their new computers , then calling tech support demanding that someone comes to fix their mysteriously blank screens , our priest in question should consider whether he ’s promising people a product he can’t deliver and rethink his amused condescension since the complainant is n’t the one with the egg on his face .
TEMBISA , SOUTH AFRICA — This was my cunning plan to penetrate the wall of silence surrounding the North Korean football team .
First , badly injure myself .
We arrived in Tembisa , a down - at - heel township 35 km from central Jo’burg , around 4 p.m .
We were more than hour early for a planned press conference and open training session by the North Koreans .
Tensions were high around the team .
A rumour circulated on Friday morning that four members of the squad had defected .
Typically , the North Koreans said nothing .
The team ’s first press conference with western journalists on Monday had been combative and slightly surreal .
Now the world ’s press was ready for a second round of jousting .
Or at least , the chance to count the players on the field .
I made the trip by car up with Jean - François Bégin , my colleague at Montreal ’s La Presse .
Tembisa is a dusty spot , dotted by tin shacks and chaotic traffic .
The greatest point of interest within the city is the Makulong Stadium .
The stadium hit the news a week before the tournament began when there was a stampede before a friendly there featuring North Korea and Nigeria .
It is n’t much to look at .
It reminded me of the old Varsity Stadium .
North Korea uses it as a training ground .
The arena sits hard up against a neighbourhood of tightly packed adobe bungalows .
A 2 ½- metre wall topped by razor wire surrounds it .
We were told to park alongside the wall .
A Portuguese film crew had arrived before us .
We pulled up beside them , the rear of our car pressed up against the wall .
I got out to stretch my legs .
The police lazily regarded me from behind a wrought - iron fence .
People who ’ve spent time in South Africa have told me that after a few months , you stop noticing the razor wire .
It ’s everywhere — around businesses , houses , public parks , churches .
What took them months must have taken me 10 days .
I slipped around behind the Portuguese TV truck , daydreaming .
The first thing I felt was a tugging .
When I flinched , I felt a ripping .
On the section wall I was passing , the razor wire spilled over , hanging about 2 metres above the ground .
It caught me on the crown of my head and tore two jagged strips in my bare scalp .
There was an impressive amount of blood .
I leaned forward to keep the stream off my clothes .
Jean - François jumped out of the car .
I explained what had happened .
He ran off to get the police .
The Portuguese had some napkins .
It did n’t hurt badly , but I wanted to disinfect it as quickly as possible .
I walked over to where Jean - François was negotiating with the police .
“ What happened ? ” one cop asked , not moving from his stool .
“ Razor wire , ” I pointed .
“ No , ” he said .
“ Yes , ” I said .
I took the napkins away and blood began dripping off my nose .
Grumbling , they let me in .
Nobody had a first - aid kit .
A few minutes later , another paramilitary vehicle pulled up .
More cops .
This car had a kit .
They disinfected my head .
Now what ?
“ Is there a doctor ? ” I asked .
“ No . ”
“ What about the North Koreans .
They ’ll have a doctor , right . ”
The cop smirked at me .
A middle - aged woman , a security guard , came out and caught sight of me .
“ You ’re covered in blood , ” she said , clucking her tongue in the direction of the police .
“ You have to get washed up , ” she said .
Her name was Marta .
“ Come into the stadium . ”
The cop on the stool was up now , waving his hand lazily at Marta .
Nobody goes into the stadium .
Marta grabbed my arm , began dragging me along and blew right by him .
She made a low hissing noise at the cop that I ’ve noticed African women of a certain age make when they ’re non-plussed .
Marta — my protector .
We went down a corridor and through one door and I was standing in the North Korean dressing room .
It looked like your high - school locker room — wooden cubbies , a green wooden bench , a couple of toilets .
Marta washed my head at the sink .
Then she told me to fling the bloody mess of hand towels in the toilets .
Only one was working .
I blocked up the other .
Sorry , North Korea .
Marta left me with a few handfuls of paper and walked me back to the gate .
The same policeman who ’d disinfected my head now wrapped me up like Elmer Fudd with a toothache .
I returned to the other side of the gate to wait .
At 5 p.m. , the North Korean motorcade arrived .
The curtains on the team bus were closed .
When the gate opened , a hundred or so media members sprinted to the doors .
The corridor Marta had taken me down was now blocked off with school desks .
We sprinted up the stairs .
When we reached the third floor , there was n’t a North Korean in sight .
FIFA officials had erected a “ wall ” of chairs , three deep .
They announced that the press conference had been “ postponed . ”
We were invited to watch the team practice from our third - storey perch in the stands .
I leaned over the chair barrier .
“ Is there a doctor with the team ?
I ’ve hurt myself , ” I said .
The FIFA official stared for a bit .
I looked more ridiculous than injured .
But he phoned someone .
And someone else phoned someone .
And everybody was suddenly on their phones .
Out on the pitch , the North Koreans were playing keep - away .
With their hands .
Without anyone to interview , the journalists now started interviewing other journalists .
A Japanese claimed that he could see the rumoured defectors out on the field .
It turns out , the whole panic was caused by a clerical error .
The North Koreans had mistakenly left four names off their team sheet .
Behind the chair wall , a pair of paramedics — Manuel and Abigail — were presented to me .
Abigail ’s first question : “ You cut yourself shaving your head ? ”
“ Um , no .
Razor wire . ”
“ No . ”
“ Yes . ”
“ No . ”
Manuel took a look .
No , no stitches required , he said .
No shot required .
No nothing required .
I was not reassured .
“ Does n’t the team have a doctor here ? ” I asked another official , a guy with an English accent who looked like he was in charge .
He looked at my head .
And looked at me .
And my head .
“ I think it ’s impossible , ” he said .
“ But I ’ll try . ”
A few minutes later , he sidled up and whispered , “ Come with me . ”
Back down the stairs and off into the familiar corridor .
Down on his knees in front of a locked door was a middle - aged man in North Korean colours .
A player was standing behind him .
The pair of them were fiddling with the lock .
The English guy disappeared .
The player sensed someone behind him .
He turned .
His eyes widened .
He jerked his head toward the ground , as if the sight of me was painful .
He tucked his chin into his chest and stared steadily at his shoes .
The official fiddled with the lock .
Then another door and another lock .
The sight of me did n’t impress him much .
He took hold of my arm and pushed me through .
“ You .
Here , ” he instructed .
The player nervously followed me in .
Then the door was closed and he and I were alone inside the North Korean dressing room .
It was Spartan stuff — tracksuits now neatly folded in place , shower slippers sitting below them .
The player moved to the other side of the small room , sat down and stared intently at the wall .
He looked like most of the North Korean players — remarkably fit , a crew cut .
He wore a tracksuit and full kit underneath , including shin pads .
Later , after checking pictures , I realized it was defender Ri Jun - Il .
I recognized him by the small scar alongside his eye .
At first , we sat in silence .
A very long silence .
“ Hello , ” I ventured .
Ri turned uncertainly , torn .
“ Hello , ” he finally said .
He still would n’t look at me , but now he was facing my direction .
I pointed at my head .
“ Razor wire . ” I mimed the coils and catching myself and cutting my head .
Ri winced appreciatively .
“ You .
Brazil , ” I said , and gave him a thumbs up .
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Loading ...
Another uncertain smile .
I mimed running hard .
The North Koreans had lost their early match to Brazil , but ran like demons the whole time .
I gave him another thumbs up .
“ Very good , ” I said .
Ri shook his head .
“ No . No , ” he said , and gave me an ‘ aw shucks ’ wave .
“ No good . ”
It occurred to me that I was having the first - ever sit - down interview with a North Korean footballer inside a North Korean dressing room .
The doctor arrived .
Abigail and Manuel bundled in behind him .
He was a tan , middle - aged man in glasses .
He took off his red ball cap and placed it down very carefully beside me .
Then he straightened and said deliberately , “ I am the first aid director . ”
His English was better than decent .
“ The doctor ? ” I asked .
I was finished with anybody with an MD after their name .
“ Yes , the doctor . ”
“ I ’ve cut my head . ”
He unwound the bandage and gave me a couple of sympathetic ‘ Oohs . ’
He probed the wound with his fingers .
He put his hand to his chin and thought .
Abigail , Manuel and I waited for his verdict .
“ Sutures , ” he said .
“ Sutures ? ” said Manuel , uncertainly .
“ No sutures .
But go hospital , ” he said .
“ You need medicine .
I have medicine — special medicine . ”
“ You have it here ? ” I said hopefully .
“ No , ” he said , looking crestfallen .
“ I leave in hotel . ”
He opened his FIFA pack and showed me .
No medicine .
He did decide that my head need rewrapping .
He very pointedly made sure that the bandage came from Manuel .
Then he wrapped me up like a mummy .
It felt nice and tight .
When he was finished , he stepped back to admire his work .
Then he squared his shoulders toward me again .
“ I have great pity , ” he said slowly .
“ I ’m sorry ? ”
“ I have great pity , ” he said and touched his heart .
I thought he felt bad about not having any sort of disinfectant or a tetanus shot .
“ No , no , that ’s okay .
I ’m sure they ’ll have something in the hospital . ”
He shook his head from side to side and started again .
“ No .
I have great pity , ” he said , and pointed to the top of his own head .
He was saying sorry that this had happened to me at all .
I liked him more than any doctor I ’ve ever met .
He still had n’t told me his name .
He ignored my question when I asked him .
Just then another North Korean official walked in to talk to Ri , an assistant coach by the rangy look of him .
He saw me out of the corner of his eye and looked as if he might faint .
He swayed in place .
He tore his eyes away from mine , deeply confused , even frightened .
I waved .
He goggled .
He turned toward the opposite wall .
I held my hand up and continued wagging it .
He looked back at Ri and the doctor .
Both men ignored him .
He waved back slowly .
Then he fled without saying whatever it was he had come in to say .
I stood up and shook the doctor ’s hand .
Ri stood as well .
I shook his hand .
I thanked them both .
They smiled and nodded .
They seemed embarrassed by my thank - yous .
So I left .
Probably like you , I know the bare facts about North Korea — an oppressive dictatorship that starves its own people ; a place so deprived of basic necessities they cannot light their cities ; a populace brainwashed into a state of constant frenzy for war .
I was at North Korea ’s first game against Brazil .
I saw Japanese - born and Japan - based North Korea striker Jong Tae - Se cry during the national anthem .
I thought , these are the privileged robots who eat well while their countrymen eat grass .
I met them for only a moment yesterday .
But those two men changed my mind .
The regime is evil .
They were n’t .
Would any other team here have pulled their doctor off the field during practice to treat a journalist — and one who is ostensibly an enemy of the state ?
I do n’t know .
But I doubt it .
Later , in the hospital , a young South African doctor was taking a look at the cuts .
First , we talked a little about football .
“ Do you know who treated me first ? ” I said after a while .
“ No . Who ? ”
“ The team doctor for North Korea . ”
“ North Korea ?
Is it ? ” he said , only half interested .
“ What were they like ? ”
“ They were wonderful , ” I said .
“ You would have liked them . ”

Hi everyone ,
I often get asked how I pick a profitable niche market , and what keywords I choose .
These are of course very good questions indeed .
So in this post I thought it might be helpful to share an example of a market and product that I came across , which I do n’t have time to build a site in , but maybe one of you will .
I should also add that this style of affiliate site is for Amazon affiliate marketing , which is very easy to get accepted into , all you need is a website !
Ok so let ’s get straight into it , the product that I came across is ‘ Morphy Richards Breadmaker ’ .
I do n’t know much about this brand of breadmaker , but I do n’t need to know much either .
What I first did was go to the Google keyword tool and check what sort of search volume this product has .
Typing in the phrase “ Morphy Richards Breadmaker ” into the keyword tool , shows me that an exact match gives 8,100 searches a month , which is great !
Next I do a quick competition analysis of the keyword for SEO , and what I found was that on the front page of Google that there is not one website directly targeting this phrase .
By that I mean no one has the term “ Morphy Richards Breadmaker ” in their title , keyword , description or H1 tags of the page !!
Now I look for the number of backlink to these sites on the front page of Google have , and to my surprize the most is only 15 links !
So this keyword phrase is really really easy for SEO , and it is highly targeted , because it a brand name .
Affiliate Sites
I did some more research and found this site :
http://www.morphyrichardsbreadmaker.com
This is a great example of a site that is an Amazon affiliate and is targeting this brand of bread maker .
Notice that they are targeting many model numbers too .
Although the model number may not get much search volume , it you have enough of them , it will soon add up .
So you could make a simple site , like the example above and target the phrase “ morphy richards breadmaker ” and also all the model numbers , and before you know it have a 20 page site !
The only problem with Amazon affiliate marketing , is that the commission is low , and is usually about 4 % .
However often customers will buy more than one item , and so the basket size increases and so do your commissions ( especially around Christmas ) .
Morphy Breadmakers may only get you $ 5 commission a sale , but if you can get top Google rankings for many keywords , that are highly targeted , then you can have yourself a nice little money earner .
Just remember many streams form a large river !
Also the best thing is that the SEO is pretty easy for these keywords too .
That ’s all from me , I hope this post opened up some new ideas of different types of sites you can build and also the potential with Amazon affiliate marketing too

When Texas oil refiners Valero and Tesoro were contemplating whether to buy their way onto the California ballot last winter , they envisioned a ripe environment for their proposition to repeal the state ’s clean energy and air standards : skyrocketing unemployment rates , a Tea Party - inspired anti-regulation backlash , and increased skepticism about the science of global warming fueled by the rants of right - wing talking heads Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh .
Sure , the state ’s landmark climate law ( AB 32 ) was popular – with 66 percent approval in a PPIC poll and 58 percent in the Field Poll .
Yes , Attorney General Jerry Brown had saddled the initiative with a deadly accurate but inconvenient title and summary ( “ Suspends Air Pollution Control Laws Requiring Major Polluters to Report and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions ” ) .
And , of course , the then - cheerleaders for the ballot initiative were n’t the sharpest knives in the drawer : gadfly Ted Costa ( who has since announced his opposition to the measure after being pushed aside ) and first - term Republican Assemblyman Dan Logue .
But initiative strategist Mark Carpenter , a former tobacco lobbyist who fought California ’s indoor smoking laws , apparently convinced the companies that those obstacles could be overcome by the deep pockets of Big Oil .
After all , the $ 50 million or so it would take to win the campaign was chump change for an oil company that had just upped its CEO ’s salary to $ 10.9 million , a 64 percent increase from the prior year .
But a funny thing happened on the way to the ballot .
In late April , some 1.7 million gallons of oil began gushing from a British Petroleum well in the Gulf of Mexico each day .
Horrified Californians continue to be exposed daily to images of brown pelicans soaked in black oil , tar balls washing up on beaches , and devastated local economies .
That ’s not exactly good PR for a ballot measure being bankrolled with $ 2 million from oil companies , including California offshore driller Venoco Inc .
Cases in point : the immediate sharp decline in support for offshore oil drilling in California , according to a Los Angeles Times / USC poll and the defeat of a local measure to allow Venoco to begin slant drilling into the Santa Barbara channel .
Or look to the state Senate District 15 special election , as environmental champion and drilling opponent John Laird points out Assemblyman ( and former Exxon employee ) Sam Blakeslee ’s support of the controversial Tranquillon Ridge oil drilling project .
Being associated with oil companies is political death this year .
On top of that , voters are beginning to focus on the economic downside of America ’s addiction to oil .
That is driving a renewed push in the nation ’s capital for federal action to support a clean energy economy .
So it was no surprise then that President Obama bee - lined to California , the nation ’s leader in renewable energy development , when he wanted to connect the dots between investment in clean energy and the oil spill .
He put a bright national spotlight on AB 32’s renewable energy requirements , the driving force behind more than 500,000 clean tech jobs and $ 9 billion in solar , wind , and other renewable energy projects being built in California .
If the oil spill was n’t bad enough for Valero ’s fortunes , last week ’s primary election results might be even more problematic .
Two special interest propositions were dismissed by voters despite record - shattering spending by their corporate sponsors .
That will throw a wrench in Carpenter ’s calculus for winning , which includes spending up to $ 50 million branding the oil company measure as a “ jobs initiative . ”
Voters and the media already are seeing through that fog , noting that it is a deceptive measure that has little to do with employment and everything to do with allowing the company to bypass pollution laws .
And no one is buying that the ballot measure is just a “ temporary ” suspension of the law either – particularly when the once - in - a - blue - moon economic conditions it specifies ( banning implementation of the law unless the statewide unemployment rate exceeds 5.5 percent for four consecutive quarters ) have occurred just three times in the past 30 years .
It ’s just that kind of deception that doomed Props 16 and 17 .
The Valero initiative could well be strike three for special interest ballot measures , particularly because its high - profile CEO makes Enron ’s Ken Lay and BP ’s Tony Haywood look like church mice .
Valero chief exec Bill Kleese – recently named to MSNBC ’s “ Mad Money ” Hall of Shame – dismisses climate change legislation as “ alarmist . ”
He ’s taken a lead role as chief attack dog in battling clean energy policy at the national scale as Chairman of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association .
He also is the brains behind the AstroTurf “ Voices for Energy ” effort supporting Alaska Sen .
Lisa Murkowski’s effort to strip EPA of its right to regulate greenhouse gases .
( That measure failed in the U.S. Senate last week . ) .
Meanwhile , Republican and Democratic candidates alike are distancing themselves from the Big Oil initiative .
Meg Whitman , not wanting to give Jerry Brown further ammunition in the gubernatorial campaign , has refused to endorse it ( as has Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado ) .
Whitman ’s distancing herself from the ballot measure comes despite her call for a one - year moratorium on AB 32 .
She ’s declined to embrace an oil company - backed proposal unpopular among her Silicon Valley supporters , as well as suburban decline - to - state voters she views as key to victory in November .
Candidate Brown has come out strongly against the measure .
Running against Big Oil , corporate special interest measures , and fat cat CEOs are all key components in the Brown playbook , and opposing the Dirty Energy Initiative fits nicely into that narrative .
It looks as if Big Oil picked the wrong time and the wrong place for this fight .

( CNN ) -- Lance Armstrong 's official Twitter account says this year 's Tour de France will be the cyclist 's last .
" And yes , this will be final Tour de France .
It 's been a great ride .
Looking forward to 3 great weeks , " the post says .
In May , Armstrong shot down allegations from former teammate Floyd Landis that he used performance - enhancing drugs .
Also in May , Armstrong was taken to a hospital after crashing in the Tour of California race .
Armstrong is a record - holder in the cycling world and also famous as a cancer survivor .
He won seven Tour de France titles in 1999 - 2005 , and he beat cancer after it had spread to his lungs and brain .
He launched the Livestrong Foundation in 1997 .
The foundation makes the popular yellow bracelet accessory and has raised more than $ 325 million toward fighting cancer , according to its website .
Armstrong placed third in the 2009 Tour de France after a four - year hiatus from the race .
Brought to You by the Letter S
When you ’re writing laws , changing the smallest details can have huge effects .
But I ’ve never seen anything as big as what happened this week , when the White House gutted an entire section of financial regulation by removing the letter s .
Right now , shareholders of big companies vote to decide who will be on the board of directors by filling out a mail - in ballot called a proxy card .
But currently the corporation ’s CEO gets to decide who ’s on the card !
The result is a board hand - picked by the CEO — and they return the favor by providing CEOs with exorbitant salaries .
The current financial regulation bill — in a provision passed by both the House and Senate — would change that by allowing shareholders with 5 % of the stock to come together and propose additional names for the ballot .
But the White House is trying to gut this proposal at the last minute , and they ’ve done it in an incredibly sneaky way — they removed the letter s from the end of the word shareholders .
Now instead of shareholders whose stock adds up to 3 % coming together , you have to be a single shareholder with 5 % of the stock all by yourself .
And for most big companies , there just is n’t anyone like that .
Take GE , for example — its biggest shareholder only owns about 3.4 % of the company .
So by removing a single letter , they managed to make this provision completely useless .
The White House is being barraged by major CEOs begging them to keep fighting for this provision — after all , no CEO wants to see their lavish salaries cut !
As Barney Frank put it , “ I think there are some people in the White House who think , ‘ Well , we ’re fighting the financial institutions , but why fight with some of the others , you know , the other corporations ? ’ ”
Apparently they ’re so scared of a fight , they ’re willing to gut a provision passed by both the House and Senate .
If you ’re interested in fighting for real corporate reform , please sign our petition to the White House :
“ Stop lobbying against shareholder power in corporate decision - making — and against protections that would finally rein in CEO pay .
That ’s not change we can believe in . ”

Verizon says it has managed to push 10 gigabits per second through its industry - leading fiber - optic network , known as FiOS .
In the test the company says it even managed to push 1 gigabit per second to a customer 's house .
That 's an astounding torrent of data – about 1,000 times faster than the average 10 - Mbps connection in U.S. households today .
Verizon trumpeted the test as proof that its gamble on building out a large fiber - optic network will pay off in the future , as user needs for bandwidth outstrip the capabilities of cable and DSL .
At the customer 's home , the optical network terminal ( ONT ) received the 10/2.5 Gbps feed and used two data communication ports to simultaneously provide transmission speeds of close to 1 Gbps to each of two PCs inside the home .
Combined , the two ports delivered approximately 1.85 Gbps in aggregate bandwidth in each direction .
Tests were designed to simulate what two different customers might experience while using their PCs to download , upload or share files to the Internet when served by a 10G PON system .
In addition , speed tests were performed to Verizon 's speed test server located more than 400 miles away in Reston , Va. , realized speeds of up to 915 Mbps between the PC and the speed test server .
That test shoved four times as much data through FiOS as it had before , the company said .
Now , FIOS customers are n't going to be getting 1 - Gbps speeds anytime soon ( and it 's doubtful that anyone could actually handle that much data right now ) .
But they can currently get 50 - Mbps plans for $ 140 a month .
Comcast offers similar speeds in some areas through its cable network , but that 's getting close to the physical limitations of nonoptical transmission lines and is hampered by the shared nature of cable connections .
It 's clear that the future of internet access will be a combination of wireless and fiber – which has nearly infinite capacity , because broadband providers typically lay more cable than they can actually use in the foreseeable future when they dig the trenches .
Verizon , however , is the only one of the nation 's large ISPs that has made a strong commitment to fiber , a decision that Wall Street punished the company for years .
Now the company is taking a moment to gloat and to aim barbs at cable companies and Google – which promised to build a few test networks for select communities in the United States that will have a 1 - Gbps capacity .
No , an individual customer wo n’t get those speeds any time soon ; the idea is to add capacity to the delivery system .
The engineers DID , however , link two PCs to symmetrical 1 Gbps links and delivered service close to 1 G bps in each direction to those machines .
[ See , Google ?
We get the picture . ]
Both Verizon ’s High Speed Internet running at up to 7.1 Mbps and FiOS Internet involve no shared “ pipelines ” as do Cable ’s feeds .
There ’s no network congestion between " school ’s out " time until bedtime , as can happen on Cable .
So take this fiber testing of Verizon ’s FiOS network as a moment to reflect on the surge in bandwidth demand that ’s already happening , and has been happening since dial up .
And if the future demand scares you , think " fiber . "

SAN SALVADOR , El Salvador — El Salvador and 20 other nations in Latin America and the Caribbean are this month electing their national Baha 'i assembly for the 50th time .
The anniversary not only marks a milestone in the establishment of the Baha'i Faith in the Western Hemisphere , but the formation of those 21 assemblies in 1961 helped pave the way for the election two years later of the Universal House of Justice , the nine - member body that is now the worldwide head of the Baha'i Faith .
" To be able to elect the House of Justice , we first had to elect national assemblies , " explained Gabriel Torres , who was a member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha 'is of El Salvador .
Mr. Torres shared his memories at a special session during El Salvador 's 50th national convention , held this past weekend at the new Baha 'i center in the capital city of San Salvador .
Others who spoke were Quentin and Jeanne Farrand – also among the nine people elected to the first Salvadoran Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly .
" It was such an emotional moment when ( we learned ) that 21 countries in Latin America would all form their national assemblies in 1961 , " Mrs. Farrand said .
At the time , added Mr. Farrand , there were just 24 active Baha 'is in El Salvador .
" I remember that there were only 11 people at the first summer school we had .
Now our Baha'i Institute is too small to hold all the people . "
There are several thousand Baha 'is in El Salvador now , despite upheavals caused by civil war in the 1980s and early '90s that forced many people from their homes and significantly reduced the size of the Baha 'i community .
More important than numbers , however , is the progress being made at the grassroots level to work with the wider community in contributing to the betterment of society , said Gabriela Velis , 32 .
" Our work is aimed at raising the capacity of people to take charge of their own spiritual , social , and intellectual development , " she said .
Activities include gatherings that strengthen the devotional character of the community ; classes for children ; groups that channel the energies of young people ; and study circles where participants explore the application of spiritual teachings to their lives .
Festival of Ridvan
National Baha'i elections are held during the 12 - day Festival of Ridvan , which begins each year on 21 April .
Ridvan marks the anniversary of Baha 'u ' llah 's declaration in 1863 that He is the Messenger of God for this age , the most recent in a line of divine educators that includes Buddha , Jesus , Krishna , Mohammed , Moses , Zoroaster , and others .
In its annual message for the Ridvan period addressed to the Baha 'is of the world , the Universal House of Justice observed the growing ability of National Spiritual Assemblies across the globe to think and act strategically in nurturing community - building processes at the local level .
As core activities multiply , the message noted , they will be sustained by " men and women eager to improve material and spiritual conditions in their surroundings . "
In addition to El Salvador , other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where Baha 'is are electing their National Spiritual Assembly for the 50th year include Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , Cuba , Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Guatemala , Haiti , Honduras , Jamaica , Mexico , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Peru , Uruguay , and Venezuela .

They just do n’t want to consider the possibility that there are just too many people in the world .
Like doomsday church people waiting for Messiah to show up , they are sure the right technology or social program will fall out of the sky just in time for salvation .
But do n’t mention the possibility that we are blundering into disaster , one following another , caused by ever increasing consumer demand from adding more of us .
You see , we just are n’t engaging in the correct kind of consumption is all .
You can get some of them , not most , not all , to comprehend finite space , finite habitat for man and the lifeforms he relies on and crowds out .
But even this minority , will without realizing what ’s implied , unwittingly propose whittling consumerism to ever tinier slices of the collective pie for each person as our numbers continue to grow .
How far does the slippery slope slide ?
Not to infinity , which would make the slope argument fallacious .
But , some propose regression to paleolithic society , a place humans have already been .
Will 11 billion mud huts and caves suit 22nd Century Mankind ?
Without any advanced form of preserving history and managing society , no one will understand , much less have the means to stop all the thousands of future curious inventors , using their advanced human brains , from reinventing modern consumer society again from scratch .
Overpopulation remains taboo for the green people , yet it is the factor , as we increase its value on the other half of the equation that makes any form of consumerism whatsoever more burdensome on the environment .
All sort of products , from cars to consumer durables to consumer electronics used to have much longer average lives in service .
More frequent trade ins/ups seem to have been foisted upon consumers by playing on status - seeking and a desire for novelty .
nakedcapitalism
Environmentalism for many greens is a means to political ends , what humans want , Â like selling green goods or votes , not the goal itself , which is what the non -human life we depend on to exist needs .
Make room for nature .
This needs to be our litmus test for separating the ecology conservationist from the products and politics utilitarian .

Somalilanders have pulled off peaceful national elections three times .
The last presidential election in 2003 was decided by a wafer - thin margin , around 80 votes at the time of counting , yet there was no violence .
Each successful election feeds the hope here that one day the world will reward Somaliland with recognition for carving a functioning , democratic space out of one of the most chaotic countries in the world .
But this presidential election , scheduled for Saturday , will be one of the biggest tests yet for Somaliland ’s budding democracy .
The government seems unpopular , partly because Somaliland is still desperately poor , a place where even in the biggest towns , like Burao or the capital , Hargeisa , countless people dwell in bubble - shaped huts made out of cardboard scraps and flattened oil drums .
Most independent observers predict the leading opposition party , Kulmiye , which means something akin to “ the one who brings people together , ” will get the most votes .

But that does not mean the opposition will necessarily win .
In many cases in Africa  Ethiopia in 2005 , Kenya in 2007 , Zimbabwe in 2008  right when the opposition appeared poised to win elections , the government seemed to fiddle with the results , forcibly holding on to power and sometimes provoking widespread unrest in the process .
“ The best city in the world . ”
I ’ll admit it — I ’ve rolled my eyes in reaction to New Yorkers implying , or sometimes just directly stating , their city ’s superiority over mine .
But I think I was missing the point : Bravado is part of the package with this first class city .
New York encourages superlative work in nearly every medium .
Bagel and pizza eaters say there ’s something in the water , scientists theorize that Manhattan would have been the best national park in the country , and Pictory contributor Carla Drago suggested that the city ’s strict grid is a component of its creative success .
Surely a little confidence does n’t hurt either .
This lucky thirteenth showcase , published on the six month anniversary of Pictory ’s launch , seems an occasion to celebrate the concept of showing off .
I ’m proud to have NYC designer Nicholas Felton of Feltron Annual Report fame as my guest designer , and Josh Haner of the New York Times Lens Blog as my guest curator .
But at the end of the day , the submissions — the beautiful , authentic , sometimes heartwarming , sometimes heart - stopping photo stories I ’ve received from Pictory members over the last six months — are truly humbling .
His testosterone - charged youth filled with Harley - Davidsons , ultralight aircraft and ski-slope derring - do , Richard Lee hardly fit the mold of social warrior .
But when an accident left the Houston native partially paralyzed , fate intervened to transform him first into a millionaire , then into one of the nation 's top advocates for legalized marijuana .
Lee , 47 , now a purveyor of medicinal marijuana in Oakland , Calif. , is credited with engineering a successful effort to get an initiative legalizing the drug for adult consumption on his adopted state 's November ballot .
Coming on the heels of a failed legislative bid to legalize pot , the measure has ignited a pitched battle between drug activists and opponents who object that marijuana use is a “ gateway ” to abuse of cocaine and heroin .
If voters approve the measure , California will become the first state in the nation to permit legal recreational consumption .
In 1996 , the state became the nation 's first to approve medicinal use of the drug — a policy later adopted by 14 other states and Washington , D.C .
All uses of the drug remain illegal in Texas .
“ I put this in the class of a civil rights issue , ” Lee said .
“ It 's unfair and unjust to lock people up for using cannabis when it 's safer than alcohol .
... I got into this because of my support of law enforcement .
People are losing respect for the law . ”
Law enforcement should be directed at “ protecting us from real sociopaths and predators , ” he said , not at pursuing drug offenders .
‘ A bellwether '
Steve Gutwillig , director of the national Drug Policy Alliance 's California chapter , said Lee single - handedly pushed to get the marijuana proposition on the ballot even as “ mainstream ” drug advocacy groups hesitated .
“ Victory for this initiative is a game changer in the struggle to end decades of failed marijuana prohibition , ” Gutwillig said .
“ It will be a bellwether for the nation and will resonate not just across the country , but potentially around the world . ”
Lee said he was heartened in his campaign by polls that showed 55 - 60 percent of respondents in favor of decriminalizing marijuana .
Lee 's group gathered 690,000 signatures — only 434,000 were needed — on a petition to bring the issue to a vote .
Despite those polls , Lee 's marijuana initiative has drawn stiff opposition from anti-drug organizations , law enforcement groups and some religious leaders .
John Redman , a Texas A&M University graduate who heads California 's Community Alliances for Drug Free Youth , complained that legalizing marijuana for adults would make it seem less harmful and , indirectly , increase its availability to minors .
Redman 's group led a fight against a San Francisco legislator 's bill to legalize pot , which died earlier this year in the California Assembly .
Lee grew up in Houston , one of five sons of Robert and Ann Lee , self - described “ Goldwater Republicans , ” who have come to agree with their son on marijuana issues .
“ Richard always marched to a different drum , ” said his mother .
“ Two things came across with him .
First was his integrity .
If he told you something , you could take it to the bank .
Second , he was very much a ‘ damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead ' guy .
If he believes in something , he 'll push ahead whether you support it or not . ”
Fall changed his life
Lee 's parents recalled their son's youth as one filled with action sports .
“ It was his life — hopping onto a his Harley - Davidson to run to Pearland , ” Ann Lee said .
Lee was 27 when , working as a lighting technician , he fell off a scaffold and broke his back .
The injury left him paralyzed below the waist .
Suffering from sleeplessness and other complications , Lee told his parents he was considering suicide .
While at a Houston rehabilitation center , Lee chanced upon an article describing the efficacy of marijuana in easing painful symptoms in paralytic patients .
“ Before the current research , the standard treatment prescribed lots of Valium .
People would be Valium zombies .
They 'd stay at home all day , ” he said .
“ When they switched to cannabis , they 'd go back to college , get married . ”
Upon experiencing his cannabis epiphany , Lee opened The Hemp Store , a Montrose - area boutique selling hemp - fiber clothing and other legal pot-related products .
He also moved into advocating the drug 's legalization .
“ He was a sharp guy who really was tied into entrepreneurship and the force of the market in bringing about change , ” said Jerry Epstein , co - founder of the Drug Policy Forum of Texas .
“ He knew what he was going to do : somehow harness the free market . ”
Lee moved to the Bay Area to work in the medical marijuana industry after voters made it legal .
Ultimately , he became proprietor of one of Oakland 's four marijuana dispensaries and founder of Oaksterdam University , a trade school offering courses in cultivation and other pot-related topics .
Area revitalized
More than 10,000 students have attended classes at the school 's California and Michigan branches .
Lee 's dispensary , trade school and related businesses generate more than $ 5 million annually in income and have served as a nucleus for redevelopment in Oakland 's Oaksterdam neighborhood .
“ When I first got here , ” he said , “ the area was really empty .
Homeless people were sleeping in the doorways .
I tried to make this a working model .
Cannabis businesses can help clean up the neighborhood . ”
Now , he said , the area is filled with coffee shops , galleries , retail stores and sidewalk cafes .

On June 21 , 2010 , in the case of Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , the United States Supreme Court upheld Section 6603 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 in a 6 - 3 decision .
Section 6603 , an amendment to an amendment of the PATRIOT Act , makes it illegal to provide “ material assistance ” to terrorist organizations , and defines “ material assistance ” to include , among other things , “ expert advice or assistance . ”
Free speech advocates and the lawyers for Humanitarian Law Project argue that “ expert advice ” constitutes speech and that this definition therefore violates the First Amendment .
I ’m inclined to agree , but 2/3 of the Supreme Court told us to shut up or face prosecution .
But so far , we ’re not the ones who have to worry .
It ’s the USA Network and the guys who make the show Burn Notice who are really in trouble .
Burn Notice , currently in its fourth season , is the story of Michael Westen ( Jeffrey Donovan ) , a former covert intelligence agent who has been forced out of his job ( “ burned ” ) and forced to live in Miami .
Like the A - Team before him , he uses the skills he learned from Uncle Sam to help the helpless in Miami stand up to a variety of murderers , gangster , spies , drug dealers , biker gangs , etc .
Michael is assisted by two sidekicks : Sam Axe ( Bruce Campbell ) is a former Special Forces operative with extensive connections in Miami ’s law enforcement community , and Fiona Glennanne ( Gabrielle Anwar ) is a former hit - person / explosives expert / general badass for the Irish Republican Army and Michael ’s sometime girlfriend .
The show ’s overarching plot is about Michael ’s attempts to get his old job back by finding out who burned him and why , but the joy of the show is in the team ’s application of spy- craft and well - trained violence to the criminal underclass of Miami .
Often going undercover , Michael generally works to get the bad guys to make mistakes that will either get them arrested by the authorities or killed by some other bad guy , getting the client of the week out of a jam .
The last few episodes are on Hulu , so take a look , especially if you ’re at work right now .
It ’s a light and implausible show – a modern cross between the A - Team and MacGyver with a lot of establishing shots of girls in bikinis – but it ’s one of the most entertaining things on summer TV .
Or it was .
Consider this :
The Supreme Court just upheld the conviction of the Humanitarian Law Project for offering “ material assistance ” to terrorists in the form of “ expert assistance . ”
What was HLP doing ?
They were working with the Kurdish People ’s Party , a group seeking to set up a separate Kurdish state in eastern
Turkey , to teach this group how to achieve its goals through non-violence by engaging with the United Nations .
In the court ’s majority opinion , Chief Justice John Roberts argues that teaching this group non-violent ways of achieving its goals is a crime because “ Such support frees up other resources within the organization that may be put to violent ends . ”
If making the means of non-violent protest available is now enough to convict HLP of a crime , then Jeffrey Donovan and the producers of Burn Notice better start filming in a country without an extradition treaty .
Throughout each episode of Burn Notice , Donovan ’s voiceover offers how - to ’s on whatever particular spy-technique he ’s using at the moment .
These deadpan bon-mots are the single best part of the show and offer all sorts of helpful advice .
They ’re so popular that they ’re used as promos for the show .
There ’s only one good one on YouTube , but you can see the others here .
I recommend the ones on Turkmenistan and brake failure .
That one may seem relatively benign , but check out some of these others pieces of advice from Mr. Westen :
“ When you ’re being watched , what you need is contrast .
A background that will make the surveillance stand out .
An FBI field office is full of guys in their forties .
At most South Beach business hotels , it would be tough to tell which middle - aged white guy was watching you .
So you stay in the place where everyone is a Jell - O shot away from alcohol poisoning .
If you see someone who can walk a straight line , that ’s the Fed . ”
And
“ Freon is available at most computer stores .
Buy a can of screen duster , turn it upside - down , and you ’ve got it in liquid form .
It ’s cold enough to crystallize the metal in many commercial locks .
A hammer can take care of the rest . ”
And
“ Need to go someplace you ’re not wanted ?
Any uniform store will sell you a messenger outfit , and any messenger can get past a security desk . ”
And
“ With everyone X - raying and chemical testing their mail these days , a box of wire and pipe and batteries sprinkled with chemical fertilizer is a great attention - getter . ”
And
“ Military firebombs are typically white phosphorus or chlorine trifluoride .
These are remarkably effective , but they are also unstable , lethally toxic , and hard to find at the grocery store .
The main ingredient in a homemade firebomb , on the other hand , is Styrofoam . ”
And
“ The sticky bomb was originally developed in World War II for mining tanks .
For the homemade variety , tile adhesive works best – sticky , water - proof , and it comes in an easily portable plastic bucket . ”
And
“ The longer you run from the police , the more certain you are to get caught .
There ’s a small window of time after a chase begins , before backup arrives , before helicopters are deployed .
If you want any chance of getting away , you ’d best use this time to find some place secluded … and bail out . ”
There are dozens more .
Basically , the whole show is a TV adaptation of the Anarchists Cookbook , the how - to manual for all sorts of nastiness that many of us bought when we were 13 year - old - boys and fully expected to be badass action heroes in the near future .
Every Thursday night for the last four years , the USA Network has offered explicit expert advice to everyone , making the secrets of American spy - craft available to our nation ’s closest friends , its most sedentary citizens , and its bitterest foes .
Terrorist cells with access to basic cable , Hulu , or one of those illegal download sites ( the ones that Overthinking It.com so strongly discourages ) have now learned how to : recognize and avoid FBI surveillance , break through locks , get past security desks , build firebombs , stick them to things , and escape from the police .
Burn Notice has planned an entire operation for them .
Moreover , the show even implicitly endorses the use of terror tactics , making one of its main sympathetic characters , Fiona , a former bomb - maker for the IRA ( which , though not on America ’s list of terrorist organizations , is still on the UK list ) .
And lest you think this is silly , that the bad guys are n’t watching and learning from TV , allow me to share a brief anecdote .
In 2007 , I was living in Las Vegas in a big group house .
One night , we got home to realize that the house had been burglarized and that my roommate ’s car had been stolen .
The LVPD does n’t usually send the CSI guys for a burglary , but when the police subsequently found the car a few blocks away , on fire , the crime became arson and the CSI truck showed up .
It turned out that the guy they sent had been one of the advisors to Anthony Zuiker when Zuiker first started reaserching on the first CSI show .
As he dusted every surface in the five bedroom house ( that dust is really , really hard to clean up , btw ) , he expressed regret that the show he helped create was making it much harder to do his job , as now every criminal knows what the CSI guys look for and knows , for example , that wearing gloves while committing crimes is probably a good idea .
It was n’t just this one guy – recent studies have shown that this is a serious problem .
So believe me , the bad guys are watching Burn Notice and they ’re learning .
According to the reasoning of the Supreme Court , the USA Network is clearly in violation of the law for providing “ material assistance ” to terrorist organizations .
US Department of Justice , send those bastards to Gitmo .
PS : In putting this post together tonight , I ’ve Googled “ terrorist , ” “ terrorist organizations , ” “ anarchists cookbook , ” “ PATRIOT Act , ” “ IRA , ” “ Kurdish People ’s Party , ” and “ countries without extradition treaties . ”
I ’ve also clicked on links for white phosphorus and chlorine triflouride .
I ’d like to welcome to Overthinking It.com the National Security Agency staffer who is now assigned to subject me to a level of scrutiny I probably do n’t deserve .
Thank you for your service to our country .
We hope you enjoy the site .
They ’ve been married for ten years and for a long time everything was O.K. — swell — but now they argue .
Now they argue quite a lot .
It ’s really all the same argument .
It has circularity .
It is , Ray thinks , like a dog track .
When they argue , they ’re like greyhounds chasing the mechanical rabbit .
You go past the same scenery time after time , but you do n’t see it .
You see the rabbit .
He thinks it might be different if they ’d had kids , but she could n’t .
They finally got tested , and that ’s what the doctor said .
It was her problem .
A year or so after that , he bought her a dog , a Jack Russell she named Biznezz .
She ’d spell it for people who asked .
She loves that dog , but now they argue anyway .
They ’re going to Wal - Mart for grass seed .
They ’ve decided to sell the house — they ca n’t afford to keep it — but Mary says they wo n’t get far until they do something about the plumbing and get the lawn fixed .
She says those bald patches make it look shanty Irish .
It ’s because of the drought .
It ’s been a hot summer and there ’s been no rain to speak of .
Ray tells her grass seed wo n’t grow without rain no matter how good it is .
He says they should wait .
“ Then another year goes by and we ’re still there , ” she says .
“ We ca n’t wait another year , Ray .
We ’ll be bankrupts . ”
When she talks , Biz looks at her from his place in the back seat .
Sometimes he looks at Ray when Ray talks , but not always .
Mostly he looks at Mary .
“ What do you think ? ” he says .
“ It ’s going to rain just so you do n’t have to worry about going bankrupt ? ”
“ We ’re in it together , in case you forgot , ” she says .
They ’re driving through Castle Rock now .
It ’s pretty dead .
What Ray calls “ the economy ” has disappeared from this part of Maine .
The Wal - Mart is on the other side of town , near the high school where Ray is a janitor .
The Wal - Mart has its own stoplight .
People joke about it .
“ Penny wise and pound foolish , ” he says .
“ You ever hear that one ? ”
“ A million times , from you . ”
He grunts .
He can see the dog in the rearview mirror , watching her .
He sort of hates the way Biz does that .
It occurs to him that neither of them knows what they are talking about .
“ And pull in at the Quik - Pik , ” she says .
“ I want to get a kickball for Tallie ’s birthday . ”
Tallie is her brother ’s little girl .
Ray supposes that makes her his niece , although he ’s not sure that ’s right , since all the blood is on Mary ’s side .
“ They have balls at Wal - Mart , ” Ray says .
“ And everything ’s cheaper at Wally World . ”
“ The ones at Quik - Pik are purple .
Purple is her favorite color .
I ca n’t be sure there ’ll be purple at Wal - Mart . ”
“ If there are n’t , we ’ll stop at the Quik - Pik on the way back . ”
He feels a great weight pressing down on his head .
She ’ll get her way .
She always does on things like this .
He sometimes thinks marriage is like a football game and he ’s quarterbacking the underdog team .
He has to pick his spots .
Make short passes .
“ It ’ll be on the wrong side coming back , ” she says — as if they are caught in a torrent of city traffic instead of rolling through an almost deserted little town where most of the stores are for sale .
“ I ’ll just dash in and get the ball and dash right back out . ”
At two hundred pounds , Ray thinks , your dashing days are over .
“ They ’re only ninety - nine cents , ” she says .
“ Do n’t be such a pinchpenny . ”
Do n’t be so pound foolish , he thinks , but what he says is “ Buy me a pack of smokes while you ’re in there .
I ’m out . ”
“ If you quit , we ’d have an extra forty dollars a week .
Maybe more . ”
He saves up and pays a friend in South Carolina to ship him a dozen cartons at a time .
They ’re twenty dollars a carton cheaper in South Carolina .
That ’s a lot of money , even in this day and age .
It ’s not like he does n’t try to economize .
He has told her this before and will again , but what ’s the point ?
In one ear , out the other .
“ I used to smoke two packs a day , ” he says .
“ Now I smoke less than half a pack . ”
Actually , most days he smokes more .
She knows it , and Ray knows she knows it .
That ’s marriage after a while .
The weight on his head gets a little heavier .
Also , he can see Biz still looking at her .
He feeds the damn dog , and he makes the money that pays for the food , but it ’s her he ’s looking at .
And Jack Russells are supposed to be smart .
He turns into the Quik - Pik .
“ You ought to buy them on Indian Island if you ’ve got to have them , ” she says .
“ They have n’t sold tax - free smokes on the rez for ten years , ” he says .
“ I ’ve told you that , too .
You do n’t listen . ”
He pulls past the gas pumps and parks beside the store .
There ’s no shade .
The sun is directly overhead .
The car ’s air - conditioner only works a little .
They are both sweating .
In the back seat , Biz is panting .
It makes him look like he ’s grinning .
“ Well , you ought to quit , ” Mary says .
“ And you ought to quit those Little Debbies , ” he says .
He does n’t want to say this — he knows how sensitive she is about her weight — but out it comes .
He ca n’t hold it back .
It ’s a mystery .
“ I do n’t eat those no more , ” she says .
“ Any , I mean .
Anymore . ”
“ Mary , the box is on the top shelf .
A twenty - four - pack .
Behind the flour . ”
“ Were you snooping ? ” A flush rises in her cheeks , and he sees how she looked when she was still beautiful .
Good - looking , anyway .
Everybody said she was good - looking , even his mother , who did n’t like her otherwise .
“ I was hunting for the bottle opener , ” he says .
“ I had a bottle of cream soda .
The kind with the old - fashioned cap . ”
“ Looking for it on the top shelf of the goddam cupboard ! ”
“ Go in and get the ball , ” he says .
“ And get me some smokes .
Be a sport . ”
“ Ca n’t you wait until we get home ?
Ca n’t you even wait that long ? ”
“ You can get the cheap ones , ” he says .
“ That off - brand .
Premium Harmony , they ’re called . ”
They taste like homemade shit , but all right .
If she ’ll only shut up about it .
“ Where are you going to smoke , anyway ?
In the car , I suppose , so I have to breathe it . ”
“ I ’ll open the window .
I always do . ”
“ I ’ll get the ball .
Then I ’ll come back .
If you still feel you have to spend four dollars and fifty cents to poison your lungs , you can go in .
I ’ll sit with the baby . ”
Ray hates it when she calls Biz the baby .
He ’s a dog , and he may be as bright as Mary likes to boast when they have company , but he still shits outside and licks where his balls used to be .
“ Buy a few Twinkies while you ’re at it , ” he tells her .
“ Or maybe they ’re having a special on Ho Hos . ”
“ You ’re so mean , ” she says .
She gets out of the car and slams the door .
He ’s parked too close to the concrete cube of a building and she has to sidle until she ’s past the trunk of the car , and he knows she knows he ’s looking at her , seeing how she ’s now so big she has to sidle .
He knows she thinks he parked close to the building on purpose , to make her sidle , and maybe he did .
“ Well , Biz , old buddy , it ’s just you and me . ”
Biz lies down on the back seat and closes his eyes .
He may stand up on his back paws and shuffle around for a few seconds when Mary puts on a record and tells him to dance , and if she tells him ( in a jolly voice ) that he ’s a bad boy he may go into the corner and sit facing the wall , but he still shits outside .
He sits there and she does n’t come out .
Ray opens the glove compartment .
He paws through the rat ’s nest of papers , looking for some cigarettes he might have forgotten , but there are n’t any .
He does find a Hostess Sno Ball still in its wrapper .
He pokes it .
It ’s as stiff as a corpse .
It ’s got to be a thousand years old .
Maybe older .
Maybe it came over on the Ark .
“ Everybody has his poison , ” he says .
He unwraps the Sno Ball and tosses it into the back seat .
“ Want that , Biz ? ”

The Psychopharmaceutical Industrial Complex
For the past two decades , the Psychopharmaceutical Industrial Complex has been the driving force behind the epidemic of mental illness in the United States with the promotion of biological psychiatry and a bogus " chemical imbalance " in the brain theory .
The Psychopharmaceutical Industrial Complex ( PPIC ) is a symbiotic system composed of the American Psychiatric Association , the pharmaceutical industry , public relations and advertising firms , patient support organizations , the National Institute of Mental Health , managed care organizations , and the flow of resources and money among these groups , according to an October 1 , 2009 paper in the Journal of Mental Health Counseling , by Dr Thomas Murray , director of Counseling and Disability Services at the University of North Caroline School of Art .
Murray 's paper draws parallels between cult indoctrination and PPIC techniques and notes the similarities between cult members and mental health consumers who are vulnerable to losing their identities to the PPIC .
The PPIC and " its adherence to the disease model pervades mainstream culture and greatly impacts psychotherapy , " he says .
" Consequently , the effects of the PPIC may have resulted in some psychiatric consumers adopting disease - model messages in ways similar to cult indoctrination . "
" Consumer adoption of the disease model can create obstacles to treatment when hope is fundamental , " he advises .

CALGARY - Russell McDougall , 33 , pleaded guilty today to eight charges of arson by negligence , and one charge of production of a controlled substance , after a massive $ 3.8 - million fire in the community of Citadel in December destroyed five homes .
The case had been set for a preliminary hearing this week , but McDougall 's lawyer Adriano Iovinelli requested the case be adjourned in light of discussions with the Crown about resolving the case .
McDougall was originally charged with 16 counts of arson by negligence and has been in jail since February .
Police allege the fire started inside a basement marijuana grow operation in a home on Citadel Forest Place N.W. shortly before 4 a.m. on Dec. 5 .
Investigators said they believe a man connected with the illegal drug operation discovered the fire and went into the house to rescue his two dogs -- but then fled without calling 911 or alerting neighbours .
Neighbours fled to safety with little more than the clothes on their backs , but by the time it was put out , the fire had destroyed or damaged a total of eight homes and did $ 3.8 million in damage .
More to come . . .
5:44 p.m. Police Headquarters , Rally underway
Hundreds of people , possibly 500 , have taken over the eastbound lanes of College St. , between Bay St. and Yonge St , in front of police headquarters .
Chanting " Shame ! " and " 2 - 4 - 6 -8 -
We do n't want a police state . "
4:30 p.m. Toronto Police Headquarters , Police get ready for rally
About 40 police officers , mostly on bicycles , are stationed outside of police headquarters at 40 College St. , in anticipation of a protest on Monday , June 28 , 2010 .

About 40 police officers are stationed in front of 40 College St in anticipation of a rally being held by the Toronto Community Mobilization Network .
The network is critical of the arrests of hundreds of demonstrators made by police over the G20 weekend , saying their rights have been violated .
The group wants all those arrested to be released .
Scheduled to speak are author Naomi Klein and activist Judy Rebick .
As the officers stood waiting , one of them questioned Star reporter Brendan Kennedy .
" You 're counting officers , I have ever reason to stop you and ask who you 're talking to on your cellphone , " said Officer J. Phelps who refused to provide his first name before stepping back into an unmarked maroon van with other officers .
4:30 p.m Police Headquarters , Police asking for ID
Police are asking some people for identification and searching bags .
Cars and taxi cabs are not being allowed to park or stand on the street .
Police officers stop a young man on his bike wearing a backpack around the corner from police headquarters .
He was stopped and asked to show ID as police searched his bags .
Unmarked vans full of police officers are regularly passing in front of police headquarters , seemingly doing repeated loops around the block .
4:30 p.m. College Park , Employees asked to leave work
A woman in long orange skirt walks by line of police and calls out " " Restraint - word of the day guys , restraint ! "
Some provincial employees working at College Park across from police headquarters have been advised to leave work early because of the planned demonstration .
2:46 p.m. : Downtown eats discounted
Church St. Wine Bar owners Ted and Mary Koutsogiannopoulos are starting a campaign , called G - ATE , to encourage customers to eat downtown again after the G8 / G20 summit .
The restaurant owners are encouraging other restaurateurs to join through Twitter and Facebook .
The Wine Bar will serve three courses from its regular menu for $ 25 , a savings of $ 12 to $ 18 .
The Wine Bar lost more than half of its revenue during the weekend summit .

The manager of Steve 's Music on Queen West says he " absolutely " will apply for compensation from the federal government for damage to the store on Saturday .
Four big plate glass windows cracked and smashed from the heat of a police car set on fire right outside of the store just east of Spadina .
The sign on the 33 - year - old Queen West landmark is charred and some of the plastic letters are melted .
Gerry Markman says it'll cost $ 2,577 to replace the shattered glass .
" At the begining , it was all peaceful stuff , " says sales floor manager Nigel Roopnarine , who was in the store with customers .
Around 4 p.m. Saturday , a group showed up carrying a black flag with red lettering and the mood changed , he recalls .
Saturday manager Kevin Parker bolted the door , even though people from the street were trying to get in .
A shirtless man in dreadlocks tried to climb the Steve 's sign and nearly fell .
Inside , they watched people in black throw " mini bowling balls " at police , then the car was set on fire .
" It was very scary , " says Roopnarine .
Steve 's staff snuck the customers out to the back alley .
Employees eventually got out when they managed to get to their cars in the back and drive down Peter St .
Ninety per cent of the protesters were peaceful , Roopnarine said .
About Sunday night 's four - hour standoff between police and people in the intersection of Queen and Spadina , he says , " It 's upsetting what happened on Saturday , but I can see police would n't know who 's who . "

Joshua Enns says he was at a prayer vigil and David Breed says he was out for a walk when both were arrested yesterday and found themselves at the Eastern Ave. detention centre .
Both had pocket knives on them and face concealed weapons charges .
Enns , who is studying to be a math student , says he was strip searched and moved from cell to cell , unable to talk to a lawyer .
He was " passing peace " to officers on the front lines when four officers took him into custody .
He was wearing a black T - shirt that reads , " Peace . "
He says he was driven around for hours and spent five hours in pain because he had to pee .
" I hope this is cleared up so I 'll be able to teach , " he says .
He says he uses is dollar - store knife to cut fruit .
Breed , a security guard at Molson Amphitheatre , says he and his girlfriend were watching the bike rally and thinking about brunch when he was taken into custody .
His girlfriend , waiting outside the detention centre for him , had lawyers numbers scrawled in her arm .

We did n't want summit , Miller says
Toronto never asked for the G20 summit , Toronto Mayor David Miller says .
The mayor repeated during his morning news conference that holding the summit was n't Toronto 's idea , it was the federal government 's based on the very wrong theory that downtown Toronto would be empty on a summer weekend .
Miller also says he wants Ottawa to compensate businesses that lost income and people who lost wages because they closed during the summit .
Ottawa has already said it does n't have to compensate anyone .
" I would be surprised if seeing the news of the weekend if the federal government did n't change their position .
This is a federal responsibility .
This is their conference . "
Asked about the front - page editorial in the Star that the summit failed the city and its people , Miller says it was " vastly overstated , " although he allows that " hosting a summit like this is not the wisest " thing to do in the middle of a metropolis .
Miller also says he does n't have a subscription to the Star , although he does have one to the Globe .
He defended police , saying they had " very little lead time " to prepare .
Miller referred to complaints about police brutality has " isolated incidents or problems .
We have a process to deal with that .
" Police acted with professionalism .
In the very big picture , our police did a very commendable job .
I regret the fact that because of the violence actions of people who chose to hide in the crowd with completely innocent people " that some people got caught in the police net .
Was it worth it ?
" A lot of Torontonians would say no .
This was never an event that was designed to bring a positive economic impact on Toronto " even with 10,000 international delegates packing hotels .
Huntsville had two years to prepare for the G8 summit , he said .
Toronto had six months .
He thinks it should have been held at Exhibition Place .

After a messy weekend around the city , clean - up crews and workers were out attempting to bring the city back to normal .
Kevin Sack , a spokesman with the city of Toronto said staff had been out since Sunday evening to put back street furniture , and clean - up the remnants from the protests .
“ Some of those repairs will start immediately , ” he said .
“ You can bet everyone has an interest in getting the city back to its former pre-G20 condition as soon as possible . ”
Bike racks were among the first to be put back into place this morning .
Crews would also be putting garbage cans and benches back over the course of the week , he said .
“ We ’re eager to get the bins back into place as quickly as we can , ” he said .
The furniture was removed weeks before the G20 protest amid concerns that the furniture could be used as potential weapons .
The security fence was also slowly coming down in the city ’s core Monday morning .
The Integrated Security Unit said workers taking the fence down would be in the best position to know how long it will take .
A spokeswoman with the city said they had until July 10 to get the fence cleared away .

11:11 a.m. Accusations of strip - search on women by male police officers
Three people in their 20s have just held a news conference to talk about police treatment during the summit .
Amy Miller , Jesse Rosenfeld and Adam MacIsaac describe themselves as independent media and allege police refused to accept their ID .
They did n't have G20 media accreditation , but say they did have ID .
Miller , who lives in Montreal , charges male police officers gave women a full strip search and many returned to their cells at the Eastern Ave. detention centre traumatized and crying .
MacIsaac says he was repeatedly kicked in the ribs and stunned with a stun gun .
He showed the marks on his body .
He says police ignored him when he told them that he has a pacemaker .
The incident happpened at Bloor and St. Thomas , he says .
MacIsaac is from Prince Edward Island .
Rosenfeld , who lives in the Middle East , says he was reporting for the British newspaper The Guardian , which has described him as a contributor to their open Comment is free website .
MacIsaac says he had $ 6,000 in camera equipment stolen and was told to " file a complaint " to get it back .
All three , who were held for many hours in the detention centre before being released today , say they have n't filed complaints yet , but are considering it .
10:51 a.m. Trinty - Bellwoods resident disputes police version
A man who lives in the Trinty - Bellwoods neighbourhood says he was just on his way home last night when he was corralled in the intersection of Queen and Spadina and forced to spent nearly four hours there in the pouring rain .
" We were just trying to go home , " Richard Beer told CP24 this morning .
" We were boxed in with nowhere to go . "
Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair says people inside the human wall of police in the intersection were given three chances to leave .
Beer says they were n't .
And Star reporter Raveena Aulakh , who also spent hours in the intersection , says there was nothing said by police that people could leave .
Before police boxed people in , she had heard they shouted a warning .
But not afterwards .
Most of the people standing around him in the downpour were just bystanders , Beer says .
A friend who volunteered to go was sent single file through a police line but then was put into a Court Services van and taken to Scarborough .
Hours later , she was dropped off at Kennedy subway station , where Beer and friends collected her .
Blair insisted earlier this morning that people were asked to leave three times .
The ones who stayed , in his opinion , were " facilitating " the others in the group intent on violence .
9:59 a.m. 15 - year - old released after 33 hours
15 - year - old Liam has just walked free of the Eastern Ave. detention centre , where he has been held since very early Sunday morning .
Liam , who goes to Central Tech , says he was down on the Esplanade just before midnight on Saturday night when he was arrested .
" If you 're a citizen of Toronto watching the protest , you 've got to expect to be detained , " he says .
A sergeant called his parents after 24 hours but he was not able to speak with them .
" I 'm pretty sure my parents are going to be upset . "
The police surrounded a large group of people and " once they surrounded us , they said we should have just left because we were all being arrested . "
Wearing an orange T - shirt and jeans , the babyfaced Liam has short , almost shaved dark blond hair and stands about 5 - foot - 5 .
He says he was held with three others in the young offenders ' cell and they 've all been released without charges .
The small crowd outside the Eastern Ave. detention centre is making posters now , including one that says " Amnesty for the Toronto 900 . "
There are granola bars , apples , bananas , strawberries , pakoras and a big bag of popcorn for them to eat .
9:32 a.m. 15 - year - old held in detention centre
Keith MacDonald has just been released from the Eastern Ave. detention centre to cheers and clapping from the crowd .
He contends police inside the detention centre are just telling people what they think they want to hear .
A 15 - year - old boy has been in there for 33 hours , he says , and they told him 10 hours ago they called his dad .
MacDonald , who is in his late teens or early 20s , says he was arrested at Queen and Noble in Parkdale yesterday at 3 p.m. when police were arresting anyone who was n't part of the media .
He says he was wearing a black T - shirt and black pants , with a shaved head and a bandanna .
He says he was charged with a raft of things , including obstruction of police , but all charges were dropped .
9:26 a.m. On Eastern Ave .
The Eastern Avenue detention centre still looks like an armed camp .
Two entrances on the south side of Eastern are heavily guarded by police , some of whom are shaded from the hot morning sun under large white tents .
A golf cart with three police holding armfuls of water bottles drove leisurely between the entrances .
Empty TTC buses with " Chartered " on the digital sign above the windshield are entering the facility , several at a time , from downtown .
The Modu-loc fences remain , anchored in the steel reinforced concrete jersey barriers .
A small group of media are on the north side of Eastern , no crowds any more .
9:14 a.m. Travel advisory
Union Station exits that were closed early this morning have now been opened .
TTC is reporting traffic delays and heavy traffic on Bay St. near Wellington St. W. because of the G20 security fences .
Crews started taking security fences apart overnight .
8:36 a.m. Arrest numbers keep climbing
The Integrated Security Unit is confirming that police have made more than 900 G20 - related arrests since June 18 .
8:29 a.m. Outside the detention centre
There are about 10 people waiting outside the holding centre at Eastern Ave .
About half of them were inside overnight and have been let out .
Others are waiting for family and friends still inside .
Those who spent the night inside the makeshift jail say conditions were terrible , lights were never turned off and they were kept in holding pens with only a bench for 10 people .
They were fed cheese sandwiches every four hours and given a small glass of water every two hours .
Each time someone walks free , a cheer goes up from the crowd .
A group of Montreal students just released say they were walking to the Greyhound bus station to leave at 10 a.m. yesterday when they were surrounded by dozens of police officers .
They say they were charged with wearing a disguise and possessing weapons , although they say they were just wearing black clothes and carrying water and lemons .
All the charges have been dropped , they say .
Everyone was strip searched when they were taken in .
" You 're young , you 're anarchists , you 're violent .
That 's what the police think , " says Charles from Montreal .
" They were telling us we smell bad , " says Roxanne Anouk .
" We 've been sleeping on the floor all night . "
They had come to Toronto , they say , to protest brutality , the environment , war and the need for free education .
Charles declined a TV interview , saying , " I do n't want my parents to see me like this . "
8:16 a.m. Police chief speaks
" Dozens and dozens " of people were arrested on their way to the Queen and Spadina demonstration last night carrying weapons , including wet Molotov cocktails , Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair says .
He defends the hours people spent in the pouring rain hemmed in at the intersection , saying they had three chances to leave .
Told people were confused about how to get out , he repeated that they had a chance to leave and the media had a chance to move back when told .
What he called planned criminal activity was " made a lot easier by the complicity of the crowd , " Blair tells CP24 in a morning interview .
" It 's unfortunate some innocent people had to stand in the rain , " says Blair .
" We had to stand in the rain with them . "
The deluge , he says , was the " good part " because the rain " cooled their ardour .
That 's what we wanted it to do . "
Blair describes demonstrators roaming through the city to confound police and attack vulnerable spots in the city .
7:38 a.m .
While you were sleeping ...
More people were taken into police custody last night , bringing the total number of G20 - related arrests to at least 700 , the Integrated Security Unit says .
Jenn Gearey , an ISU representative , said Monday morning that number is " still not firm , " because it does n't include any individuals who were processed by police overnight .
Police expect to have a higher , more accurate estimate later today .
As the number of people detained rises , the fences are coming down .
By midnight Monday , the gates at the security perimeter had opened and work crews were seen removing fencing and concrete barriers .
The fence remains around the Westin on Queen 's Quay and police sit in the tents away from the morning sun .
The ISU is also expected to make a decision later today on whether the police presence brought in for the summit from neighbouring regions such as Peel and York is still needed , Gearey said .
7:32 a.m. Questions from Queen and Spadina
" We 're not suggesting we 're perfect , " Toronto Police Staff Superintendent Jeff McGuire said late last night by way of explanation for the hours hundreds of people spent in the drenching rain boxed in by police .
" That was the decision we made at that time .
Sometimes , it does n't work out perfectly . "
McGuire went on to explain that police had been working a " 16 to 18 - hour day in the rain , fighting . "
Police , said McGuire , decided to box in people at Queen and Spadina last night after they saw people they believed were in the anarchist Black Bloc who " actually donned masks " and were carrying weapons en route to the protest site .
Everybody else , he said , were " people who chose not to disassociate themselves " with the Bloc .
" The inclement weather came upon us quickly , " he said .
Everyone at Queen and Spadina was arrested , and the processing took hours , but then they were released " unconditionally " without charges by 9:40 p.m..
He did n't say what happened to the people alleged to be Black Bloc .
Star reporters described people swept up in the arrests who had only been trying to cross the street .
Others stood for hours shivering in the deluge .
7:26 a.m. : Trouble at the shelter
There was word yesterday that the men who bunk at the Hope Mission , a Sally Ann hostel at the corner of College and McCaul , were being braced by the cops .
That ’s trouble .
The men who use the Hope are often fresh from jail , and many of them have issues : mental health , minor warrants , or addictions .
You ca n’t help a man if he ’s afraid to go where he can get a little help .
The Army would n’t let me talk to anyone inside .
I talked to Tony on the street .
As we talked , I could see the cops in cars , and cops on foot , and cops on bikes ; on average , groups of seven .
Tony , in fact , did n’t sleep at the Hope on Saturday night .
“ I was sleeping on a bench at city hall .
Around 5:30 this morning , the cops , they surrounded me , about 12 of them , which is overkill .
“ One was asking for my ID , and another one was asking what was in my bag ; everybody talking all at once , it was confusing .
And then they went for my bag .
I was n’t hiding anything .
They asked if I had charges . ”
He has had charges in the past , and he may have charges in the future , but he has no charges now , and he ’s doing his best , and it bothers him when he ’s pushed around .
“ They can get away with anything they want . ”
That ’s pretty much right .
And I can tell you that I passed hundreds of cops yesterday , and no one bothered to search me .
Reverse profiling ?
And then George said , “ They got me twice yesterday , once with eight cops , once with five .
It ’s scary . ”
Nerves on edge all over .

HM Revenue & Customs has started legal proceedings against the Premier League in the wake of the financial collapse of Portsmouth to try to have the so - called ‘ “ football creditors ’ rule ” ( FCR ) abolished .
Under the rule , if a club enters administration , “ football creditors ” including other clubs , players and managers owed cash are guaranteed to be paid in full while “ non-football ” creditors have to make do with whatever offer – generally small – is put on the table by the administrator .
HMRC filed a legal writ against the Premier League on 18 May , according to a scoop today for Accountancy Age .
Sportingintelligence has independently corroborated the details , and understands that HMRC believes it has a good case to get the FCR scrapped .
A Premier League spokesman told us this afternoon : “ The League will robustly defend its position . ”
A long , convoluted legal process lies ahead but if HMRC were successful , insolvency proceedings around football would undergo a sea change .
Football creditors would no longer have any preferential call over the local pie seller or St John ’s Ambulance brigade , for example , and a “ domino collapse ” of defaulting creditors throughout the game could lead to knock - on financial hardships .
Some would argue this is only right ; others that football is a special case .
HMRC ’s view is “ that the practical application of the so - called Football Creditors Rule may be unlawful .
We have nothing further to add at this stage . ”
The League ’s stance is that the creditors ’ rule , while imperfect , helps to maintain stability in the game , and that if the rule were not in place , liquidations of clubs would become much more common , and therefore “ ordinary ” creditors could suffer even more by getting no money at all .
Portsmouth ’s football creditors can expect to get their total £ 22.4 m in debts paid in full , eventually , while unsecured creditors ( including HMRC , owed tens of millions ) have been offered 20 p in the £ , or £ 16.5 m of £ 83 m owed in total , over time .
Legal experts believe HMRC has a decent case , with law firm Olswang LLP saying the FCR “ arguably offends two major principles of insolvency law : one , the pari passu principle that requires that all creditors should share equally in the surplus assets of an insolvent company ; and two , the anti-deprivation principle that requires that a company shall not be deprived of its assets by reason of insolvency . ”
David Roberts , a partner at Olswang , adds : “ These principles are designed to ensure that when a company fails , the creditors are not deprived of assets of the company that would otherwise be available to share and that the assets of a company must be shared evenly amongst all unsecured creditors .
The Football Creditors rule is not kind to either principle .
“ HMRC has thus far proved to be a loser in football club failures because clubs have not been accounting for PAYE and NICs , which is unlawful .
However , as long as the [ FRC ] is in operation , ‘ Football Creditors ’ will effectively rank ahead and in preference to all other unsecured creditors , including HMRC , and the operation of the rule diminishes the quantum of any surplus assets that might otherwise be payable to unsecured creditors …..
“ Given that Portsmouth are unlikely to be the last club in the Premier League to incur an event of insolvency , the continued viability of the [ FRC ] rule is likely to be the subject of intense scrutiny .
“ Thus Olswang LLP welcomes HMRC taking responsible steps to seek to settle this grey area and trusts that this current uncertainty will be addressed efficiently and in due course by the appropriate body , namely , the court . ”

Dobson : GOP misled me on Paul
Christian conservative leader James Dobson withdrew his endorsement of Kentucky Senate candidate Trey Grayson Monday , switching his support to Rand Paul ’s campaign and accusing “ senior members of the GOP ” of misleading him about Paul ’s record on abortion .
Dobson said in an audio recording that he made an “ embarrassing mistake ” as a result of misunderstanding Paul ’s position on abortion .

“ I was given misleading information about the candidacy of Dr. Rand Paul , who is running in the Republican Primary for the U.S. Senate .
Senior members of the GOP told me Dr. Paul is pro-choice and that he opposes many conservative perspectives , so I endorsed his opponent , ” Dobson explained .
“ But now I 've received further information from OB / GYNs in Kentucky whom I trust , and from interviewing the candidate himself . ”
Dobson ’s reversal is an embarrassment for Grayson ’s campaign , which touted the religious leader ’s support last week and had planned to highlight an endorsement from Republican Rep. Hal Rogers Monday .
Grayson , who serves as Kentucky ’s secretary of state , has struggled in the polls against Paul , an ophthalmologist , with the primary just weeks away .
Now , Paul 's campaign is featuring Dobson 's support in a wave of radio ads across the state , on news and Christian radio stations .
The campaign is also planning to put up a television spot with Dobson 's endorsement starting Tuesday .
Paul spokesman David Adams said that Dobson ’s change of heart came after the insurgent conservative ’s campaign introduced him to social conservatives who had rallied behind Paul .
“ We have made a lot of friends over the course of the campaign who know Rand , ” Adams said .
“ We were able to , when the initial statement came out from Dr. Dobson , get those friends to him and help him understand what the truth was , that he was being misled . ”
Kentucky Right to Life , the state ’s largest anti-abortion organization , has endorsed Grayson in the primary
Five years after the release of PostgreSQL 8.0 , the developers are preparing for the next major version jump with the release of a beta version of PostgreSQL 9.0 .
The most prominent feature in the new release is integrated replication using " Hot Standby " and " Streaming Replication " .
Streaming Replication allows a slave system to connect to the primary server and receive a stream of WAL ( Write Ahead Log ) records as they are generated , rather than having to wait for those records to be written to disk and picked up later .
This allows the standby to be more up to date .
Hot Standby allows connection to a server which is in recovery mode .
While still in recovery mode the server can process read - only queries and can move to normal operations without disconnection users .
Other changes include the moving of LISTEN / NOTIFY events from a system table to a memory queue for better performance , an added ability for NOTIFY to pass an optional string to listeners , the implementation of anonymous functions using the DO statement and SQL compliant per-column triggers .
Server side language support has been enhanced ; stored procedures can now be written in Python 3 and Perl procedures can now use use strict and require .
The CREATE TABLE statement now allows developers to specify EXCLUDE as non-traditional constraint .
The documentation gives an example of using EXCLUDE as way of ensuring that no two records contain overlapping circles .
The release notes contain the full details of the changes .
To move to PostgreSQL 9.0 from a previous version requires a pg_dump to export from the older database into the new version .
Alternatively , the data directory can be updated directly using pg_migrator .
The source for the new beta is available on line as is a Windows installer and binaries for other platforms .
PostgreSQL is an open - source Object - Relational DBMS supporting almost all SQL constructs .
The PostgreSQL development includes employees of Red Hat , F - Secure and EnterpriseDB .
PostgreSQL is released under the PostgreSQL License , a liberal Open Source license , similar to the BSD or MIT licenses .

Image caption A poor diet is one of the major contributors to Scotland 's ill health
Unhealthy living is almost universal in Scotland , with virtually everyone in the country putting themselves at risk , according to a study .
Glasgow University researchers analysed data from 6,574 people who took part in the 2003 Scottish Health Survey .
They identified five factors which contributed most to disease in richer countries - smoking , drinking , poor diet , physical inactivity and obesity .
The report found that 97 % of Scots had at least one of the risk factors .
Some 55 % of the population had three or more , while 20 % had four or all five risk factors .
Poverty was found to increase the risks .
Writing in the online journal BMC Public Health , the researchers concluded : " The Scottish population seems to be living dangerously .
" Considering five major risk factors to health - cigarette smoking , heavy alcohol consumption , poor diet , physical inactivity , and overweight - nearly the whole adult population ( 97.5 % ) have at least one behavioural risk factor . "
The Scottish population seems to be living dangerously Dr David Conway , Glasgow University
The study was led by Dr David Conway , who said : " Our analysis shows that around two - thirds of the Scottish population is overweight or obese , a similar proportion are not sufficiently physically active , and most people have a poor diet .
It is just that it is not the same majority for each factor .
" The most important determinants for multiple risk factors were low educational attainment and residence in our most deprived communities . "
He added that the true picture may be even worse due to respondents putting a positive spin on their behaviour .
The Scottish results are similar to those in a recent survey of English behaviour , and suggest both nations are more unhealthy than many European countries , and even North America .
Scotland has earned as unenviable reputation as the " sick man " of Europe in recent years .
The country has higher death rates from cancer , heart disease and stroke than anywhere else in the UK .
The report said that among men , Scotland had more than twice as many alcohol - related deaths than England .

Solar physicists have for the first time captured images of the collision of a comet with the Sun .
This comet apparently survived the heat of the corona and disappeared in the chromosphere , evaporating in the 100,000 - degree ( Kelvin ) heat .
A corona is a type of plasma “ atmosphere ” of the sun or other celestial body , extending millions of kilometres into space .
The chromosphere is a thin layer of the sun ’s atmosphere just above the photosphere — the ball shaped surface that emits light , roughly 2,000 km deep .
Using instruments aboard NASA ’s twin STEREO spacecraft , four post - doctoral fellows at University of California , Berkeley ’s Space Sciences Lab were able to track the comet as it approached the sun and estimate an approximate time and place of impact .
STEREO ( Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ) , launched in 2006 , consists of identical spacecraft orbiting the sun , one ahead of earth and one behind earth , providing a stereo view of the Sun .
NASA ’s twin STEREO spacecraft caught this image of a comet impacting the sun .
The comet apparently survived the intense heat of the sun ’s outer atmosphere – called the corona – and disappeared in the chromosphere , which is a thin layer of plasma found between the visible surface of the sun and the corona .
Credit : NASA
The researchers then looked at data from the ground - based Mauna Loa Solar Observatory in Hawaii , and found images in the predicted spot of what appears to be a comet approaching the edge of the sun from behind the solar disk .
“ We believe this is the first time a comet has been tracked in 3 - D space this low down in the solar corona , ” said Claire Raftery , post - doctoral fellow newly - arrived at University of California , Berkeley from Dublin ’s Trinity College .
The team presented its data and images Monday , at the Miami , Florida meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
Sungrazing comets , comprising dust , rock and ice , are seldom tracked close to the sun because their brightness is overwhelmed by the solar disk .
Based on the comet ’s relatively short tail , about three million - km - long , researchers believe that the comet contained heavier elements that do not evaporate readily , a University of California , Berkeley release said .
This would also explain how it penetrated so deeply into the chromosphere , surviving the strong solar wind as well as the extreme temperatures , before evaporating .

Gargantuan move against Internet freedom accelerates into high gear
Paul Joseph Watson & Alex Jones
Prison Planet.com
Monday , June 28 , 2010
The move to shut down and regulate the Internet under a new government - controlled system has accelerated into high gear with the announcement that the government ’s cybersecurity strategy revolves around issuing Internet users with ID “ tokens ” without which they will not be able to visit websites , the latest salvo against web freedom which , in combination with Senator Joe Lieberman ’s ‘ kill switch ’ bill , will serve to eviscerate the free Internet as we know it .
Under the guise of “ cybersecurity , ” the government is moving to discredit and shut down the existing Internet infrastructure in the pursuit of a new , centralized , regulated world wide web .
It is important to stress that “ cybersecurity ” has nothing to do with protecting the infrastructure of the United States and everything to do with taking over the Internet .
Cybersecurity is about attacking non-compliant Internet users , not defending against hackers .
Non-compliance equates as using the Internet as a political tool to dissent against the policies of the U.S. government .
Having already tried and failed in flooding the web with paid disinformation agents , the government is now turning to its only recourse , exploiting hyped or outright staged cyberattacks as an excuse through which to implement an Internet 2 system controlled and regulated solely by the authorities .
We are constantly told that the Internet needs to be subject to government control because cyberterrorists could hack in and bring down the national power grid .
However , the vast majority of the U.S. power infrastructure is not connected to the Internet .
It will only be connected to the Internet if the government accelerates the implementation of “ smart grid ” technology , so in this sense , the government itself is leaving the power grid more vulnerable to hackers by its own programs .
Threats against computer networks in the United States are grossly exaggerated .
Dire reports issued by the Defense Science Board and the Center for Strategic and International Studies “ are usually richer in vivid metaphor — with fears of ‘ digital Pearl Harbors ’ and ‘ cyber - Katrinas ’ — than in factual foundation , ” writes Evgeny Morozov , a Belarus - born researcher and blogger who writes on the political effects of the internet .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Morozov notes that much of the data on the supposed cyber threat “ are gathered by ultra - secretive government agencies — which need to justify their own existence — and cyber - security companies — which derive commercial benefits from popular anxiety . ”
Should the government go ahead and try to exercise the powers it is now on the verge of acquiring , we ’d expect to see the Internet shut down for a few days in order to prevent some kind of contrived cyberattack blamed on terrorists .
Sure , there will be problems , but large corporations will raise little dissent safe in the knowledge that the Lieberman legislation gives them immunity from civil lawsuits and also ensures they are reimbursed for any costs incurred if the Internet is shut down for a period of time .
After a series of shutdowns , the government will simply demand that every corporation or individual who wants to operate a website first obtain a license and an individual Internet ID .
Such licenses will be revoked for anyone who engages in “ hate speech , ” which is now so broad a term that it encompasses offending anyone on the Internet .
The result will be a sterile and regulated Internet which more closely resembles cable TV than the true open source , outpost of free speech that we have come to know and love .
This exact strategy was outlined in a paper published by Obama ’s cybersecurity co-ordinator Howard Schmidt , which was compiled with the aid of the National Security Council .
The strategy revolves around , “ The creation of a system for identity management that would allow citizens to use additional authentication techniques , such as physical tokens or modules on mobile phones , to verify who they are before buying things online or accessing such sensitive information as health or banking records , ” reports the FInancial Times .
Only with this government - issued “ token ” will Internet users be allowed to “ able to move from website to website , ” a system not too far removed from what China proposed and rejected for being too authoritarian .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
It is imperative that everyone redouble their efforts to bring attention to this matter because Lieberman ’s bill is on the verge of passing the Senate and it will hand the government total control over the Internet unless we can alert enough organizations from across the political spectrum to oppose this monstrosity in unison .
The true nature of the cybersecurity agenda was revealed when Lieberman told CNN ’s Candy Crowley that his 197 - page Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act ( PDF ) legislation was part of an effort to mimic China ’s control of the Internet .
“ Right now China , the government , can disconnect parts of its Internet in case of war and we need to have that here too , ” said Lieberman .
The Senator ’s reference to China is a telling revelation of what the cybersecurity agenda is really all about .
China ’s vice - like grip over its Internet systems has very little to do with “ war ” and everything to do with silencing all dissent against the state .
Chinese Internet censorship is imposed via a centralized government blacklist of any websites that contain criticism of the state , porn , or any other content deemed unsuitable by the authorities .
Every time you attempt to visit a website , you are re-routed through the government firewall , often making for long delays and crippling speeds .
China has exercised its power to shut down the Internet , something that Lieberman wants to introduce in the U.S. , at politically sensitive times in order to stem the flow of information about government abuse and atrocities .
During the anti-government riots which occurred in July 2009 , the Chinese government completely shut down the Internet across the entire northwestern region of Xinjiang for days .
Similarly , Internet access in parts of Tibet is routinely restricted as part of government efforts to pre-empt and neutralize unrest .
Major websites like Twitter , Google and You Tube have also been shut down either temporarily or permanently by Chinese authorities .
News websites in China now require users to register their true identities in order to leave comments .
This abolition of anonymity is used to chill free speech in that it prevents the user from engaging in criticism of the state for fear that they would be tracked down by authorities .
Chinese authorities are now going further than merely maintaining a “ blacklist ” of banned websites by instituting a “ whitelist ” of allowed websites , a move that “ could potentially place much of the Internet off - limits to Chinese readers ” .
Websites not pre-registered with the government would be completely blocked to all Internet users , meaning “ millions of completely innocuous sites ” would be banned .
This equates to requiring government approval to set up a website , which would obviously not be granted if the person or organization making the application has a history of or is likely to engage in dissent against the state .
President Obama himself has criticized Chinese Internet censorship as a hindrance to the free flow of information and allowing citizens to hold their governments accountable , and yet Lieberman wants to hand Obama similar powers .
Given the nature of Chinese Internet regulation , with has nothing to do with “ war ” as Lieberman claims and everything to do with political censorship and covering up information about state oppression , we should be alarmed that the Senator wants to see America move in the same direction .
The real agenda behind government control of the Internet has always been to strangle and suffocate independent media outlets who are now competing with and even displacing establishment press organs , with websites like the Drudge Report now attracting more traffic than many large newspapers combined .
As part of this war against independent media , the FTC recently proposing a “ Drudge Tax ” that would force independent media organizations to pay fees that would be used to fund mainstream newspapers .
In addition , the FCC has rolled a censorship plan into its Net Neutrality scheme in a stealth attempt to impose Internet regulation .
Under the FCC ’s regulatory control consumers would be forced to buy an Internet / TV / Phone connectivity box that the government approves .
“ Everyone will pay rates for service that the government sets .
And everything passing through your Internet , TV , or phone would become subject to the FCC ’s consistent regulatory whim , ” writes Americans for Tax Reform ’s Kelly William Cobb .
Similar legislation aimed at imposing Chinese - style censorship of the Internet and giving the state the power to shut down networks has already been passed globally , including in the UK , New Zealand and Australia .
We have extensively covered efforts to scrap the internet as we know it and move toward a greatly restricted “ internet 2 ” system .
Handing government the power to control the Internet would only be the first step towards this system , whereby individual ID ’s and government permission would be required simply to operate a website , and this is precisely what the National Security Council has proposed for the new cybersecurity measures that are set to be implemented over the next few years .

Ed. note :
This is a special post from Will Meyerhofer of The People ’s Therapist .
This article is also posted there .
I summered at Shearman & Sterling way back in 1996 .
Judging from my clients ’ feedback , the summer associate “ experience ” at big law firms has n’t changed much over the years .
With the recession , it ’s harder to get a summer associate position – but once you ’re in , it ’s pretty much the same old thing – or maybe the same old thing on lysergic acid diethylamide .
It was a pretty weird experience to begin with .
As a summer associate , you ’re entering Bizarro World , and nothing makes sense in Bizarro World .
Nothing ever has , and nothing ever will .
Here ’s how it works :
You show up , dressed in the new suit you probably bought with your mom .
You ’re a little nervous and eager to impress .
The first day starts out pretty much as you ’d expect , with human resources spiels – “ trainings ” – on stuff like how to use the library , how to turn on your computer , how to find the word - processing department , whatever .
You are presented with your desk – your own desk in a law firm !
You chat excitedly with the other summers , sizing one another up , seeking allies – someone you can trust , who seems to be thinking the same things you are .
There are no obvious candidates .
What now ?
Eventually you are introduced to a senior associate and given your first assignment .
You rush off to finish it and promise yourself it will be the best summer associate assignment in the history of the firm .
As you get down to work , it turns out to be some confusing research question that either has an obvious answer that you find in about twenty minutes , or it ’s not really a question at all , it ’s just a broad open - ended request to poke around for cases , so you ’re not sure what they want .
Or it ’s an inquiry regarding the income taxation of irrevocable charitable annuity trust stand - by provisions in the State of Florida under provision b( 7 ) , and you ’re feeling a little out of your depth .
Either :
You finish it in twenty minutes , with a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach that maybe you did something wrong .
So you wait an hour or two , re-checking everything , then poke around the library trying to look serious and busy before you hand it in .
Or you struggle through dozens of cases , trying to find something relevant , with a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach that maybe you ’re doing something wrong , but determined to produce a good heap of print - outs and some sort of summary even if you suspect you might be totally off - point .
Or you try to figure out what a charitable annuity trust is and stand gaping like an idiot while the punctilious and efficient law librarian produces state law documents that appear to be written in Klingon .
A cold wave of panic rolls up your spine .
You wonder if it ’s worth the risk to ask the senior associate for more guidance .
Let ’s say you actually go back to the senior associate .
You brace yourself to look like an idiot .
You knock on his office door , and he ’s surprisingly friendly ,
“ Ummmm … I ’m not sure I understood the parameters of the question .
Do you think I could walk through it with you for a minute ? ”
He smiles , and too - quickly agrees that the question was a little unclear , but says it looks like you did a great job of “ taking a stab at it . ”
He admits he ’s busy at the moment , and suggests you put it down for now , but adds that you ’ve “ done a great job ” and he ’ll have another assignment for you soon .
That was your first assignment and you ’re sure all you ’ve accomplished is to make the one guy you needed to impress think you ’re an idiot .
You wait at your desk .
You try not to look like you ’re surfing the internet , and settle for reading the New York Times online , which seems an improvement over Facebook .
If you hear anyone out in the hallway , you pretend to read a memo about the “ events ” that have been planned for you during the summer .
Okay , if it ’s 2010 , there are a couple of other things .
There are fewer “ events ” planned for you , and fewer of them involve visits to country clubs .
You also poke around the office and realize that half of the floor you ’re on is empty .
Just empty offices .
That ’s especially weird since there are two of you summers stuffed into a tiny office on the other side of the floor .
This situation will never , ever , ever be discussed by anyone under any circumstances .
Your officemate appears .
She turns bright and perky when she sees you , which is scary , since that ’s not how you ’re feeling , but you brighten up and turn perky yourself since she is .
You want to ask how her assignment went , but she ’s already rearranging pencils on her desk and looking intent on something , and you know she just handed it in , flawlessly executed , probably to the managing partner .
He accepted it with smiles and a congratulatory handshake .
It gets to be five o’clock and you ’re trying to look busy and not like you ’re glancing at the clock every ten minutes .
You wonder if you ’re supposed to go home now .
It ’s kind of boring sitting here and you ’re hot in your suit .
You imagine changing into a t - shirt and having a beer and watching tv .
It seems preferable to sitting in Bizarro World wondering if you ’re already in trouble on your first day .
You hope your officemate will take off first .
In desperation , you make for the bathroom , thinking that might give her an opening and then you can leave and no one will have to feel awkward .
The next day you get in at nine and realize no one else makes it in that early except the secretaries .
You sit at your desk .
Finally , you walk past the senior associate ’s office and sort of wave at him and let him know you exist .
He waves back , but does n’t invite you in .
Your boredom is relieved by a “ summer associate training breakfast . ”
The bubbly summers are greeted by a kindly - looking older partner , who then quickly disappears .
A bright , perky consultant from WestLaw or someplace like that takes over , and shows endless slides about legal research or insider trading or diversity sensitivity or ethics .
It is boring , but there are bagels and muffins laid out on a table in the back and at this point you ’re happy that time is being killed .
Eventually you go back to your desk and rearrange your highlighters and post - it flags for twenty minutes .
You ’re wondering if you should go bug the senior associate again when , to your amazement , the bright , perky young blond woman in the suit with the pearl necklace who works for human resources – or “ associate development ” – or whatever they call it – comes by your office asking if you want to go out for lunch .
She might not actually be blond or wear pearls .
She might be African - American or older or a guy .
But whoever she is , she will radiate an aura of blondness , suit - ness and pearl necklace - ness .
You ca n’t quite put your finger on it .
But she is very very nice , and there is nothing she wants more than to take you and a bunch of your summer associate buddies out for lunch .
The best description you can think of for her job is “ cruise director ” and you half expect her to herd everyone onto a boat and sail you all to Martha ’s Vineyard , which is probably where she was born and raised .
After a few weeks , you realize this “ let ’s all go out for lunch ” thing happens a lot .
Like every week .
You are constantly pigging out at Italian restaurants with the other summers , who talk about NCAA basketball – not your thing – or chat mindlessly about how nice this partner is or how wacky and fun that associate is .
These are people you ’ve barely met , so you can safely assume the other summer associates , whom you barely know , have barely met them either .
Every two weeks , you receive a paycheck for more money than you ’ve ever been paid in your life .
You notice you ’re getting fat from all those lunches .
Everything culminates in a dinner at a country club in Westchester .
You ’ve never been to a country club and are n’t sure what to make of all the wealthy , skinny young second wives and blond mop - top second batch kids eyeing you by the pool .
You drink too much at dinner and fall asleep in the van coming back to NYC .
You say goodbye to the blond lady in the suit with the pearl necklace .
You visit your family , and dodge questions about the job – and then you ’re back in school again , wondering what that surreal experience was all about and trying to process the notion that you might actually work at that place next year .
You ’re back from Bizarro World , but it ’s only a respite .
Because Bizarro
World is where you ’re headed back to soon , if you ’re lucky .
It could become your life .
How you like them apples ?
Years later , when it does become your life , you realize :
Those senior associates were “ assigned ” you against their wills , and dreaded concocting assignments for a useless summer when they were having mindless work dumped on them by people over their heads and hating their own lives .
That the firm had just laid off half of its real estate department and the entire structured finance group and partners were screaming at one another at partner meetings and threatening to de-equitize under - producers , including the kindly - looking older partner , who has n’t brought in a client in twenty years , which is why they stick him with the summers .
That they were trying to lease out the extra floor to save money , but the downtown commercial real estate market is in collapse so it ’s just sitting there , empty , while the partners argue .
That the senior associate you reported to was sleeping with the blond lady with the pearl necklace , although they ’re both married .
That no one there even remembered your name , and they will decide whether to hire you based entirely on whether there is enough business for them to bill you out for forty hours per week at five times what they ’re paying you .
That half the partners in the firm are secretly planning to jump ship to another place where the money is better and leave the other half – who are n’t pulling in the billables – up a creek .
You receive a letter informing you that your hiring date has been postponed to December , earliest .

Americans for Job Security is the same as the Chamber .
Americans for Job Security ( AJS ) spun off in the late 1990s from a group called The Coalition : Americans Working for Real Change , a group that had been formed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to counteract the extensive soft money spending by the AFL - CIO starting in the 1996 elections .
AJS has stated to the IRS that its purpose is " educating the public on economic issues with a pro-market , pro-paycheck message . "
2
The group , in reality , does not appear tied to any unifying ideological mission other than helping the electoral pursuits of favored candidates , who have exclusively been Republicans throughout the organization 's history .

How bout this group " VoteVets " who are running that ad trying to whip up war hysreria against Iran under the guise of sane energy policy .
I checked into them a little .
On the board : Leslie Gelb , Lawrence Korb , Lawrence Penn .
All long time members of the Council on Foreign Relations .
We know the CFR loves itself some war .
Especially if it 's American soldiers dying for Israeli interests .

While I appreciate your thinking here , Camus .
VoteVets has actually been a terrific advocate against such wars over the years , and , I believe , in their current commercial campaign are trying to touch an appropriate chord with the American people who have been worked into a froth over Iran .
I think it actually makes sense for them to say " Hate Iran ?
Then cut 'em off by moving to clean energy ! " , etc. Cynical ?
Perhaps .
But is a measure of cynicism needed to survive , rise above the noise these days ?
Also perhaps .
Given what I know of VV over years , I 'll given them the benefit of the doubt for the time being on this one .

Why would anyone hate Iran ?
I 'm taken aback Brad , even shocked ...... shocked !
You must admit CFR wants war w / Iran .
Who is responsible for working the sheeple into a froth ?
Why would VV spend millions to continue the frothing if they are not panting for another illegal invasion ?
If sane enrgy policy is their goal , is n't the disaster in the gulf and global warming enough to run ads on ?
I happen to think Ahmadinejad is a good man .
Way intelligent , funny , humane , leading a strong proud peaceful ancient civilization in a crazy neighborhood .
On his western border , the world 's only " superpower " has illegaly invaded Iraq .
On his eastern border the same out of control war machine has invaded Afghanistan .
The lies and threats and sanctions now lobbed against Iran are alarmingly similar to what preceded the raping of Iraq .
Millions of innocents have been slaughtered .
Who knows how many tortured .
Evil is being done in our name , with our money for what ?
Because our Zionista masters have so ordered ?
Will we march on Tehran at their behest as well ?
That ad will change nobody 's mind about oil usage .
It does clearly and intentionally stoke the winds of war and unfairly continue the demonization of the last strong voice for balance in the middle east .
I feel sick .
I would say betrayed but I guess I just never knew your position on this matter .

CamusRebel @ 4 said :
Why would anyone hate Iran ?
Um , because they 've been propagandized to do so , for years , by the U.S. corporate media ?
But that 's hardly the point .
Perhaps you did n't read my comment carefully enough .
The point was not to encourage hatred of Iran , but to use whatever hatred there might be there in order to get something * good * out of it , like the developement of clean energy in this country .
You must admit CFR wants war w / Iran .
Who is responsible for working the sheeple into a froth ?
Why would VV spend millions to continue the frothing if they are not panting for another illegal invasion ?
I do n't see any " frothing " going on by VV here .
I see the use of a common belief ( which I ca n't verify as accurate either way ) to do something positive : develop clean , reusable energy , and reduce the need ( legit or not ) to encourage more death of our folks and theirs in wars over oil .
If sane enrgy policy is their goal , is n't the disaster in the gulf and global warming enough to run ads on ?
Not if you 're talking to Fox " News " viewers / zombies , apparently .
And even for non-zombies , the reminder of the cost of foreign wars for oil as a reason to encourage clean energy legislation now makes plenty of sense to me .
Not even sure why it would n't to you !
I happen to think Ahmadinejad is a good man .
Way intelligent , funny , humane , leading a strong proud peaceful ancient civilization in a crazy neighborhood .
While I think the above point is far afield from the general point of the main article above , or even the campaign itself , there are many who justifiable feel very different about that .
Including those who have been imprisoned , tortured , convicted , killed etc. for standing up peacefully for what they justifiably feel was a blatantly stolen election by Ahmadinejad recently .
( Whether or not the election was actually stolen is beside the point , btw .
His regime was brutal in the suppression of those who had very good reason to believe that it was and to stand up peacefully in support of that belief . )
On his western border , the world 's only " superpower " has illegaly invaded Iraq .
On his eastern border the same out of control war machine has invaded Afghanistan .
The lies and threats and sanctions now lobbed against Iran are alarmingly similar to what preceded the raping of Iraq .
No question about that .
But it has little to do with whether or not Ahmadinejad is a " good man " , or the point being made in the spot rejected by Fox .
( And , btw , I guarantee you they did not reject it on any of the grounds you are proffering here . )
Millions of innocents have been slaughtered .
Who knows how many tortured .
Evil is being done in our name , with our money for what ?
Because our Zionista masters have so ordered ?
Will we march on Tehran at their behest as well ?
Again , that point has nothing to do w/ this commercial and it's rejection .
That ad will change nobody 's mind about oil usage .
It does clearly and intentionally stoke the winds of war and unfairly continue the demonization of the last strong voice for balance in the middle east .
While you may or may not be right about whether the ad would change anybody 's mind ( who knows ? ) , and that there is demonization in the spot ( fair or otherwise ) , I certainly do n't see the spot as " clearly and intentially stok[ ing ] the winds of war " , but rather attempting ( successfully or otherwise ) to do the exact opposite .
At least in my opinion .
Your mileage , of course , is welcome to vary .
I feel sick .
I would say betrayed but I guess I just never knew your position on this matter .
Not sure what you feel sick about , or what you believe is revealed about my " position on this matter " .
But either way , I hope you 'll feel better soon .
If there 's anything to be sick about these days , it hardly seems to be me .
But again , that 's just my position .
As always , you , and everyone else , is welcome to their own .

Brad ,
please confirm .
you did n't question nor defend cfr 's war mongering agenda right ?
Camus ,
from what I 've seen and heard from VoteVets , they 're as progressive as VVAW and IVAW , if not more so .
They 're stoking strong against war .
They 're target audience is probably what 's throwing off perspective here .
These ads are way beyond preaching to the choir .
They 're clearly talking to the TobyKeithBootInYourAss glitter gulch wannabe cowboy crowd .
And that crowd is in diar need of someone clearly stating that it's not ok to spray their m-16's in all directions in order to achieve ANY goal .
Better said : like invading and occupying two countries per decade in wars based on lies clearly intended to produce wild profits for anti-american corporate pigs .
besides all that , while acknowledging the pressures unduly placed on Iran , what does achmedinejad matter ?
he 's window dressing for the theocrats who run the country right ?

by the way , a bit more to ernest 's and maybe not as much brad 's points : seems readily apparent that regardless how obviuos and bad deepwater horizon gets in the GOM and beyond , bp's and their sisters and their lobbyists and their bought and paid for judges , executives and legislators are already aggressively working to weather the pr storm .
downplay is not the right word for what they 're workin on .
http://en.wikipedia.org/...pwater_Horizon_oil_spill
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montara_oil_spill
http://en.wikipedia.org/...i/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill reading those three sites gets one thinkin :
- the Wiki on montara had no numbers at all addressing the amount of oil spilled while the wiki on deepwater horizon is providing a broad selection of speculative numbers - and they 're still growing larger .
given how much access corporates have to wiki how much has the montara site been scrubbed since 11/09 .
also the first two articles give the overall warm fuzzy feeling that this is a common occurence that the big oil guys can and have taken care of all the time - aka " move along nothing to see here .... " as though to say " give us a couple months to get things under control and we 'll tell you how bad the damage is . " once again , let 's leave it to the corporate powers to sort this all out for us and decide if they 're good for us or not .
and how much money we need to give them Beyond the Pay they 've already sucked out of us .
by the way : a longer term perspective gives some idea of the cronyism and antimeritocracy running our world today http://cluborlov.blogspo.../american-chernobyl.html
how do you spell corruption ?
capitalism = corporatism = communism anyone got a valid comparison between deepwater horizon 's oil spilled and the valdez spill ?

Marn had some mixed results with Dudley in other tournaments he used him in , but he felt like that character matched up well with Valle 's Ryu .
This ended up being the correct assumption as Phan jumped out to an early lead in the Grand Finals going up 2 games to nothing .
Valle bounced back with some nice play and tied things up , but Marn got the edge and took home top honors where a guaranteed $ 2,500 prize pot for Super Street Fighter 4 was on the line . •

brainwashing & mind control techniques
Below is a list of the usual brainwashing / mind control techniques used in schools , hospitals , army , religious cults , totalitarian states ; with political prisoners and dissidents , mentally insane , some versions of psychoterapy , etc. , etc. " Indoctrination " is a more slight and more subliminal form of brainwashing ( e.g. commercials ) .
However , these concepts are nothing short of controversial and open to various interpretations , which should be kept in mind while perusing the Web sources below .
I can't guarantee the information found from some of these pages is totally unprejudiced or scientifically verifiable under skeptical observation .
So , it 's up to you to decide whether to believe them or not .
1 ) HYPNOSIS - Inducing a high state of suggestibility , often thinly disguised as relaxation or meditation .
a. Repetitive Music ( most likely with a beat close to the human heart 45 to 72 beats per minute ) .
Most likely used during " study sessions " as the teacher will say the music helps you relax and concentrate better !
b. Voice Roll -- A " voice roll " is a patterned , paced style used by hypnotists when inducing a trance .
It is also used by many lawyers , several of whom are highly trained hypnotists , when they desire to entrench a point firmly in the minds of the jurors .
A voice roll can sound as if the speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome or it may sound as though he were emphasizing every word in a monotonous , patterned style .
The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 45 to 60 beats per minute , maximizing the hypnotic effect .
c. Room " Feel " -
The way a room feels is essential to hypnotizing unknowing subjects .
It needs special lighting , florescent lights are best because they are n't too dim , but are n't too harsh .
Also , Room Temp helps a bit , usually a little cooler than normal room temperature .
You need to have the unknowing subjects very relaxed , perhaps even close to falling asleep .
2 ) PEER GROUP PRESSURE - Suppressing doubt and resistance to new ideas by exploiting the need to belong .
3 ) " LOVE BOMBING " - Creating a sense of family through physical touch , thought & feeling sharing and emotional bonding .
4 ) REJECTION OF OLD VALUES - Accelerating acceptance of new lifestyle by constantly denouncing former beliefs and values .
5 ) CONFUSING DOCTRINE - Encouraging blind acceptance and rejection of logic through complex lectures on an incomprehensible doctrine .
6 ) METACOMMUNICATION - Implanting subliminal messages by stressing certain key words or phrases in long , confusing lectures .
7 ) REMOVAL OF PRIVACY - Achieving loss of ability to evaluate logically by preventing private contemplation .
8 ) DISINHIBITION - Encouraging child - like obedience by orchestrating child - like behaviour
9 ) UNCOMPROMISING RULES - Inducing regression and disorientation by soliciting agreement to seemingly simple rules which regulate mealtimes , bathroom breaks and use of medications .
10 ) VERBAL ABUSE - Desensitizing through bombardment with foul and abusive language .
( Physical abuse , such as torture , is the more extreme form of this . )
11 ) SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND FATIGUE - Creating disorientation and vulnerability by prolonging mental an physical activity and withholding adequate rest and sleep .
12 ) DRESS CODES - Removing individuality by demanding conformity to the group dress code .
13 ) CHANTING OR SINGING - Eliminating non-cult ideas through group repetition of mind - narrowing chants or phrases .
14 ) CONFESSION - Encouraging the destruction of individual ego through confession of personal weaknesses and innermost feelings of doubt .
15 ) FINANCIAL COMMITMENT - Achieving increased dependence on the group by ' burning bridges ' to the past , through the donation of assets .
16 ) FINGER POINTING - Creating a false sense of righteousness by pointing to the shortcomings of the outside world .
17 ) ISOLATION - Inducing loss of reality by physical separation from family , friends , society and rational references .
18 ) CONTROLLED APPROVAL - Maintaining vulnerability and confusion by alternately rewarding and punishing similar actions .
19 ) CHANGE OF DIET - Creating disorientation and increased susceptibility to emotional arousal by depriving the nervous system of necessary nutrients through the use of special diets and / or fasting .
Also applying drugs for these purposes fall in this category .
20 ) GAMES - Inducing dependence on the group by introducing games with obscure rules .
21 ) NO QUESTIONS - Accomplishing automatic acceptance of beliefs by discouraging questions .
22 ) GUILT - Reinforcing the need for ' salvation ' by exaggerating the sins of the former lifestyles .
23 ) FEAR - Maintaining loyalty and obedience to the group by threatening soul , life or limb for the slightest ' negative ' thought , word or deed .
Three Principles of Re-Education
1 ) REPETITION - Going through the same subject over and over again until it is known by heart .
2 ) ACTIVITY PEDAGOGICS -
The subjects are never left alone nor give any private time of their own , they are always in activity .
3 ) CRITICISM AND SELF -CRITICISM -
The subjects are supposed to feel uncertain ; under the constant threat of being humiliated and despised .
In the Korean War the " criticism and self - criticism " sessions held for the American prisoners of war by the Chinese clearly had deeper effects than the POWs could initially comprehend , and when they found out , it was too late .
In the beginning many prisoners found this whole procedure just childish , and were inclined to take it merely as something of a joke , but without them being able to realize it , the situation of being subjected constantly to the criticism of one 's comrades became humiliating .
That a grown - up person should publicly discuss one 's habits or inclinations -- some of them of very private nature -- confess one 's faults , receive strong criticism for insignificant misdemeanours , will not be indeed in the course of time anything to be considered childish or playful : it simply will be experienced as insulting .
This continuing feeling of humiliation became crucial in the gradual psychological break - up of the prisoners ' personalities .
Furthermore , this ongoing process of " criticism and self - criticism " was bound to cause mistrust for one 's own comrades : it was the tactics of " divide and conquer " as the ancient Romans would have called it .
( " Criticism and self - criticism " were also widely applied during China 's " Cultural Revolution " starting in 1966 , as a method of " re-education " . )

Michelle Ortiz was serving one year at the Ohio Reformatory for Women , a state prison in Marysville , when she was molested by a male guard .
A recent article in the Columbus Dispatch describes what happened next :
When Ortiz reported the first assault to prison official Paula Jordan , the official told the inmate that the male guard was being transferred from the facility and was “ just a dirty old man . ”
That same evening , the male guard assaulted her again .
Rebecca Bright , another prison official who launched an investigation , ordered Ortiz placed in solitary confinement , where she was handcuffed .
Bright reportedly argued that Ortiz was talking about the incident with other inmates .
Other accounts were more specific :
In the first assault , Ortiz was “ fondled ” by the guard , who then told her “ I ’ll get you tomorrow , watch . ”
In the second , which took place after she had appealed for help , the guard returned while Ortiz was asleep and raped her .
The assaults took place back in 1996 .
Subsequently , Ortiz sued both prison officials in federal court for doing nothing to protect her from the guard and punishing her instead .
A jury awarded her $ 625,000 in damages .
But Bright and Jordan appealed the verdict , and the US 6th Circuit Court of Appeals “ ruled 2 - 1 that the prison officials had qualified immunity , shielding them from paying damages ” to Ortiz .
The third judge , however , issued an outraged dissent .
As the AP reported :
It is extremely rare for a prison inmate ’s civil rights complaint to overcome preliminary legal obstacles and persuade a jury there was a violation , said Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey , the dissenting appeals court judge .
Given the statistics , Daughtrey said , “ I view this result as a legal travesty . ”
The evidence against Bright and Jordan was strong , she said .
“ The majority ’s decision to overturn the jury ’s verdict strikes me not just as an unfortunate result in this case , but as one that is thoroughly senseless . ”
Against the objections of Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray , the US Supreme Court–also not known for its sympathy to “ prison inmate ’s civil rights complaints ” –has now agreed to review the case , and will hear arguments in the fall .
The wheels of justice move slowly , when they move at all .
Back in 2003 , the organization Stop Prisoner Rape–now renamed Just Detention International –published a report on the sexual abuse of prisoners by guards at the Ohio Reformatory for Women ( ORW ) Alerted to the problem by a prison psychiatrist , Stop Prisoner Rape ( SPR ) interviewed several staff whistleblowers , as well as prisoners , and discovered a “ climate of abuse . ”
Inmates described a range of incidents , including violent encounters , threats and pressure to submit to sexual advances , trading sex for goods and favors , and relationships that were seemingly consensual .
However , for women under near - total control of prison staff , the concept of “ consenting ” to sex is virtually meaningless ( and Ohio law reflects this ) .
The problems arising from this power imbalance are compounded by the past history of sexual abuse that many female inmates have endured .
SPR learned that women who report sexual misconduct are routinely sent to solitary confinement , unusually harsh conditions in the hole at ORW may compound the trauma .
This use of isolation emboldens perpetrators who know that the practice discourages women from reporting abuse .
SPR concluded that the problem was compounded by the Ohio prison system ’s “ instututional response ” –or lack of it .
They found a “ culture of silence and denial ” at the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction that began its director , Reginald Wilkinson .
Head of the sixth - largest prison system in the country , Wilkinson “ repeatedly made public statements denying that any problem exists and discouraging suggestions for reform , ” including the Prison Rape Elimination Act ( PREA ) , which was passed unanimously by Congress in 2003 .
In an op - ed opposing the legislation , Wilkinson argued that the data on prison sexual assaults was “ highly exaggerated ” and based on “ disingenuous data ( self reporting ) . ”
While investigating allegations at the Ohio Reformatory for Women , SPR interviewed Warden Deborah Timmerman .
According to SPR ’s report :
Timmerman - Cooper confirmed that prisoners who complained of sexual abuse were transferred to segregation , losing their privileges while there .
She justified this policy by saying that it was necessary in order to protect the inmate while officials investigated the incident , but could not explain why those inmates should be stripped of basic privileges and locked in isolation for 23 hours a day … .
In summary , SPR has found extensive and credible evidence that an environment consistently conducive to sexual abuse exists at the Ohio Reformatory for Women and that a pattern of abuse may exist at other Ohio women ’s facilities …
The isolation and punishment of inmates who report sexual assault is a practice that punishes victims and encourages staff misconduct .
In Ohio , it is a policy that has fostered a climate of abuse and intimidation and undercut respect for human rights .
This happens to be a pivotal moment in the effort to combat the epidemic of sexual assaults in detention .
The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission , which was created by the PREA in 2003 , has issued recommendations for a new set of national standards to address the problem .
As David Kaiser and Lovisa Stannow wrote earlier this year in their two excellent articles in the New York Review of Books on prison rape and how it can be stopped :
One of the most pernicious myths about prisoner rape is that it is an inevitable part of life behind bars .
This is simply wrong …
In well - run facilities across the country it is being prevented — and this should n’t be surprising , the government has extraordinary control over the lives of those it locks up .
Stopping sexual abuse in detention is a matter of using sound policies and practices , and passing laws that require them .
Attorney General Eric Holder has until June to review the recommended standards proposed by the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission and turn them into federal regulations , which would make them binding on prisons and other detention facilities .
Predictably , they are being opposed by some leaders of the powerful corrections industry , and questioned on the basis of cost .
The Department of Justice has opened a 60 - day public comment period on the standards .
That comment period ends in one week , on May 10 .
Just Dentention International is hosting a petition urging Attorney General Eric Holder to enact the strongest possible standards .
You can sign the petition on JDI ’s web site here , or its Facebook page here .
US POLICE raided a bar in Ocean City , Maryland , over the weekend after customers there confused a female drinker for Canadian teen heartthrob Justin Bieber .
Regulars at the Mug and Mallet bar confirmed police entered the venue Saturday night , following reports that Bieber , 16 , was drinking underage inside reported TMZ today .
Instead , they found a 27 - year - old female Bieber lookalike , with the same petite frame and tousled short brown hairstyle as that of the pint - sized pop sensation .
The woman , known only as Katie , told TMZ she was mistaken for Bieber all the time - and was forced to produce her ID card to police to prove she was not him .
Bieber is due in Maryland this year but not until September , when he will perform at the state fair .
Last weekend , at the time of his apparent sighting , he was actually in The Bahamas on a photo shoot with U.S. socialite Kim Kardashian .

With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse
Courtesy of Chris , here is photographic evidence of the startling discovery we made a few months ago at the Glasgow Science Centre
The idea is a demonstration of Pythagoras 's theorem that a ^2 + b ^2 = c ^ 2 .
The area ( a^2 + b ^2 ) in this case is equal to the cross-sectional area of the two smaller tanks filled with fluid .
Then we simply rotate the apparatus and let the " hypotenuse " tank fill with fluid .
The result : the larger tank does not contain all the fluid .
a ^2 + b^2 > c^ 2 .
Convincing experimental disproof of Pythagoras 's theorem !
I think it 's great that thousands of Scottish schoolchildren are getting to witness first - hand hoary mathematical theories being uprooted by real - world experiments .
That is science in action !
We just featured an article about London ’s construction frenzy , which includes over half a dozen skyscrapers for the city .
This new era will completely alter the city ’s skyline as tall buildings will be sprouting everywhere to house new office , commercial , and residential activities .
Of these new structures , Renzo Piano ’s 310 meter high mix-used tower , The Shard ( be sure to check out our coverage of the tower ) , will not only become London ’s tallest tower , but also the tallest building in all of Western Europe .
Of all of London ’s new developments , we are excited to see this dynamic tower ’s impact on the city and its relationship with London ’s context and future neighboring skyscrapers .
We have new images to share from Renzo Piano Building Workshop and more video clips of the construction progress after the break .

BGR appears to have nabbed a document being distributed by Apple corporate to AppleCare reps tasked with handling iPhone 4 customers miffed with the antenna performance fiasco -- and for the time being , the recommendations are focusing on managing expectations , not fixing the problem .
In a nutshell , reps are being instructed to pass on a more politically correct version of Steve 's email by telling customers that they should " avoid covering the black strip in the lower - left corner of the metal band . "
Interestingly , they agree that bumpers might fix the problem , but they 're emphatic in saying that they " ARE NOT appeasing customers with free bumpers – DON'T promise a free bumper to customers . "
And yes , that statement is complete with caps and bold in the source document , so they mean business , it would seem .
If it 's any consolation , Apple says that " the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best [ they ] have ever shipped , " but let 's be honest : for those zapping their calls into the afterlife every time they brush their phone the wrong way , it 's not much consolation at all .
MAKING HISTORY
By Stephen Fry
380 pages .
Random House . $ 24 .
Remember '' Springtime for Hitler , '' the campy , mock - Nazi musical in Mel Brooks 's film '' The Producers ' ' ?
It 's hard to imagine such a tasteless idea actually getting off the ground in real life , but that is exactly what the new novel by the British writer and actor Stephen Fry aspires to do .
'' Making History , '' which is being promoted as ''a thriller with a funny streak , '' uses Hitler and the Holocaust as fodder for an antic comedy about time travel and academic high jinks : the subject matter of '' Shoah ' ' seen through the lens , if you can believe it , of '' Back to the Future ' ' and '' Lucky Jim . ' '
The resulting novel is both shockingly tasteless and deeply offensive .
The plot of '' Making History ' ' goes like this : a bumbling graduate student in history named Michael Young and a professor of physics named Leo Zuckermann decide that the world would be a better place if Hitler never existed , and with the help of a time machine they use a male contraceptive to insure that Hitler is never born .
As in a Ray Bradbury story , the results are not what they expected : with no Hitler to stand in his way , a charismatic maniac named Rudolf Gloder ( a character invented by Mr. Fry ) assumes leadership of the Nazi Party and uses the atomic bomb to take over Europe and the Soviet Union .
He eventually concocts a monstrously evil plan , using the same contraceptives Michael used to prevent Hitler 's birth , to wipe out all the Jews of Europe .
Faced with the horrifying consequences of their actions , Michael and Leo decide that they must reverse the events they set in motion .
The remainder of the novel chronicles their efforts to '' make the world a better place by insuring that Adolf Hitler lived and prospered . ''
It is a premise that inadvertently suggests that all evil is relative and that the six million Jews who died in the real - life Holocaust were an unfortunate but somehow acceptable number .
As his earlier novels like '' The Hippopotamus ' ' have demonstrated , Mr. Fry possesses ample comic talents , but in this volume he uses them to try to put a humorous gloss on one of history 's darkest moments .
The doctoral thesis written by his hero Michael , for instance , treats Hitler 's life story as a schlocky comic novel .
It depicts the sexual union between Hitler 's parents that led to his conception ; it shows the young Hitler trying to stand up to his domineering father , and it suggests that much of Hitler 's character was simply a function of his dysfunctional family .
Economics is like actuarial science : Voodoo predictions based on a set of assumptions and mathematical models .
The thing is , none of those models work when behavior is erratic , rules broken and and focus put on the quick buck rather than true growth .
If no other lesson from the financial meltdown resonates , let that one ring .
Alan Greenspan knows it too .
That 's why he came before Congress on October 28 , 2008 and told them he was wrong :
He was wrong , yes , but now he 's not willing to blame the Wall Street moguls for everything .
In March , he gave this gem of an interview to Bloomberg News .
Here are some of the mind - boggling parts :
HUNT : Right .
Let ’s talk about the subprime a little bit .
You said in your Brookings speech , I ’m going to quote you , “ We at the Federal Reserve ( this was a footnote I think actually ) were aware - GREENSPAN : I ’m impressed .
HUNT : - ( inaudible ) as early as 2000 of instances of some highly irregular subprime mortgage underwriting practices but regrettably viewed it as a localized problem subject to standard prudential oversight , not the precursor of what was to happen . ”
Is that saying you saw instances of highly irregular underwriting , but you did n’t dig deeper ?
GREENSPAN : No , we knew that there was a lot of egregious underwriting going on .
The critical issue is that it was n’t subprime per se that created the triggering of the crisis .
It was securitized subprime .
And securitization did n’t happen until mid-2003 , 2004 in the volume , including not only securitization but essentially adjustable rate mortgages - subprime adjustable rate mortgages
I had to read that twice , but I think I understand it now .
My interpretation : " We knew there were a lot of toxic assets being created , but it was ok because at that point they were n't carved up and bundled as securities . "
This happens after the S&L mess , Orange County , California 's bankruptcy after a $ 1.6 billion dollar loss on derivatives , and the failure of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 due to a huge derivative loss .
If there was a lesson to learn from those three events it is this : Bad loans make bad investments .
If that has the ring of truth , how on earth can Greenspan sit and admit with a straight face that he knew bad loans were being made ?
Of course , Greenspan loves hedge funds now , especially since he consults for one of the biggest ones , and has since January , 2008 .
They love him too .
Digby points out that the guy who loves him best is John Paulson .
THAT John Paulson .
The Goldman - Sachs - is - in - very - deep - trouble John Paulson .
Let that deep conflict of interest sink in .
His next tidbit made my head explode .
In a discussion about the deficit , the current recovery , whether it 's sustainable , and whether a value - added tax makes sense he says this :
GREENSPAN : The problem , however , is very much the type of issue that Greece has got .
We can find money to bail them out in the short run .
But unless the underlying system contracts , the deficit contracts , it ’s just delaying the problem .
So I ’m not convinced by any means that we can succeed in stabilizing this long term outlook strictly from a value added tax because unless we come to grips with the fundamental issue , which is the fact that we have promised in the ways of benefits for Medicare , for Social Security physically more than we have assets to deliver with .
So the economy can only grow so far and right now the claims on the real economy , forget finance , are getting larger and larger .
And it is not an issue just in Social Security I might add , its money .
You can always print money and solve it .
Medicare is a defined - is not a defined benefit program .
It is one based on the physical needs of the population .
Those darn American people again .
Sitting around on Main Street , getting in the way of the economic recovery with their health care and retirement needs .
Those entitlements .
This is the same guy who gave away the Treasury to the rich guys by green - lighting Bush tax cuts .
The same guy who testified that cutting the deficit and creating a surplus was the way to economic growth in the 90s before he said if the deficit got too low and the US got too solvent , it could cause economic problems in 2000 .
The same guy who let John Paulson endow a chair in economics in his name at NYU so he could leave a legacy of inconsistent , erratic , self serving conservative monetary policy to students in perpetuity .
If you 're in the mood for some common sense abuse , read the whole thing .
He 'll explain why big banks should n't be broken up but why they should n't be bailed out , why regulators missed the warning signs of the meltdown ( I 'd argue they ignored them , did n't miss them ) , why Fannie and Freddie were good before they were bad , and more .
It would be so nice if something made sense for a change .

Manufacturers of electronic devices do n’t seem to be able to get a global standard on docking connectors , resulting in that youusually end up buying a new dock for every electronic device you acquire .
In the past I bought multiple iPod docks ( also see my other article about bypassing the Apple video out protection on older docks here ) , but I own more devices than just the ones from Apple .
My current mobile phone is a Motorola Milestone ( or Droid if you are from the US ) , which of course does not fit on an iPod dock .
Not willing to buy new docks I decided to build an adapter to enable me to use my iPod docks with my mobile phone .
This article will describe step - by - step how I have built this dock adapter .
Because I am from Europe ( the Netherlands to be precise ) my Motorola device is named a Milestone , but the whole article of course is just as applicable to the Motorola Droid .
For the ease of use I will just refer to the ‘ Motorola Milestone ’ in this article from now on .
However , the methodology that this article contains could , in theory , be applied to almost all Android devices .
Since all the information in this document is gathered from the internet or analyzed by myself it could be that there are some errors in this document , I am sorry if that is the case .
Any opinion expressed in this document is solely my own .
Goals
The goal of this project is to create a dock adapter which enables the Motorola Milestone to charge , output music and switch to docking ( multimedia ) mode .
The Motorola Milestone charges through the micro USB connector on its side .
To enable charging through our dock adapter we will need to equip it with a micro USB connector .
Since the Motorola Milestone does not provide audio output through the micro USB connector , we will have to use the headphone connector on the top of the device to enable audio out .
To enable automatic switching to docking mode on the Motorola Milestone the device is equipped with a magnetic sensor .
When a magnet is placed against a certain location on the device it will recognize the dock type ( Media or Car ) by the polarization of the magnet .
With some testing I found the best location for the magnet is at the back of the device above the micro USB connector and a bit to the right .
This location is shown on the picture below which shows the back of the Motorola Milestone .
Using a magnet in our dock adapter will enable us to use the multimedia docking mode .
So , our dock connector will need to have a micro USB and audio connector as well as a magnet in it .
The last part to enable us to connect it to the iPod dock will of course be a connector which fits the iPod dock itself .
The schematic design for the dock adapter is shown in the next image .
Parts
This chapter will list all the parts that are needed to create the dock adapter .
The specific parts used in this document might not be the most obvious , but they were cheap and available at the time of executing this project .
i Pod dock connector
Since good dock connectors seem to be quite expensive and hard to find , I decided to buy a cheap Dock extender cable and harvest the connector from that .
The Dock extender cable has been bought from DealExtreme for just $ 3.14 :
Dock Extender Male / Female Cable for All iPod/iPhone 2G /3G
http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.21892
The dock connector from this cable has almost all the pins available to make use of and provides nice solder pads to connect wires to .
Since this is not always the case it is good to keep this in mind when looking for a suitable dock connector .
3,5 mm stereo audio plug
The audio cable I used in this project was one I had lying around .
It suited this project fine since it had an angled jack connector , which I preferred .
An alternative cable could be bought from DealExtreme for just $ 1.80 :
3.5 mm Male to 3.5 mm + 2.5 mm Audio Male Audio Cable
http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.39763
Of course any 3,5 mm stereo audio plug will be fine .
Micro USB connector
The Micro USB connector I used in this project has been harvested from a headphone adapter for another Motorola device .
I bought this connector with the hope it would enable audio out from the micro USB port of the Motorola Milestone ( which it of course did not ) .
This adapter has been bought from DealExtreme for just $ 2.27 :
3.5 mm Stereo Audio Headphone Adapter For Motorola V8/V9
http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.30099
Of course any micro USB connector will be fine .
Magnets
To enable the docking mode on the Motorola Milestone we will need some magnets , the following magnets from DealExtreme will suit our needs just fine for only $ 2.09 :
Super - Strong Rare - Earth RE Magnets ( 10 - Pack 9 mm )
http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.3461
I ended up using four out of the ten magnets .
Polymorph
To create the encasing of the dock adapter we will use Polymorph , which is a polymer that can easily be moulded when heated at moderate temperatures .
Polymorph is great stuff for prototyping and can be remoulded time after time .
I bought my Polymorph from eBay , but it can be found at various places online .
Some more info can be found on the website of the company I bought it from :
http://www.c-d-c-shop.com/polymorph.htm
Pin outs
Before we can start to build the dock we will need the pinouts of the various components .
This chapter will show the pinouts for all the components used .
3.5 mm stereo audio plug pinout
The following image shows the pinout of the 3.5 mm stereo audio plug :
The pinout for the 3.5 mm stereo audio plug can also be found online at :
http://pinouts.ru/Home/Tele35s_pinout.shtml
Micro USB pinout
The following image shows the pinout of the micro USB plug from the Motorola Milestone side , not the cable side .
The cable side is the same pinout in opposite direction .
The pinout for the micro USB connector can also be found online at :
http://pinoutsguide.com/CellularPhones-Nokia/micro_usb_connector_pinout.shtml
Dock connector pinout
The following image shows the pinout of the Apple iPod dock connector on the board we will be using to create our adapter .
The pinout for the iPod dock connector can also be found online at :
http://pinouts.ru/PortableDevices/ipod_pinout.shtml
Wiring
Now that we have all the pinouts for the components we can now see how we should wire the components together .
The table below shows which pins should be connected together .
Component Connector
Wire colour Connected to 3,5 mm stereo GND ( audio ) Metal Dock 2 Audio right Red Dock 3 Audio left White Dock 4 Micro USB Vcc Red Dock 16 GND ( USB ) Copper Dock 23 Data – Green – Blue Data +
The colours mentioned in the table refer to the wire colours of the components named in this article , when using other components these wire colours will probably be different .
To enable the Motorola Milestone to accept the power on the USB port , the USB Data - and Data + connections should be linked to each other .
Without these points connected the device will not charge .
The following image shows the wiring inside our dock adapter :
Building the adapter
Having the different components , the design and the wiring schematics , it is now time to actually build the adapter .
After soldering the components together I shortened the original dock encasing a bit because it was larger than needed .
To hold everything together I filled the dock encasing with hot glue , resulting in the prototype shown below .
Polymorph encasing
The prototype showed above already works as a dock adapter however it does not hold the Motorola Milestone in its place .
To build an encasing for the dock adapter that holds the Motorola Milestone in its place we will be using Polymorph .
Polymorph consists of small plastic pellets which can be melted in hot water .
My general approach is to melt the pellets in hot water , press them together and making small sheets of plastic of it .
These plastic sheets can be cut with scissors to preferred sizes .
I personally like to use a hot air gun to melt these sheets again and then use them in the project .
The encasing of the adapter has been made of multiple layers of Polymorph which have been melted together .
The encasing also holds the magnets for the docking mode option .
Result
The following images show the end result of our Motorola Milestone iPod dock adapter .
When the Motorola Milestone is connected to the adapter it will go into multimedia docking mode right away and start charging .
After connecting the audio cable to the headphone connector it will output its audio to the dock as well .
The Motorola Milestone is standing solid on the adapter and works great .
This article showed how to build an iPod dock adapter for the Motorola Milestone , however this information can easily be used to create adapters for other devices as well .
If anyone is going to build a similar adapter for the Motorola Milestone or another device , I am for sure interested to know about it .
The adapter that I have built might not be the quality of an official one , but it is of course a prototype and it works pretty well .
It probably is not going to happen , but I would really appreciate if any company out there would just build and sell adapters like this .

" Education , education , education . "
Despite 13 years in power , and six different education secretaries , Labour 's record on schools was patchy .
Standards at secondary level improved considerably , but , according to one London School of Economics study , " the improvement in primary schools since 2000 has been more muted " .
During the same period , middle - class parents pored ever more obsessively over school league tables and Ofsted reports , and monopolised the best state primary and secondary schools at the expense of poorer families .
Can this self - proclaimed " progressive " Tory - Lib Dem coalition do any better ?
The Conservatives ' election manifesto correctly identified " improving our school system " as " the most important thing we can do to make opportunity more equal and address our declining social mobility " .
And in Michael Gove , the government has a clever and ambitious politician to push through its contentious programme to reform the country 's schools .
The new Education Secretary - one of his first acts was to rename his department the Department for Education - is a fascinating character .
A founding member of the " modernising " faction in the Conservative Party , and one of a handful of backbench MPs who urged an inexperienced David Cameron to stand for the leadership in 2005 , Gove is , in the words of a friend who has known him since his student days at Oxford University , " a formidable debater , with a very sharp mind . . . [ and a ] very effective big- picture operator " .
Heir to Blair
Gove was a pluralist long before Cameron exchanged vows with Nick Clegg .
And he remains the Conservative frontbencher most likely to reach out across party lines in order to win hearts and minds - a useful quality for an Education Secretary facing a battle with the teaching unions .
In the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003 , Gove expressed admiration for Tony Blair ( " I can't fight my feelings any more : I love Tony " ) ; he has also lavished praise on Andrew Adonis , the Blairite former schools minister and architect of Labour 's education reform agenda .
During the coalition negotiations last month , Gove even used a BBC interview to announce that he would be willing to give up his own cabinet seat to a Liberal Democrat .
His may have been the last major cabinet post to be filled during the horse - trading that led to the formation of the Con - Lib Dem coalition , but it would be a mistake to underestimate Gove 's importance to Cameron .
A member of the so - called Notting Hill set , Gove was one of only two Tory frontbenchers who attended the private family burial of the Prime Minister 's son Ivan in March 2009 .
His wife , the columnist Sarah Vine , is a close friend of Samantha Cameron and often helps with the school run for the PM's two children , Nancy and Arthur .
Gove , charming and self - deprecating in person , is said to see himself as a future prime minister .
As the adopted son of a Labour - supporting family in Aberdeen , whose adoptive father was a fish merchant , he would certainly command wider support than , say , the privileged George Osborne .
One former colleague of the Education Secretary says he is " the politest man I have ever met " .
But for all his pluralist credentials , Gove is a card - carrying Eurosceptic right - winger , with a Thatcherite agenda for education .
He has , for example , lined up two apologists for empire , Andrew Roberts and Niall Ferguson , to advise on a new history curriculum , and has scrapped the previous government 's programme of extending free school meals to a further 500,000 low - income families .
Moreover , he says he has " no ideological objection " to private companies seeking to profit from the running of academy schools .
According to Chris Husbands of the Institute of Education , the Tories ' plans for a new generation of academies may well amount to the " most significant change in the school system in 45 years " .
Cameron and Gove are staking much of the government 's " radical " reputation on their Academies Bill , which allows for up to 500 secondary and 1,700 primary schools to apply for academy status before September , thereby opting out of local - authority supervision .
Sold to the public as a revolutionary act of localism and " parent power " , the Academies Bill in fact disenfranchises parents .
Instead , it empowers head teachers and governors , and hands huge powers to a single politician in Whitehall .
" It is hard to escape the conclusion that this bill is undemocratic , " the education barrister David Wolfe has said .
" What it does is remove the public process .
Nobody , apart from the Education Secretary and the governors , will be able to stop the process . "
Two - tier education
In any case , are more academies the answer ?
" There is no evidence that an expansion of the academies programme . . . would improve average educational attainment , " said the LSE 's Centre for Economic Performance in April .
And a study carried out by the centre - right think tank Civitas in December 2009 , found a " lack of expected transparency " in the exam results published by such schools .
Because academies are exempted from the Freedom of Information Act , " We do not know how they are achieving their results at GCSE level . "
Nonetheless , Gove has informed all schools judged " outstanding " by Ofsted that they have been " pre-approved " for academy status .
But
if they are already outstanding , why meddle with them ?
Under Labour , academies at least had a somewhat noble aim : to replace " failing " schools in predominantly poorer areas .
By contrast , the coalition is offering academy status , and the freedoms that go with it , to some of the most socially exclusive schools in the country .
Will there be resistance to Gove 's plans ?
" You would n't want to find yourself on the right side of an argument against Michael , let alone the wrong side of one , " says one friend of the Education Secretary .
And the front - runners for the Labour leadership are compromised by their support for academies in office and their refusal to repent in opposition .
Labour has made much of the likely costs of Gove 's reforms , but its opposition to this " rolling back of the state " across the education sector has to be based on principle , not affordability .
We are heading towards a two - tier , market - orientated school system in which power is concentrated in the hands of the Secretary of State .
So much for " progressive " Conservatism and the " big society " .

I would find it strongly preferrable to remove that assignment ( doing so does n't seem to break anything in the test suite ) .
I was at 30,000 feet when the crash hit on Thursday .
When I landed in NY and saw what happened , the first thought was trader error .
But the evidence for that remains lacking .
I spent a good part of the weekend trying to track down evidence that it was HFT , or a fat thumb , or a NYSE erroneous trade halt .
To date , the best analysis I ’ve seen came from a young analyst on an institutional desk .
His forensic approach to piecing together what occurred is the best explanation I have come upon :
~~~
While “ trader error ” or “ a fat finger ” may have been a catalyst for certain elements of the decline , it also may not have been .
It may have been a “ computer error ” and it may not have been .
Do you notice how we ’re unwittingly restricting our analysis to what the sellers did ?
The offer side of the trading that saw the S&P 500 lose - 5 % of its value in the span of about 3 minutes – that after it had already declined by over - 3 % – is a RED HERRING .
It ’s misdirection – hand wringing over what is irrelevant at the expense of ignoring what is relevant … and what ’s relevant is the bid side of the market , that is , what the buyers did .
Volume was gigantic [ Thursday ] before we really went into freefall .
As of 2 p.m. , some 40 minutes before Armageddon , we were tracking for a massive 15.6 billion share day ( we ended up doing 19.3 billion – the second largest day ever after the October 10th , 2008 whitewash ) .
Half an hour later , at 2:30 p.m. – still ten minutes before the bottom fell out – volume had surged and we were tracking for a 17.2 billion share day .
The period between 2 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. saw immense selling pressure in both the cash market and the futures market , and that occurred with the E - minis still north of 1120 .
Check out the below graphs .

In other words , it was not a sudden , random surge of volume from a fat finger that overwhelmed the market .
It was a steady onslaught of selling that pressured the market lower in order to catch up with the carnage taking place in the credit markets and the currency markets .
Take a look at the next charts , the chart on the left , which clearly shows the surge in the yen preceding the drop in the stock market .

But what about the final thrust lower – the seeming air pocket ?
We know , thanks to our friends at CNBC who were fixated on this particular stock , that Proctor & Gamble tumbled by over - 35 % in the span of about 5 minutes .
It ’s impossible to tell by looking at a chart of the stock , but when you look at the individual prints you can see that this was not a case in which two or three “ erroneous ” prints marked the tape down to $ 39 before the stock sprang back to $ 60 .
I ’ve got 28 pages in front of me of P&G prints that occurred between $ 39 and $ 50 per share and between 2:46 p.m. and 2:51 p.m .
At 36 prints per page , that means P&G traded over one thousand times at those “ crazy ” and “ surely erroneous ” levels .
I ’m sorry , but that is n’t an error , THAT IS WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL TRADING .
So what happened here ?
Three things :
1. Sellers probably had orders in algorithms – percentage - of - volume strategies most likely , maybe VWAP – and could not cancel , could not “ get an out . ”
These sellers could be really “ quanty ” types , or high freqs , or they could be vanilla buy side accounts .
It really does n’t matter .
The issue here is that the trader did not anticipate such a sharp price move and did not put a limit on the order .
The fact that the technology may have failed does not mean the
trader deserves a do - over , it means that the trader and the broker who provided the algorithm need to decide whether any losses should be split .
2 . Sell stop orders were triggered which forced market sell orders into an already well offered market .
3 . While the market was well offered , it was not well bid .
Liquidity disappeared .
For example , in P&G , 200 shares traded at $ 44.10 at 2:51:04 in the afternoon and one second later , at 2:51:05 , three hundred shares traded at $ 47.08 .
That ’s a three dollar jump in one second .
Bids disappeared , spreads blew out , and no one was trading except a handful of orphaned algo orders , stop sell orders , and maybe a few opportunists who had loaded up the order
book with low ball bids ( “ just in case ” ) .
High frequency accounts and electronic market makers were , by all accounts , nowhere to be found .
It boils down to this : this episode exposed structural flaws in how a trade is implemented ( think orphaned algo orders ) and it exposed the danger of leaving market making up to a network of entities with no mandate to ensure the smooth and orderly functioning of the market ( think of the electronic market makers and high freqs who can pull bids instantaneously as opposed to a specialist on the floor who has a clearly defined mandate to provide liquidity ) .
Now that that is settled , we can return our attention to what caused the selling in the first place : Greek contagion .
Currently , the euro is rallying on speculation that the European Central Bank is going to announce a reopening of its emergency 1 - year funding program for its constituent banks over the weekend .
Interbank lending has become more expensive as the perception of counterparty risk has grown more acute .

A thought here on the ECB ’s action :
It will likely prove as fruitless in stopping the carnage as the Fed ’s liquidity measures taken in the summer of 2007 :
• Greek contagion may represent a similar magnitude threat as the subprime debt crisis three years ago .
Subprime debt service was contingent upon rising house prices and house prices were going inexorably lower – so the market was doomed , in effect .
Peripheral European debt service is contingent upon rising tax revenues relative to government outlays in those countries .
Is pulling off this austerity effort without instituting debt deflationary dynamics as doomed as subprime borrowers ’ efforts to service their debts three years ago ?
For Greece and Portugal , it may be .
•
If we say that Spain and Italy are not in the same pickle , and that these countries ’ debt markets are analogous to the Alt - A mortgage market , maybe the contagion can be quarantined as it could not be in 2007 .
The X - factor is the growth trajectory of the euro zone and the extent to which that trajectory is depressed by a drop off in Greek and Portuguese demand and by general financial instability in the zone .
If growth in Italy or Spain were to falter , they could become subject to the same treatment as Greece and Portugal are currently receiving ( I should probably throw Ireland in there somewhere between Portugal and Spain ) .
Like in 2007 , it may take several more months before we understand how spikes in libor and euribor have affected European growth .

CHEYENNE , Wyoming --
A grizzly bear killed a man outside Yellowstone National Park , apparently just hours after researchers trapped and tranquilized the animal .
The attack happened Thursday in the same place where two researchers with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team had examined a large adult male grizzly earlier that day , Park County Sheriff Scott Steward said Friday .
The suspect bear was wearing a radio collar .
Authorities did n't intend to venture into the woods to chase the animal , however .
They hoped to trap it -- again -- and do DNA testing to see if it was indeed responsible .
Shoshone National Forest officials closed off the Kitty Creek area , about 6 miles outside the Yellowstone East Entrance , until further notice .
The victim was Erwin Frank Evert , 70 , of Wyoming , who went hiking around 12:45 p.m. local time from his cabin in the Kitty Creek drainage .
When Evert did n't return , his wife went looking for him and met one of the bear researchers .
The researchers had been getting ready to leave the area but one of them returned to the place where they had found the bear in a previously set trap , then tranquilized the animal for study .
The researcher found Evert 's body where they had left the bear to wake up , about 2 miles from Evert 's cabin .
The team is made up of federal and state biologists who monitor and study grizzlies in the Yellowstone ecosystem .
The researchers also had trapped and tranquilized another grizzly in the area Thursday .
Schwartz said there would be an investigation , including into whether required procedures were followed , such as posting warning signs about the grizzly research .
Schwartz said it was n't certain whether the trapped grizzly had mauled Evert .
But Chris Servheen , grizzly bear recovery coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , said it 's unlikely that another grizzly would have been in the same area as the large adult male .
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department was working Friday to try to recapture the bear , agency spokesman Eric Keszler said .
Grizzly bears have been back on the federal list of threatened species since last year .
Say so long to initiatives as we 've known them .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8 - to - 1 decision Thursday that it's more important that people have full access to the names and addresses of petition signers than it is to protect those signers from intimidation and harassment .
The harassment is real , as political activists around the country have threatened – and even followed through on threats – to spread widely the names and addresses of people who have signed onto controversial ballot measures .
Then their adversaries can contact them about their political ideology .
Talk about an awkward and unwelcome moment on your porch .
Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown welcomed the Supreme Court 's decision , saying all citizens suffer when governments operate in secret .
( Even though that 's not really what having privacy for petition signers does .
Voters operate " in secret " every election , after all . )
Brown is also not worried groups will routinely put the names of people who sign petitions online , saying , “ Certainly there is that potential .
It has not happened so far in Oregon .
But I was really clear , when we discussed this issue during the last session .
That if there is any harassment , we will pass legislation to prohibit that . "
Let ’s hope so .
As Justice Clarence Thomas , the lone dissenter of the court majority opinion , said , publishing names chills citizen participation in the referendum process .
When people vote , how they voted is kept private .
If it was n’t , can you imagine how voter turnout would plummet ?
A lot of people like to keep their political opinions to themselves .
Because petitions represent ideas , it would offer consistency to the system to keep the names and addresses of those supporting a petition a private matter , too .
Once the voter is verified by the state , the name and address of a voter should remain off limits to political activists of any stripe who are on a mission to silence political thought .
Now that the court has sided with signatures going viral , it will become harder than ever before to get people to sign onto a ballot measure .
Which is , of course , fine by a lot of folks , not to mention the hope of many political activists who do n’t want to see certain ballot measures come to fruition .
( The ballot measure that spawned this Supreme Court battle was an anti-gay rights measure in Washington state that voters there rightly rejected . )
For those of us who still see ballot measures as an opportunity to act when our Legislatures wo n't , get ready to mourn the demise of a tool designed expressly for the people .

Physicians have had to live under a series of payment ' fixes ' which get harder and harder to enact because even a freeze in physician fees is counted against the deficit .
Senate passes ' doc fix '
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the Senate - passed bill that would fully restore Medicare payments to physicians , further dragging out a payment nightmare for doctors that started June 1 .
After squabbling for weeks over a broad tax extenders package that already cleared the House , the Senate passed a stand - alone , $ 6.4 billion patch to stop a 21 percent cut in the rate at which doctors are paid for treating Medicare patients .
The narrow bill was passed by unanimous consent Friday after Republicans objected to the Democrats ' larger plans earlier in the week .

But Pelosi said late Friday that the Senate - passed bill was " a great disappointment " and she saw " no reason to pass " it .
" The bill Senate Republicans allowed to pass is not only inadequate with respect to physician fees , but it ignores urgent sections of the House bill to provide jobs , " Pelosi said in a statement .
" The House has repeatedly sent jobs — creating bills to the Senate since December — Build America Bonds , small business hiring incentives , and importantly , summer jobs — and yet Republicans continue to block approval of jobs legislation .
Under the Senate - passed bill , the payment cut would eliminated and a 2.2 percent raise would be applied to Medicare reimbursements through Nov. 30 .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and ranking Republican Charles E. Grassley came up with the deal late Thursday .
The 21 percent reduction results from an erratic Medicare reimbursement formula dating back to Republican control of Congress and one neither party has been able to fix on a permanent basis .
In the interim , physicians have had to live under a series of so - called " doc- fixes " which get harder and harder to enact because even a freeze in physician fees is counted against the deficit .
This has been especially true this spring given the coming elections and Republican anger at President Barack Obama ’s healthcare agenda .
The extension now is fully offset with a combination of hospital savings and pension changes approved by the Senate Finance Committee .
But these will now have to pass muster with the House as well before going to the White House .
Before the Senate passed the repair , Vice President Joe Biden scolded Republicans for opposing the extenders bill on Thursday .
" As a nation , we have a responsibility to fix this problem , so that our doctors can get paid for the lifesaving services they provide for our seniors , " Biden said .
" And Republican leaders , I would respectfully suggest , have an obligation , a responsibility to stop walking away from these needs , stop playing brinksmanship and politics with this every time it rolls around , and fix this problem . "
Republicans said they opposed the extenders bill because it was n’t paid for and they do n’t want to add to the nation ’s rising debt .
The latest reduction in the Medicare repayments took effect June 1 , but the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) had instructed contractors to hold back claims for two weeks given the promise of a congressional reprieve .
That hold was again extended through Thursday — or 17 days altogether .
But CMS ordered contractors Friday morning to begin processing claims with the reduction in effect .
Claims can be reprocessed once Congress has finally approved the new stay , but the whole picture is not one of a smooth running government .
The American College of Physicians warned that Congress is " playing with fire " by messing around with short - term fixes and delayed payments .
" I have never seen physicians more frustrated with the cuts and cynical about Congress ’ willingness or ability to do the right thing for patient access , " said Bob Doherty , a senior vice president at the American College of Physicians .
A short - term repair " will confirm the growing sentiment among doctors and seniors that Medicare is an unreliable and unstable partner that can't be counted on to pay its bills , and more of them accordingly will limit how many Medicare patients and seniors they can afford to see . "
The American Medical Association says it has run out of patience .
" This is no way to run a major health coverage program – already the instability caused by repeated short - term delays is taking its toll , " said AMA president Cecil B. Wilson .
" Congress has finally taken its game of brinkmanship too far , as the steep 21 percent cut is now in effect and physicians will be forced to make difficult practice changes to keep their practice doors open . "

Hey , that kid who fell asleep while listening to President Obama 's speech on Monday ?
He should n't feel that bad .
These things are inevitable .
As long as White House communications and advance staff continue to place people behind the president as human props these things are going to happen .
Why do they do it anyway ?
It looks good on video ( usually ) .
It 's a good shot .
The president is surrounded by what looks like loving supporters who clap on queue .
No , not as excitedly as the over - caffeinated and eternally springy Nancy Pelosi or clap - happy Joe Biden ( God love him ) .
But it 's a good picture -- most of the time .
The human props are forewarned that they will be in the target of video cameras .
So behave !
But think about it .
These kids are n't professionals .
They forget they 're on camera .
They 're kids .
And even if it is the president , the thrill wears off .
After a while , Obama , to them sounds like an adult on Charlie Brown .
Wah , wah , wah , wah , wah , wah .
And look at their view .
They can't see him .
Well , they can see part of him .
But it ai n't a great shot .
Even a frontal view of the president puts some people to sleep .
Like his own staff .
You 'll recall last year that White House National Economic Council Director Larry Summers zonked out on Obama while attending a meeting in the White House !
If anything , we should all be applauding the kid for trying hard .
You 'll see that even though the kid was comfortably dozing he came to a few times like an awakened zombie and tried to put his hands together .
You gave it your best shot , kid .
We salute you .

The first intellectual consequence of the economic crisis was to undermine neoliberalism — or the belief in the sufficiency of markets to secure human welfare — as the age ’s default ideology .
The second was to prompt a hasty resurrection of Keynes .
“ We are all Keynesians again ! ” the ghost of Richard Nixon might have declared as Gordon Brown and Barack Obama , leaders of the nations most squarely behind the neoliberal push of the last thirty years , changed the Anglo - American tune and , this past winter , begged their European colleagues to stimulate the Continental economy with borrowed money .
The crisis also made the economists Paul Krugman and Nouriel Roubini into the first Keynesian superstars since John Kenneth Galbraith .
Their recommendations , on their invaluable blogs , of still vaster counter - cyclical spending and the temporary nationalization of banks were not taken up by the Obama administration , but they did confer new respectability on the idea of close state involvement in the economy .
But the Keynesian revival , so far , is partial and expedient rather than thoroughgoing .
Keynes ’s “ somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment ” remains taboo , and when Hyman Minsky ’s famous reinterpretation of Keynes was rushed back into print last year ( Minsky developed through Keynes a theory of bubbles and their bursting ) , the author of the preface to the new edition assured readers that Minsky ’s own advocacy of public - led investment could be ignored .
There are at least two Keyneses : the tinkering inspiration for the so - called neoclassical synthesis , who demonstrates the ultimate viability of capitalism in spite of bouts of crisis ; and the suave radical whose call for the “ the euthanasia of the rentier ” does n’t stop far short of taking the rentier out to be shot .
This second Keynes lives next door to the Marx who in the Manifesto insisted on the “ centralization of credit in the banks of the state , ” and has n’t been heard from much lately .
For the moment , the neo-Keynesian blog posts bear the same relationship to the crisis as cognitive behavioral therapy does to a patient ’s troubles .
Here is something insightful , helpful ; listen carefully and it might save your life .
But when the acute pain passes you will be left with the chronic problem of who and what you are .
The suffering individual has psychoanalysis to turn to .
In economics , the analogous route is Marxism , which like psychoanalysis has a dubious reputation — and an explanatory power and long - term perspective that its rivals can’t touch .
With luck , the next intellectual consequence of the crisis will be to pry the lid off Marx ’s tomb , since it is only from a Marxian standpoint that the recent credit bubble can be understood in terms of the structural problems it affected to solve as well as those it has created .
From the first there were confused signs of a hunger for Marxist thought .
Back in the clammy depths of the market ’s autumn plunge , Robert Kuttner of the determinedly liberal American Prospect acknowledged that in light of Treasury ’s rescue plan the “ Marxian cant ” designating the government as “ the executive committee of the ruling class ” sounded perfectly just .
And John Lanchester in the New Yorker wanted to know , “ Are there any unreconstructed Marxists left , anywhere in the wild ?
( Universities do n’t count . )
If there are , now would be a good moment for one of them to publish a book saying that the man in the beard would regard himself as having been proved right . ”
Here was a call for Marxist ideas that simultaneously reimposed their ban .
We might require authors of Marxist tomes — but professors do n’t count , only freelancers .
( Such a guy would be worth a New Yorker profile : for instance , who loans him his shoes ? )
Of course there are reasons for being suspicious of Marxism .
During the Third International and in the scattered sectarian life it has led outside the universities since the Second World War , Marxism has shown a susceptibility to dogma hardly equaled outside of American economics departments .
But the ideological rout that Marxism began to suffer in the ’ 70s did what periods in the wilderness are supposed to do : it discouraged bandwagon - jumpers and enforced a new seriousness on those who stuck around .
The truth is that since the neoliberal era began thirty years ago , Marxism has yielded some of its most formidable monuments of economic thought .
Two in particular are David Harvey ’s abstract and categorical Limits to Capital ( 1982 ) , which as the restatement and completion of a great thinker ’s project easily outclasses Minsky ’s John Maynard Keynes ( 1975 ) , and Robert Brenner ’s narrative and empirical Economics of Global Turbulence ( 2006 ) , which barely mentions Marx while vindicating , through an analysis of the postwar American , German , and Japanese economies , the idea Marx took from David Ricardo and made his own : the tendency of the rate of profit to fall in a situation of free competition .
The need for a Marxist macroeconomics is patent in one small line from Paul Krugman ’s Return of Depression Economics :
“ In the early 1970s , for reasons that are still somewhat mysterious , growth slowed throughout the advanced world ” ( our italics ) .
And growth had stayed slow , for reasons that to a mainstream economics confessedly “ shy of the grandest themes ” ( as the founder of general equilibrium theory once put it ) remain a baffling mystery .
The global rate of economic growth has declined from about 3.5 percent annually in the ’60s , to 2.4 percent in the ’70s , to 1.4 percent and 1 percent in the ’80s and ’90s , to 1 percent in this decade — much of which single paltry percentage turns out to have been illusory .
Meanwhile , financial services , starting in the early ’ 80s , took a larger and larger share of total income and total profits in the world ’s largest economy , until finally finance had become , by last fall , the largest American industry , accruing to itself a quarter of all US profits .
This combination of declining overall growth with burgeoning finance suggests that the connection between finance and investment can’t have been the alleged one : the direction of capital to its most productive uses .
So there must be a better way to characterize a situation — that of the last decades — in which vast quantities of overaccumulated capital ( the neo -Keynesian ’s “ excess of desired savings ” ) circle the globe in search of profits , while the vitality of capitalism as a whole steadily diminishes .
Marxists differ in the details of their accounts of the postwar economy , but the story , which ends for now in the cliffhanger of the first contraction of the world economy since 1945 , goes something like this :
The so - called Golden Age of postwar capitalism from 1950 – 70 — a time of rising wages , profits , and investment — was the product of special and perishable circumstances .
The wartime destruction of the Japanese and German productive base meant that , with the resumption of peace and renewed growth in demand for non-military goods , all the major industrial economies could for a time thrive without threat to one another .
But the maturation of European and Japanese industry toward the end of the ’60s spelled the return of mutually destructive competition .
Firms producing internationally tradable goods ( cars , electronics , et cetera ) could only survive by reducing prices , which in turn reduced profitability .
And yet the capital sunk in manufacturing plants was enough to make capitalists reluctant to exit a given product line in spite of reduced profitability .
Besides , governments do n’t like to see big firms fail even when they ca n’t compete .
( The Obama administration has lately proved almost as indulgent of GM as the state - directed Japanese banks have always been of Japanese industry . )
And the more recent advent of China as a manufacturing power only exacerbated the situation , as the Chinese ( to quote Brenner ) “ continued to expand capacity faster than it could be scrapped system - wide and to rain down torrents of redundant , increasingly high - tech goods upon the world market . ”
The orthodox story blames declining profitability ( and price inflation ) during the ’70s on the excessive demands of labor — a plausible enough explanation until you consider that the worldwide defeat of labor since the ’ 80s has failed to restore prior levels of growth .
The high wages of the early ’ 70s are long gone .
What has endured and intensified since then is a systemic bias in favor of short - term financial speculation over longer - term productive investment .
The replacement of the gold standard by floating currencies encouraged capital to flit from country to country in search of returns magnified by any temporary overvaluation of this or that national fiat money .
At the same time , information technology sped transactions along at a new rate and volume .
What in 1983 was a daily mass of $ 2.3 billion in international financial transactions had become $ 130 billion by 2001 .
Only about 2 percent of the same sum would be necessary to maintain international trade and productive investment .
Meanwhile production is guided by the search for low wages .
The export - led growth of first Germany and Japan , then the “ Asian Tigers , ” then China with its endless reserve army of labor has flooded the world with cheapening goods ; and between 1985 and 1995 the US itself staged a manufacturing revival through the exporter ’s proven formula of cowed labor and an undervalued currency .
But this is supply : what about demand ?
The fundamental problem with workers ( to whom as much money as possible should be denied if commodities are to be affordable ) is that they are also consumers ( to whom as much money as possible should be supplied if they are to buy commodities ) .
Marxists are n’t kidding when they talk about the contradictions of capitalism .
In the end , as Marx wrote , “ the ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses . ”
The result of declining or stagnant real wages since the ’ 80s has been global industrial overcapacity : too much plant turning out too much stuff for not enough buyers .
The structural solution to this dilemma was as ingenious as it was unsustainable .
If the global wage - bill could n’t cover all the world ’s gimcrack goods and coastal vacation properties , then consumers — especially American , but also European — had to be extended a new line of credit .
They would borrow money to buy houses , and then borrow more money , to buy other stuff , against the rising value of these houses !
Of course many new home - buyers plainly could n’t pay their mortgages ; the mortgages were granted on the assumption that someone else ultimately could and would .
So present consumer demand was leveraged against a future demand for which there was no plausible source .
For mortgage brokers operating under the originate - and - distribute model this did n’t matter ; they had already pocketed their commissions .
And those bundling iffy mortgages into securities comforted themselves with a rhetorical question :
What was the likelihood of homeowners defaulting en masse ?
The venality and self - deception of the brokers , rating agencies , and bankers are now notorious .
By comparison , David Harvey ’s most audacious theoretical move , in Limits to Capital , seems sensible enough : How can Marx ’s labor theory of value ( which identifies value as “ socially necessary labor time ” ) be reconciled with land prices , given that land is obviously not the product of human labor ?
Harvey ’s answer was that under capitalism land becomes “ a pure financial asset ” ; land price is a claim on future revenue treated as a present - day asset .
“ Mortgages , ” Marx said , “ are mere titles on future rent . ”
And Harvey completes his thought : “ Land price must be realized as future rental appropriation , which rests on future labor ” ( our italics ) .
The big risk , naturally , is that you will attribute to real estate far more present - day value than can later on be returned to it by labor ( in the form of the portion of total income devoted to housing ) .
A bubble occurs not when people pay for real estate with money they do n’t yet have — as always happens , given the availabilty of credit — but when they pay with money they will never have , out of wages they will never receive — out of wages no one will ever receive .
This past fall the papers were full of “ analysts ” wrapping their heads around a new idea : “ Home prices , ” said one , “ are going to have to start reflecting people ’s income . ”
In the world at large , if not always in the bubble - addicted US , recessions have been deeper and longer and recoveries ever more feeble since 1973 .
Already the recovery after the recession of 2001 – 02 was the weakest on record , adding virtually no new jobs to the rolls .
The main stimulus to consumption was the confection of fantastic , improbable , and finally fictitious paper assets .
And as Brenner wrote in 2006 — were he not a Marxist he would be counted among the prophets of the crash — “ the US Fed ’s continuing dependence on cheap credit and asset - price bubbles to provide the subsidy to demand to keep the economy turning over appears to have only delayed , but not really avoided , the economy ’s obligatory responses to the over - capacity , fall in profitability , and asset - price crash of 2000 – 01 . ”
In this way alone — alas — the Bush Administration never happened .
The motor of accumulation has been sputtering for nearly four decades , and its coughs can be heard again now that the roar of combusting paper wealth is dying down .
This does n’t mean capitalism or even growth is at an end .
Economists of all kinds have pinned their hopes on the transformation of laboring and saving Chinese into hardy consumers .
In any case , the US consumer — a ravening appetite in a paper house — appears to be finished as the world ’s buyer of last resort .
It would add a nice dialectical twist to the future history of our period if it could be said that , around the time the post - Maoist Chinese took up shopping , the post - bubble Americans turned to studying Marx .
Outside the café wha ? , a long - haired Joni Mitchell type is softly strumming “ Which Side Are You On . ”
She stops as we pass .
Starts “ Nobody Knows You When You ’re Down and Out . ” Curses .
Shamefacedly tries a soprano rendition of “ We Did n’t Start the Fire , ” which starts a crowd of curb dogs on the other side of MacDougal Street to booing .
Now ’s the time for protest songs !
But of our generation !
The kazooists in Washington Square Park are jamming on a wordless funeral march .
A German shepherd tows a mini-hearse , with a coffin marked “ Our Prospects , ” as the law school class shuffles behind .
Even the guys who sell their self - produced rap CDs on Sixth Avenue are standing with arms folded .

“ Why , hip - hop ’s the poetry of money , and getting it , and not having it .
And — ”
“ It sure was , ” the salesman says .
“ But you steal that from a brother , too .
All the white boys on Wall Street take to rapping .
They ’re buying airplay with their TARP money , falsifying the charts . ”
“ What ? ”
But he ’s reached to turn on the radio , and to our horror the giant speaker snaps in , mid-verse , on a smug Caucasian voice :

But Congress do n’t mean shit to me , I do like AIG
If you gonna say I robbed em , why you keep me on the job , son ?
They pulled their raise off , execs got paid off , while bitches ’ eyes on Bernie Madoff

You can yell your price of bail into my Anti-Noise headphones ! —
“ That ’s terrible , ” we say .
“ It sure is .

“ On the plus side , me and my lady are moving back to where we used to live now that the rents came down .

After Israel released a tape purportedly showing passengers on the Mavi Marmara making inflammatory comments , many questioned the authenticity of the tapes and charged that they had been edited .
Leaders on the ship said that they never radioed the IDF to tell them “ Go back to Auschwitz ” and that they are “ helping Arabs go against the U.S. , do n’t forget 9/11 . ”
Now , the IDF has issued an unedited tape and admitted that the earlier version was edited .
It also admits that it is not clear that these comments came from the Mavi Marmara .
Here is part of the original tape released by the IDF that was widely distributed over blogs and news channels :
Here is the unedited tape :
The IDF insists that it was merely trying to edit out long periods of silence , but now admits that due to “ an open channel , the specific ship or ships in the Freedom Flotilla responding to the Israeli Navy could not be identified . ”
Activists have objected that the IDF seized their own recording equipment that would have shown such editing as well as how they responded from the Mavi Marmara .

When Valve announced that they were pulling their Portal 2 event from E3 , promising that a " surprise " would be there in its place , the Internet did what the Internet does :
It immediately went ablaze with speculation that Half - Life 2 : Episode 3 actually exists in a demonstrable capacity suited for public display and would be present at the big show next week .
Seriously , the only thing the Internet is good for is guessing when the next Half - Life game is coming .
Note that I said , " good for , " and not , " good at . "
In a succinct e-mail , Gabe Newell has confirmed that the " surprise " is not Half - Life 2 : Episode 3 .
So , there it is , Internet .
Wrong again .
You 're just going to have to go back to your second love of pornography to mend your bruised ego .

" Yeah , we think we can , " Swerdlow said in answer to his own question .
" We 're going to have some major opponents ... ( but ) this will be the beginning of the end of the drug war . "
Local governments would be given power to regulate the commercial cultivation and sale of marijuana .
" I think certainly it 's going to be one of the highlight campaigns , " said Tim Rosales , spokesman for Public Safety First , the official campaign formed in opposition to the marijuana initiative .
The marijuana initiative does not yet have a proposition number for the November ballot .
Its supporters are calling their campaign " Control and Tax Cannabis California 2010 . "
Both sides say polling results show they have a majority of voters .
The legalization campaign points to Field Poll results released April 30 that showed 56 percent of respondents willing to legalize and tax marijuana .
The opposition campaign 's poll had the same percentage of respondents wanting to keep marijuana illegal .
The only poll that really matters will be the Nov. 2 vote , and until then , the campaigns are sure to revive arguments that have been made for and against marijuana since Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 .
For those wanting to keep marijuana illegal , the drug is the gateway to crime and more dangerous substances such as methamphetamine and heroin .
To legalization proponents , marijuana is safer than alcohol , and its prohibition leads to unjust jail time and waste of law enforcement resources .
During the years since the 1996 passage of Proposition 215 - the initiative that allowed medical marijuana - much of the debate has centered on whether cannabis sativa can be legitimately considered a medicine .
Skeptics have argued since 1996 that medical marijuana is a smoke screen for legal highs , but providers say cannabis is often better than pharmaceutical painkillers .
Whatever the medical value of cannabis is , proponents of the new initiative make no bones about their view that there 's nothing wrong with recreational marijuana use .
" People like to party .
People like to alter their consciousness , " Swerdlow said .
" We 've been doing this for so long that there 's probably a genetic reason for it .
We 've got to give people a safer alternative . "
But taxes - and California 's perennial budget crises - are also going to be part of the marijuana debate .
Proponents say state government can reduce its deficit if marijuana is taxed and regulated .
Supporters point to the California Board of Equalization 's analysis of AB 390 , an Assembly bill authored by San Francisco Democrat Tom Ammiano to legalize marijuana .
Board staffers predicted that if marijuana were sold and taxed under that bill , annual state revenues would be around $ 1.4 billion .
Current revenues from taxes on medical marijuana transactions are estimated at $ 58 million to $ 105 million per year , board spokeswoman Anita Gore said .
Proponents expect a fight from the law enforcement community and are assured of getting one .
The California State Sheriff 's Association and several other officials , including San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael A. Ramos and Sheriff Rod Hoops , have already joined the opposition .
" You 're going to set up candy shops for the Mexican cartels , " said Ramos , who called the initiative the worst ballot proposition he has ever seen .
Passing the initiative , Ramos predicted , would lead to traffic cops struggling to keep streets safe from a wave of marijuana - impaired drivers .
He said the initiative would also lead to more abuse of harder drugs .
The legalization campaign maintains that cartels are able to make money off marijuana because it is illegal .
Proponents say passing the proposition would take pot off the black market , an expectation that arouses support within pro-marijuana circles .
During Swerdlow 's meeting last week at THCF Medical Clinic in Riverside , he and Oaksterdam University President Richard Lee addressed such concerns as the possibilities of a legal marijuana market leading to a corporate takeover of the marijuana business or dwindling profits for cultivators .
" They are harvesting bad karma , because the high prices come from people being locked in jail , " Lee said .

Citing a " retired F.B.I. agent " as his source , U.S. Rep.
Louie Gohmert , R - Tyler , said on the floor of Congress last week that terror cells are plotting to breed future terrorists inside the United States .

They would n't even have to pay anything for the baby , " Gohmert said .
" And then they would return back where they could be raised and coddled as future terrorists .
And then one day , 20 , 30 years down the road , they can be sent in to help destroy our way of life . "
Gohmert issued the warning in defense of Arizona 's immigration law , which the Obama administration is planning to file suit over .

Careers : Articles - Three Things Every Recruiter Looks for in a Resume
If you are in the middle of a job search , recruiters can be either your friend — or your foe .
They make the choice to keep you out of the hiring process or to introduce you to corporate hiring decision makers .
The quality of your resume is a key factor in determining how recruiters will treat you in the job market .
There are three things every recruiter looks for in a resume : Focus
Core competencies or transferable skills
Accomplishments
If your resume lacks any of these crucial elements , then you are probably not capturing the attention you deserve , and you are missing out on important interview opportunities .
Focus
Since recruiters ’ time is at a premium , they must know your career focus within seconds of opening your resume .
If your career focus is n’t clearly stated , you ca n’t assume the reader will take the time to search through your resume for clues .
Most recruiters consider “ Career Objective ” statements worthless if they contain no real information about the specific position you are looking for and the industry expertise you offer .
The best objective statements are concise and to the point .
Core competencies or transferable skills
Once a recruiter understands your focus , he / she will want to know if you have the required core competencies or transferable skills to accomplish the job .
A thorough research of employer job descriptions will help you identify the core competencies your resume must feature .
You ’ll capture and hold recruiter attention by including only those core competencies relating specifically to your focus .
Be careful not to muddy up your personal marketing message by including extraneous skills .
If you remember the all - important rule of relevancy , you ’ll go a long way toward keeping the reader ’s attention on your key skills .
Accomplishments
Once your resume has made it through the initial screening for focus and skills , the recruiter will want to know how you stack up against other candidates .
Remember , with record - high resume response to job openings , recruiters need good , solid reasons to recommend you for consideration over the mountain of other candidates .
Clear , concisely stated accomplishments are the best way to distinguish yourself from your competition .
Whether the recruiter works for one corporation or represents many corporate clients as a third - party recruiting consultant , he or she must be able to give valid reasons for promoting you as a viable candidate .
You can make their job infinitely easier by including the information they need — and bring your resume to the top of the candidate pile .
When your resume sells itself , you gain advantage points , and make the recruiter look good as well .
For optimum impact , write accomplishments that illustrate the strength of your core competencies , transferable skills and focus .
An accomplishment is only valuable to your resume if it promotes the skills your target employers are looking for .
Remember the rule of relevancy as you craft each of your accomplishment statements .
In today ’s extremely competitive job market , employers rely heavily on recruiter to screen out the crowd of applicants .
Allow them to present you as one of their best candidates by letting your resume present your best abilities .

Who else but Joe Lieberman would introduce a bill to give the President the power to shut down the Internet with the flick of a switch ?
I ’m afraid of the answer to that question , and you should be , too .
However , it ’s hardly surprising America ’s premier authoritarian warmonger – author of a bill that would strip American citizenship from anyone even vaguely suspected of “ terrorism ” – would come up with a scheme like this .
If the “ Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act ” passes – and is n’t that a name that embraces practically every collectivist bromide extant ?
– the Department of Homeland Security would establish a “ cyber- terrorism ” sub - bureaucracy , the Office of Cyberspace Policy ( OCP ) , and the National Center for Cybersecurity and Communication ( NCCC ) , with the former lording it over the Internet – a Cyber - Czar – and the latter unleashed to spy on and otherwise guard the “ cybersecurity ” Senators Lieberman and his two co-sponsors aver is imminently threatened .
This bill is the culmination of years of yelping about the likelihood of a “ cyber - 9/11 , ” a devastating attack on the national infrastructure via the Internet .
If such an event is so likely , then why has n’t it happened already ?
Because the likelihood of it ever happening is nearly nil .
In short , this is a completely phony and for all intents and purposes nonexistent “ threat ” that has been invented by those most likely to profit – financially and politically – from this kind of hype : the “ cybersecurity ” industry , which has been thriving ( mostly off of government contracts , naturally ) since 9/11 , and neoconservative authoritarians of a Liebermanesque frame of mind .
In their 2003 opus , An End to Evil , neocons Richard Perle and David Frum argue that what ’s needed is a “ domestic intelligence agency ” to spy on Americans , and the Internet plays a major role in their scenario : Perle and Frum advocate establishing an Orwellian government database and comprehensive electronic surveillance system that not only keeps constant track of the whereabouts of everyone in the country , but also stores a dossier , complete with their religious and political affiliations – surely a job for the OCP / NCCC .
After all , if we ’re going to track the “ cyber - terrorists , ” we have to know who and where they are .
Lieberman ’s Cyber - Czar , and his minions , would put flesh on the bones of this nightmare , and make the neocon dream of a police state an emerging reality .
The icing on the cake is the “ kill switch ” provision in this bill , which says that Internet firms , including search engines , broadband providers , and software companies listed by the feds “ shall immediately comply with any emergency measure or action developed ” by the Department of Homeland Security – includng a presidential order to shut down Internet connections .
Failure to comply would result in a hefty fine : presumably the company would be commandeered by the government and forced to obey .
Andrew Sullivan , relying on dubious sources , pooh - poohs the threat to civil liberties , but his record on this subject is n’t very good : he refers us over to the neoconnish Volokh Conspiracy web site , where we ’re told it ’s all a bunch of nonsense , no need to worry , move along nothing to see here – but this argument falsely avers that search engines are n’t included in the bill .
They are : the bill gives broad powers to the new cyber - bureaucracy and the President over any company that “ relies on ” the Internet , the telephone system or any other component of the US “ information infrastructure ”
What this means is that any web site , any search engine , or anything to do with the Internet could be subjected to a government takeover : the entire US - based Internet could be shut down , including news aggregators like Antiwar.com , if they were deemed a “ threat ” to “ cybersecurity , ” whatever the heck that means .
In effect , although the reach of our Cyber - Czar is not global – yet – the feds could electronically isolate the US from the rest of the world , erecting the cybernetic equivalent of the Great Wall of China in order to keep out the Bad Guys .
Speaking of China , that country ’s policies were an inspiration to Lieberman , according to the Senator ’s recent remarks on CNN :
“ Right now China , the government , can disconnect parts of its Internet in case of war and we need to have that here too . ”
It ’s Liebermanism with Chinese characteristics , our own version of the Great Cultural Revolution : if anything serves as a model for the ideal neocon state , it ’s the Beijing regime .
Too bad the Communist Party ( Marxist - Leninist ) , which used to have the China franchise in the US , is defunct : I hear Joe is looking for a party that will take him .
While this odious bill is gaining traction , it may be a bit too extreme for the public to swallow , and so we have a two - pronged approach : the “ soft ” version is being peddled by the Federal Trade Commission , which is seeking to establish bureaucratic hegemony over Internet regulation .
Frustrated by its inability to force “ Network Neutrality ” down our throats , Obama ’s FCC chairman Genachowski , in league with Democratic appointees to the commission , has launched a campaign to extend its control over cyberspace – this in spite of federal laws which supposedly ensure that the Internet shall be “ unfettered by state or federal regulation . ”
This is the “ progressive ” face of Liebermanism , which holds that the federal government has the right to tell broadband companies which applications they must allow ( or disallow ) on their networks , all in the name of the egalitarian - sounding “ net neutrality . ”
But of course if private companies and individuals cannot determine what goes on in their own networks , then the government ’s role becomes decisive , as the FCC tries to do an end run around the courts .
The CNS News site puts it thus :
“ The FCC is now trying to reclassify the Internet to broaden its authority over the Web .
Currently , the FCC only has ‘ ancillary ’ authority , meaning it can regulate Internet access only in the process of regulating another service that it has direct authority over , such as television or cable .
“ The 3 - 2 party - line vote on Thursday at the FCC began the formal process of reclassifying the Internet as a telecommunications service instead of an information service – its current classification .
This is necessary because , as an information service , the government has little power to regulate Internet networks .
As a telecommunications service , such as a telephone network , the Internet would fall under a much broader regulatory scope – giving the government the power to enforce universal service requirements , making them pay into a federal universal service fund used to provide communications services to poor areas . ”
The FCC bureaucrats aver that they have three choices : take charge of the Internet entirely , as if it were the old monopoly telephone system , which it quite obviously is n’t ( indeed , it ’s quite the opposite of that archaic structurally centralized relic ) : do nothing ( not a chance ) , or choose a “ third way , ” in Senor Genachowski ’s phrase , in which the FCC would indeed extend its regulatory sway over the Internet , but in a promise of “ forbearance , ” a pledge to not exercise its authority – unless , of course , it ’s a “ national emergency . ”
When , I ask you , has government ever exercised “ forbearance ” when it came to exercising and extending its power ?
One does n’t quite know whether to laugh or cry .
This brazen power grab would give the feds the means to enforce certain terms of service ( in the name of “ consumer ’s rights ) , extort cash from Internet companies – and subject them to “ emergency ” regulations that would give the Feds the power to shut down web sites , shut down search engines , and give the Joe Liebermans of this world all the power they need to make the Internet “ safe , ” i.e. free of “ terrorism . ”
How “ progressive ” can you get ?
The Internet has been a painful thorn in the side of the political Establishment , destroying the hold of their useful idiots in the “ mainstream media ” over the flow of information , and giving dissidents a voice – and they ’ve been seeking ways to rein it in , “ for the public good , ” ever since .
We ’ve heard for years how sinister the Internet is , and how we need to be “ saved ” from the “ dangers ” that lurk in cyberspace .
The only danger , however , is to the power elite and its information monopoly , which has now been broken beyond repair : the authoritarians in our midst , and I do n’t just mean Sen .
Lieberman , are desperate to get this cyber - monkey off their backs , and that ’s what ’s behind the legislative assault coming from all sides of the political spectrum .
Lieberman , Cass Sunstein , and Mr. Genachowski are hoping that the American people are dozing off , unaware of the danger to their liberties : they want to regulate the Internet to death , and hope that no one notices .
Do n’t be caught sleeping : wake up and contact your congressional representatives .
Tell them that we do n’t need to be more like China – and that if Senator Lieberman wants to emigrate , you ’d be glad to help him out with a one - way ticket .
With his distinctly un-American views , he ’d do much better as a delegate to China ’s rubber - stamp National Congress of People ’s Deputies , rather than a member of the Congress of the United States – and that goes for his co-sponsors , Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) and Sen.
Tom Carper ( D - Delaware ) , too .
Put them on a slow boat to China , and good riddance to them all !

Corrie family ' heart - sick and outraged ' by flotilla raid Ma'an News June 2 , 2010
Bethlehem - Ma'an -
The parents of an American activist killed in Gaza say they are devastated over Israel 's deadly raid on an international aid flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip .
" We are heart - sick and outraged about the brutal attack launched by the Israeli Military on the Free Gaza Movement 's flotilla of boats , " Cindy and Craig Corrie said in a statement .
" The boats were carrying civilian passengers and humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip , and were clearly in international waters when this illegal attack occurred , in violation of international law , " they said .
The number of dead and injured are still unconfirmed , but lowest figures reported are nine killed and 34 injured .
Israel has not released their names .
Over 700 citizens from nearly 40 countries were on board .

Image caption Brazil 's vast agriculture industry is forecast to boom over the next decade
The emerging economies of Brazil , India , China and Russia will enjoy an agricultural boom over the next decade as production stalls in Western Europe , a report says .
Agricultural output in the Bric nations will grow three times as fast as in the major developed countries , the joint United Nations - OECD study said .
Livestock and crop prices will stay above long - term averages , it added .
And rising incomes and urbanisation in developing states will drive growth .
" Developing countries will provide the main source of growth for world agricultural production , consumption and trade , " the report said .
" As incomes rise , diets are expected to slowly diversify away from staple foods towards increased meats and processed foods that will favour livestock and dairy products .
" For virtually all commodities , the projected growth in imports and exports of developing economies [ over the next decade ] exceeds that of the OECD area , " said the report .
A further increase in oil prices could ... reinforce feed stock demand for biofuels .
Agricultural Outlook , United Nations - OECD report
While overall world net production of commodities is forecast to grow 22 % , production among the 30 members of the OECD is estimated at 10 % .
Production in western Europe alone will stagnate .
This OECD growth rate is almost three times slower than the growth rate of Bric countries , which is forecast to expand 27 % .
The report also identifies Ukraine as likely to see rapid agricultural growth over the next few years .
Crop prices , in real terms , will rise between 16 % to 40 % " above their average for the decade " .
And average dairy prices are expected to be 16 % to 45 % higher , with butter prices showing most gains .
Brazil is forecast to see by far the fastest growth in agriculture , with a expansion of more than 40 % through to 2019 .
China and India are expected to see growth of 26 % and 21 % respectively to 2019 .
Projections for Russia and Ukraine were 26 % and 29 % .
Protests
Food prices in 2007 - 08 soared , sparking protests and riots , as demand for biofuels diverted commodities into energy production .
The UN - OECD 's annual Agricultural Outlook said it did not expect to see a similar food price shock in the coming years .
However , the report warned that a sharp rise in energy prices could again impact on the food industry .
" A further increase in oil prices could be expected to increase input and production costs , having an impact on crop supplies , prices and trade flows , and reinforce feedstock demand for biofuels . "
Looking beyond the next decade , the report forecasts global food production to expand by 70 % by 2050 .
Some people do not taste salt like others
Low - salt foods may be harder for some people to like than others , according to a study by a Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences food scientist .
The research indicates that genetics influence some of the difference in the levels of salt we like to eat .
Those conclusions are important because recent , well - publicized efforts to reduce the salt content in food have left many people struggling to accept fare that simply does not taste as good to them as it does to others , pointed out John Hayes , assistant professor of food science , who was lead investigator on the study .
Diets high in salt can increase the risk of high blood pressure and stroke .
That is why public health experts and food companies are working together on ways to help consumers lower salt intake through foods that are enjoyable to eat .
This study increases understanding of salt preference and consumption .
The research involved 87 carefully screened participants who sampled salty foods such as broth , chips and pretzels , on multiple occasions , spread out over weeks .
Test subjects were 45 men and 42 women , reportedly healthy , ranging in age from 20 to 40 years .
The sample was composed of individuals who were not actively modifying their dietary intake and did not smoke cigarettes .
They rated the intensity of taste on a commonly used scientific scale , ranging from barely detectable to strongest sensation of any kind .
The study , a collaboration between Hayes and Valerie Duffy , professor of allied health science and Bridget S. Sullivan , Master 's graduate , University of Connecticut , appeared in today 's ( June 16 ) issue of Physiology & Behavior .
" Most of us like the taste of salt .
However , some individuals eat more salt , both because they like the taste of saltiness more , and also because it is needed to block other unpleasant tastes in food , " said Hayes .
" Supertasters , people who experience tastes more intensely , consume more salt than do nontasters .
Snack foods have saltiness as their primary flavor , and at least for these foods , more is better , so the supertasters seem to like them more . "
However , supertasters also need higher levels of salt to block unpleasant bitter tastes in foods such as cheese , Hayes noted .
" For example , cheese is a wonderful blend of dairy flavors from fermented milk , but also bitter tastes from ripening that are blocked by salt , " he said .
" A supertaster finds low - salt cheese unpleasant because the bitterness is too pronounced . "
Hayes cited research done more than 75 years ago by a chemist named Fox and a geneticist named Blakeslee , showing that individuals differ in their ability to taste certain chemicals .
As a result , Hayes explained , we know that a wide range in taste acuity exists , and this variation is as normal as variations in eye and hair color .
" Some people , called supertasters , describe bitter compounds as being extremely bitter , while others , called nontasters , find these same bitter compounds to be tasteless or only weakly bitter , " he said .
" Response to bitter compounds is one of many ways to identify biological differences in food preference because supertasting is not limited to bitterness .
" Individuals who experience more bitterness also perceive more saltiness in table salt , more sweetness from table sugar , more burn from chili peppers , and more tingle from carbonated drinks . "
Supertasters live in a neon food world , Hayes noted .
Nontasters , on the other extreme , live in a pastel food world .
" Interestingly , nontasters may be more likely to add salt to foods at the table because they need more salt to reach the same level of perceived saltiness as a supertaster , " he said .
" However , most of the salt we consume comes from salt added to processed foods and not from the salt shaker . "
Currently , U.S. citizens consume two to three times the amount of salt recommended for good health .
Hayes advises consumers to lower their salt intake by reading the food label and looking for products that contain fewer than 480 milligrams of sodium per serving .
Jihadi Calls For ' Suspicious Bags ' To Be Left Throughout DC and NYC FBI warns of potential new terror tactic as summer tourist season begins .
June 7 , 2010  --
A recent internal FBI report warns federal , state and local authorities to be alert for a potential new tool in the jihadi terror arsenal – the placing of suspicious , but harmless , bags in public places to inspire fear , disrupt public transportation and tie up police and bomb squads .
The so called " battle of suspicious bags " was encouraged by an unknown poster to a known jihadi website .
On May 12th , the poster suggested an " invasions suspicious bags ( sic ) " in " the heart of Washington and New York , " as the FBI 's Washington Field Office Intelligence Division noted in its May 27th " Situational Information Report . "
The bags would contain not bombs , but innocuous items , a tactic that has been used by other political extremists in the U.S. in the recent past .
" The stated goal of the campaign , " said the report , " was to exploit desensitization of first responders caused by response fatigue to suspicious , but harmless items . "
The FBI report did not include the full text of the jihadi forum post , but said " the poster suggested packing bags with innocuous items and placing them in public areas has the capability to occupy response assets and disrupt public infrastructure and transportation . "
The poster 's credibility was not known , according to the FBI , but the site where the information was posted was listed as a " known jihadi web site . "
The information had also been shared among numerous law enforcement agencies in advance of the bulletin's circulation .
The jihadi posting came within two weeks after an attempted car bombing in Times Square .
The man charged in the case , Faisal Shahzad , has alleged link to Islamic fundamentalists overseas .
So far , no evidence of any " suspicious bag " campaign has been found in either Washington or New York .
In New York , there was a spike in calls to police about suspicious packages in the immediate aftermath of the May 1 Times Square bombing attempt , law enforcement officials said .
During the week right after the failed attack there were 140 calls a day to the New York City Police Department of suspicious packages , compared with 90 per day in the week prior to the attack .
The NYPD Bomb Squad was called out in force to investigate several items , including a cooler , a pizza box and a car with propane tanks in its back seat .
Each incident , however , was unrelated to the others , and showed no signs of being part of an organized campaign , officials said .
Authorities told ABC that they were familiar with the tactic of sowing fear with suspicious bags , and there were telltale signs that could help them establish whether such a campaign was underway .
Anarchists have used the tactic in the U.S. with some success , at venues such as the 2000 Philadelphia Republican Convention , where hoax bomb knapsacks including some with messages were left at or near the convention .
The threat of another such campaign was also investigated prior to the Republican Convention in New York in 2004 and authorities trained for a variety of potential responses .
The FBI 's Washington Field Office included the information on the jihadi posting in what has become an annual event -- the circulation of a report reminding authorities that " Summer Tourist Season Increases the Potential for Terrorist Threats . "
" Washington DC and the National Capital Region ( NCR ) remain primary targets for Extremists , particularly during the summer tourist season , " this year 's report states .
The possibility of a suspicious bag campaign was at the top of a list of " indicators to assist in detecting potential terrorist activity . "
The FBI 's Washington Field Office declined to discuss the issues raised in the " Situational Information Report .

The FBI in New York , meanwhile , said it provides situational awareness training specifically geared towards helping patrol officers and others to determine when an bag or other object might be suspicious .
Said Special Agent Richard Kolko , spokesman for the FBI 's New York Field Office , " Our Bomb Techs recently had a training class for FBI personnel from New York and several other field offices to educate them on how to identify suspicious packages , or routine items in order to help recognize what may or may not be potentially dangerous .
This helps cut down on the calls for items that just do n't warrant sending out the bomb squad and provides the agents on the street additional situational awareness as they go about their daily duties . "
Kolko noted that this training class was not related to the Washington Field Office report or to the jihadi posting .

The Federal Communications Commission has n't even formally proposed its new " Third Way " net neutrality rules .
All it did on Thursday was open an inquiry about them .
But already we 're on the edge of catastrophe , judging from the comments from the bench at the agency 's Open Commission meeting .
If the agency goes this route , " we will have lost the moral high ground , " suggested Republican Commissioner Robert M. McDowell .
" For decades now , the international consensus has been for governments to keep their hands off the Internet and to leave Internet governance decisions to time - tested nongovernmental technical groups .
Once that precedent is broken , it will become harder to make the case against more nefarious states that are meddling with the Internet in even more extensive ways than are contemplated here . "
Yikes !
What does that mean ?
Is the Commission indirectly appeasing Iran and China by even thinking about Internet nondiscrimination rules ?
But au contraire , declared Democratic Commissioner Michael Copps .
This probe must go forward despite the opposition .
" I , for one , am worried about relying only on the goodwill of a few powerful companies to achieve this country ’s broadband hopes and dreams , " he darkly warned .
" We see what price can be paid when critical industries operate with unfettered control and without reasonable and meaningful oversight .
Look no further than the banking industry 's role in precipitating the recent financial meltdown or turn on your TV and watch what is taking place right now in the Gulf of Mexico . "
So if you oppose net neutrality , you 're no better than the company responsible for all those oil - soaked pelicans , and if you 're for it , you 're subverting the opposition to North Korea ?
Consequences
Looks like the rest of us better hunker down for a wild ride here .
Just to recount the facts for a moment or so , today the FCC announced a Notice of Inquiry on FCC Chair Julius Genachowski's so - called " Third Way " proposal for net neutrality rules .
Genachowski wants to reclassify broadband ISPs as telecommunications common carriers for the purpose of barring them from unfairly discriminating against Internet services and applications .
But the agency would " forbear " against using many of the Communications
Act 's common carrier rules , particularly those that empower the government to regulate prices .
What would be the " legal and practical consequences " of doing this , the NOI asks .
From which specific sections of the Communications
Act should the agency forbear ?
And the document takes on the tricky question of how to ensure that future Commissions do n't reverse these barriers against further regulation .
" What provisions , if any , could appropriately be included in a forbearance order to establish a heightened standard for justifying future ' unforbearance ' , " the NOI asks .
This question is doubtless responsive to the concerns of AT&T and other companies who invoke the " slippery slope " argument .
If the FCC passes these forbeared rules , " I 'm a 3 - 2 vote away from the next guy coming in and saying I disagree with that , I take it away , " commented AT&T's Chief Executive Randall Stephenson earlier this week .
What 's the point ?
The press conference that followed the hearing made it evident that there 's some uncertainty as to how this process will move forward .
Technically , this inquiry is a subset of ( but separate from ) the agency 's Open Internet proceeding , which last October proposed the addition of two new provisions to the agency 's " Four Freedom 's " Internet Policy Statement .
These would include an enforcement mechanism against ISPs that , like Comcast , discriminated against some Internet application or feature , and a transparency provision .
But then came the Federal appeals court decision striking down the agency 's sanctions against Comcast , which were based on the Communications Act 's Title I " information service " definition of ISPs .
That necessitated this turn to the Communication Act's Title II common carrier provisions , the subject of this NOI .
Will this latest process considering Title II " have to play itself out , " asked one reporter , before the Commission thinks about moving forward on the Open Internet proceeding ?
Does the reclassification issue come first ?
" I 'm not sure how to answer that , " Genachowski confided .
" We have n't said anything publicly about how the different proceedings will relate to each other .
We 've been very clear about goals .
I think , on that , if we could get back to you with any timetables that we 're looking at , but of course , there 's a relationship . "
The next question basically asked whether Genachowski's Third Way plan was a done deal , as some have charged .
" What can you say to reassure people that that 's not the case ? "
" I think that we have , each of us , an obligation to keep an open mind as we run a public process , " he insisted .
" There 's no point in having a Notice and Comment process unless people bring open minds to it . "
Ditto , added pro-net neutrality Commissioner Mignon Clyburn , her rhetorical guns pointed at Genachowski 's critics .
" My fear , " she proclaimed , " is that there are efforts underway designed to stifle at all costs our ability to engage in reasonable and productive discussion about these pressing issues .
Indeed , it appears that we are a long way from a sincere debate on the merits of these proposals .
There is , I believe , a great deal of misinformation being disseminated , which is creating misplaced anxiety . "
This NOI , Clyburn added , successfully takes a " difficult and combustible topic " and presents it " in a way that should produce meaningful and fruitful discourse . "
We 're all ears .
The deadline for comments on the probe is July 15 .
The deadline for replies to comments is August 12 .
The proceeding number is 10 - 127 , and you can file your fruitful or combustible comments with the FCC here .
Vom Elend des Kalaharisalzes Rudolf Stumberger
Hartz IV - Kochbücher werfen ein Blitzlicht auf einen bizarren Armen- Messianismus
Deutschland kann manchmal sehr seltsam sein .
So ist es wohl das einzige Land , dessen umwälzendste Sozialgesetzgebung nach einem Straftäter benannt ist .
Bekanntlich wurde Peter Hartz wegen Untreue rechtskräftig verurteilt .
Und wahrscheinlich ist Deutschland auch das einzige Land dieser Erde , in dem Kochbücher zu Sozialgesetzen geschrieben werden .
Es ist ein groteskes Kapitel und eine sozialpsychologisch höchst interessante Erscheinung , dass meist biedere Bürger sich dazu hingezogen fühlen , den Armen zu erklären , wie schmack - und nahrhaft man sich mit ein paar Euro am Tag ernähren kann .
Sie tun dies meist in Verlagen , in denen man für die Veröffentlichung zahlen muss , und mittlerweile existiert eine ganze Reihe dieser seltsamen Armuts - Kochbücher .
Fangen wir ganz unten an .
„ Schmackhaft kochen mit Hartz IV “ nennt sich ein hochstapelndes Produkt von Werner Trinks , das für 8,90 Euro eine unglaublich banale Aufzählung von Küchengeräten ( Fleischwolf , Mixer ... ) , Kräutern ( Petersilie , Rosmarin , Salbei ... ) oder Suppen ( Gemüsesuppe , Rahmsuppe , ... ) bietet , dazwischen ein paar Gerichte ( „ Geflügelleber mit Waldpilzen “ ) einstreut .
Im Vorwort meint der Autor : „ Jeder , der heute Hartz IV bezieht , hat bestimmt schon bessere Tage in seinem Leben erlebt “ und verspricht „ Dies ist kein Kochbuch für den verwöhnten Gaumen , denn Trüffel kann sich ein Hartz IV - Empfänger nicht leisten . “
Warum sich in diesen Aufzählungen bei „ Das Salz “ dann aber das Meersalz Fleur de Sel ( „ handgeschöpft “ , „ Das Kilo kostet um die 100 Euro “ ) , das Kalaharisalz ( „ kommt aus der Wüste Kalahari , wird in der Gourmetküche verwendet und ist auch sehr teuer “ ) oder das Mauisalz ( „ kommt von der Hawaiinsel Maui und ist genau so teuer “ ) findet , bleibt unerklärt .
Ähnliches findet sich in der Öl - Rubrik : „ Eins der hochwertigsten Öle ist das Trüffelöl “ .
Am Anfang seiner Aufzählungen hat der Autor etliche Fragen aufgelistet : „ Wo wohne ich ? “ „ Habe ich eine Gefriertruhe ? “ „ Was brauche ich ? “ .
Es fehlt freilich die entscheidende Frage : „ Wer bin ich und wozu in aller Welt soll dieses merkwürdige Büchlein eigentlich gut sein ? “
Die Antwort von Sylvia Wenig - Karasch darauf ist , „ sich und seinen Lieben auch bei kleinem Budget großes Essvergnügen gönnen “ , und man höre und staune , das „ schon für zwei Euro pro Tag und Person “ .
Die Broschüre mit dem vollmundigen Titel „ Glücklich und satt für zwei Euro am Tag “ macht einem zuerst den Mund wässrig ( “ Morgens am nett gedeckten Frühstückstisch sitzen , den Duft von frisch gebrühtem Tee ... leckeres Brot auf dem Teller ...ein gekochtes Ei...frisches Obst “ ) , um dann eine Diät für schwer Übergewichtige zu empfehlen .
Morgens zwei Scheiben Toastbrot , mittags zwei Eier mit Kartoffelbrei , abends eine Scheibe „ Schwarzbrot dünn “ mit Leberwurst – wer so auf Dauer Kinder , Heranwachsende oder Erwachsene ernähren will , wird wohl weder satt noch glücklich machen .
Dass die Broschüre mit ihren Rezepten ausdrücklich keinen Anspruch darauf erhebt , „ kulinarisch besonders erwähnenswert oder ernährungswissenschaftlich besonders ausgewogen zu sein “ , muss man wohl als eine Art Rückversicherung gegenüber möglichen Schadensansprüchen verstehen .
Kommen wir zu der Rubrik „ Selbstversuche “ .
„ Hartz IV in aller Munde “ nennt sich etwas keck ein Vollwert - Kochbuch , das der Frage nachgeht : „ Kann man sich 31 Tage lang von dem in Hartz IV vorgesehenen Anteil von 132 Euro wirklich vollwertig - biologisch ernähren ? “
Die Autorin beantwortet dies mit einem „ deutlichen Ja “ , schweigt sich aber darüber aus , wie es am 32 .
Tag dann weitergeht .
Immerhin bietet das Buch anscheinend solide Vollwert - Rezepte vom „ Birnenfrühstück “ bis zum „ Rotkohlauflauf mit Haferkartoffelkruste “ .
Freilich ist auch hier Schmalhans Küchenmeister .
Mit einer Hauptmahlzeit aus Endiviensalat , Möhren und Rotkohl kann man zwar prima abnehmen , ist aber irgendwann nur noch Haut und Knochen .
Unerträglich aber ist auch hier jene unbedarfte Beflissenheit , sich messianisch der Welt der Armut in einem „ Versuch “ für ein paar Tage zu nähern .
Das erinnert an die „ Selbstversuche “ des Bürgertums gegen Ende des 19 .
Jahrhunderts , als man sich für Berichte wie „ Drei Monate Fabrikarbeiter und Handwerksbursche “ oder „ Dreieinhalb Monate Fabrik - Arbeiterin “ als Proletarierer verkleidete und in die dunkle Welt der Fabrik - Arbeiter hinabstieg , jedenfalls für ein paar Wochen .
Es ist die gnadenlose Gedankenlosigkeit , die in Sätzen wie diesen aufstoßen :
Gerade in der Hartz IV - Versuchsphase habe ich gelernt , auch den Kohl viel aufmerksamer zu betrachten .
Ein „ Selbstversuch “ ist auch „ Gut essen und Trinken trotz Hartz IV ? “ von Michael Lüpke .
Das Buch bietet keine Rezepte , sondern schildert die „ Erlebnisse “ während eines Monats , in dem der Autor versucht , sich mit 4,25 Euro pro Tag zu ernähren .
Auch hier wieder dieser seltsame masochistische Drang , sich der eigenen behäbigen Bürgerlichkeit für eine kurze Zeit zu entledigen und das Schaudern angesichts von Armut am eigenen Leibe zu erleben :
So verfolgte mich monatelang die Frage , wie es denn nun sei , wenn man ständig mit dem Druck eines ( zu ) knappen Budgets seine täglichen Besorgungen erledigen muss ... “
Dem Autor ist zweierlei zugute zu halten .
Dass er eine klare Meinung zu Hartz IV hat ( „ Synonym für sozialen Abstieg , Ausgegrenztsein und Perspektivlosigkeit “ ) und dass sein Bericht so ungewollt komisch daherkommt , dass er fast schon wieder lesbar ist : „ Mein sowieso schon strammer Schritt verschärft sich nochmals , was mir aber nicht leicht fällt , denn die schweren Beutel schneiden schon merklich in die Hände “ ; „ Ich registriere wieder einen deutlichen Schwund meiner Vorräte “ .
Als es ein paar Tage regnet und der Autor deshalb (! ) nicht zum Supermarkt kommt wird es gar dramatisch :
Fürs Abendessen muss ich meine zur Neige gehenden Vorräte bereits rationieren , auch in Hinblick auf das morgige Frühstück ...
Irgendwie macht sich eine Art Panik in meinem Kopf breit .
Ich muss unbedingt an etwas anderes denken .
Das nächste Kapitel heißt dann „ Dem Elend gerade noch entronnen “ .
Ernst nehmen kann man all diese Produkte als ein Blitzlicht , das eine etwas doch bizarre Variante bürgerlicher deutscher Mentalität beleuchtet .
Wenn die Bundesregierung beschließen würde , dass Arbeitslose nur noch auf einem Bein hüpfen dürfen , gäbe es wohl auch dazu ernstgemeinte „ Ratgeber “ und „ Selbstversuche “ .
Im übrigen sind die Versuche , anderen mit immer weniger Euros pro Tag das Überleben zu lehren , längst schon bis zum Null - Euro - Niveau erforscht .
Rüdiger Nehberg hat mit seinem Buch „ Überleben ums Verrecken “ schon vor Jahren gezeigt , wie man sich kostenlos von Insekten und kleinen Feldmäusen ernährt .

Councils say there is nothing they can do about a new mobile app that drivers in Australian capital cities are using to skirt parking meter fees and fines .
ParkPatrol , developed by Sydney - based software developer Crwdpower , sends alerts to iPhone and , soon , Google Android mobile users when a parking officer is near their car .
People who have the app on their phones can with one button report the locations of parking officers they see in the street .
The server then cross-checks incoming reports with all the checked - in parked cars on its database , and sends instant text alerts to drivers when a report comes within 200 metres of a parked car .
A spokeswoman for the Local Government and Shires Associations of NSW said that as technology advances , the creation and use of applications such as ParkPatrol are " essentially unavoidable " .
She advised users to " consider both the legality and reliability " of the application .
Family denounces Detroit police murder of seven - year - old child
By Jerry White
18 May 2010
Memorial for Aiyana Jones
Family members say an incendiary device the police threw into their home severely burned seven - year - old Aiyana Stanley Jones before she was fatally wounded by a police gunshot during an early Sunday morning raid .
The second grader at Detroit ’s Trix Elementary School was sleeping on a front room couch with her grandmother when the “ flash - bang grenade ” came through the window and landed on the sofa , burning her .
On Monday , an attorney for the family said a videotape of the incident revealed that Aiyana had been shot from outside the house before the grenade was tossed inside .
Police officials have claimed an officer accidentally discharged his weapon inside the house after a “ physical confrontation ” with the child ’s 47 - year - old grandmother , Mertilla Jones .
Jones , a retired school worker , has strenuously refuted the allegations that she had a struggle with the cops .
Police officials are now saying the police officer may have “ simply collided ” with her before the gun discharged .
Up to 20 cops from the Special Response Team , a heavily armed unit referred to by a former member as the “ Marine Corps of the Detroit Police Department , ” conducted the assault on the east side Detroit home located on Lillibridge Street .
The grenade — known in the US Army as an M84 — is intended to be used in enclosed spaces to “ distract and temporarily incapacitate enemy personnel ” for easier capture or “ when the risk of collateral damage during urban warfare or hostage rescue operations ” precludes the use of more lethal high explosive ordnance .
Police say they were conducting a “ no knock ” search for a homicide suspect .
However , the suspect , a 34 - year - old male who was arrested by police , did not live in Aiyana ’s apartment but in a separate , upstairs unit in the three - story home .
The unnamed officer involved in the shooting death is a 14 - year veteran who has worked on the Special Response Team for about six years , the assistant police chief said .
It has now been revealed that the police raid was being videotaped for a reality crime show on the Arts & Entertainment Network called “ The First 48 . ” A plug for the show on the A&E website , says , “ For homicide detectives , the clock starts ticking the moment they are called .
Their chance of solving a case is cut in half if they do n’t get a lead in ‘ The First 48 . ’
Each passing hour gives suspects more time to flee , witnesses more time to forget what they saw , and crucial evidence more time to be lost forever . ”
In the twisted minds of the media executives , police raids in Detroit ’s neighborhoods , like military sweeps through Iraqi and Afghan homes , are “ entertainment . ”
An attorney for the Jones family said the police “ were excited ; they were on TV .
They did n’t have to throw a grenade through the front window when they knew there were children in there .
There was nothing but innocent people in the home where they put this flash grenade . ”
There is no doubt that the police were also using overwhelming and indiscriminate force after a similar raid last month — about five miles away — resulted in one cop being killed and another four wounded — the highest number of casualties in any one incident in the history of the department .
Sunday ’s raid took place in a working class neighborhood a few blocks from Chrysler ’s Jefferson Avenue Assembly Plant , an area where auto workers once lived , that is now dotted with abandoned houses and vacant lots .
Before the raid family members and neighbors told police the house was inhabited by several small children and pointed to the toys on the front lawn .
Their warnings were ignored .
After the raid police held Aiyana ’s grandmother , Mertilla Jones , for more than 12 hours before releasing her .
At a press conference Sunday evening , Jones said , “ I never touched none of them .
No one gave them any struggle .
They blew my granddaughter ’s brains out .
They killed her right before my eyes .
I watched the light go out of her eyes . ”
Aiyana ’s aunt , Krystal Sanders , a laid - off office worker , was in the home when the assault occurred .
On Monday , she told WSWS reporters she was watching TV around 12:58 a.m. when she heard a loud noise .
“ I never heard them say they were Detroit police .
They told everyone to get down and put their face on the floor , so we could not see what they had done .
“ They killed Aiyana .
Her brains were on the couch and on the porch .
They would not let my brother go with her to the hospital .
My brother has a picture of her in the morgue , burned .
“ At first the police said that my brother shot at them .
Then they blamed my mother .
My mother was fingerprinted , given a mouth swab and tested for gunpowder residue .
My mother and brother were cleared of all charges . ”
“ There were four children in the house at the time .
Aiyana was seven and the others were four , three years old and two months old .
My cousin Mark told the police before the raid that there were children in the house .
No amount of money will ever bring her back . ”
Since the shooting , Krystal told the WSWS , she has been unable to sleep or eat .
Speaking of the media coverage she said , “ The news is crooked .
The media interviewed my mother .
None of her interviews have been on TV .
All of the TV stations were here during the vigil last night .
I told A&E not to tear us ( her family ) down .
They know this is a high profile case .
Some of these people are lying . ”
Aiyana ’s 25 - year - old father , Charles Jones , is a self - employed construction worker and handyman .
Jones said he rushed into the living room after hearing the explosive and gunshot .
Police made him lie face down on the ground with his face in shattered glass and blood .
Jones said police told him his daughter would be OK .
In an account of the raid , he told the Detroit News , “ I saw them ( police ) running with my daughter out of the house .
They had my mother on the floor , and they just kept me there for like two hours .
I knew it was bad , and they probably had my baby at the hospital , because someone asked me if she had any allergies .
Her blood was everywhere and I was trying to stay calm , but nobody would talk to me .
None of them even tried to console me .
“ If they were watching this place to see if their suspect was here , why did n’t they notice all the toys in the yard and all the kids coming and going downstairs ? ”
Jones asked the News .
“ They came into my house with a flash grenade and a bullet .
They say my mother resisted them , that she tried to take an officer ’s gun .
My mother had never been in handcuffs in her life .
They killed my baby and I want someone to tell the truth . ”
After the raid the father reported that the police confiscated Aiyana ’s blanket , which had been burned by the stun grenade .
He also said his daughter had been badly burned and the sofa soaked in blood .
The indiscriminate murder of a seven - year - old child is fueling enormous social anger , which is already reaching the breaking point due to the miserable living conditions in Detroit — where the real unemployment rate is 50 percent — and the daily indignities suffered at the hands of indifferent politicians and city officials .
Police officials have sought to dispel community anger and have said a full investigation would be handled by the Michigan State Police , citing “ community confidence concerns , ” i.e. , the Detroit police department ’s utter lack of popular credibility .
For his part , Mayor David Bing has hardly issued a word on the killing of Aiyana Jones .
In brief comments during an event on a different subject Monday , the Mayor sought to defend the police saying he would let the investigation into Sunday ’s events unfold and did n’t “ want to point fingers at anybody right now . ”
In an effort to justify the actions of the police he blamed the killing on a wave of violent crime .
“ This is a time , he said , “ for the community to come together .
We just ca n’t continue the massacre of our citizens . ”
Bing , a multi-millionaire businessman is overseeing the further impoverishment of the city , including a corporate - backed plan to shut down schools and city services in whole areas of the city deemed too poor to maintain .
To carry out these measures — which are deeply unpopular — he is increasingly relying on the brute force of the police .
At a funeral for a police officer killed in a similar raid last month , Bing called for a law and order crackdown in the city .
“ We collectively will bring this city back and make sure that those few who disrespect the leadership in this city are not going to take this anymore .
The madness has to stop , ” exclaimed Bing .

Well , talk about joining the mile high club .
Plenty of odd things have happened in space .
Animals have taken flight , the Hubble Telescope has captured photos of mindbending light shows , and our interstellar adventures have sparked more than a few flying saucer tales .
But in Low Earth Orbit , we now know of one thing that is n’t happening .
There ’s apparently no sex allowed on the International Space Station .
At least that ’s what Alan Poindexter , a NASA commander , would have us believe .
“ We are a group of professionals , ” he said .
“ Personal relationships are not … an issue .
We do n’t have them and we wo n’t . ”
( In other sex news : King Tut ’s penis is missing )
There ’s no word , though , on how many astronauts may have wanted to .
And you know what happens when you tell people they ca n’t do something …
Think about it :
These are people who ( a ) spend months crammed together in a confined space and ( b ) like to experiment with science and mechanics — surely , they must be curious about how sex in zero gravity would work .
Call it the final frontier of human anatomy .
So one question remains : Your habitation module or mine ?

What happens when Americans plunder America and leave it broken , destitute and seething mad ?
Where do these fabulously wealthy Americans go with their loot , if America is n’t a safe , secure , or even desirable place to spend their riches ?
What if they lose faith in their gated communities , because those plush gated communities are surrounded by millions of pissed - off Americans stripped of their entitlements , and who now want in ?
We finally have the answer , and you ’re not going to like it : a new fleet of castles that float in the oceans .
The super - wealthy are already building their first floating castle , a billion - dollar - plus luxury liner that offers permanent multimillion - dollar housing with the best protection of all : moats made of oceans , keeping the land - based Americans they ’ve plundered at a safe distance .
The first such floating castle has been christened the “ Utopia “ – the South Korean firm Samsung has been contracted to build the $ 1.1 billion ship , due to be launched in 2013 .
Already orders are coming in to buy one of the Utopia ’s 200 or so mansions for sale -- which range in price from about $ 4 million for the smallest condos to over $ 26 million for 6,600 square - foot “ estates . ”
The largest mansion is a whopping 40,000 square feet , and sells for $ 160 million .
It ’s the first of its kind to offer permanent housing units to buyers , and there ’ll be plenty on board the Utopia for the global elite inhabitants to keep themselves entertained : an outdoor movie theater , casino , miniature golf course , nightclubs , restaurants , shops , and a water park for the elites ’ heirs ( featuring a “ Lazy River , ” rock - climbing wall and water slides ) .
At nearly 1,000 feet , the Utopia is almost as long as a nuclear - powered Nimitz - class aircraft carrier .
The floating castle is a longtime dream of libertarian oligarchs — a place where they can live their lives in peace free from the teeming masses of starving losers and indebted parasites and their tax demands .
Since they ’ve grown so rich off of America , they have enough spare change to fund projects like the Seasteading Institute , run by Milton Friedman ’s grandson , Patri Friedman , and financed by the bizarre right - wing PayPal founder , Peter Thiel .
It could n’t have come a moment sooner for Milton Friedman ’s grandson , who was best known until recently for running a grotesque advice blog for married swingers , PUA4LTR ( Pick Up Advice For Long - Term Relationships ) .
Actually , Patri Friedman ran that pick - up advice blog with his wife –the two of them are apparent big - time cyber - swingers , apparently –posting blog entries saying things like “ Why Should Husbands Become PUAs ?
Because otherwise , your wife will talk like those wives on the blog My Husband Is Annoying . ”
Both Thiel and Milton Friedman ’s grandson see democracy as the enemy–last year , Thiel wrote “ I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible ” at about the same time that Milton Friedman ’s grandson proclaimed , “ Democracy is not the answer . ”
Both published their anti-democracy proclamations in the same billionaire - Koch - family - funded outlet , Cato Unbound , one of the oldest billionaire - fed libertarian welfare dispensaries .
Friedman ’s answer for Thiel ’s democracy problem is to build offshore libertarian pod-fortresses where the libertarian way rules .
It ’s probably better for everyone if Milton Friedman ’s grandson and Peter Thiel leave us forever for their libertarian ocean lair–Thiel believes that America went down the tubes ever since it gave women the right to vote , and he was outed as the sponsor of accused felon James O’Keefe ’s smear videos that brought ACORN to ruin .
Genius at work : Various designs for billionaire - libertarian escape pods
While Thiel and Friedman are busy cooking up their libertarian dystopia , the Frontier Group investment firm — an offshoot of the Carlyle Group — has already entered the realization phase with the Utopia floating castle .
Frontier Group , was founded by some of the same big names from the notorious Carlyle Group –the private equity firm that brought together right - wing oligarchs like George H. W. Bush and other top American officials with their billionaire pals in Saudi Arabia like the Bin Laden family , who together raked in enormous profits thanks to the War on Terror that their kids Dubya and Osama launched .
While neither Bush nor the Bin Ladens are principals in the Frontier Group , its founding director , Frank Carlucci , is a name they know well , and you should too .
Carlucci ran the Carlyle Group as its chairman from 1989 through 2005 , right around the time that the wars started going undeniably bad , and floating castles started to look like a viable plan .
But Carlucci ’s past is much weirder and scarier than most of us care to know : whether it ’s his strangely timed appearances in some of the ugliest assassinations and coups in modern history , or serving as Carter ’s number two man in the CIA , and Ronald Reagan ’s Secretary of Defense , if Frank Carlucci ( nicknamed “ Creepy Carlucci ” and “ Spooky Frank ” ) is the founding director of a firm that ’s building floating castles , it ’s a bad sign for those of us left behind .
I ’ll get into Carlucci ’s partners in the Frontier Group in a moment , but first , let ’s reacquaint ourselves with Frank Carlucci .
From an early age , Carlucci learned the importance of getting to know the right people in the right places .
He studied at Princeton in the mid-1950s , where as luck should have it , Carlucci roomed with Donald Rumsfeld .
Both Carlucci and Rumsfeld shared a passion for Greco - Roman wrestling at Princeton , and both went on to serve in the Navy after Princeton .
Their paths would split and merge several times over the next few decades , even as they remained close personal friends throughout their lives .
In the late 1950s , Carlucci briefly served as an executive at a lingerie manufacturer , Jantzen ( the Victoria ’s Secret of its day ) , but quickly left to join the State Department .
At age 30 Carlucci was named vice consul of the U.S. embassy in the Congo–just in time for the colony ’s independence from Belgium .
Of all the European colonies in Africa , Congo suffered perhaps the worst , at least that we know about : the Belgians exterminated up to 10 million Congolese between 1885 and 1908 , and introduced the now - widespread punishment of hacking off Africans ’ forearms to scare everyone into submission .
All of this was done in order to strip the Congo of its lucrative rubber , ivory , and later , precious metals , as quickly as possible , and send the riches back to Belgium .
Naturally the Belgians did n’t want to let go of their colony , so they held out until 1960 , when the Congo finally was granted independence and democratic elections .
Unfortunately for the Congo , America did n’t like way they voted–so two months after Patrice Lumumba was elected president , he was overthrown in a CIA - backed coup , taken out into the jungle , murdered , chopped into little pieces with a hacksaw , and then dissolved in sulfuric acid by Belgian goons and their local collaborators .
Carlucci has been accused of green - lighting Lumumba ’s assassination by multiple investigative reporters .
The dictator who replaced Lumumba was a CIA asset named Joseph Mobutu–the notorious dictator who brought the Congo to ruin after embezzling more than any dictator in Africa .
Mobutu was finally deposed in 1997 , but the wars since then have claimed roughly six million lives , the bloodiest conflicts since World War II .
After his success in Congo , it was all uphill for Carlucci : he moved to the Brazil embassy just in time for the military coup in 1964 , then went to Washington to serve as deputy to his buddy Donald Rumsfeld in Nixon ’s Office of Economic Opportunity , where the young Dick Cheney was making his name .
The first thing they did upon taking control of the OEO was conduct a purge of “ subversives ” firing up to a quarter of the staff .
In 1974 , Carlucci was named ambassador to Portugal just in time for the overthrow of the dictatorship–Carlucci saw to it that the communists who led the overthrow were themselves overthrown by IMF - friendly “ moderate ” socialists , and a few years later , he was back in Washington serving as the number two man in the CIA under Carter .
Once that agency was sufficiently gutted , he moved on to other forms of destruction :
In 1974 , Carlucci was named ambassador to Portugal just in time for the overthrow of the dictatorship–Carlucci saw to it that the Communists who led the overthrow were themselves overthrown by IMF - friendly “ moderate ” socialists , and a few years later , he was back in Washington DC serving as the number two man in the CIA under Carter .
In 1981 , Reagan named him deputy Defense Secretary ; Carlucci left in 1983 to head up Sears World Trade , a trading company involved in shady arms deals that was once described by Fortune magazine as a front for US intelligence ops .
Once that collapsed , Carlucci moved back to the Reagan Administration as National Security Advisor and then Defense Secretary .
In 1989 , Carlucci left to become chairman of the fledging Carlyle Group , which subsequently morphed into the monster we remember it by : using its highly paid A - list of public officials to lobby big government for lucrative contracts , profiting off of privatized rest stops and unnecessary arms contracts , leaving the public to foot the bill while guys like Carlucci run around preaching the benefits of private enterprise .
Creepy Carlucci
Carlucci may be the scariest of the Frontier Group bunch building the floating castles , but he ’s among his kind .
Other Carlyle Group directors who joined Carlucci at Frontier include David Robb , who headed up Carlyle ’s investments in defense and aerospace ; Sanford McDonnell , the former CEO of McDonnell Douglass and onetime head of the Boy Scouts of America ; and Norman Augustine , another ex-president of the Boy Scouts , another Princeton alum , and former board director at the scandal - plagued Riggs bank .
Riggs bank became one of those dark unsolved mysteries of the Bush - Cheney War on Terror .
After the attacks on 9/11 , the FBI discovered that Saudi government officials used accounts at Riggs bank to wire funds to at least two known associates of the Saudi hijackers who crashed Flight 77 into the Pentagon .
Riggs was also implicated in the Britain - Saudi $ 3 billion bribery scandal , in which British Aerospace bribes were wired through Riggs accounts to Saudi officials in return for lucrative contracts .
One of Riggs bank ’s top executives was Jonathan Bush , the brother of George H. W. Bush , after Riggs bought out Jonathan Bush ’s bank in 1997 , and appointed him as a director .
In 2005 , with Riggs embroiled in investigations and scandals–Riggs pled guilty to money laundering Augusto Pinochet ’s stolen funds , and the funds of various Equatorial Guinea officials – it was taken over by PNC bank , with the approval of Fed Chair Alan Greenspan .
Even after the Washington Post revealed that Riggs ’ billionaire chairman flew Greenspan ’s wife , MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell , on the Riggs company jet .
But the weirdest of all the Frontier Group directors has to be founding director Danny Pang .
Last year , the Wall Street Journal reported that Pang embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars from his private equity firm PEMGroup .
Pang claimed he was investing money in “ Dead Peasants Insurance ” ( life insurance policies for people considered likely to die ) , but in secret , Pang confided to PEMGroup ’s ex-president that he ran it as a Ponzi scheme .
That sparked a fresh FBI investigation into Danny Pang ’s crimes –which led back to the unsolved murder of his wife , Janie Louise Pang , a 33 - year - old ex-stripper who was shot to death execution style in their Irvine , California home in 1997 , the same year Pang was accused of embezzling three million dollars from another fund he worked at .
There was plenty of reason to suspect Danny Pang of murdering his wife : he beat her so often ( breaking her nose on one occasion ) that police were called in on at least four occasions before her murder .
She ’d had him tailed by a private detective who discovered Danny holding hands with another woman shortly before she was murdered .
Danny had known ties to the Taiwanese Triad mob , he took the fifth and refused to cooperate in the murder trial , and reportedly threatened Janie ’s friends after her murder , demanding to know what Janie told them about his business activities .
Janie Louise Pang
Here is a description of Janie Louise Pang ’s murder , from the L.A. Times :
According to the family maid and two of Pang ’s children , a clean - cut man with a pencil - thin mustache arrived at the door asking for her husband .
The pair talked casually for a couple of minutes , until the man drew a semiautomatic pistol .
Pang began running and the maid , terrified , spirited Pang ’s children out the back door .
Within minutes , the killer caught up with Pang , who tried to hide in her bedroom closet .
The killer fired several .380 - caliber rounds and left her to bleed to death as she lay in a fetal position .
Somehow , the trial ended with a hung jury , and Danny Pang went on to join Frank Carlucci and the Boy Scouts presidents to start building the world ’s first billion - dollar floating castle to spirit away all that stolen money in luxury .
But Pang was apparently too careless for them .
He was outted last spring in the Wall Street Journal , and you can probably guess what happens to guys like Pang who become a liability to the right - wing oligarchy :
In September 2009 , Danny Pang was found dead of unknown causes in his Newport Beach home .
Danny Pang
After a three - month investigation , Pang ’s death was ruled a suicide :
John C. Hiserodt , a private forensic pathologist in Cypress , Calif. , reviewed the toxicology report released by the coroner .
He said it showed that Mr. Pang had roughly five times the typical fatal levels of both oxycodone and hydrocodone in his blood , plus the equivalent still in his stomach of about 30 oxycodone pills of 10 milligrams apiece .
“ You do n’t get this level of drug accidentally , ” he said .
“ It ’s pretty clearly a suicide . ”
Indeed .
Meanwhile , plans to launch the Utopia are moving ahead on schedule .

For the second time in less than three years , death has visited the mixed martial arts community .
Michael Kirkham , a 30 - year - old based in Fayetteville , N.C. , died Monday from injuries he was believed to have sustained during his first professional MMA match .
The 6 - foot - 9 lightweight was knocked out at Dash Entertainment / King MMA “ Confrontation at the Convocation Center ” in Aiken , S.C. , on Saturday .
Kirkham never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at nearby Aiken Regional Medical Center two days later .
Aiken County Coroner Tim Carlton on Monday told the Associated Press that Kirkham died from bleeding inside the brain .
An autopsy will be conducted on Tuesday .
South Carolina law prevented organized MMA competition until state legislators approved a measure to allow the South Carolina Athletic Commission to regulate fights last summer .
Kirkham held a 3 - 3 mark as an amateur and , according to his Facebook page , trained in tae kwon do and submission wrestling for three and a half years .
He operated out of the Fayetteville Independents camp in Fayetteville , N.C. Kirkham joins Sam Vasquez as the only other fatality at a regulated event .
Vasquez died on Nov. 30 , 2007 , a little more than a month after his bout with Vince Libardi at a Renegades Fighting Extreme show in Houston .
Competing for the first time in more than a year , the 35 - year - old married father of one battled Libardi in a featherweight contest at the Toyota Center , succumbing to strikes 2:50 into round three .
Emergency medical technicians tended to Vasquez for several minutes , until he lost consciousness and was rushed to a local hospital .
Despite hopes and prayers , Vasquez ’s conditioned worsened .
On Nov. 4 , two weeks after he was admitted , he underwent the first of two surgeries to relieve pressure on his brain .
He then suffered a massive stroke and was placed in a medically induced coma .
Doctors could do little else to save him , and on Nov. 30 , he was gone .
The only confirmed death prior to government oversight came when 31 - year - old Douglas Dedge died in 1998 at a non-sanctioned World Super Challenge event in Kiev , Ukraine .
The Chipley , Fla. , resident passed out during a training session leading up to the fight but went through with the match anyway .
Writing at National Review , Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron argues that if the Tea Party movement wants to get serious about limiting government , it must oppose the drug war :
Voter dissatisfaction with Republicans and Democrats is at historic levels , and the tea-party movement is hoping to play kingmaker in the November elections .
The country 's current breed of discontent is ideal for the tea parties , because economic concerns are foremost , allowing the movement to sidestep the divisions between its libertarian and conservative wings .
As the elections near , however , voters will want to know where the party stands not just on the economy but on social issues .
A perfect illustration is drug policy , where conservatives advocate continued prohibition but libertarians argue for legalization .
Which way should the tea party lean when this issue arises ?
If the party is true to its principles — fiscal responsibility , constitutionally limited government , and free markets — it must side with the libertarians .

Just what the doctor ordered
We have previously published two lists of bizarre deaths so we thought we ought to make it a trilogy .
A first in this new list is that we have the chance to include an entire group of people as one of the entries .
Read the previous lists before reading this one and feel free to contribute any additional entries via the comments .
10 The Donatists
Donatism was an early Christian heretical movement which was named after Donatus Magnus , Bishop of Carthage , in 313 AD .
The Donatists believed that the Church should be a church of saints and not sinners .
This view led huge numbers of them to seek out martyrdom – either by suicide , or by asking strangers ( often in large groups ) to kill them all .
This was such a widespread belief that it is surprising to know that they survived ( albeit as a very small sect ) until the 7th or 8th century .
9 Al - Musta’sim
In 1258 the Grandson of Genghis Khan ( Hulagu Khan ) invaded the Abbasid region ( comprising modern Iraq and Syria ) .
The Caliph ( Al - Musta’sim ) raised no repelling army and consequently fell into the hands of Hulagu who , being a relatively decent man , needed to execute him but did n’t want to spill royal blood .
Khan came up with a brilliant idea .
He had the Caliph rolled up in a rug and ordered his men to trample him to death with their horses .
Such compassion was not shown for Al - Musta ’ sim ’s sons , most of whom were summarily executed .
8 Clement Vallandigham
Clement Vallandigham was a member of the US House of Representatives , from Ohio .
Vallandigham had not just a bizarre , but rather an ironic death :
He was representing a defendant in a murder case for killing a man in a barroom brawl .
Vallandigham wished to prove the victim had , in fact , killed himself while trying to draw his pistol from a pocket while rising from a kneeling position .
As Vallandigham conferred with fellow defense attorneys in his hotel room , he decided to show them how he would demonstrate this to the jury .
Grabbing a pistol he believed to be unloaded , he put it in his pocket and enacted the events as he imagined them to have happened , shooting himself in the process .
Vallandigham proved his point , since the defendant , Thomas McGehan , was subsequently acquitted and released from custody .
7 Alexander I of Greece
Alexander I , King of the Hellenes , died of sepsis caused by the bites of two monkeys three weeks earlier .
The King was taking a walk in the Royal Gardens , when his dog was attacked by a monkey , and the King , attempting to defend it , received a bite by the animal and its mate .
His death had , as a result , the reinstatement of his deposed father Constantine I who , being pro-German , changed the fortunes of the Greek nation for the years to come .
6 J G Parry - Thomas
John Godfrey Parry - Thomas was a Welsh engineer , and motor - racing driver , who at one time held the Land Speed Record .
He was killed at Pendine Sands in March 1927 , while trying to regain his own world land speed record , that had been broken just weeks earlier by Malcolm Campbell on the same beach .
He was suffering from influenza and turned down a lucky black cat charm from a little girl , announcing “ I will put my faith in my maker ! ” .
His Liberty engined car , Babs , used exposed chains to connect the engine to the drive wheels , while the high engine cover required him to drive with his head tilted to one side – the right .
On his final run , the right - hand drive chain broke at a speed of 170 mph ( 270 km /h ) , causing a fatal head injury .
5 Tennessee Williams
Tennessee Williams was an American playwright who received many of the top theatrical awards for his works of drama .
He moved to New Orleans in 1939 and changed his name to “ Tennessee ” , the Southeastern U.S. state , his father ’s birthplace .
His greatest works are A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof .
He suffered through his life with alcoholism , and had a nervous breakdown in 1969 .
In 1983 , possibly dazed from drug use , he used his mouth to open an eyedrop bottle .
He would routinely hold the bottle cap in his mouth while administering drops to his eyes .
On this occasion , the lid of the bottle became lodged in his throat and he choked to death .
4 Garry Hoy
Garry
Hoy was a lawyer for the law firm of Holden Day Wilson , in Toronto .
He is best known for the circumstances of his death ; in an attempt to prove to a group of his partners at the firm that the glass in the Toronto - Dominion Centre was unbreakable , he threw himself through a glass wall on the 24th story and fell to his death after the window frame gave way .
He had apparently attempted this stunt many times in the past , having previously bounced harmlessly off the glass .
For his unusual death , Hoy was recognized with a Darwin Award in 1996 .
3 Allan Pinkerton
Allan Pinkerton was a Scottish American detective and spy , best known for creating the Pinkerton National Detective Agency , the first detective agency of the United States .
In late June 1884 , he slipped on a pavement in Chicago , biting his tongue as he did so .
He did n’t seek treatment and the tongue became infected , leading to his death on 1 July 1884 of gangrene .
At the time of his death , he was working on a system that would centralize all criminal identification records , a database now maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
2 Frank Hayes
Frank Hayes was a jockey who is most well know for being the jockey to win a horse race whilst dead !
Hayes suffered a fatal heart attack in the midst of a race at Belmont Park in New York atop his horse “ Sweet Kiss ” .
Despite carrying a dead weight , Sweet Kiss ran ahead of the field and won the race .
1 Mithridates
Mithridates was a Persian soldier , who accidentally killed Cyrus the Younger ( son of Darius II of Persia ) .
For such a blunder he was put to death by scaphism .
Here is an ancient account of his grueling 17 day death :
[ The king ] decreed that Mithridates should be put to death in boats ; which execution is made in the following manner :
Taking two boats framed exactly to fit and answer each other , they lay down in one of them the malefactor that suffers , upon his back ; then , covering it with the other , and so setting them together that the head , hands , and feet of him are left outside , and the rest of his body lies shut up within , they offer him food , and if he refuse to eat it , they force him to do it by pricking his eyes ; then , after he has eaten , they drench him with a mixture of milk and honey , pouring it not only into his mouth , but all over his face .
They then keep his face continually turned towards the sun ; and it becomes completely covered up and hidden by the multitude of flies that settle on it .
And as within the boats he does what those that eat and drink must needs do , creeping things and vermin spring out of the corruption and rottenness of the excrement , and these entering into the bowels of him , his body is consumed .
When the man is manifestly dead , the uppermost boat being taken off , they find his flesh devoured , and swarms of such noisome creatures preying upon and , as it were , growing to his inwards .
In this way Mithridates , after suffering for seventeen days , at last expired .

University of Michigan law professor David Uhlmann , former chief of the environmental crimes section in the Department of Justice , had an op-ed in the NYT discussing the potential prosecution of British Petroleum and its executives for the Deepwater Horizon blowout and spill .
He writes :
If the spill had resulted from a hurricane or lightning strike , or if it had been an unavoidable accident — an equipment failure that happened without warning — it would n’t warrant criminal prosecution .
Increasingly , however , it appears that there was negligence or worse in the events leading to the explosion of the rig .
News reports have described warning signs that went unheeded and deviations from standard industry practice : Gas was seeping into the well .
The blowout preventer was leaking .
Concerns were raised about the well casing .
There were signs of trouble with the cement in the well .
Mud circulation was limited .
A final concrete plug was not properly installed .
And when disaster struck , the blowout preventer failed .
Prosecutors must examine all witness statements , internal documents and any physical evidence that remains after the explosion .
But if the news articles are accurate , the Justice Department should bring criminal charges against BP , and possibly Transocean and Halliburton , for violations of the Clean Water Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act — the same charges brought in the Exxon Valdez case .
Exxon ultimately paid a criminal fine of $ 125 million , the largest ever for an environmental crime .
. . .
No one thinks BP , Transocean or Halliburton intended to spill oil into the gulf .
But given good evidence , the government could argue that the companies cut corners or deviated so much from standard industry practice that they knew a blowout could happen .
Or , the government could argue that , even if the initial gusher involved only negligence ( a misdemeanor under the Clean Water Act ) each additional day represents a knowing violation .
Both approaches are untested , because there have been so few oil spill cases — but the gulf disaster warrants trying aggressive strategies .
Even without a criminal prosecution , BP will pay dearly for its mismanagement and lax practices .

Act may cap BP ’s liability for economic damages at $ 75 million , but that will barely scratch the surface of the moneys BP will pay .
According to company executives , BP has already spent over $ 1 billion on cleanup and recovery efforts , and some estimate the cleanup tag alone could reach $ 14 billion .
On top of that , it share price has taken a tumble , and over 100 lawsuits have been filed against it .
BP was irresponsible ( as were Halliburton and Transocean ) and they will pay , as they should .
BP ’s lax operations and corporate culture contributed to the series of events that caused the spill .
( See , e.g. , this WSJ article . )
What ’s ironic about this is it was not so long ago that environmentalists were lauding the oil giant for its “ progressive ” approach to environmental issues ( and substantial financial contributions to environmental causes ) .
One CEO even sought to rebrand BP as “ Beyond Petroleum ” to reflect its commitment to alternative energy sources .
Yet it ’s becoming increasingly clear that BP ’s commitment to the environment was just window dressing .
The Gulf spill is hardly the first example of BP ’s lax oversight and negligent operations .
Going Green was good PR , not meaningful commitment that should influence its operations so as to enhance worker safety and protect the environment .
how ironic that BP ’s actual performance pales in comparison with competitors like ExxonMobil .
Those companies most aggressive in seeking to burnish their green credentials , and pronounce their progressive commitment , are often those with the worst records on the ground .
Bigfoot has apparently gone blond and lives in North Carolina .
At least according to Cleveland County resident Tim Peeler , who told local authorities of his encounter with the 10 - foot tall creature , reports the Charlotte Observer .
Peeler thought he was calling coyotes , but instead got surprised and frightened by what -- or who -- came a -calling .
" Instead of them , him , " Peeler , who lives in a rural area near South Mountains State Park , told NBC affiliate WCNC NewsChannel 36 .
" This thing was 10 - foot tall .
He had beautiful hair , " said Peeler , adding that it looked like the creature had six fingers on each hand .
" I come out here and rough - talked him and run him off , " continued Peeler .
But then the creature returned .
Luckily the encounter ended safely when Peeler got a bit more aggressive .
" I said , ' Get away from here !
Get! Get !' and he went right back up that path again . "
Sgt. Mark Self of the Cleveland County sheriff 's office responded to the suspicious - person call placed by Peeler .
" It scared me , " said Self .
" This is just totally blowing my mind that they even brought it back up , " adding that the Sasquatch legend has been in the county since the 1970s .
" It does n't bother me now -- I do n't think there 's anything to it , " Self said .
Still , the sheriff 's office plans to continue its routine patrols of the area .
" If we see something , we ’ll try to capture it and take it into custody , " he added .
So campers and hikers visiting the state park , one of North Carolina ’s least - developed recreational sites , be forewarned -- you might want to plan on carrying a big stick , and leaving the coyote caller at home .

It ’s been a while since any of us have seen head or tail of the Open Graphics Project , but they have n’t been just sitting around twiddling thumbs .
Enjoy an in - depth interview between OSNews and Timothy Miller , the founder of the Open Graphics Project and the main man behind the drive that keeps it going , and Michael Dexter , Program Director at Linux Fund and a key player in Linux Fund ’s partnership with the OGP .
Though it ’s been some time since there has been much public action , much of the work that the OGP has been putting into the OGD1 is finally coming to fruition .
Linux Fund has raised money to build an initial ten OGD1s for open
source developers .
Their fund - raising has exceeded the initial
fundraising goal of $ 5000 ; does this mean that additional cards will be
produced ?
Our initial estimate of $ 5000 was based on a combination of hope and
assumptions .
Our original estimates were based on a 100 - board production run .
However , there are costs that remain
fixed when you scale down the quantities , more than we had anticipated .
Fortunately , the nearly $ 8,500 we have raised has allowed us to go
ahead with a production run of 25 boards and Linux Fund has loaned the
effort the additional funds needed to complete it .
We are counting on
selling at least 10 boards to break even and will have them available
for purchase when the first boards are available to volunteer
developers .
Can you please give us an estimate of your progress thus far ?
Besides the physical hardware , being build and undergoing testing and
flashing , we have a sizable library of logic
blocks ( hardware vendors sometimes call these “ IP blocks ” ) that we’ve
developed .
This includes things like controllers for PCI , DDR memory ,
SPI PROMs , video , and even a simple MIPS - like microcontroller .
Using those , we ’ve developed working VGA emulation for OGD1 .
VGA is n’t
trivial since it requires a text mode where characters are rendered
into pixels on the fly as they ’re being scanned out to the monitor .
Instead of implementing that directly , we use our microcontroller
( named HQ ) to convert VGA text into pixels in the background ,
continuously scanning and reconverting the text buffer .
This approach
was much less invasive than hacking our video controller , and we were
going to require a microcontroller anyhow to support DMA ( at a future
date ) .
This also required a VGA BIOS .
All of this can be found in the
Open Graphics Subversion repository .
The svn head of the firmware needs some additional work to make it
ready for release , and we could use some help with that .
Meanwhile , we
have a slightly older release that
does work , which we will be programming into the shipping boards .
It is important these cards get
into the hands of active developers .
What will happen to a card if its developer withdraws from the project ?
Linux Fund owns these boards .
Although OGP and Traversal Technology
people are involved in the work , the financial and legal situation is
that Linux Fund licensed the designs under the GPL and paid for the
production .
For developers who are given a board for
free , the boards are technically on loan .
If a developer decides to no longer be
involved , they can either buy the board or they can help us to pass it
on to another developer .
Moreover , Linux Fund should be able to recall
a board at any time if they determine that it is not being used for the
intended purpose .
What is the target price you would
like to sell the consumer version of
your card at ?
Originally , OGD1 was a fund raiser , and we were going to sell them at
$ 1500 apiece .
Even today , $ 1500 is a competitive price for a board of
this complexity , but we will be selling it at half that with the goal of
breaking even .
I just want to make it clear that our goal here is not necessarily to
make a profit .
What we want is to build “ open ” ( Free - Design ) hardware
products .
One way to do it is to create a self - sustaining business .
Linux Fund came along with an alternative .
Nobody is making any profit
from this now , but if we ’re successful with getting developers on board
to make interesting stuff using OGD1 boards , this may attract more
donations in the future that we can use to create hardware products
that Free Software users can really take advantage of .
To Free Software users , the biggest challenge is hardware whose vendors
wo n’t release docs on their products .
Without them , we ca n’t make free
drivers that allow us to use the hardware we paid for .
For some people ,
the answer is to pressure the hardware vendors into releasing docs .
For
us , the answer is to create our own hardware with designs that are free
to begin with .
Going forward , we hope for opportunity for commercial development
because quite a large number of us would love to design hackable and
Free -Software - friendly hardware as our day jobs .
Companies that are
enthusiastic about supporting Free Software are something our community
really needs .
Are there plans to develop a PCI express version of the open graphics
card ?
If so , what time frame will this be in ?
This all depends on the community .
Before OGD1 , we did n’t have any real
hardware to show people , so we were n’t taken seriously .
With OGD1 ,
perhaps now people will feel we ’ve proven ourselves and decide to get
involved .
To make a PCIe version of OGD1 will require community
expertise and community funding .
Please note that OGD1 is n’t strictly a graphics card .
It ’s an
FPGA - based prototyping platform that can be made into a graphics card .
But it can also be made into innumerable other things .
I ’m interested
in doing things ranging from recording - studio quality audio processing
to wireless networking .
You said that you ’ve got 25 graphics
boards produced and
they ’re ready for programming .
What ’s the process that needs to be done
for said programming ?
All of the 25 boards we produced need to be tested for manufacturing
defects and overall serviceability .
Once they pass this testing , FPGA
and BIOS PROMs will be flashed with with the latest working firmware .
We hope to have the first few boards tested and ready for delivery by OSCON .
You ’ve put out a call for developers ,
but do you have a date that
you ’re looking at for an official launch of sorts ?
Any shindigs planned
( virtual or real ) ?
How soon will the developers and the purchasers have
their boards ?
We do n’t have any firm dates yet and we are patiently waiting for the
first batch of tested and flashed boards .
This whole project has been
an exercise in patience given the nature of hardware .
Unlike software ,
you ca n’t just tar it up and e-mail to the team .
If we have boards by
OSCON , we will definitely raise a toast to the project !
Are you hoping to build more OGD1
boards after these initial 25 ?
How
soon do you think this could be accomplished – or what needs to happen
before this can be accomplished ?
We would love to build more boards if the academic or private demand
exists .
A second run certainly would n’t take as long as this first and
it is largely a question of money .
No one wanted to take any risks with
this first run and we are fortunate that Linux Fund was willing to
front the extra money we needed .
It sounds like it ’s been a rough road
for the Open Graphics Project to
accomplish its goals ; has it been harder than initially expected ?
What
were / are some of the major roadblocks throughout the project ?
Given that the to - do list was always clear , it was more a question of
frustration than difficulty .
Speaking from Linux Fund ’s perspective ,
the first challenge was raising enough money to comfortably begin the
manufacturing process and then minor component - availability issues .
For one of the chips , the price in the US had gone from $ 5 to over $ 15 was officially unavailable during the fundraising process .
We
found ourselves nervously buying from an overseas vendor using a combination of Skype and PayPal .
Luckily , we
did n’t end up with a box of expensive chopsticks .
Aside from those
challenges , our general dependence on volunteer help has led to a few
delays given that we ’re competing with personal lives .
We ’d like to
congratulate one project member on the birth of their daughter during
the project !
That said , everything they say about the challenges of hardware are
true : it is a moving target thanks to component pricing and
availability and the countless physical variables .
We ’re still not out
of the woods until we ’re sure that every surface - mounted pad is
correctly soldered in place and that no other defects have emerged .
In the big picture , while the OGD1 has relatively good longevity , any
volunteer - driven open hardware project runs the risk of being obsolete
before ever reaching production .
In addition to Linux Fund and the
selling of some of the OGD1 boards to
create sources for funding , have you considered other community - funding
routes such as Kickstarter.com ?
While we admire the PR that Kickstarter.com is receiving , we are
concerned that they are neither a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - deductible nonprofit
nor rely on actual funds received .
Linux Fund has operated its capital
projects since 2008 and feels it has a better , albeit lesser - known
model .
How many people have really been at
the core of the Open Graphics
Project ?
Are there any people who especially stand out for their work
and contribution ?
Howard Parkin and Andy Fong get most of the credit for the printed
circuit board , with some help from various others along the way .
Timothy Miller developed most of the FPGA logic .
Petter Urkedal is
primarily responsible for the HQ microcontroller , along with a lot of
its programming .
Mark Marshall is primarily responsible for the VGA
BIOS code .
Mark Marshall is the official maintainer of the FPGA code
for the Lattice XP10 .
Patrick McNamara is the official maintainer of
the FPGA code for the Xilinx Spartan III 4000 .
Howard Parkin , Mark
Marshall , and Petter Urkedal did a vast amount of simulation and
hardware testing and debugging all of the FPGA and BIOS code to get it
to work to the point you see in this
video .
Is there any room for a newbie to
contribute to this project ?
What
would he / she have to learn to work on drivers or firmware ?
Is there an
ODG1 101 to help people interested in the project but with a limited
skill set ?
On the Open Graphics Project wiki , there are some Verilog tutorials
we ’ve written for people who would like to get started on learning how
to design chips .
Even for those who do n’t have hardware in their
hands , a lot of FPGA work can be done just in simulation , and there is
Free Verilog simulation software ( e.g. Icarus Verilog ) .
Plus there is
a ton of software work to be done .
Right now , we have a working BIOS
and microcode for VGA text mode , but we ’d like to improve it , adding
things like VGA graphics mode .
Finally , one of my dreams is to make the hardware equivalent of GCC .
We
really need a fully free chip design toolchain .
Such a thing would
lower the barrier to entry for those who want to design hardware , and
it would also be a huge benefit to hardware vendors .
FPGA vendors sink
a lot of money into their synthesis tools .
Most are pretty good , but
they can also be very expensive .
Developing a free toolchain would
allow the hardware vendors to focus on hardware and give everyone Free
and potentially better tools .
I ’d say that the cost of proprietary FPGA
synthesis tools is the biggest barrier to entry for someone wanting to
get into FPGA hacking .
I have the background in both chip design and AI
necessary to help design these tools , but we ’d need a team of
developers to complete the project .
Developers Interested In Obtaining an OGD1
As stated at LinuxFund.org , “ the goal of this developer program is two - fold :
To guarantee solid open source operating system driver support and to stimulate innovative uses of this unique computing platform .
Interested developers are invited to write ogd1@linuxfund.org with a description of their background , technical qualifications and how they would use an OGD1 .
OGD1 boards must legally remain Linux Fund property to satisfy IRS requirements and developers must agree to return their board should they discontinue their work for whatever reason , allowing another developer to use the board .
Both short - term and long - term projects are encouraged . ”

This is not the way we want to treat customers .
From Facebook to significant customer service channels , AT&T strives to provide our customers with easy ways to have their questions addressed .
Because of this incident , we are reviewing our entire process to ensure a situation like this does not happen again .
AT&T's Executive Response Team certainly caused a little controversy yesterday after it warned reader Giorgio Galante that sending another email to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson would result in a cease and desist letter , but apparently it was all just a mistake -- Giorgio tells us that he 's received a sincere apology from an AT&T senior VP , who took responsibility for the mixup .
Apparently the cease and desist warning came about due to bad reading of AT&T internal policy -- Giorgio was told the rep who made the call is " not having the best of days today " -- and AT&T tells us it 's reviewing its procedures to make sure it does n't happen again .
As for Giorgio , he says AT&T 's rep sincerely listened to his concerns about the new data plan pricing schemes and that he 's accepted the company 's apology , but ultimately he 's decided to switch over to Sprint and the EVO 4G anyway .
That 's to be expected , we suppose -- and we'd say next time Randall might do well to use up a few bytes of his 2GB limit and write back to a dissatisfied customer .

They are showing us the wrong leak !!!!!
This has been troubling me for several weeks now .
I knew there was something wrong with the live feed we were being shown by BP from the gulf oil spill .
I just could n't figure it out until now .
We all already know there were 3 leak points .
The main " hole " from the drilling rig , as well as 2 smaller leaks from pipes that led away from the drill hole .
Supposedly they have capped 1 of the 3 leaks .
The second and larger pipe leak they tried to cap with a cement building basically , which developed ice crystals from methane and had to be removed .
They did finally get a pipe into the larger pipe to siphon some oil off .
I posted about this Here .
Here is the link to the feed BP is showing us .
This is what I finally realized is wrong this morning .
Why there have been so many estimates on the amount leaking .
The are still showing the PIPE leak .
NOT the actual wellhead leak .
To prove it , here is a video from Yahoo of the feed from a couple weeks ago along with the attempt at dropping the dome onto the leak .
BP had said this was an attempt to cover the main leak , but look at it ....
It is obvious this is still the pipe and not the main riser .
There is NO drill column here .
They had just cemented it in place .
Where is it ?
This is a pipe running horizontally across the ocean floor .
They are not showing the oil coming from the vertical riser which is a much larger amount than we are seeing .... They have NEVER shown us the main leak .
Since they have begun to show the " top kill " video , they have shown parts of the main leak .
There was a very short clip of a scene behind a CNN anchor that was possibly it .
It looked a lot larger than what we have seen .
And the huge gusher there was I 'm sure an accidental showing ... It seemed that CNN had multiple views of a live feed from BP .
But were only showing us the one BP wanted us to see .
CNN obviously has inside information .
Either way , the single pipe they had been showing us is in no way the main leak .
Looking at the live feed now , what they are showing has way more equipment around it than what they showed .
And it was almost an immediate switch .
They finally switched the video to the correct spill , which we still really can't see .
Real Leak ?:OP edit to reflect more current information .
I first posted this before the top kill videos came out ....[ edit on 26 - 5 - 2010 by webpirate ]

Advertisement France 's players refused to train on Sunday following Nicolas Anelka 's expulsion from the squad for verbally abusing coach Raymond Domenech .
Domenech read out a statement from his squad which said : " The French Football Federation did not at any time try to protect the group .
" To show our opposition to the decision taken [ on Anelka ] , all the players decided not to take part in training . "
The French Football Federation 's managing director subsequently quit .
Moments before a public training session was about to begin , Domenech had to separate captain Patrice Evra and fitness coach Robert Duverne .
Duverne is understood to have stormed away from an argument with the Manchester United defender , throwing his accreditation badge to the ground .
The players then left the pitch and walked to their bus where they had a meeting with Domenech behind closed curtains .
Domenech ( right ) chose Anelka to start France 's first two games " I am disgusted , I am quitting my post , " FFF managing director Jean - Louis Valentin said immediately after the incident between Evra and Duverne , before driving off in his car .
" It 's a scandal for the French , for the federation and the French team .
" They do n't want to train .
It 's unacceptable .
As for me , it 's over .
I 'm leaving the federation .
I 'm sickened and disgusted . "
FFF vice - president Christian Teinturier said : " I confess that I understand nothing .
We 're in another world here .
French football is in a catastrophic situation . "
Later on Sunday , the federation distanced itself from what it called " the unacceptable behaviour of the players representing our country " .
French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot said President Nicolas Sarkozy had asked her to extend her stay in South Africa and that she would meet with Evra , Domenech and FFF chief Jean - Pierre Escalettes on Monday .
606 : DEBATE
Was it right to send Anelka home ?
100 % yes .
Sulky , arrogant , obnoxious , childish .
Although the English were awful against the Algerians , they put the effort in .
The French do not want to play for their manager .
Tomaniski " We are taking note of the indignation of the French people and ... calling for dignity and responsibility , " she told TFI television .
Asked whether there would be penalties for the fiasco , she said : " It 's not yet the right time to take disciplinary action but that time will come very soon . "
Earlier , Domenech had played down his row with Anelka and insisted the striker could have stayed with the squad had he apologised .
Anelka was sent home after insulting Domenech during the defeat by Mexico which has left France unlikely to qualify for the last 16 .
" I had another chat with him and left open the possibility for him to apologise , " said the 57 - year - old .
" [ That was ] something which he did not want to do . "
Read the France squad 's statement on their decision to boycott training But Domenech insisted the incident could have been dealt with without such damaging repercussions , had a leak to the media not escalated the problem .
" People cannot imagine the pressure , " said Domenech , who took France to the final of the last World Cup in 2006 .
" We are in a dressing room , the coach says something to a player who is already under pressure , he can react angrily , and with strong words .
" He did not react in the most suitable fashion .
But it was just a guy sitting in his corner and muttering - that would not have mattered had it stayed there .
" What was important was that it made the front page of a newspaper , and that exposes the internal life of the squad . "
He continued : " I sorted out the problem internally , and as far as I was concerned it was done and dusted .
" [ But ] the decision to exclude him was the right one .
I am sorry for the children for whom the French team represents something .
Anelka does not have the right to say such things . "
Duverne later denied he was the source of the dressing room leak , and explained his fall - out with Evra .
" He came to tell me that the players were not going to participate in training .
I was angry because we play a big game in two days and we have no right to destroy our last chance . "
Anelka's Chelsea team - mate John Terry , who is playing for England in South Africa , said he disagreed with the decision to send the former Arsenal and Real Madrid player home .
" As a person , you wo n't find a better man in football , " he said .
" It 's obviously the wrong decision .
He 's a great player as well . "
Domenech 's six - year stint as France coach ends at this World Cup and and he will be replaced by Bordeaux boss Laurent Blanc .
His last match in charge could be on Tuesday unless his team convincingly beat hosts South Africa in their final Group A encounter , and Uruguay and Mexico do not draw the other match .

Strategic ties between Jerusalem and Washington have been slowly changing since the conclusion of the Cold War , Mossad chief Meir Dagan told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday .
" Bit by bit , Israel is becoming less of a strategic asset for America , " Dagan said in his meeting with committee .
The Mossad chief indicated as well that the US views the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as a lower priority after determining that neither side is ready for an agreement .
According to Israel Radio , Dagan also surmised that the Iranian uranium fuel - swap deal brokered by Brazil and Turkey was designed to avert the sanctions proposal currently in front of the UN Security Counci l. Iran 's effort to avert sanctions was influenced by a lack of progress in the development of its centrifuge program the intelligence chief reported .
The Iranians " pulled a rabbit out of their hat to split the international community at the last moment , " Israel Radio quoted Dagan as saying .
Eindhoven University of Technology ( TU / ) researchers want to develop solar cells with an efficiency of over 65 percent by means of nanotechnology .
In Southern Europe and North Africa these new solar cells can generate a substantial portion of the European demand for electricity .
The Dutch government reserves EUR 1.2 million for the research .
The current thin - film solar cells ( type III / V ) have an efficiency that lies around 40 percent , but they are very expensive and can only be applied as solar panels on satellites .
By using mirror systems that focus one thousand times they can now also be deployed on earth in a cost - effective manner .
The TU / researchers expect that in ten years their nano - structured solar cells can attain an efficiency of more than 65 percent .
Jos Haverkort : " If the Netherlands wants to timely participate in a commercial exploitation of nanowire solar cells , there is a great urgency to get on board now . "
The research is conducted together with Philips MiPlaza .
They think that nanotechnology , in combination with the use of concentrated sunlight through mirror systems , has the potential to lead to the world 's most efficient solar cell system with a cost price lower than 50 cent per Watt peak .
In comparison : for the present generation of solar cells that cost price is 1.50 euro per Watt peak .
Stacking Nanowires make it possible to stack a number of subcells ( junctions ) .
In this process each subcell converts one color of sunlight optimally to electricity .
The highest yield reported until now in a nanowire solar cell is 8.4 percent .
Haverkort : " We expect that a protective shell around the nanowires is the critical step towards attaining the same efficiency with nanowire solar cells as with thin - film cells . "
Haverkort thinks that at 5 to 10 junctions he will arrive at an efficiency of 65 percent .
Scarcity of raw materials
In addition , the researchers expect considerable savings can be made on production costs , because nanowires grow on a cheap silicon substrate and also grow faster , which results in a lower cost of ownership of the growth equipment .
What is more , the combination of the mirror systems with nanotechnology will imply an acceptable use of the scarce and hence expensive metals gallium and indium .
An agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , will grant the EUR 1.2 million to researchers dr. Jos Haverkort , dr. Erik Bakkers en dr. ir .
Geert Verbong for their research into nanowire solar cells .
It is their expectation that , when combined with mirror systems , these solar cells can generate a sizeable portion of the European electricity demand in Southern Europe and North Africa .

Everyone that has an iPhone , an iPod Touch and a computer would want to use MobileMe , Apple ’s suite of web applications and services that includes email , contacts , photos and calendar web usage , and sharing .
The service also includes a virtual disk and services which allow you to locate and wipe a lost iPhone .
Apple charges an annual fee of $ 99 for the service and offers a 5 person family pack for $ 149 .
While the service is n’t extremely expensive , especially the family pack , it is a long way from what you pay for similar services from Google , which is to say nothing .
The main advantage of using Apple ’s service is its integration with iPhones , iPods and now iPads .
The built - in applications in these devices can automatically sync data to and from this service , just as PCs and Macs can .
This allows the users to keep all the email , contacts and calendar information in all their devices in sync .
This is the most enticing aspect of the service in my opinion .
Google ’s services , which are free for everyone , have this sort of integration with Android based devices , which makes these devices have this sync capabilities as default features , instead of optional ones .
As people use more devices such as iPhones , iPods and now iPads in addition to regular computers , keeping data in sync and always available becomes more and more important .
Having this service available for free can become an important advantage for devices running Google ’s Android platform .
From this point of view , offering a free service , at least for owners of compatible Apple devices , would make a lot of sense for Apple .
This would bolster the perceived value of the devices and help attract more users to the Mac platform as the online applications greatly resemble Apple ’s own native applications in Mac OS X .
This might encourage Windows users that become familiar with the service to opt for getting a Mac the next time that they have to buy a desktop or notebook computer .
Of course , running online services like MobileMe has a large cost associated , however considering Apple ’s margins on the products it sells and the potential to help sell even more of those devices , as well as the elimination of an advantage of Android over iPhone OS devices may well be worth it .
Just today MacDailyNews published a rumor that Apple might be considering doing just this , pending the availability of facilities .
There are certainly valid business reasons for Apple to offer the service for free , and it might just be that they will do so in the near future .
Doing so before anyone has the opportunity to bring to market an Android tablet device integrated with Google ’s services offer would go a long way to permanently removing or at least seriously downplaying one of the strong talking points for Android evangelists .
Apple should make the service available for free , at least for owners of iPhones , iPods and iPads , sooner rather than later .
Doing so as soon as possible will help the company more firmly establish it self as a major player in the online applications space .
If the service were available to all for free , just as Google offers its services , it might also serve to bring users who are not yet Apple customers into contact with the company and its products .
Another aspect of such a free offering is that it would truly bring Apple out of the online services sandbox in which it has been playing for the past decade , offering its service as add - on to Macs and iPhones .
This would allow Apple to aim for a piece of a market which is native ground for Google , just as Google moved in to step on Apple ’s turf when they decided to go into the phone business .
Apart from the cost of starting the operation , I see very little in the of drawbacks for Apple and a lot possible benefits .
Apple certainly has the capital available to shrug off the costs and the 1 Billion they ’ve invested in creating a major data center facility in North Carolina seems to indicate they plan to expand their on line services big time .
Is all this investment targeted at expanding the infrastructure for iTunes , AppStore and iBookstore , or could a sudden expansion of MobileMe be on the horizon ?

V minulých dnech a týdnech se v médiích objevila nevídaná záplava zpráv na téma pirátství , až má člověk pocit , že žije někde ve vodách Somálska .
Všechny byly bohužel typické účelovým šířením strachu , selekcí informací , překroucenými fakty a – jemně řečeno – nepravdami .
Noviny a zpravodajské servery přišly s neobvyklou sadou článků na stejné téma .
Zde je výčet , určitě najdete sami i další :
6. května , Novinky.cz : I za pouhé stahování z internetu hrozí trestní stíhání ,
6. května , Novinky.cz : Protipirátská unie chce víc bránit české filmy ,
7. května , Novinky.cz : BSA obdržela 3500 udání kvůli nelegálnímu softwaru ve firmách ,
7. května , ČTK : Policie zablokovala největší český web s pirátskými filmy ,
8. května , iDnes.cz : Policie dopadla šestnáctiletého piráta , nelegálně nabízel přes deset tisíc filmů .
10 . května , Novinky.cz : Šestnáctiletý majitel pirátského webu z Liberce je podezřelý z miliónových škod .
Do toho ještě e-mailem přišla další tisková zpráva u nás neexistující organizace BSA , jejíž mediální zástupce Jan Hlaváč sdělil , že „ Pirátského softwaru v Česku opět ubylo , nelegálně se ho užívá 37 % , “ ovšem záhady neopomenul dodat , že podle studie IDC přesto „ v důsledku přišli výrobci softwaru kvůli pirátství v Česku o tržby v hodnotě 3,6 miliardy korun “ .
Tyto studie mají nulovou váhu , nemají cenu ani toho papíru , na kterém jsou napsány .
Český mediální zástupce BSA možná kouzlům s čísly věří , každopádně žádné spolehlivé studie na toto témat neexistují – nejen analytici mnohokráte upozornili , že studie jsou připraveny na zakázku tak , aby odrazily předpoklady a závěry zadavatele , v tomto případě BSA .
O nadhodnocení čísel v minulosti hovořil i jeden z autorů těchto studií , viceprezident IDC John Gantz , který uvedl , že jsou nadhodnocena asi desetinásobně , že možná jen jedna z deseti pirátských kopií může znamenat jakousi finanční ztrátu .
A sám se brání používání slov jako „ ztráta “ .
Prezident americké Asociace spotřební elektroniky Gary Shapiro zase řekl , že předpoklady BSA a jejích studií majících ukazovat na negativní dopady na ekonomiku , nejsou správné .
„ Předpoklady [ o ztrátách spojených s kopírováním ] jsou klamné a problematiku zkreslují .
[ BSA ] pak tato překroucená čísla ukazuje Kongresu a snaží se zákonodárce přimět , aby ještě zpřísnili už tak tvrdý autorský zákon . “
Jan Hlaváč nás ubezpečil , že ve vodách Somálska žijeme , řekl totiž , že „ studie jasn ě ukazuje , že boj s piráty jednoznačně vyhráváme . “ ( Zdůraznění v tiskové zprávě . )
Nejen posádky ruských tanker ů se zase mohou cítit bezpečněji .
„ Snížení míry pirátství je důsledkem dobré policejní práce při vymáhání práva a pravidelné osvětové činnosti BSA , která se zaměřuje zejména na firmy , kde se daří dlouhodobě pirátství potírat . “
Takzvaná osvětová činnost zaměřená na firmy se nerovná ničemu jinému než rozesílání výhrůžných dopisů tisícovkám nic netušících firem , které s pirátstvím nemají a vůbec nemusí mít nic společného .
„ Pokud se nám neozvete , může se stát , že Vás budeme kontaktovat sami , “ vzkazuje BSA ústy Jana Hlaváče firmám .
Osvětu může takto šířit kdokoli , kdo má zájem .
Stačí si ve svém okolí vybrat nějaké společnosti – třeba konkurenční firmy nebo prostě náhodně zvolené – , a udat je , že používají nelegálně komerční software .
Bude - li se „ BSA “ – resp .
panu Hlaváčovi a týmu najatých právníků zastupujících v Česku BSA – na nich zdát opravdu něco podezřelého , na firmách pak bude , aby policii a následně soudu dokázaly , že pirátský software nepoužívají .
Jestliže se jim nepodaří jasně prokázat , jak software získaly a nepodloží - li svá tvrzení náležitými papíry , mají problém .
V USA jsou lidé k udávání motivování finančními částkami , které BSA vyplácí – u nás si však vystačíme s dobrým pocitem sousedovy chcíplé kozy .
Na serveru Novinky.cz ( opět ) Jan Hlaváč v minulosti varoval , že v bezpečí nejsou ani domácí uživatelé : BSA bude kontrolovat nelegální software i v domácnostech nebo Jan Hlaváč z BSA : nelegální software odhalíme , i když nejste připojeni k internetu .
„ Jan Hlaváč z protipirátské organizace BSA tvrdí , že nelegální software lze odhalit i na počítačích , které nejsou připojeny k internetu , “ stojí v perexu druhého zmíněného článku .
Samozřejm ě že na základě udání .
Že udaný člověk může být nevinný , je BSA a panu Hlaváčovi zcela jedno .
„ O vině rozhoduje soud , nikoli BSA , “ uvedl .
Mluvčí Hlaváč v nedávné tiskové zprávě ( viz například výše přepsaná zpráva na serveru Novinky.cz ) , oznámil , že výzvy BSA fungují .
Lidé se mstí rádi .
Za osm měsíců přišlo již 3 500 udání .
16letý pirát a nejhorší způsob kradení filmů podle TV Nova
Boj proti filmovému pirátství nese ovoce , zněl titulek první reportáž TV Nova v televizních novinách ze 7 . května .
2010 .
Ray Koranteng divákům oznámil , že ČPU ( Česká protipirátská unie , neplést s Českou plynárenskou unií ) „ uzavřela největ ší webovou stránku nabízející pirátské kopie filmů a seriálů “ a že 16letý hoch , který ji vedl , „ si svým pirátstvím vydělával desítky tisíc korun měsíčně . “
Jak to tak s informacemi na TV Nova bývá , jsou „ kapku “ nepřesné – web nebyl zdaleka největší a jeho provozovatel si nejspíše žádné desítky tisíc korun měsíčně vydělávat nemohl .
Podle všeho se jednalo o server Cinema - World.biz , který má nízk ý Google pagerank – 2 .
Denně měl návštěvnost v řádu tisíců lidí a videa nabízel k přehrání nebo stažení zdarma .
Jeho provozovatel si vydělával reklamou .
Tvrdí-li Nova , že jde reklamou z řádově tisíce zhlédnutí webu udělat řádově tisíc korun , pak očividně stojíme na prahu nového velice výkonného obchodního modelu .
Jako nejlogičtější vysvětlení se zdá , že hoch si desítky tisíc korun vydělal během celé doby provozu webu – což bylo něco kolem dvou let .
Ředitelka ČPU Markéta Prchalová tento případ podle Novy označila za největší úlovek za poslední roky .
Za pozornost stojí , jak reportáž odvyprávěl reportér Novy Michal Kratochvíl .
„ Filmové a televizní společnosti přicházely o miliony korun , peníze šly do kapsy někomu , kdo při výrobě nehnul ani prstem . “
V tu chvíli do kamery promluví Markéta Prchalová :
„ Byl to vlastně server , který online spouštěl filmy a měl i sekci na stahování filmů , “ a reportér TV Nova to komentuje slovy : „ co ž je jeden z nejhorších možných způsobů , jak krást filmy i naší televizi . “
Asi bychom našli horší způsoby , jak ukrást filmy .
Takové představy by zahrnovaly baseballové pálky a přepadené prodavače .
Trochu vážněji .
Televizi Nova bych doporučil zmírnit výroky o tom , kterak kdosi využívá cizích videosnímků bez hnutí prstu .
Nova ve svém vysílání neustále používá videa z YouTube s dovětkem „ zdroj : YouTube “ .
Bohužel je to totéž , co kdysi dělala tištěná média , která si myslela , že přebrané elektronické texty a snímky stačí ověnčit nálepkou „ zdroj : Internet “ .
Je to stejné , jakoby elektronická média bez zeptání přebírala články z novin s poznámkou „ zdroj : Papírové noviny . “
YouTube zakazuje přebírání a distribuci videomateriálu , navíc nevlastní autorská práva uživatelů .
O tom se YouTube zmiňuje například těmito slovy :
„ Nemůžeme vám ud ělit práva ke snímkům obrazovky nebo záznamu obsahu třetí strany .
Kvůli právům k těmto záznamům je třeba kontaktovat jednotlivé vlastníky obsahu .
Uživateli můžete zkusit zaslat e-mail pomocí svého účtu YouTube . “
Další perlu
Nova případu nasadila v tu chvíli , když se reportér snažil ukázat závratné ztráty , které kluk svým webem způsobil .
„ Mladíka teď čeká soud .
Kromě toho , že mu hrozí vězení , bude muset zaplatit škodu .
Vypočítat se dá různě .
Třeba jen poslední díl Harryho Pottera na webu zhlédlo 65 635 lidí .
Kdyby šli do kina , zaplatili by na vstupném přes 6,5 milionu . “
Ano , klíčová je věta , že škoda „ se dá vypočítat různě “ .
Našli bychom jistě i hloupější metody .
Ještě podstatnější je část „ Kdyby šli do kina “ .
„ Kdyby “ .
Jenže oni by tam možná nešli ani tak , a možná tam mnozí i byli .
Snahy vypočíst škody vždy ztroskotají na nesprávných předpokladech .
Jedinou spolehlivou metodu výpočtu ztrát bychom měli tehdy , pokud by podvodník prodával filmy nebo je promítal za srovnatelnou cenu jako oficiální distributor – kdyby tedy podvedl ty , co si dílo pořídili .
Srovnávat zhlédnutí filmu nabízeného zdarma s potenciální návštěvou kina může jen blázen .
Malý dodatek : Harry Potter byl za rok 2009 třetím nejnavšt ěvovan ějším filmem v českých kinech .
Přišlo na něj 684 247 lidí , čistá tržba činila 72 milionů korun .
A Harry Potter byl nejnavšt ěvovan ějším snímkem na celém světě , nehled ě na kopie na internetu .
Na konto si připsal 924,4 milionu amerických dolarů – 18,6 miliardy korun .
Nemíním obhajovat činnost zavřeného webu ani jeho provozovatele – mladík měl dokonce ignorovat varování a po zavření prvního serveru si otevřel další , za což teď ponese následky – , ale velký problém je v médiích , která z tuctové webové stránky udělala hlavní zprávu číslo jedna , jíž ještě okořenila o řadu nepravd a absurdních tvrzení .
Mimochodem , nakonec ten kluk firmám zábavního průmyslu ukázal , jak by mohl zčásti vypadat nový způsob distribuce filmů a seriálů .
Na něj se čeká asi deset let .
A jsem si i jist , že reportáž TV Nova inspirovala řadu lidí k hledání i zakládání podobných webů .
Zároveň se však obávám , že je pomálu oslavných text ů o policii a odhalených distributorech dětské pornografie , o lapení těch , kteří prodávají kopie filmů za peníze , ukrývají za servery v Rusku a jejích ž výdělky jsou v jiných sférách než tisícovka kluka z internetové reklamy .
Nějak nám stále dennodenně řádí spammeři a neslyšíme nic o chycených útočnících , kteří přišli k penězům phishingem .
Nemáme ani zprávy o těch , co kopírují platební karty .
Máme dramatické zprávy BSA .
A máme lapeného 16 letého kluka .
Exemplárně potrestat , veřejně lynčovat .
Třikrát hurá .

Using Python magic to improve the deferred API
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , deferred , app- engine , coding , celery
Recently , my attention was drawn , via a blog post to a Python task queue implementation called Celery .
The object of my interest was not so much Celery itself - though it does look both interesting and well written - but the syntax it uses for tasks .
While App Engine 's deferred library takes the ' higher level function ' approach - that is , you pass your function and its arguments to the ' defer ' function - I 've never been entirely happy with that approach .
Celery , in contrast , uses Python 's support for decorators ( one of my favorite language features ) to create what , in my view , is a much neater and more flexible interface .
While defining and calling a deferred function looks like this :
def my_task_func(some_arg ) : # do something defer( my_task_func , 123 )
Doing the same in Celery looks like this :
@task def my_task_func( some_arg ) : # do something my_task_func.delay ( 123 )
Using a decorator , Celery is able to modify the function it 's decorating such that you can now call it on the task queue using a much more intuitive syntax , with the function 's original calling convention preserved .
Let 's take a look at how this works , first , and then explore how we might make use of it in the deferred library .
Functions as objects in Python
In Python , everything is an object .
That includes everything from what other languages call ' primitive ' values like the number 3 , all the way up to and including things such as functions , classes , and modules .
This has many implications for the design of the language and what you can do with it .
You probably think of functions as things which you can only do one thing to - call them - but because every function in Python is also an object , that 's not the case : a Python function is simply a ' callable ' object .
We can explore the members of a function in Python using the dir ( ) builtin :
>>> def my_func( arg1 , arg2 =None ) : ... return arg2 or arg1 ... >>> type(my_func ) < type ' function '> >>> dir( my_func ) [ ' __call__ ' , ' __class__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __dict__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __get__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __module__ ' , ' __name__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __reduce_ex__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' func_closure ' , ' func_code ' , ' func_defaults ' , ' func_dict ' , ' func_doc ' , ' func_globals ' , ' func_name ' ]
As you can see , my_func is an instance of type ' function ' , and it has a number of members , including __call__ , the special method that makes an object callable .
It also includes a bunch of standard members , such as __hash__ , __class__ , and so forth , and a few function - specific ones , which we 'll come back to later .
Celery takes advantage of this by modifying the function , adding a new member called ' delay ' .
You can modify functions in this way just by setting the member as you would anything else :
>>> my_func.foo = ' bar ' >>> my_func.foo ' bar '
Based on this , we could define a decorator for the deferred library trivially :
def task ( func ) : task .
defer = lambda *args , ** kwargs : defer ( func , * args , ** kwargs ) return task
And indeed , this will work exactly as expected , allowing us to call my_func.defer ( args ) instead of defer( my_func , args ) .
There 's a couple of missed opportunities , however .
First up , you can call this new function with any set of arguments , and it will happily try and defer a call to the function with those arguments .
If you passed an invalid set of arguments - for example , passing 4 arguments to a function that expects only 3 - you wo n't know about it until your task runs , and fails , making tracking down the culprit a lot harder .
There are a couple of solutions for this .
One is to use inspect.getargspec to retrieve the argument specification from the original function , and check it against the passed in arguments .
This will impose some additional overhead , however , and require us to write our own argument checking code , which will be difficult to test for correctness .
The second approach is slightly kludgier , but provides a better result : Dynamically create a new function and evaluate it using eval ( ) .
The function we create can have the same argument specification as the original function , and call our more permissive function as its sole activity .
Fortunately , someone 's already done this for us , in the form of the decorator library .
With the decorator library , our new signature - preserving defer decorator looks like this :
def task ( func ) : func.defer = decorator ( defer , func )
Not only is it signature preserving , but it 's even simpler !
Note we did n't have to define a function at all : the decorator function expects its first argument to be a function with the signature func(f , * args , ** kwargs ) , which is exactly the signature of the existing deferred .
defer function .
Given the decorator function and the function being decorated , decorator returns the decorated function , which we add as the ' defer ' method of the original function , instead of replacing it .
The second feature I 'd like to take advantage of is the ability to provide arguments to the task queue service , such as ETA and task name , both at definition time and at runtime .
The existing defer function handles this using reserved , underscore - prefixed arguments for these parameters , but this seems less than ideal .
If we follow the pattern used by Celery , the former is easy to achieve : we can have our ' task ' decorator take arguments , which will serve as defaults for anything that calls ' defer ' on the decorated function .
This only handles specification at definition - time , though , and we'd like to be able to specify them when we call our deferred function , too .
We 've got several , possibly conflicting , goals here :
Make basic invocation as simple as possible .
myfunc.defer( some_args ) should continue to work as expected .
Make it possible to specify arguments for the task queue at runtime , without modifying the signature of the function we 're deferring a call to .
Make it possible to bulk - add deferred tasks , rather than having them implicitly added individually , without complicating the interface for goals 1 and 2 .
Satisfying all of these may be a tall order .
I 'm actually not entirely certain what the best way to handle this will be , yet .
Currently , I think the best option may be this :
Define a ' DeferredTaskTemplate ' abstract class that encapsulates the arguments to be used in creating a deferred task .
Instances of the class are immutable .
The class has a method called something like ' with ' or ' options ' , which when called with task queue options returns a new instance of itself with those options modified .
Have the task decorator create a new subclass of DeferredTaskTemplate with the __call_ method defined using the decorator trick we discussed above .
When called , it returns the taskqueue .
Task object for the new deferred task , after optionally enqueueing it .
Add another keyword argument to the with / options method , ' add ' , which causes the class to not enqueue the task if it 's set to True .
With a framework such as that , the calling conventions look like this :
# Regular call my_func( a , b) # Standard deferred call my_func.defer(a , b) # Deferred call with task name and countdown my_func.defer.with(name='foo ' , countdown=60 ) ( a) # Deferred calls using batch interface : tasks = [ my_func.defer.with( add=False ) ( x ) for x in l ] taskqueue .
Queue ( ' test ') .add ( tasks ) # Shortcut for commonly used options gone_in_60s = my_func.defer.with(countdown=60 ) gone_in_60s ( a , b)
This seems like a reasonable interface to me .
What do you think ?
Do you have any ideas on how to improve the interface further ?

This week we learned that one member of the Bank ’s Monetary Committee wanted to put up interest rates last month .
Mr Sentance was rightly concerned that inflation remains well above target , and dares to question the Bank ’s orthodoxy that because there is such a large amount of spare capacity around that there should be no price increases to worry about .
This site has been querying the whereabouts of all this spare capacity , and pointing to the inflationary threat , for many months .
Although Mr Sentance predictably lost his skirmish this month , he did some good .
he reminded markets that the next move - whenever it is - in UK interest rates will be up .
Coming in the same week that the government announced a substantial move towards lower borrowing , this was sufficient to put the pound up a bit more against the dollar , on top of its recent rise against the Euro .
Much of the current inflation has come from the big fall in the pound in the year or so prior to the Election .
A rise in the pound will soon relieve inflationary pressures on imported commodities , raw materials and finished goods , and will likely be visible to us all at the petrol pumps .
Today the Bank decided to warn us all that banks are still weak thanks to the weakness of the Euro area in general and the threats to government bonds in particular .
Their remedy is yet more cash and capital to be held by the banks .
That is code for saying they want the banks to lend even less to the private sector , at a time when credit is already too scarce .
Think again , Bank .
We need counter cyclical regulation of the banks .
This is somewhere near the low of the cycle .
That means allowing banks to lend more , not forcing them to lend less .
The main banks have stronger balance sheets than in 2007 - 9 , balance sheets strong enough to allow some more lending .
UK banks are not too exposed to Greek debt .
Behind the scenes the Bank should be working with other European authorities to ensure no EU state does renege on its debts .
The Regulators made the commercial banks buy loads of state bonds .
They should now help ensure the banks are not damaged by doing as they were told to do .
It 's time to end chemical trade secrets
It 's time to end the chemical secrecy
( Natural News )
After weeks of silence on the issue , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) finally decided to go public with the list of ingredients used to manufacture , the chemical dispersant used by BP in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster .
There are two things about this announcement that deserve our attention :
First , the ingredients that have been disclosed are extremely toxic , and second , why did the EPA protect the oil industry 's " trade secrets " for so long by refusing to disclose these ingredients until now ?
As reported in the New York Times , Brian Turnbaugh , a policy analyst atsaid , " EPA had the authority to act all along ; its decision to now disclose the ingredients demonstrates this .
Yet it took a public outcry and weeks of complaints for the agency to act and place the public 's interest ahead of corporate interests .
"
On the toxicity question , you could hardly find a more dangerous combination of poisons to dump into the Gulf of Mexico than what has been revealed in Corexit .
The Corexit 9527 product has been designated a " chronic and acute health hazard " by the EPA .
It is made with , a highly toxic chemical that has long been linked to the health problems of cleanup crews who worked on thespill .
A newer Corexit recipe dubbed the " 9500 formula " contains , a detergent chemical that 's also found in laxatives .
What do you suppose happens to the marine ecosystem when fish and sea turtles ingest this chemical through their gills and skin ?
And just as importantly , what do you think happens to the human beings who are working around this chemical , breathing in its fumes and touching it with their skin ?
The answers are currently unknown , which is exactly why it is so inexcusable that Nalco and the oil industry giants would for so long refuse to disclose the chemical ingredients they 're dumping into the Gulf of Mexico in huge quantities ( over a million gallons dumped into the ocean to date ) .
But it gets even more interesting when you look at just how widespread this " chemical secrecy " is across Big Business in the USA ... and how the U.S. government more often than not conspires with industry to keep these chemicals a secret .
Armed with the accomplices in the FDA , EPA , FTC and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , powerful corporations have been keeping secrets from us all .
It 's not just the toxic chemicals in Corexit , either : Large manufacturers of consumers products -- such as Unilever , Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson ---- ingredients which are usually kept secret from the public .
Similarly , virtually every perfume , cologne and fragrance product on the market is made withthat their manufacturers refuse to disclose , claiming their formulas are " trade secrets .
" Throughout Big Business in America , the toxic chemicals used in everyday products such as household cleaners , cosmetics and yard care remain a dangerous secret , and the U.S. government actually colludes with industry to keep these chemical ingredients a secret by , for example , refusing to require full disclosure of ingredients for personal care products .
The FDA offers us virtually no enforcement in this area , depending almost entirely on companies to declare their own chemicals are safe rather than requiring actual safety testing to be conducted .
This is why the following statement is frightening yet true : .
We are all beingby the toxic chemicals in personal care products , foods , medicines , fragrance products and other concoctions created by powerful corporations that use toxic chemicals throughout their product lines ... but who refuse to disclose those ingredients in the public .
Thanks to the widespread use of secret chemicals in foods , medicines and personal care products , we arethat have already reached the shores of public health .
The rates of cancer , Alzheimer 's , diabetes and infertility that we 're seeing right now are a reflection of the devastating health cost associated with ongoing the ongoing chemical contamination of our population .
Even public water fluoridation policies are a kind of " water contamination disaster " where chemicals from an undisclosed source are dumped into the water supply ( on purpose , no less ! ) .
What 's doubly disturbing about all this is that many of the chemicals used in foods , medicines , household cleaners and personal care products end up in the Gulf of Mexico as well because they get flushed down stream .
So now the Gulf is n't just polluted with crude oil and dispersant chemicals ; it 's also heavily contaminated with all the chemical runoff from the products made by large corporations that refuse to disclose the actual chemical ingredients , claiming they 're trade secrets .
As this Gulf of Mexico oil disaster clearly demonstrates , it 's time to end the chemical secrecy maintained by Big Business .
We must demand thatso that the curtain of chemical secrecy is lifted once a for all .
Neither oil companies nor consumer product companies should be able to hide behind the excuse of " trade secrets " to avoid disclosing the actual chemicals contained in the products they sell .
As consumers , we must demandfrom these companies or refuse to buy their products .
Legislatively , we must demand new laws that requireon all consumer products so that ordinary people can see what 's contained in the products they buy .
In a world where one person 's chemical runoff impacts every other person , there is no justification for chemical secrecy .
We all have the right to know what we 're putting on ( or in ) our bodies , and if companies refuse to be honest with us , we should boycott their products and publicly shame them for engaging in deceptive , secretive behavior .
Because the truth is that consumer product companies do n't dare want you to know what 's actually found in their products .
And that 's because most of their products are .
If the average perfume product listed its chemical ingredients on the label , for example , product sales would plummet as consumers realized just how many of those ingredients are linked to cancer and liver disorders .
Big Business wants us all to remain ignorant ... blinded to the truth of what poisons they 're slathering on our skin or dripping down our throats .
But it 's time to halt this dark era of chemical secrets in our modern world .
It 's time to demand transparency , clean up our waterways and stop poisoning ourselves and our planet .
ELON MUSK is not , to paraphrase James Watson 's bon mot about Francis Crick , a man given to modest moods .
Today , though , he might be forgiven a little hubris .
The co-founder of PayPal , and developer of the Tesla , the first modern electric sports car , has long wanted to get into the space business as well .
Now he has .
The launch on June 4th of a Falcon 9 rocket , built by his company SpaceX , from Cape Canaveral , in Florida , is a turning point in the development of private space flight .
Though the industry 's coming of age is still some way in the future , this launch marks , if you like , its transition from childhood to adolescence .
Other rockets of this class , such as Boeing 's Delta IV and the Atlas V , operated jointly by Boeing and Lockheed Martin , are children of the military - industrial complex .
Though built by private firms , they are the result of taxpayer - financed programmes , often on a “ cost - plus ” basis , that only superficially resemble anything which a real entrepreneur would recognise as free - market capitalism .
By contrast SpaceX , though subsequently buoyed up by a $ 1.6 billion contract with NASA , America 's space agency , to fly missions to the international space station , had to raise the initial development money itself — much of it from Mr Musk 's back pocket .
The important point about Falcon 9 , so called because its lift - off is propelled by nine of SpaceX 's proprietary Merlin rocket motors , is that it is powerful enough to put people into orbit .
Other private space companies are either restricted to launching small , unmanned satellites ( Orbital Sciences Corporation 's Pegasus , for example ) , or — in the case of Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic — hope to take tourists on suborbital hops of the sort that NASA gave up almost 50 years ago and the Russians never bothered with in the first place .
SpaceX has gone for the jugular .
Though it will take many more launches and a lot of inspections before the system can be “ man-rated ” , as the jargon has it , prototypes of manned space capsules are already lying around in SpaceX 's factory in Hawthorne , California .
Just in time , too .
For America 's current manned system , the government - owned space - shuttle fleet , is about to be withdrawn from service .
The last shuttle flight is pencilled in for November .
After that , American astronauts who wish to visit the space station ( largely an American - financed project , despite its “ international ” soubriquet ) will be reduced to hitching lifts on Russian rockets .
If Falcon 9 does , indeed , manage to get man-rated , they may be spared that indignity .
Those astronauts that are there will , in any case , be able to have their groceries delivered by Falcon 9 .
The question of man-rating does not affect its ability to take supplies to the station .
The vehicle itself is a two - stage affair .
The heavy lifting is done by the nine - engine cluster , fuelled by kerosene and liquid oxygen .
That burns for three minutes , before being jettisoned .
The payload , a capsule known as Dragon , is then carried into orbit by a single - Merlin - engined second stage that burns for a further six minutes .
The unmanned version of that capsule is designed to accommodate six tonnes of goodies for the inmates of the space station , or could be replaced by a heavy satellite , if that is what the client wants .
The heavy - satellite - launching market is quite crowded already , though , what with Atlas , Delta , the “ European ” ( in reality , almost exclusively French ) Ariane and Russia 's Proton .
So Mr Musk 's real bet is on the ultimate man-worthiness of the system .
That will not only open up the taxi - to - the - space - station market , but will also allow him to tout for tourist business .

Who knows , a little competition might even bring the price down from something that is out of this world , to a level that is merely stratospheric .
In her testimony during her confirmation for solicitor general , she wrote : “ I wrote that I was frustrated by what I called Justice Ginsburg ’s ‘ pincer movement ’ — the tendency to say that questions were either too specific or too general to be able to answer , with little ground in between .
Even at the time I wrote the review , I agreed with Justice Ginsburg that a judicial nominee should not forecast how she would decide a particular case ; the question that seemed different to me , as noted above , was whether a nominee could answer questions about ‘ judicial methodology , ’ ‘ prior case law , ’ ‘ hypothetical cases ’ and ‘ general issues . ’
I think I made clear in the review that I would have done the same thing as Justice Ginsburg given prevailing conventions and standards .
( I asked in the review , ‘ Who would have done anything different ? ’)
The question I raised in the review was whether those conventions and standards were correct .
As noted in my answer above , my views on this question have evolved in some ways , but I continue to think the question well worth exploring . ”
Social networking service Twitter has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers and put their privacy at risk by failing to safeguard their personal information , marking the 30th case the FTC has brought targeting faulty data security , and the agency ’s first such case against a social networking service .
The FTC ’s complaint against Twitter charges that serious lapses in the company ’s data security allowed hackers to obtain administrative control of Twitter , including access to tweets that consumers had designated private , and the ability to send out phony tweets pretending to be from then - President - elect Barack Obama and Fox News , among others .
The privacy policy posted on Twitter ’s website stated that “ Twitter is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information .
We employ administrative , physical , and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access . ”
According to the FTC ’s complaint , between January and May 2009 , hackers who gained administrative control of Twitter were able to view nonpublic user information , gain access to direct messages and protected tweets , and reset any user ’s password and send authorized tweets from any user account .
According to the FTC ’s complaint , Twitter was vulnerable to these attacks because it failed to take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized administrative control of its system , including :
Requiring employees to use hard - to - guess administrative passwords that are not used for other programs , websites , or networks
Prohibiting employees from storing administrative passwords in plain text within their personal e-mail accounts
Suspending or disabling administrative passwords after a reasonable number of unsuccessful login attempts
Providing an administrative login webpage that is made known only to authorized persons and is separate from the login page for users
Enforcing periodic changes of administrative passwords by , for example , setting them to expire every 90 days
Restricting access to administrative controls to employees whose jobs required it ; and
Imposing other reasonable restrictions on administrative access , such as by restricting access to specified IP addresses .
Under the terms of the settlement , Twitter will be barred for 20 years from misleading consumers about the extent to which it maintains and protects the security , privacy , and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information , including the measures it takes to prevent authorized access to information and honor the privacy choices made by consumers .
The company also must establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program , which will be assessed by a third party every other year for 10 years .
UPDATED 5:21 p.m. EST : Police say failed NYC car bomber may be white male in his 40s , allegedly caught on tape
UPDATED 2:58 p.m. EST : Pakistan denies claim
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told ABC ’s Jake Tapper this morning that authorities had not found any evidence that the bomb scare in New York City on Saturday May 1 was part of a larger plot .

“ We have no evidence right now that this is anything other than a one off , ” said Napolitano .
The federal government is treating the incident in Times Square as a potential terrorist attack .
The FBI is also reportedly involved in the investigation .
The Economist and other news outlets are reporting a Taliban - affiliated bomb maker has claimed credit for the attempt .
According to The Long War Journal , Qari Hussain Meh , a member of the Pakistani Taliban is behind the scare .
Qari Hussain made the claim on an audiotape accompanied by images that was released on a YouTube website that calls itself the Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan News Channel .

The tape has yet to be verified , but US intelligence officials contacted by The Long War Journal believe it is legitimate .
The Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan News Channel on YouTube was created on April 30 .
Officials believe it was created to announce the Times Square attack , and Qari HussainÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s statement was pre-recorded .
An image from the YouTube site is below .

Pakistan was quick to deny the claim .
“ There is no credible way to prove that the Taliban have this kind of capacity to attempt such an attack in the heart of the United States , ” a Pakistani intelligence told CBS News on condition of anonymity .
“ A claim is far easier to make than to be carried out in real life , ” he added .

According to an article about clues by CNN , inside the Nissan Pathfinder , police found “ gas cans and bomb - making materials , ” Mayor Michael Bloomberg said .
Investigators removed three propane tanks , two filled five - gallon gasoline containers , two clocks with batteries , consumer - grade fireworks , and a locked metal box that resembled a gun locker .
WCBS TV reports that the NYPD is still checking surveillance tapes .

“ We ’re in the process of identifying additional cameras which may have captured images of the vehicle and more important , people seen driving or leaving the vehicle , ” said NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly .
Reuters spoke to a security expert who pointed to similarities between the attempted attack in Times Square and another in London in 2007 .
The London attack “ included a vehicle abandoned in a crowded area with the intent of causing mass casualties , ” said Sajjan Gohel , director for international security at the London - based research company Asia Pacific Foundation .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Was this done by an established group or , as in the London case , by self - radicalized people ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Gohel said , adding security camera footage could be the key .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Are the investigators in the U.S. able to quickly develop a logistical trail ?

To understand the news involving Israeli nuclear - armed subs off Iran , I recommend an important post by Jerome Slater on his blog about a crazy / chilling paper from a former high Israeli security adviser now at Harvard , named Chuck Freilich .
Read the whole original post–which includes a link to Freilich ’s paper–then ask yourself what in heaven ’s name this guy is doing at Harvard ?
And how many other brains in Israeli command are as deluded as he is ?
( It suggests again how little Americans know about rightwing trends in Israeli society . )
In my excerpt from Slater , note once again the utter refusal by this Israeli strangelove to reckon with the Palestinian issue as anything that Israel has to deal with .
No , Israel has endless Arab enemies .
Also note Slater ’s view that our Israel policy is not just a strategic liability , no , it ’s making us a nuke target .
Excerpt , with my emphases
[ T ]he latest , and surely the craziest employment of the rationality - of - irrationality strategy of nuclear deterrence : Chuck Freilich ’s thirty - four page study and recommendations for Israeli policy , “ The Armageddon Scenario : Israel and the Threat of Nuclear Terrorism . ”
Freilich ’s core argument is that Israel must enhance its deterrence against nuclear terrorism by adopting a policy under which it will initiate nuclear attacks against any state or non-state group that has a “ declared nuclear terrorist capability , a stated intention to acquire one , or an advanced suspected one . ”
While Freilich does not refer to [ Thomas Schelling ’s ] rationality - of - irrationality theory [ act so crazy that your enemies will fear you might actually nuke them ] , that is clearly the logic of his argument .
Does he actually mean what he seems to be saying : that Israel should not merely retaliate against a state or terrorist group that attacks it with nuclear weapons , but should completely destroy , in advance , any unfriendly state or group that declares it has the intention of acquiring nuclear weapons , or is merely suspected of having such an intention ? ”
Yes .
To be sure , there are all sorts of crackpot theories and arguments , particularly concerning the use of nuclear weapons , but most of them are unlikely to actually influence state policies .
However , Freilich ’s arguments are more ominous , since he is at very heart of the Israeli government - military - academic establishment : a former Deputy National Security Adviser to the Israeli government and an Israeli delegate to the UN , now a Senior Fellow at Harvard ’s Belfer Center and a professor of political science at Hebrew and Tel Aviv universities .
The “ Armageddon Scenario ” was published by Bar - Ilan University ’s Center for National Security Studies , a rightwing thinktank that is known to be highly influential within the Netanyahu government .
Here is Freilich ’s argument .
Israel ( and the United States ) faces a grave threat of nuclear terrorism , not only from a nuclear Iran , but perhaps “ one which may be no less likely and actually far more difficult to counter [ because ] …. those most likely to pursue nuclear terrorism may be fundamentally nihilistic and thus undeterrable … [ they ] may be prepared to pay any cost in lives – their own and others ’ – in pursuit of their goal of destroying Israel . ”
Moreover , because al - Qaeda can blend in with the population and perhaps clandestinely set off a nuclear weapon in an Israeli or American city , there may be “ no return address , ” as he puts it , for retaliation .
The problem is real : Osama Bin Laden is known to be seeking nuclear weapons –which could be acquired by theft , loss of control over nuclear arsenals , or clandestine transfer or sales of nuclear weapons by North Korea or Pakistan– and he has openly threatened to use them against Israel and the United States .
Freilich is hardly the first analyst to have noticed the problem , despite his modest claim to be “ the first to examine the nature of the nuclear threat Israel faces and to propose potential responses to it . ”
However , the nature of his proposed responses is certainly original .
To begin , Freilich argues that the nuclear terrorism problem cannot be solved by political or diplomatic means and he has no criticism — not a word –of Israeli policies and behavior towards the Palestinians ; rather , the underlying premise of his argument is that the Israeli occupation and increasingly harsh repression of the Palestinians have nothing to do with the hatred it has engendered in the Arab / Muslim world .
For those who find this premise to be preposterous the only solution can be a negotiated settlement with the Palestinians and the Arab world as a whole , precisely what has been offered to Israel by the Arab world since 2002 .
Freilich not only rejects such a course , he argues — and this is also certainly original — that a settlement of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict would actually increase the threats to Israel : “ Peace in the Middle East , although desirable , unfortunately will not provide for true reconciliation … .
For the radicals who will never accept Israel , a peace agreement will further increase their determination to try and restore ‘ Arab rights ’ by all means possible … .
A Palestinian state might create a sanctuary for terrorist organizations , which could use its territory , with or without its knowledge and cooperation , to develop and deploy a nuclear bomb on Israel ’s borders and near major population centers .
… The more Israel is accepted in the region and establishes peaceful relations with Arab states , the more the radicals will be determined to find new ways of achieving their goals . ”
To meet this problem , Freilich concludes , Israel must adopt a new and more far reaching deterrence policy : “ If the source of a terrorist nuclear attack against Israel is unknown , or if it is known to originate with al - Qaeda or Iran , Israel should make it clear that its response will be unlimited and include not just major population centers , but all sites of value , including those of major symbolic importance … such as Muslim cultural and religious sites . ”
But even such draconic threats might not be sufficient , Freilich fears , to dissuade terrorist attacks .
Therefore , Israel must go beyond deterrence and adopt a policy of preventive war : …
There is indeed a threat of nuclear terrorism against Israel and the United States — to this country , to a substantial degree , precisely because of its near - unconditional support of Israel .
The best way to defuse this threat would be a negotiated and fair settlement of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
To be sure , while it is ( shall we say ) far - fetched to argue that such a settlement would increase the terrorist threat , it must be conceded that it might not eliminate it altogether : the conflict has gone on for so long , and with such terrible consequences for the Palestinian people , that the bitterness and hatred it has engendered in the Islamic world might continue for some time .
There could not be a better moment for this novel .
Doctor
Who has never been bigger , and a whole new generation has just experienced the phenomenon of regeneration , where one Doctor changes into another .
When David Tennant made way for Matt Smith in the role , the last words he cried out echoed the feelings of millions of fans : " I do n't want to go ! "
The genius of Paul Magrs 's book is the way it uses this notion of regeneration as a metaphor for adolescence : a time when your whole life changes , a new body grows around you , and you have no idea who you may be becoming – just that all familiar certainties are gone for ever .
The story is set in 1981 , when Tom Baker gave way to Peter Davison ( below ) as the Doctor .
Its protagonist is an obsessive fan called David who is on the verge of becoming a teenager , and is terrified at the prospect .
He 's happy with his childhood in working - class north - east England , and does n't want anything to change .
He takes comfort in the weekly ritual of watching Doctor Who ( or The Show , as true fans call it ) .
He and his best friend , Robert , have always shared their love for The Show , but now Robert seems more interested in chasing girls , listening to goth music and , most threatening of all , dismissing The Show as childish rubbish .
Magrs 's take on early adolescence is very sharp and beautifully nuanced .
Almost every page contains some seemingly offhand observation that rings true , from the cringing embarrassment of boys ' changing rooms to the way the tiniest details of popular culture can become matters of life or death , fiercely personal and political .
This is backed up by a fully realised pop-cultural landscape that encompasses not only television but music , books , comics . . . even chocolate bars .
It might be wondered whether all this period detail would mean anything to a teenager today – but it is n't retro reference - dropping for its own sake .
Rather , Magrs treats the details as if writing a historical novel or science fiction : using them to build a picture of a world , and show what matters to the people in it .
The reader may or may not know the distinction between " Laughing Gnome " David Bowie and " Ziggy Stardust " or " experimental Berlin " David Bowie – but will surely recognise the crushing humiliation of being seen to like the wrong things , of being less cool than the people around you appear to be .
There is sexual politics , too , as David comes to realise that he is gay , or at least not attracted to girls .
There are some similarities here with Jacqueline Wilson 's standard - setting Kiss , as well as with Magrs 's own Strange Boy .
But in this respect , the book seems more preoccupied with what David is not than with what he is , and perhaps thereby misses opportunities for narrative development .
It should also be said that although the writing is deeply thoughtful and textured , it 's not exactly action - packed .
There are plot strands that go nowhere , and an epistolary section that is essentially a collection of sketches .
Yet the emotional dynamics keep it moving towards a conclusion that is both uplifting and convincing .
The discovery that there are people in the world whom David might hope to become – people who have not lost everything that made childhood magical , while confidently inhabiting the new bodies and aspirations of adulthood – is something anyone can take heart from , whatever their situation .
And this sense that change may be survivable after all makes this not just a book for Doctor Who addicts , but for everyone interested in the transformations that come with growing up .

The 1st of July will be a day that will shake the basketball world as we know it .
Former franchise poster - boys will be testing the waters in search of the right team that can bring them the most fame , fortune and rings on their fingers .
The crown jewel of the 2010 free agents is none other than The King ; LeBron James .
Where will his future destination be ?
Now forget the rumor mill .
Putting all speculation and bruits aside , yours truly will be weighing LeBron options based on concrete tangible facts not assumptions .
Currently LeBron ’s top legitimate candidates to landing him are ; Cleveland , Chicago , New York and New Jersey .
However , there are dark horses that can woo James to join their organization for 2010 .
Cleveland has been the home for LeBron James for virtually his entire life .
Growing up in the city of Akron , Ohio LeBron is the adored home - town boy that runs the city .
The Cavs are a team that has shown growth over his tenure but sadly have shown the inability to play successful playoff basketball .
For this reason I think LeBron wants to look elsewhere for a team that can keep him in the NBA Playoffs deep into mid June .
As grateful as LBJ is I feel he is looking for a new chapter in his basketball career in a new destination .
In the Windy City , the winning allure is fast returning as the Chicago Blackhawks recently just won the Stanley Cup .
Across the street from the Mad House in Madison ( Blackhawks Arena ) , the United Center is where the youthful and improving Bulls play their games .
With a strong core already the Bulls can court LeBron and another maximum level player to join their team , attractive ?
LeBron seems to think so .
However , Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf is known as quite a stingy owner and was even called a “ cheapskate ” by Time Magazine in 1995 .
After winning six titles in the 90’s Reinsdorf broke up the personnel from those teams including Michael Jordan and Phil Jackson .
This is surely a concern of LeBron ’s .
If Reinsdorf was hesitant to spend on keeping MJ and basketballs best coach , how will he treat LeBron James in the future ?
Another deterrent of LeBron going to Chicago is that copper statue outside the arena and those 6 NBA Championship banners hanging in the rafters … .
New York is my personal preference for The King .
He is vocal about being an athlete billionaire and winning titles .
There is no better place to do it than in New York .
Being the global marketing capital and Mecca of basketball , NY will give LeBron unlimited business opportunities to fulfill .
LeBron is already being offered a TV network if he signs with the Knickerbockers and is set to meet with entrepreneur and music mogul Diddy to discuss business ventures if he signs .
World renown Iron Chef Mario Battali told LeBron that if he joins the Knicks he will cook meals for him once a week for 20 of his closest friends .
A group of stars in New York have also formed to attract LeBron to the city including ; Spike Lee , Diddy , Alec Baldwin and Howard Stern amongst others .
You think the money and star treatment is attractive ?
LeBron definitely has his eyes on New York .
Under new billionaire ownership and a promising team New Jersey can make a fair run at Mr. James .
With a good nucleus of young players and an opportunity to seek 2 max players the Nets are a contender .
Newark , NJ is n’t the most aesthetically pleasing city in the world but billionaire owner Mikhail Prokhorov and Jay Z are moving the team to Brooklyn .
However the team is n’t positioned to win yet and playing in Madison Square Garden is no more than an hour away so this can affect LeBron ’s decision .
My two sleepers to make an admirable run at LeBron James are the Clippers and the Mavericks .
Both teams have the salary room to ink a premier level player and both teams have very solid teams already .
The LA Clippers are historically a dreadful team , but they do have the 3rd biggest market in the NBA .
LA is a great city to play in and this is a team that LeBron could make his own and create an identity .
A starting lineup with Baron Davis , Eric Gordon , James , Blake Griffin and All Star Chris Kaman would make them as good as anybody .
The appeal of LeBron constructing a legacy in Los Angeles is there , its whether or not he wishes to pursue it .
Dallas is interesting as well .
For one thing the organization has an owner that is willing to give everything up for winning .
Mark Cuban is willing to spend , spend and spend some more to keep LeBron happy .
The possible trio of LBJ , Jason Kidd and Dirk Nowitzki with additional complementary pieces is a team that can compete for the title .
James and Jason Kidd are known to have a close relationship with each other and Kidd will be used as a recruitment tool by the Mavs .
Additional food for thought would be playing twenty home games a year in the majestic Dallas Cowboys Stadium and the fact that there is no state income - tax in the “ Lone Star State ” … more pocket change for LeBron .
The reason why I do n’t consider Miami as a first tear contender is because LeBron is an alpha player in the NBA .
He wants to be the main figure in the spotlight and the man to lead his team to victory .
If he goes south to Miami he will potentially share the limelight with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh .
D- Wade runs the city of Miami and if LeBron steps in he cannot expect to be the consensus # 1 basketball figure .
To see James and Wade ( possibly Bosh ) play together would be nothing short of palpable and every night would be the best show on earth .
However , to have 2 or 3 players that demand that ball in clutch moments of the game would n’t make sense from a team perspective .
We all know LeBron wants to win but he can win elsewhere and be the complete focal point not only on the court , but in the city .
BUT if LeBron is willing to throw away records , recognition and ” hes - the - greatest - ever ” debates about himself than he can form a dynasty with Wade and possibly Bosh that would change the complexity of the NBA forever .
Where do you think his destination will be ?

Today is a day that you will probably tell your grandchildren about – the day they released the first affordable , pocket - sized fuel cell for personal usage .
As with flying cars , personal jet packs and a usable voice recognition computer interface , the promise of a safe , affordable , personal power plant was entering the realm of perpetual vaporware .
Now it 's finally here !
Whatsmore , at US $ 100 , the Horizon MiniPak might well prove to be the “ disruptive ” technology the press release claims it to be .
By producing electricity from hydrogen at the point of use and offering effectively unlimited run-time for personal electronics , it will almost certainly be the public 's first experience of the coming Hydrogen Economy .
It 's the first fuel cell product to compete on cost with both disposable and rechargeable batteries with just one refillable cartridge supplying as much power over its life as 1000 disposable AA alkaline batteries .
Completing the fairytale sustainability pitch , it 's also 100 % recyclable , uses no heavy metals and there are no toxic liquids involved .
Specifically designed for portable consumer electronics , the MiniPak offers unlimited portable power for your cellphone , smartphone or personal media device .
At higher production levels , prices are expected to drop to US $ 30 , with fuel cartridge prices eventually comparable with disposable alkaline batteries , and refilling costs of just a few cents .
Yep , this IS an important date in technology history because run-time will soon cease to be a limiting factor to productivity , connectivity , and lifestyle - enhancing electrically - powered everything such as flashlights , wireless speaker systems , personal mosquito repellents and GPS devices .
While Horizon 's personal fuel cell is not the first such device , it is certainly the first affordable and readily available personal power plant .
Toshiba has had such a device on the market in Japan for around six months .
The Toshiba Dynario weighs 280 grams , measures 15 cm x 2.1 cm x 7.45 cm and can produce enough power in 20 seconds to charge two mobile phones .
The power is stored in in - built lithium ion batteries and costs around US $ 275 with the 50ml cartridges at US $ 30 a pop – far more expensive to buy and run than the MiniPak .
The MiniPak delivers 1.5 to 2W of continuous power using a standard USB port , and uses refillable fuel cartridges with up to 12 Wh of energy .
It is designed to extend the charge of small portable electronics .
Although the Minipak ’s capability is limited to small devices , it is effectively a miniature - scale power plant that produces electricity directly from hydrogen at the point of use .
The MiniPak uses a combination of Horizon ’s mass - produced PEM fuel cells and a new low - cost metal hydride storage solution , which is able to store hydrogen safely as a dry , non-toxic and non-pressurized material .
The fuel cartridge contains a metallic sponge that is able to absorb hydrogen and turn it into a solid hydride .
It is then able to release it back to the fuel cell when needed .
The PEM fuel cell combines oxygen from the air with the stored hydrogen - electricity via its USB port and trace amounts of water vapor .
Similar to a pocket - size distributed energy system , it avoids the energy losses that occur between the power plant and the battery operated devices that we charge from powerpoints .
Cumulatively , these losses are massive .
There are roughly 10,000 power plants in the US with an average thermal efficiency of 33 % , and transmission losses of around 5 - 10 % .
When it comes to portable electronics , the US Environmental Protection Agency estimated that in 2004 in the US alone , there were 2.5 billion AC to DC power adapters consuming 207 billion kWh per year or up to 6 % of the US $ 247 billion national electric bill .
It is further estimated that 6 to 10 billion similar devices are presently in use worldwide , operating at an energy efficiency of around 50 % .
Whereas the MiniPak is not applicable to all AC to DC powered devices , it can indeed participate in reducing billions of dollars of wasted energy costs .
Besides contributing to overall efficiency , Horizon ’s new micro-fuel cell system offers numerous environmental benefits .
Just one of its Hydrostik fuel cartridges can deliver the same amount of power over its lifetime as over 1000 disposable alkaline AA batteries , while storing more energy at a lower cost .
In addition , the cartridges do not contain any toxic materials and can be completely recycled , using conventional methods .
“ Over the past 4 years , Horizon has brought to market several award - winning products to retail environments in over 60 countries around the world .
As these were primarily toys , few have realized the implications of these first products .
They have in fact enabled Horizon to become the world ’s largest volume producer of micro- fuel cells , and placed the company in a prime position to begin mass - commercialization into other new markets , including portable electronics .
Our global market experience and mass - production are already in place , and with costs competitive to disposable batteries , Horizon ’s refillable fuel cell products shift the paradigm ” , noted Taras Wankewycz , Founder and Chief Marketing Officer .
The MiniPak is Horizon ’s first portable fuel cell product to enter the market , while several others are currently under joint development with various large - scale global market leaders .
Horizon is also scaling up the size of the solutions , since they offer the promise of storing renewable energy in larger quantities with no self - discharge and at a lower cost than batteries , therefore opening a path towards independent , distributed energy in homes , businesses and other industrial applications .
Russia began shutting off gas supplies to its neighbor Belarus on Monday , in an energy dispute with familiar political undertones .
Experts say the dispute is unlikely to affect downstream customers in Europe – which depends on Russia for more than a quarter of its gas – as previous spats with Russia 's neighbor Ukraine have frequently done .
Belarussian pipelines carry just 20 percent of Russian exports to Europe and demand is much lower now due to warm summer temperatures .
But the shutdown does reflect ongoing Russian willingness to use energy as a tool of foreign policy , experts say .
Moscow has reportedly been losing patience with Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko , who talks a strong pro-Russian game but actually pursues an independent course that increasingly conflicts with the Kremlin 's wishes .
In recent months , Mr. Lukashenko has dug in his heels against joining a Belarus - Kazakhstan - Russia customs union being championed by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , has demanded duty - free Russian oil as the price of further cooperation , and has given refuge to ousted Kyrgyzstan leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev , some say against the Kremlin 's wishes .
" This gas cutoff is just another stage of the general crisis of relations between Russia and Belarus , and in particular Lukashenko's refusal to sign the customs union agreement with Putin , " says Yaroslav Romanchuk , an analyst with Strategia , one of the few independent political think tanks in the Belarussian capital of Minsk .
" There will soon be a presidential election campaign in Belarus , and it seems like Putin and [ Russian President Dmitry ]
Medvedev have given up all hope of coming to terms with Lukashenko . "
On Monday , Mr. Medvedev ordered the Kremlin - run gas monopoly , Gazprom , to slash gas deliveries by 15 percent each day until the amount reaches 85 percent of Russian supplies to Belarus 's state - run economy , or an amount equal to the $ 192 - million debt claimed by Moscow .
Lukashenko at first offered to cover the debt with farm products and machinery , a suggestion that was rejected out of hand by Medvedev .
" Gazprom cannot take pies , butter , cheese , or pancakes or any other form of payment [ except cash ] .
Our Belarusian partners must understand this , " Medvedev said .
By late Monday , Belarus ' deputy prime minister Vladimir Semashko said the country would try to pay the debt within two weeks , even if it has to borrow the money .
But Gazprom indicated that it would keep up the pressure , and re-route European gas supplies through Ukrainian pipelines for the duration of the dispute .
Analysts say the Ukrainian example clearly illustrates how the Kremlin uses gas to coerce its neighbors .
While pro-Western former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko was in charge , Russia and Ukraine went through repeated annual " gas wars , " and Russia jacked up Ukraine 's energy prices to the same rates paid by Western European customers .
But since a Moscow - friendly leader , Viktor Yanukovich , was elected in February , Russia has made a series of sweetheart deals with Kiev , including granting a 30 percent discount on gas prices in return for Russia 's continued use of a naval base on the Crimean peninsula .
" Russia found it easy to lower Ukraine 's gas bill , once it saw political reasons to do so , " says Alexei Makarkin , deputy director of the independent Center of Political Technologies in Moscow .
" This dispute with Belarus is all about negotiations over the customs union project , and other political issues .
Moscow has not been happy with Lukashenko's flirting with the West , or his refusal to grant diplomatic recognition to [ the Russian - sponsored Georgian breakaway statelets of ] South Ossetia and Abkhazia , " he says .
Lukashenko , a former collective farm director who has often been slammed as " Europe 's last dictator , " was freely elected in 1994 but has since held on to power by suppressing opposition and allegedly rigging elections .
He recently told journalists that he will run for a fourth term of office , in polls to be held early next year .

“ APOSTATE ” Mohamed Nazim has been taken into custody and threatened with death in the Muslim - majority north Asian nation of Maldives after declaring his atheism at a lecture given by lunatic Islamic hate - preacher Dr Zakir Naik , who is soon due to tour the UK .
Courageous Nazim – who was in a crowd of thousands – told Naik :
I am a Maldivian .
I am still struggling to believe in religion .
That is why I just came to the front of this row .
I was born a Maldivian .
My parents taught me the religion of Islam .
They are good practitioners , actually .
I read a lot of books .
I have read the translation of Quran .
Yet , I still do not believe in a religion .
So what do you say , [ about ] my verdict in Islam ?
According to prophetic traditions , every child is born as a Muslim and that a Muslim is one who submits his / her will to God .
In Islam , death penalty should not necessarily be evoked on every person who leaves Islam , but to those who propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam .
Naik responded :
Naik asked : “ Are you a Muslim ? ” Â and Nazim replied “ I am not . ”
According to this report , the brief exchange sparked hatred from an angry crowd of around 11,000 , with many calling for his death .
Several people rushed towards him as an official of the Islamic Ministry tried to escort him out .
Police , however , came between Nazim and the crowd and took him into custody .
The newspaper report also stated that a crowed gathered outside the police station and demanded that Nazim be handed over to the crowd , who shouted anti-atheism slogans and called for Nazim ’s beheading .
The Maldives media are reporting that it is the first time in many hundreds of years that a Maldivian has publicly renounced Islam , since Sultan King Hassan IX converted to Christianity in 1552 and was deposed .
The Maldives constitution mandates that all citizens of Maldives must be Muslims .
Â A December 2009 study showed the Maldives ( with a 99 percent literacy rate ) to be in the top five percent of the worst nations for religious freedom abuse .
It is a nation that has been building its criminal law based on sharia , andits Parliament bans non-Islamic houses of worship .
There have been repeated reports on Maldives government publicly whipping of women and the Maldives is in the bottom rankings of nations with a global gender gap .
The Maldives is also a nation that , on May 13 , 2010 , was elected to be part of the United Nations Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) .
Defence lawyer Mohamed Ibrahim
Waheed called for councelling for Nazim , saying he should be given the chance to “ repent ” before capital punishment is considered .
First , he should be counselled .
If he does not take the advice and repent , the penalty stated in Shari ’a should be evoked on him .
According to Shari’a , the punishment for apostasy is death .
Waheed further argued that Nazim could be charged under the Religious Unity Act , for disrupting the religious unity of the country .
A state prosecutor who wished to remain anonymous said Nazim could be prosecuted for legal disobedience .
Meanwhile , The Islamic Foundation has called for the self - declared apostate to be stripped of his citizenship and sentenced to death if he does not repent and return to Islam .
It issued a press statement calling on judges to give Nazim the opportunity to repent .
If he does not , then sentence him to death as Islamic law and Maldivian law agreeâ€¦ .
The Islamic Foundation believes that the person who announces apostasy should be punished according to Islamic laws .
It warned that Nazim represented :
A disturbance to the religious views and the religious bonds that exist with Maldivians .
Zakir Naik , has a long history of calling for violence against those who choose their universal human right of freedom of conscience and leave Islam .
Â Â
He has repeatedly called for denying human beings their universal human rights of freedom of conscience , calling those who leave Islam as “ traitors . ”
Â The London Times has quoted Zakir Naik as stating that :
People who change their religion should face the death penalty â€ ¦If Â a Muslim becomes a non-Muslim and propagates his / her new religion , then it is as good as treason .
Â
There is a â€˜death penalty ’ in Islam for such a person .
Â
In many countries , the punishment for treason is also death .
If an army general discloses his army ’s secrets to another country , then there is a â€˜death penalty ’ or life imprisonment for such a person according to the laws of most of the countries .

You know , I 'm tired of hearing about how the Mars Exploration Rovers are so cute , and spunky , but their successor Mars Science Lab is big and ugly .
MSL is n't supposed to be cute , it 's supposed to be awesome .
Just how awesome , you ask ?
I 'll tell you how awesome .
For starters it 's huge : 7 feet tall and almost 2000 pounds .
The instrument package on the end of its 8 - foot arm is about the same size as the 1997 Mars Pathfinder rover .
In fact it 's so big that the famous airbag landing system used by Pathfinder and both MERs just wo n't work .
There just are n't airbags strong enough to cushion the impact of such a big rover .
And besides , MSL has class .
It 's not going to arrive on Mars huddled and asleep , cocooned in wussy airbags .
No , MSL is going to arrive in style : on a jetpack That 's right .
After its heatshield ( the largest ever flown to another planet ) withstands a fiery entry and is discarded , and its parachute ( 50 feet across and deployed at twice the speed of sound ) slows MSL down , our action hero will cut the shrouds and fire up a jetpack .
The rockets will fire , bringing MSL within a few meters of the surface .
And then , as if all that was not impressive enough , MSL will rappel down from the hovering platform , touch the surface , and cut the cords with explosive bolts .
It will then smooth the creases in its tuxedo , adjust its tie and order a martini .
Ok , I made up the part about the tuxedo and the martini .
But really , its an entrance that would make James Bond jealous .
And not only is it a really cool way to land , it is extremely precise , so MSL will be able to access some of the most interesting places on the planet .
And just like Bond , MSL has some sweet gadgets .
First , there are the cameras .
Unlike the MER cameras , these will be true - color , high - definition cameras .
In addition to the two mast cameras ( one of which is zoomed in enough to make out details just three inches across at 1 km away ) , MSL will have a hand - lens camera , used for studying details of the surface much smaller than a human hair .
The hand lens will also be able to focus out to infinity , and could be used to take snapshots of otherwise inaccessible places , like the underside of the rover .
( This would have come in handy for Spirit !)
There will also be a video camera pointing down to capture MSL 's heroic skycrane landing .
That camera may also work during the mission , recording the changing surface features as MSL roves across the surface .
Impressive though the cameras are , the real heart of MSL are its analytical instruments .
First of these is the huge organic chemistry lab , SAM , which contains a mass spectrometer to break apart and weigh molecules of martian material , a gas chromatograph to separate the molecules based on their chemical properties , and a tunable laser spectrometer to sense the faintest traces of molecules like methane in the martian atmosphere .
Mars has puzzled scientists for a long time because previous missions have been unable to detect any organic molecules , even those that would be expected from comet and asteroid impacts .
With SAM , MSL will be able to solve that mystery .
That 's nice , but a real action hero needs more .
Say , perhaps , x-ray vision ?
MSL will carry the CheMin instrument , which peers into the detailed structure of crystals by shining x-rays through them .
This is extremely important because it will allow MSL to uniquely identify minerals on Mars .
All previous missions have been able to measure the elements in rocks and soils , but lacked the x-ray view provided by CheMin which reveals how those elements are put together .
MSL does even better than x-ray vision though .
It can also see neutrons .
In particular , scattered neutrons .
The DAN instrument sends pulses of neutrons into the soil , where they scatter off of atoms up to several feet down .
Lighter atoms scatter neutrons better , which means that hydrogen ( and therefore water ) are the brightest things MSL will see with its " neutron vision " .
As you might imagine , for a mission in search of evidence of a habitable Mars , being able to estimate the amount of water in the soil will be very valuable .
And of course , just because it has x-ray and neutron " vision " does n't mean MSL does n't want the elemental info too .
That 's why it carries two instruments for measuring the atoms in a target .
The first is a classic .
Just like Bond 's signature Walther PPK , every Mars rover comes armed with an Alpha - Particle X - Ray Spectrometer .
This instrument bombards the target with alpha particles , causing the individual atoms to give off x-rays revealing their identities .
MSL carries a new and improved APXS , capable of estimating the major elements in about 15 minutes .
Still , for an action hero 15 minutes is a long time .
I 've never seen James Bond sitting around for 15 minutes waiting for an accurate elemental abundance estimate , have you ?
No , a true action hero would carry a tool that delivered the info instantly , and preferably involved a laser .
That 's why MSL has a laser .
No , I 'm not making this up .
The ChemCam instrument is a high - powered infrared pulse laser , capable of vaporizing bits of rock up to 7 meters away .
MSL will use a telescope and spectrometer to collect the light given off by the laser plasma to determine what the target is made of .
Even better , ChemCam is sensitive even to light elements like hydrogen and carbon that APXS can't see .
But wait , there 's more !
Since it involves a big telescope , ChemCam will also be able to take microscopic images of the targets hit by the laser .
Oh , and did I mention that MSL is nuclear powered ?
No sissy solar panels for this rover !
Instead , MSL harnesses the heat given off by a lump of plutonium to get reliable , long - lasting power .
MSL laughs in the face of dust storms !
Now , do n't get me wrong , I have nothing against the MERs .
And they are darn cute .
But MSL is a jetpack - flying , laser - toting , plutonium - driven league of its own .
It is an action hero , armed to the teeth with gadgets to help it uncover Mars ' secrets and send them back to Earth .
Now , I 'd love to keep blogging about MSL , but I need to get on the phone with Hollywood and pitch a movie idea .
The trailer could go something like this :
In a world where rain has n't fallen in billions of years ...( pan across windswept martian dunes )
At a time when questions outnumber answers ...( cut to orbital view of dry riverbeds )
One robot will change our view of the Red Planet . ( closeup of the Mars Science Laboratory rover ) ( cue awesome rock 'n roll soundtrack and action montage )
There ’s been plenty of discussion lately about how print magazines have been swinging big and missing big on the iPad , how their attempts at translating the value of their printed pages into apps have been ill - advised or clumsy .
Venture capitalist Fred Wilson sums it up best , I think , in a recent blog post in which he declares that he prefers content in a browser rather than in an app , and I tend to agree .
However , I think it ’s worth pointing out that one publication , at least , has gotten it right : Time Warner ’s Entertainment Weekly has a terrific app called EW ’s Must List .
Unexpectedly , it ’s a user experience winner .
It may never achieve recognition for bringing penetrating content to the app space , but in my mind it nails precisely what a print brand needs to do in order to win a share of the attention market on this platform .
A Little Goes a Long Way
Actually , EW ’s app can hardly be credited with swinging big , but therein lies the genius .
The app makes no pretenses at bringing the full breadth of the printed magazine ’s content to the iPad .
Instead , EW ’s designers have made the bold and savvy choice to bring users very little — as much as makes for a great user experience , and no more .
Once a week , the app pulls down ten short pieces of content , a ‘ must - see list ’ of samplings from essential pop culture currency including movies , television , music videos , books , music , etc .
The splash screen is a beautifully designed menu of these ten items , arranged in a cleverly constructed grid that is completely unchanging from week to week , yet still manages to be visually surprising .
Hats off to the EW visual design team for creating a smart template framework in which standardization and variety co-exist harmoniously .
It looks sharp .
Tap on any item , and you drill down to the article level , with a bit more written content ( though not much ) , accompanied by big visuals and friendly , unambiguously clickable buttons that help you to read , watch , listen , buy , download etc .
If you had n’t already gotten the idea from the splash screen , clicking through to the article gives you the entire concept of the app : it ’s a very simple list of ten interesting things , with links to finding out more about them .
The whole thing is so logical , so intuitive that I ’ve found myself perusing through these articles and their links for fifteen or twenty minutes at a time without even realizing it .
Notice too , that the app is devoid of explanatory interface text .
While there are of course labels accompanying buttons and icons , completely absent is the regrettable tendency of print magazine apps to use non-functional captions to explain what their app interfaces do or how to use them — instead of just designing intuitive interfaces and affordances to begin with .
Just as the presence of such text in other apps is a clear flag that those interfaces are poorly conceived if not broken , the absence of such text here calls subtly powerful attention to the fact that this app is well - designed .
Of course , it must have been easy for EW ’s designers to make so many of the right design choices here because at its core EW ’s Must List is not just a good design but also a well conceived one .
The app is a shining example of the less is more credo , yes , but it ’s also a rare case study where product design intelligence wins out over the editorial prerogative , wins out over that tendency on the part of content creators to “ get it all in there because we made it ” and not because it ’s truly needed .
The core idea at work here evinces a perceptive , efficient , even ruthless focus on delivering what users really want , thereby creating a clear , simple case for the usefulness of the content .
It ’s a huge win that this app entirely omits the printed magazine ’s full table of contents , special features highlighting their prized columnists , elaborate video extras complementing their feature stories , charts , slide shows , or any of their blogs .
( Shockingly , there ’s not even a link to subscribe to the printed magazine . )
All of these things make sense ( to some degree or other ) at EW.com , but their absence makes this app all the better .

I am a fly on the wall sitting at a table .
Seated at a round table are three state governors , one state senator , a Harvard professor and author , and a strange little man who assumes the role of group moderator .
The strange little man asks the group to talk about their experiences at the education conference .
The ex governor from the South begins to talk about how the traditional school model is not working and the problem of too many teachers who do not understand what they teach .
Teachers , he complains , are not prepared to teach in 21st century classrooms because they possess , in his words , " only 20th century skills . "
He does not provide specific examples or elaborate upon his theory but the other guests at the table nod their heads in agreement .
A governor from the Midwest first pays homage to the governor from the South .
He tells us that his " good friend " is " right on target " about teachers not prepared to teach in 21st century classrooms .
The governor from the Midwest thanks the governor from the South for presenting " the best talk at the conference . "
Not to be undone , the governor from the South responds by telling the governor from the Midwest that he " presented the best talk at the conference . "
When both men are done patting each other 's backs , the Midwest governor complains that teachers , particularly math teachers , do n't know their subject materials .
Again , the other guests at the table nod their heads in agreement .
All is civil .
The third governor hails from a cold northern state but his words have a scorching tone .
" The problem with schools , " he says , " is a lack of accountability .
Schools need to be guided by specific core curriculum standards and data - driven assessment . "
The governor continues his diatribe .
" I do n't understand why schools are not managed more like businesses . "
This time the guests nod their heads vigorously , not unlike those small bobble head dolls seen on car dashboards .
The next education expert to speak is the professor from Harvard .
He gives a mini lesson about the role of chaos theory in education .
His new order of thinking - or New Age way of thinking - argues that seemingly unrelated events occurring in the classroom ( the boy coughing , the girl raising her hand , and the teacher writing on the board ) when taken together form a pattern of continuity and purpose rather than chaotic or random events .
The 21st century teacher must be able to recognize these events as purposeful moments in time and space because education is connected to the rest of the universe .
Wow .
I will forever wonder if I did something to upset a time and space continuum the next time I admonish a student for not covering his mouth while coughing .
Teachers do recognize that order and disorder exist in classrooms and that educating children is often an uncertain endeavor , but we do not have time to reflect on such esoteric thoughts when breaking up a spit ball fight .
The strange little man tries to fuse all the promulgated ideas together and asks the group to consider the following question : " Where do we take education from here ? "
The state senator from the West is asked to go first .
She is a diminutive lady and pauses to reflect upon the question .
" I think we need to consider the role of teachers in the classroom , " she replies in a soft voice .
" We are headed toward a teacherless classroom and must be guided by this fact . "
A teacherless classroom ?
I look around the table and hope one of the esteemed guests will ask her to clarify or possibly expand upon her statement .
Instead , the guests just nod their heads in agreement .
The strange little man interrupts .
" I agree .
Technology is making the traditional classroom teacher less relevant - possibly obsolete .
Soon students will be learning at home from online classes on their laptops . "
I silently question who will be teaching the online classes .
The senator continues her line of reasoning , asserting how the rapid infusion of technology in classrooms is better understood by students than teachers .
Teachers are best suited to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge through interactive technology rather than try to teach ideas and concepts using traditional methods .
A Brave New World suddenly enters the discussion and the senator 's vision of a utopian classroom is greeted with comments such as " indeed " and " without question . "
The Harvard professor tugs at his chin with his right thumb and index finger and compliments the senator .
" In the future , " he says , " students will be learning at home using their computers .
School buildings and classrooms will not be the primary learning environment . "
Really ?
Could any sane person envision millions of school children staying home and learning a full curriculum online ?
I foresee a stay - at - home mom or dad spending most of the day trying to keep their children away from Facebook .
The senator from the West is very pleased that her comment about technology replacing teachers is embraced by the people seated at the table .
So far I have not been asked to speak or comment .
I remain a fly on the wall at the table .
How weird and familiar it feels to be an invisible teacher listening to politicians and academics speak about teachers and the teaching profession .
I try not to move lest they notice me .
The governor from the South changes the direction of the conversation and boasts about how he personally raised test scores in his state by challenging the " status quo of education . "
He forgot to mention that he lowered the passing grades for state assessment tests - a status quo practiced by quite a few states .
The strange little man grabs a large strawberry from a fruit dish and gnaws at it .
I have never seen a person eat a strawberry with two hands .
" I think we all agree that changes are needed , " he declares to the group .
" That 's why we are here , " the senator replied .
The politicians and academics enjoy a dessert of pastries and fruit .
I can't keep my eyes off the strange little man nibbling on the strawberry like some backyard squirrel .
The group discusses the need to drastically modify classroom management and teaching practices .
They talk about curricula and how children learn best when they are provided meaningful activities .
We are reminded by the governor from the South that teachers must be proficient in content knowledge .
Once again the strange little man grabs the reigns of the discussion and now alerts the group of my presence .
He deposits the strawberry 's calyx on a plate .
I am no longer a fly on the wall at a table as the others look upon me .
" What do you think ? " the senator asked .
Where do I begin ?
I spent the last thirty minutes listening to a group of arrogant and condescending non educators disrespect my colleagues and profession .
I listened to a group of disingenuous people whose own self - interests guide their policies rather than the interests of children .
I listened to a cabal of people who sit on national education committees that will have a profound impact on classroom teaching practices .
And I heard nothing of value .
" I'm thinking about the current health care debate , " I said .
" And I am wondering if I will be asked to sit on a national committee charged with the task of creating a core curriculum of medical procedures to be used in hospital emergency rooms . "
The strange little man cocks his head and , suddenly , the fly on the wall has everyone 's attention .
" I realize that most people would think I am unqualified to sit on such a committee because I am not a doctor , I have never worked in an emergency room , and I have never treated a single patient .
So what ?
Today I have listened to people who are not teachers , have never worked in a classroom , and have never taught a single student tell me how to teach . "
An uneasy silence cloaks the table .
The governor from the South looks at his watch , the governor from the North bows his head , the governor from the Midwest stirs his coffee , the diminutive senator stares at me , and the strange little man grabs another strawberry .
One by one the lunch guests leave the table .
I return to being a fly on a wall at a table .
I wonder how many other teachers have been treated in such a manner .

England fans who associate World Cups with false dawns and heartbreak should spare a thought for the Spanish .
For a country that has given us two of the most celebrated club sides in the game 's history and a roll call of stellar players , Spain 's record in the global showpiece is nothing short of woeful .
Fourth place in 1950 is their best showing in 16 tournaments , with most of their other campaigns ending in humiliation , misfortune , or abject failure .
However , South Africa 2010 promises to be a very different story .
Victory at Euro 2008 ended a 44 - year wait for an international trophy and was followed by a World Cup qualifying campaign in which Vicente del Bosque 's side won all 10 of their games , culminating in a 5 - 2 away victory over their nearest rivals Bosnia - Hercegovina .
Spain have won 45 , and lost only one , of their last 48 games .
A team at the peak of their powers , they underlined their status as World Cup favourites with an effortless 6 - 0 demolition of Poland in their final warm - up game on Tuesday .
So what is it about this Spanish team that makes them rise to the big occasion where their predecessors foundered ?
What factors can explain the seismic change that has taken place ?
Many football observers suggest Spain 's transformation from a perennial underachiever to a ruthless winning machine is largely explained by the emergence of a golden generation of players , drawn heavily from Barcelona 's ranks .
As former Barca and England striker Gary Lineker asks : " How many sides could survive the loss of Fernando Torres ?
Only one : Spain .
Because they have got David Villa .
" They 've also got Cesc Fabregas , who could play behind the strikers and does n't get a regular game because they 've got Xavi and Andres Iniesta in midfield . "
Others point to the strength of the Spanish domestic league , or argue that playing in the Premier League has given some of the squad members vital experience of a more physical kind of football .
But often overlooked are the seeds sown by the Spanish Football Federation over the last 15 years , which are now bearing fruit .
Pedro Calvo , who coached Liverpool striker Torres at the Atletico Madrid academy , believes Spain 's current prowess owes much to the federation 's long - term commitment to a nationwide programme for the training of coaches .
According to European football 's governing body Uefa , Spain had almost 15,000 Uefa A and Pro Licence coaches in 2008 - more than double the number of any other European nation .
And that is despite it taking 750 study hours to acquire a Pro Licence in Spain , compared with just 245 in England .
We have moved on from the time when nobody knew what the characteristics of Spanish football were .
Now , it 's good to say that Spanish football is here
Fernando Hierro
" The federation has really focused on getting people qualified and to the level where they can go to other countries and coach , " says Calvo .
" It 's not just in professional football , it runs right through the system .
You have to have the same qualification to work in schools as you do to work in the top division .
" We are really starting to see the effects in the last few years . "
Unlike the turbulent world of England 's Football Association , Spain 's FA is a model of stability , with president Angel Maria Villar about to begin his 23rd year at the helm .
Not only are there more qualified coaches in Spain than in England , they are all promoting exactly the same style of football - the highly technical , possession - based game that has taken Barcelona to the summit of European football , made Spain 's youth teams the envy of the world and allowed the national side to end nearly half a century of failure in Vienna two years ago .
Indeed , the senior team 's victory at Euro 2008 was not an isolated success .
Since 1998 , Spanish youth teams from under - 16 to under - 21 level have won 19 Uefa and Fifa championships .
During this same period , England have won just one - the U17s European Championship last month when they beat Spain in the final .
UEFA A & PRO COACHES SPAIN --------------------
14,860 GERMANY
----------------
6,570 FRANCE
-------------------
2,588 ITALY
-----------------------
1,810 NETH'NDS

1,137 ENGLAND

1,010 Former Spain and Real Madrid captain Fernando Hierro , who was made the federation 's technical director in 2007 , said recently : " We have moved on from the time when nobody knew what the characteristics of Spanish football were .
" Before , we all knew about Italian football , English football , German , Argentine , Brazilian .
Now , it 's good to say that Spanish football is here . "
The importance of the structures put in place by the Spanish federation was recognised in Uefa 's technical review of Euro 2008 , drawn up by a panel including Fulham manager Roy Hodgson and former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier .
" For years , Spanish youth football has carried the same , recognisable hallmark , " the report read .
" And , after years of watering the roots , the plant has matured and blossomed . "
International success has been matched by domestic triumphs , with Spain 's top - flight La Liga surpassing Italy 's Serie A and the Premier League to be rated by many as the world 's strongest .
Barcelona are the reigning World Club champions , and the league 's strength in depth is illustrated by the fact that Spanish teams have won the Uefa Cup / Europa League four times in the last seven seasons .
Not one English , Italian or German side has claimed the trophy during that period .
606 : DEBATE
Spain 's second XI would give England a run for their money , and I reckon only Ashley Cole would command a place in Spain 's team
Tom Mansell
But while the nucleus of Spain 's team play their football at home , six members of Del Bosque 's 23 - man squad , including Fabregas , Torres and Pepe Reina , either play , or have played , in England .
Rodolfo Borrell , who coached Fabregas and Lionel Messi at the Barcelona academy before joining Liverpool 's youth set - up in 2009 , says the experience gained amid the rough and tumble of the Premier League has added crucial ingredients to the mix .
" Aggression , tackling , passion and heart are all a lot bigger in England than in Spain , " he says .
" The football is more competitive than other leagues .
This is making our national team stronger . "
If the Premier League has improved the physical strength of Spain 's players , it is a new - found mental toughness that has allowed them to exorcise the ghosts of World Cups past , says Spanish football expert Phil Ball .
He believes previous Spanish squads were hampered by frailties rooted in the national psyche and bore mental scars from the 1982 tournament , when as host nation they won just once in five games , suffered a 1 - 0 loss to Northern Ireland , and crashed out in the second round .
" Little by little , Spain have shed the inferiority complex they have always had towards northern European sides , " explains Ball , the author of ' Morbo : the History of Spanish Football ' .
" Under ( former Spanish dictator ) Franco , Spain were seen as the poor man of Europe , a bit backward politically until the 1970s .
" When Spain opened up after the transition into democracy , it got a World Cup in 1982 and made a fool of itself .
It had that chance to show the world that it was n't inferior and it mucked it up . "
Ball , who has lived and worked in the northern city of San Sebastian for 20 years , says Spain 's footballers may have been inspired by national success stories in other sports .
" You 've got the likes of Fernando Alonso in Formula 1 and Rafael Nadal in tennis .
People are seeing these Spaniards going out and doing the business .
They 've got that tough winning mentality . "
According to Calvo , much of the credit for Spain 's psychological transformation must go to Luis Aragones , the outspoken coach who led them to Euro 2008 glory before making way for former Real Madrid manager Del Bosque .
" Before , we were a good team , we would always cruise through the group stages , but when we got to the important stages , like the quarter - finals , we seemed to have a breakdown , we did n't believe that we could do it , " he says .
" Aragones made them believe .
He knew how to prepare them for the really big games . "
Among many who are tipping Spain to win the World Cup is Lineker .
The BBC frontman , who was England 's top scorer at the 1986 and 1990 tournaments , says the Spanish now boast a depth of talent that makes them the envy of most other sides at this year 's event .
" There is quality right the way through their squad - they have even got the best group of goalkeepers in world football and most of the best players in the world , " he said .
" They will take some beating in South Africa . "
Yet for those who wonder how Spain finally changed from wobblers into winners , the message is clear : the glory has been a long time in the making .

PHILADELPHIA
— The most riveting , nail - biting , and story - laden playoff series in the past several years of professional sports had the misfortune of reaching its amazing overtime finish in the sport of hockey Wednesday night , as the Blackhawks defeated the Flyers to win the NHL 's championship series 4 - 2 .
" To see a team that was 14th out of 15 teams in its conference a few months ago not only make the playoffs , but advance to the final by coming back from three games down , was really a shame , " said ESPN 's Bill Simmons , who spent the evening preparing for Thursday 's Lakers - Celtics game and did not watch the hockey finals .
" And when the barnstorming Chicago team hoisted that trophy , ending its championship drought with an overtime win on the road , I felt sick to my stomach that it was n't the Cubs and the World Series trophy . "
The NHL playoffs also saw Montreal goalie Jaroslav Halak stop 131 of 134 scoring attempts over three games in a superhuman defensive effort that was tragically not put forth by the Baltimore Ravens .

A working holiday visa for Japan will allow you to holiday in Japan for up to a year .
You will be allowed to work to fund your holiday ( for example by teaching English ) .
But of course you do n’t have to work if you already have enough money for your whole holiday .
I ’m applied from the UK so my advice is UK centric , but the scheme operates in a similar way in other countries where it is available – at the time of writing this includes Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand and others .
The Japan Association for Working Holiday Makers has a complete list of eligible countries .
If applying from the UK you ’ll want to read the guidance from the Embassy of Japan in the UK .
There are a few unofficial links giving good general advice .
This one from Guillaume Erard has a great account of what he did to apply for the Japan working holiday visa .
This YouTube video is also a good watch .
As there is good information out there , I ’m going to add extra information that I have , rather than just repeating what has already been said .
The Japan visa application form
You need to fill in the standard Japan Visa application form .
There is n’t a separate form for a working holiday visa .
It is n’t quite clear from the website but the form you need is this one .
For purpose of journey I put ‘ Holiday ( working holiday visa application ) ’.
For route of present journey I filled in all three parts .
It does n’t matter if your change your port of entry , date of entry , or flight later on .
I think they just want to make sure you know you are trying to go to Japan !
In the passport section I circled ‘ ordinary ’ .
For the ‘ guarantor or reference ’
I put the name and address of the friend I was going to stay with .
Exactly the same as what I put in the ‘ where / who are you going to stay with ’ section above it .
I glued a 45x35 mm passport style photo into the photo space on the form .
The CV
For this I produced a cut down version of my CV .
I did n’t think they ’d want the same level of detail a recruiter would want , so I made it fit on a single side of A4 – with a bit of space to spare !
I started with the basics – name , address , email , telephone number .
I put a run down of my jobs and responsibilities .
There was a section with my qualifications , and a final section talking about hobbies .
Proposed itinerary
This was by far the most difficult part of the application to do .
It is made more difficult by the almost complete lack of guidance on the Japan embassy website .
In order to write a good itinerary I decided to plan the whole year out .
The where , when , what , and how much .
I looked at tourist information for where I wanted to go , planned it out on an Excel calendar , and worked out a budget on another Excel spreadsheet .
This I then condensed into a single side of A4 .
I ’ve heard that other people such as Guillaume Erard have had to re-write their itineraries in the Embassy as theirs were too long .
Mine was more detailed than his but they were fine with the first version I gave them .
When I went to hand it in I had actually brought an even shorter version with me just in case !
I believe what they are looking for is that you are serious about having a holiday in Japan and have done some planning .
They are n’t interested in exactly what you are doing .
There is no reason why you ca n’t change you plans later – you do n’t have to stick to the itinerary .
What I think they want to filter out is people who are just going to go to Japan , stay in one place , and work full time , instead of having a holiday .
The written reason
For this I again stuck to a single side of A4 paper .
I ’m sure they are very busy in the Embassy and do n’t want to read any life stories .
I wrote about what a good time I ’d had on my previous visit to Japan , and about what I wanted to do if I was given a visa to spend longer there .
I ’m guessing they want to see some genuine interest in going to Japan .
Again this part of the application is probably there to dissuade people who just want to work full time from applying .
Bank statements
They want to see evidence that you have enough to get started in Japan ( and get back to your home country ) .
If you apply from the UK they ’ll want three months worth of original bank statements showing a certain level of cash .
This is a pain for anyone who has swapped to paperless statements .
Fortunately I knew I wanted to apply over three months before I needed to so I switched back to paper statements .
Going to the Japan Embassy in London to make the application
Having got all the necessary material together I headed off to the Japan Embassy which is opposite Green Park .
Outside the embassy is a security contractor .
You ’ll have to tell him or her why you want to go inside .
You might have to show some ID or your application forms to get in .
You ’ll then go through airport style security .
Any bags will be x-rayed and you ’ll need to go through a metal detector .
So do n’t bring unnecessary metal with you unless you enjoy being scanned in more detail !
Then you go up the stairs to a little counter .
There was a Japanese lady behind the glass and I told her I wanted to hand in my working holiday visa application .
She asked to see the visa form .
She did n’t want to check it – she just wanted to make sure I ’d filled in the right form before going through .
She told me to go through the glass doors and press the bottom green button on the ticket machine at the end of the room .
On doing this I got a numbered ticket .
An electronic board above flashes your number up and tells you which counter to go to .
I ’d only sat down for a minute and my number came up .
Efficient !
I went to the counter and a British guy served me .
I told him I wanted to hand in my application .
I gave him the visa form , the CV , itinerary , written reason , bank statements , and my passport .
He looked through them and re-confirmed a few details such as my intended length of stay , and the fact that I had no criminal record .
He also asked about my job plans in Japan .
He signed various bits of the application form , photocopied the bank statements , and then stamped the form .
He gave me back my bank statements and also a receipt for my application and passport ( which you have to leave at the embassy ) .
He said to come back one week later to collect the result of my application .
He said that he could n’t promise anything but everything on my application looked fine .
One week later – do I get a working holiday visa ?
Yes !
I was in the embassy for less than 10 minutes .
I paid my £ 6 ( Update 2010 / 11/08 : this has now gone up to £ 20 ) and I got my passport back with the working holiday visa stuck inside .
It was dated from the day they approved the visa which was a few days before I collected it and valid for a year .
So from this date I have one year in which to enter Japan .
Yen and flights
I bought my Yen from the Thomas Exchange Global foreign currency shop in London , and booked my flight with Finnair ( flying from London to Osaka via Helsinki ) .
Getting into Japan with the working holiday visa
When you arrive at the airport in Japan you need to go into the normal foreigners queue .
When you get to the counter you ’ll need to give the immigration staff member your passport and immigration ( embarkation / disembarkation ) card .
I handed him the passport with the visa visible , but I ’m sure you do n’t need to as the fact you have a visa should be on their computer system already .
There is a machine to take the finger prints of your two index fingers , and there is a camera as well which takes your photo .
They can give you a short interview at this point as well .
On my previous visit to Japan where I did n’t have a pre-arranged visa ( I was just going via the normal tourist visa - waiver scheme ) I was asked quite a few questions about what I was doing in Japan and how long I was going to be there .
This time though the guy did n’t ask me anything .
He stamped the visa to say ‘ USED ’ .
Then he printed off and stuck in a landing permission sticker .
This is dated from the day you enter Japan , and expires one years after you enter Japan .
To be clear the validity of your stay in Japan is from entry to Japan .
It is not the dates which are in your visa .
The dates that are in your visa are the dates between which you can enter Japan , to start your one year stay .
He also removed the disembarkation part of the immigration card , and stapled the embarkation part of the card into the passport .
I had left the ‘ Flight No. ’ part of the embarkation card empty , as I did n’t know what flight I would be getting back to the country at the end of my travels .
Whereas a tourist landing permission sticker gives the status as ‘ Temporary Visitor ’ , the working holiday landing permission sticker says ‘ Designated Activities ’ .
He handed the passport back , and gave me a small leaflet reminding me that I would have to register as an alien within 90 days .
Finally do n’t forget the visa is single entry and is marked as ‘ USED ’ the moment you enter Japan !
So do n’t even think of making a short break to South Korea , or back home without sorting out a re-entry permit first .
If you leave without a re-entry permit your one year landing permission will be invalidated , and then your only way to re-enter would be under the normal tourist visa waiver scheme .
Which they might not let you do if you have already been in the country for a while !
Can I stay in Japan longer than a year ?
A one year working holiday visa for British citizens ca n’t be renewed .
However you can get your residence status changed to a normal working residence status from within Japan if a company is willing to give you the necessary paperwork .
This will give an automatic extension to your period of stay by one or three years from the day the status change is granted .
There is a lot of conflicting information on the internet about this , much is out of date , and there is a big difference between what embassy / immigration officials might informally tell you , and what can be done if you actually submit the application .
It is probably not worth asking anyone if this can be done as they will probably say ‘ no ’ .
Definitely do n’t ask about this when applying for your working holiday visa , as with the working holiday visa you are only supposed to be intending to stay for a year .
The actual situation that I have found as of 2011 is that you can submit a ‘ change of status ’ application in Japan before your working holiday visa expires , and this will ( if approved ) convert your visa to a normal working visa and give you another year ( or three ) in the country .
There is no need to leave the country to get this done .
All you need is a company who is willing to sponsor you .
I may post more about this topic in a future post .
So if you want to change a working holiday visa into a work visa , do n’t ask – just submit the application and it will probably be ok .
I managed to get my Working Holiday designated activities residence status changed to a three year Specialist in Humanities a few weeks before it expired so it can be done !

On the same day that a City Council committee moved to close the loophole that allows short - time employees such as Barnett to buy credit in the city 's pension fund based on public service elsewhere , the Board of Pensions and Retirement revealed that Barnett had done just that .
Internet Explorer ( IE ) gained browser usage share last month in the U.S. , while major rivals Firefox and Chrome both lost ground , Microsoft said today , citing data from Web analytics firm Net Applications .
" This is an incredibly competitive space now , which is incredibly healthy , " said Ryan Gavin , director of platform strategies for Microsoft .
" But we 're already seeing Chrome in retreat in the U.S. "
According to Net Applications data not available to the general public , all versions of IE gained 0.76 of a percentage point in U.S. usage share last month , accounting for 63.27 % of the browsers used in May .
Firefox and Chrome , meanwhile , fell 0.24 and 0.45 of a percentage point , respectively , in the U.S. last month , ending with shares of 20.38 % and 4.53 % .
Net Applications confirmed that the data Gavin cited was accurate .
But the growth of IE in the U.S. was not enough to offset its decline globally , where Microsoft gave up 0.26 of a percentage point to fall to a new low of 59.7 % .
Meanwhile , Google 's Chrome and Opera Software 's Norwegian - made Opera boosted their worldwide shares in May at the expense of IE and Mozilla 's Firefox .
By May 's end , Chrome accounted for 7.05 % of the browsers that surfed to the 40,000 sites that Aliso Viejo , Calif . - based Net Applications monitors for clients .
Opera increased its share by 0.13 of a percentage point , its largest increase in eight months , to 2.4 % .
Chrome 's increase of 0.3 of a percentage point was the browser 's smallest gain since August 2009 , and significantly off its three - and 12 - month averages of nearly half a point .
Firefox , on the other hand , was again down last month , sliding 0.24 of a percentage point to 24.35 % worldwide , marking the fourth time in the last six months that the browser 's share slipped .
In March and April , Firefox gained back some of the ground it had lost since November 2009 , but May 's decline cost Mozilla most of the growth it had fought for during the two - month stretch .
Firefox now stands at about the same share it had in January .
Once considered a lock to hit and then move beyond the 25 % bar , Firefox has yet to reach that milestone .
In April , Vince Vizzaccaro , a Net Applications executive vice president , said that Firefox was " just holding steady " and explained that gains that had once come its way were instead being gobbled by Google 's Chrome .
Microsoft disputed that Chrome is grabbing share .
" IE8 continues to lead in user choice , " Gavin argued .
" It grew 2.5 times faster than any competitor . "
He arrived at the two - and - a - half times figure by comparing IE8's global increase of 0.81 of a percentage point with Chrome 's growth of 0.32 of a percentage point .
IE8 closed May with 35.38 % of the U.S. browser usage share , making it the most - used browser in the country .
Microsoft 's IE7 was second , with 16.75 % , said Vizzaccaro , while Mozilla 's Firefox 3.6 was third with 13 % .
Google 's best showing was at No. 8 , where Chrome 4.1 accounted for 3.52 % .
Chrome 5.0 , which just shifted out of beta into what Google dubs its " stable channel , " owned 0.76 % of the usage market .
" Microsoft is doing extremely well with IE8 in the U.S. , " said Vizzaccaro in an e-mail today .
" Windows 7 [ growth ] is certainly part of the reason why IE8 is growing , " said Gavin , when asked for Microsoft 's explanation of IE 's increase in the U.S.
" But there is more choice in [ the browser ] space than at any other time in history , " he said , adding that when IE8 goes head - to - head with rivals , such as in Europe , where Windows users have been offered a government - mandated way to change browsers , IE8 does well .
" IE8 grew half a percentage point in Europe last month , " said Gavin , to 29.69 % .
Besides touting the climb of IE8 , Gavin also plugged the success that Microsoft has had in driving down the share of the nearly - nine - year - old IE6 , the aged browser that Microsoft has been aggressively urging customers to ditch .
He confirmed that one of his tasks is to push IE6 's share to zero .
" In the U.S. , we 're seeing that tip - over [ towards zero ] , " Gavin said , and again credited Windows 7 and IE8 adoption as reasons .
Windows 7 , the operating system Microsoft launched last October , was the first to include IE8 .
Microsoft has made more headway in its " kill IE6 " movement in the U.S. than it has globally .
According to Net Applications , IE6 accounted for 6.74 % of all browsers used last month in the U.S. , a number substantially lower than IE6's worldwide average of 17.13 % .
The two biggest groups of customers still running IE6 , said Gavin , are enterprises having trouble migrating because of mission - critical Web applications or sites that rely on the old browser , and users in emerging and underdeveloped markets .
There , the global economic recession and sluggish recovery have stalled efforts to upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7 .
" We 're working very , very actively [ to move IE6's share toward zero ] , but that takes time , " acknowledged Gavin .
" We 're doing a lot of work with partners and developers on educating users to upgrade to a modern browser , " he said , pointing out efforts such as the " Adios IE6 " campaign now running in Latin America .
A similar campaign in Australia equated IE6 to a carton of long - expired milk .
" You would n't drink 9 - year - old milk , " the campaign 's marketing copy read in a page that showed a milk carton dated August 2001 , the month when IE6 debuted .
" So why use a 9 - year - old browser ? "
The fifth major browser , Apple 's Safari , owned a global usage share of 4.77 % , up 0.05 of a percentage point , and a 10.38 % share in the U.S .
May 's browser usage share data is available on Net Applications ' site .

Scientists analyse ancient plants to work out when the Egyptian kings ruled
Scientists have used the analysis of ancient plants and seeds to complete the most detailed chronology of the kings of ancient Egypt yet .
The international study sheds light on one of the most important periods of Egyptian history , documenting the various rulers of Egypt 's Old , Middle and New Kingdoms .
In the past , the dating of events was controversial , with Egyptologists relying on various different ways of working out which king ruled over which period .
But the new radiocarbon dating , led by Professor Christopher Ramsey from the University of Oxford , is said to resolve the chronology once and for all .
A scrap of papyrus and seeds in a Deir el - Bahri offering bowl .
Some of the objects collected fro museums around the world were more than 4,000 years old
The researchers obtained seeds , baskets , textiles , plant stems and fruits linked to the particular reigns of ancient Egyptian kings from museums worldwide .
They then combined their radiocarbon data with historical information about the order and length of each king 's reign to make a complete chronology of ancient Egyptian dynasties .
A statue of Djoser , the pharoah of the Third Dynasty of Egypt
The new dating evidence rules out some chronologies that were put forward , particularly in the Old Kingdom , which is shown to be older than some scholars thought .
In the Old Kingdom , one of the best known pharaohs of the Third Dynasty of Egypt is Djoser , who is thought to have commissioned the first of the pyramids .
He was found to have ruled between 2691 and 2625 BC - about 50 to 100 years earlier than some experts thought .
The study also suggests that the start of the New Kingdom might be pushed back slightly to between 1570 and 1544 BC .
' The very first dating done with radiocarbon was dating Egyptian material of known dates , to check that [ the method ] worked , ' said Andrew Shortland from Cranfield University told the BBC .
' Now , for the very first time , [ we ] managed to get radiocarbon techniques so good , that we can do it completely the opposite way around .
We can say , from using radiocarbon , whether the Egyptian history is correct or not .
' Previously radiocarbon has n't had a voice on this because the errors had been so great .
Now radiocarbon is able to distinguish between different ideas of reconstructing the history . '
Academics say the study has implications for the whole region , as the Egyptian chronology anchors the timing of historical events in neighbouring areas .
Prof Ramsey and colleagues from the universities of Oxford and Cranfield , along with a team of researchers from France , Austria and Israel , radiocarbon - dated 211 plants from museum collections worldwide .
The pyramids at Giza , one of the Seven Wonders of the World , and burial place of the Egyptian kings .
New radiocarbon dating of plants has given definitive dates for the Egyotian rulers
They used a computer programme devised by Prof Ramsey that provides a radiocarbon calibration and analysis of archaeological and environmental chronological data .
Prof Ramsey said : ' For the first time , radiocarbon dating has become precise enough to constrain the history of ancient Egypt to very specific dates .
' I think scholars and scientists will be glad to hear that our small team of researchers has independently corroborated a century of scholarship in just three years .
' My colleague Joanne Rowland went to a lot of museums , explaining what we were doing and asking for their participation .
' The museums were all very helpful in providing the material we were interested in to ask for their help .
' We are very grateful to them for providing us with the material we were interested in , especially important since the export of samples from Egypt is currently prohibited .
' Fortunately , we only needed samples that were about the same size as a grain of wheat . '
The mesmerizing feeling of warm sun rays leaning down into tropical waters , and breaking back through the water ’s vivid facade as it rebounds off the glistening scales of a rare fish provides an experience that stays in one ’s memory for a lifetime .
I thought I ’d share some of the most beautiful species that I know in the waters .
There are in the order i consider them the most vibrant and beautiful , since , beauty is , ofcourse , in the eye of the beholder .
1.Mandarinfish
The Mandarinfish or Mandarin dragonet , is a small , brightly - colored member of the dragonet family , which is popular in the saltwater aquarium trade .
The mandarinfish is native to the Pacific , ranging approximately from the Ryukyu Islands south to Australia .
2.Juvenile Emporer Angel Fish
The emperor angelfish , Pomacanthus imperator , is a species of marine angelfish .
It is a reef - associated fish , native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans , from the Red Sea to Hawaii and the Austral Islands .
3.Lionfish
A Lionfish is any of several species of venomous marine fish in the genera Pterois , Parapterois , Brachypterois , Ebosia or Dendrochirus , of the family Scorpaenidae .
The lionfish is also known as the Turkey Fish , Scorpion or Fire Fish .
They are notable for their extremely long and separated spines , and have a generally striped appearance , red , green , navy green , brown , orange , yellow , black , maroon , or white .
4.Clown Trigger Fish
The clown triggerfish , Balistoides conspicillum , is a triggerfish from the order Tetraodontiformes .
This reef - associated fish is commonly found in the tropical Indo - Pacific
5.Nudibranch
A nudibranch is a member of what is now a taxonomic clade , and what was previously a suborder , of soft - bodied , shell - less marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks , which are noted for their often extraordinary colors and striking forms .
The clade Nudibranchia is the largest clade within the heterobranchs , with more than 3,000 described species .
6.Symphysodon
Symphysodon are a genus of three species of cichlid freshwater fishes native to the Amazon River basin .
Discus are popular as aquarium fish and their aquaculture in several countries in Asia is a major industry .
7.Mantis Shrimp
Mantis shrimp or stomatopods are marine crustaceans , the members of the order Stomatopoda .
They are neither shrimp nor mantids , but receive their name purely from the physical resemblance to both the terrestrial praying mantis and the shrimp .
They may reach 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) in length , although exceptional cases of up to 38 cm ( 15 in ) have been recorded .
The carapace of mantis shrimp covers only the rear part of the head and the first three segments of the thorax .
Mantis shrimp appear in a variety of colours , from shades of browns to bright neon colours .
Although they are common animals and among the most important predators in many shallow , tropical and sub- tropical marine habitats they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes .
8.Moorish Idol
The moorish idol , Zanclus cornutus , is a small marine fish species , the sole representative of the the Family Zanclidae in order Perciform .
A common inhabitant of tropical to subtropical reefs and lagoons , the moorish idol is notable for its wide distribution throughout the Indo - Pacific .
A number of butterflyfishes closely resemble the moorish idol .
9.Clownfish
Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae .
About twenty - nine species are recognized , one in the genus Premnas , while the remaining are in the genus Amphiprion .
In the wild they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones .
Depending on species , clownfish are overall yellow , orange , reddish , or blackish , and many show white bars or patches .
The largest reach a length of 18 centimetres ( 7.1 in ) , while the smallest barely reach 10 centimetres .
10 . Rainbow Parrot Fish
Named Parrot fish because of their calcareous bird - like beaks .
Parrot fish use these beaks to crush and eat the small invertebrates that live in coral .
Much of the sand and sea floor of coral reefs are actually remains of meals from the parrot fish , they chew the coral , eat the invertebrates and spit out the leftover calcium .
In most species , the initial phase is dull red , brown or grey , while the terminal phase is vividly green or blue with bright pink or yellow patches .
The remarkably different terminal and initial phases were first described as separate species in several cases , but there are also some species where the phases are similar .
I am currently reading through " Effective Perl Programming " .
Another fine book that I wish my coworkers would read .
( And another fine book they are not going to read ) .
The authors not only want you to write effectively , they want you to write concise code that is easy to read for anyone with a bit of Perl experience .
For example , there is a piece of advice in there that says " Avoid excessive punctuation " : " [...]
Excessive puctuation makes programs less readale [... ] "
Exactly !
But why is code less readable when it 's full of parenthesis , e.g.?
I think the answer is simply that the puctuation lowers the signal - to - noise ratio .
When reading code , you are looking for the signals , the statements that actually do something , the meat , the beef .
A corollary of this is that a bit of whitespace here and there will increase your code 's signal - to - noise ratio because it will make the beef stand out .
Here 's a stupid little example :
$ x=foo ( ) ; if ( defined ( $x ) ) { bar ( $y , $x , $z ) ; }
That 's pretty cramped code and whitespace will make it more readable :
$x = $ foo ( ) ; if ( defined ( $ x ) ) { bar ( $y , $ x , $ z ) ; }
It 's a lot easier to see what is is that needs to be defined here and what the arguments passed to bar ( ) actually are .
Now , assuming this is possible here , let 's get rid of the excessive punctuation :
$x = foo ; if ( defined $ x ) { bar $y , $ x , $ z ; }
Even better !
Readable !
You do n't have to concentrate too hard to see what is going on here .
All this got me thinking , that at this low level of symbols , code readability should be measurable .
If punctuation increases the noise and whitespace increases the signal , it should be easy to come up with a formula here .
Let 's try that , with those examples :
$ x=foo ( ) ;
Tokens you need to understand : 3 ( $x , = , and foo ) .
Amount of whitespace : 0 . Punctuation : 2 ( the parens ) .
So that might be a SNR of ( 3 + 0 ) / 2 = 1.5 .
$x = $ foo ( ) ;
Tokens : 3 , whitespace : 2 , puctuation : 2 . This gives us ( 3 + 2 ) / 2 = 2.5 .
And finally :
$x = foo ;
which results in a divide by zero exception !
In this rare case , this is exactly what we want .
I wonder whether something like this could be turned into a Perl : : Critic policy ?
Or does is already exist ?

Supreme Court : Christian Group Ca n’t Exclude Gays While Accepting Public Funds
Once again , the Supreme Court affirmed today that there is no Constitutional right to receive public funds .
Doug Mataconis · · 28 comments
Another decision handed down by the Supreme Court today reiterated the old adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
An ideologically split Supreme Court ruled Monday that a law school can legally deny recognition to a Christian student group that wo n’t let gays join , with one justice saying that the First Amendment does not require a public university to validate or support the group ’s ” discriminatory practices . ”
The court turned away an appeal from the Christian Legal Society , which sued to get funding and recognition from the University of California ’s Hastings College of the Law .
The CLS requires that voting members sign a statement of faith and regards ” unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle ” as being inconsistent with that faith .
But Hastings , which is in San Francisco , said no recognized campus groups may exclude people due to religious belief or sexual orientation .
The court on a 5 - 4 judgment upheld the lower court rulings saying the Christian group ’s First Amendment rights of association , free speech and free exercise were not violated by the college ’s nondiscrimination policy .
” In requiring CLS — in common with all other student organizations — to choose between welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of official recognition , we hold , Hastings did not transgress constitutional limitations , ” said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who wrote the 5 - 4 majority opinion for the court ’s liberals and moderate Anthony Kennedy .
” CLS , it bears emphasis , seeks not parity with other organizations , but a preferential exemption from Hastings ’ policy . ”
Justice Samuel Alito wrote a strong dissent for the court ’s conservatives , saying the opinion was ” a serious setback for freedom of expression in this country . ”
” Our proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘ the thought that we hate , ” ’ Alito said , quoting a previous court decision .
” Today ’s decision rests on a very different principle : no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of political correctness in our country ’s institutions of higher learning . ”
The Cato Institute ’s Roger Pilon ’s picks up on Justice Alito ’s theme in his reaction to the decision :
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , writing for the Court ’s three other liberals plus Justice Anthony Kennedy , held that the school ’s “ all comers ” policy , which requires that student organizations accept anyone as members and even as officers , is “ constitutionally reasonable , ” taking into account all of the surrounding circumstances .
That is a new standard for constitutionality when it comes to fundamental rights .
And if students , whatever their interests or values , cannot form organizations limited to people who share those interests and values , what ’s the point of having student organizations at all ?
In a word , like the mugger who says “ Your money or your life , ” today ’s opinion enables Hastings to say , “ If you want benefits otherwise available to all , you ’ve got to give up your right to freedom of association . ”
No public institution should be able to put people to such a choice .
The problem I have with this is that Pilon , who I generally respect when it comes to Constitutional Law , seems to be confusing the ideas of Freedom of Association / Expression with the “ right ” to receive official recognition or , in this case , access to student activity funds .
The first is clearly guaranteed by the First Amendment and there ’s nothing in today ’s decision that says that the members of the Hastings Christian Legal Society can’t form a private group and air their views .
The second , though , seems to me to come dangerously close to the idea that their is a right to receive public funds for private purposes , which would seem to be a position that libertarians like the people at Cato would soundly , and correctly reject .
As long as the regulations are reasonable and not arbitrary , I see no reason why Hastings Law School should not be permitted to set standards defining which groups can and cannot receive public funding for their activities .
France and Uruguay contested a truly awful goalless draw in the second match of the 2010 World Cup at the Cape Town Stadium .
The result ensured that both of the opening day Group A fixtures ended in draws - but there was much more to savour in South Africa 's earlier game against Mexico .
The match in Cape Town never really got going ; instead of sparking into life , it deteriorated into a largely forgettable contest only briefly illuminated by the occasional moment of trickery and skill .
In a game of few chances , Uruguay came closest to scoring through a Diego Forlan shot that was saved in the opening half , while they finished the contest with 10 men after substitute Nicolas Lodeiro picked up two bookings .
France were arguably the better team and might have snatched the points with a free - kick from a promising position deep into injury - time , but substitute Thierry Henry 's strike hit the wall .
Both teams had laboured through qualification , requiring play - offs to reach South Africa , and their lack of fluency was clear to see .
France , who recently switched to a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , lost to China in their final warm - up game and were too ponderous in possession against La Celeste , with a lack of understanding undermining their efforts .
This was encapsulated in one move when Abou Diaby , surprisingly recalled in favour of Florent Malouda amid suggestions of a training ground row with manager Raymond Domenech , played a superb through ball for Sidney Govou .
But striker Nicolas Anelka , who made way for Henry with 20 minutes left , intercepted the pass after returning from an offside position and a promising opening was completely wasted .
Franck Ribery was an early threat down the left and his low cross after seven minutes should have been converted by Govou , while playmaker Yoann Gourcuff had few opportunities to showcase his skills - although he almost caught Fernando Muslera out with a free - kick from a tight angle on 17 minutes .
France 's holding midfielder Jeremy Toulalan was reduced to trying his luck from more than 35 yards , while Uruguay 's Diego Lugano mystified his team - mates by shooting at goal from deep inside his own half .
Toulalan was booked for a heavy tackle on Alvaro Pereira after 68 minutes and locked horns with Lugano seconds later .
Domenech came on to the pitch to try to calm the situation , but at least it was something to rouse the crowd , leading to a brief cacophony of vuvuzela sounds .
Forlan , who forced an excellent first - half save from Hugo Lloris after cutting inside and shooting from 20 yards , was impressive for Uruguay .
The Atletico Madrid striker was alive with craft and invention , but he wasted a decent opening with 20 minutes left , shooting wide from 16 yards after a decent lay - off from Luis Suarez .
Striker Suarez , with 49 goals in 48 games for Ajax last season , was all too frequently caught offside , while playmaker Ignacio Gonzalez was a peripheral figure .
Uruguay coach Javier Aguirre brought on the highly rated Lodeiro in place of Gonzalez shortly after the restart , and Domenech replaced Gourcuff with Malouda .
Lodeiro's only mark on the game was arguably made on the ankle of Bakari Sagna as the Uruguayan picked up his second booking with 10 minutes to go .
Henry almost produced a moment of late drama with a header that glanced across the face of goal , and had an appeal for a handball against Mauricio Victorino turned down as Uruguay held on .
NEW YORK , June 10 / PRNewswire / --
Citing the company 's history of safety lapses , cost cutting , and workplace disasters , shareholders who purchased stock in BP have filed a class - action lawsuit based on claims that the company mislead investors prior to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The suit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana , seeks to represent not only American investors , but also people around the world who bought shares in United Kingdom - based BP .
Zwerling , Schachter & Zwerling , LLP filed the class - action lawsuit on behalf of individuals or entities that purchased ordinary shares and / or American Depository Receipts in BP p.l.c. during a period beginning February 27 , 2008 , through May 12 , 2010 , ( the " Class Period " ) .
BP's ADRs and ordinary shares are actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE : BP ) and the London Stock Exchange ( London Stock Exchange : BP.L ) , respectively .
The lawsuit notes BP 's prior statements about its Gulf operations being a primary economic driver , and the company 's assertions that it had the technology to safely conduct the operations .
But nearly a month after the catastrophic explosion at the Deepwater Horizon , BP's Chief Executive Officer Anthony B. Hayward admitted that BP did not have the technology available to stop the Gulf leak .
The lawsuit chronicles BP 's long history of spills , fires and explosions at its facilities , including a 2005 explosion in Texas City , Texas , that killed 15 people , and a 2006 oil leak in its Prudhoe Bay , Alaska , operations pipeline .
In the Alaska case , Zwerling , Schachter & Zwerling served as lead counsel for securities plaintiffs who brought suit against BP , and secured a multimillion - dollar settlement on their behalf .
In the current case , shareholders claim BP violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing false and misleading statements about safety , technology , inspections and precautions at its offshore oil facilities .
At the time of the latest disaster , BP shares were trading at nearly $ 60 , but since have lost nearly half their value .
If you purchased or otherwise acquired the ordinary shares and / or ADRs of BP during the Class Period , you may apply to serve as lead plaintiff .
The lead plaintiff is responsible for overseeing the prosecution of the action and ensuring that the interests of the class are protected .
Should you desire to be lead plaintiff , you may apply to be appointed through Zwerling , Schachter & Zwerling , as counsel .
The deadline for seeking to become a lead plaintiff is July 20 , 2010 .
Zwerling , Schachter & Zwerling , LLP represents clients nationwide in financial - related class action lawsuits .
With offices in New York City , Garden City , N.Y. and Seattle , the firm currently plays a leading role in numerous major securities and complex commercial litigations pending in federal and state courts .

Every time they passed a replica of astronaut Sally Ride 's flight suit on their visits to NASA or Space Center Houston , Calvin Dale Smith would laugh , his wife recalled .
She told NASA investigators her husband would comment that he knew where Ride 's original flight suit was , but he always remained very secretive about it .
Smith , 56 , of Houston , is now in federal custody after being accused of stealing the original flight suit used by Ride , the first American woman to travel into space , court records show .
Smith , of the 1600 block of Richvale Lane , has been indicted by a federal grand jury on suspicion of theft of government property .
He is accused of receiving , concealing and keeping nearly $ 10,000 in property belonging to the U.S. government , including the NASA flight suit , an Omega watch used on two shuttle flights and machine parts used in NASA 's space program .
The former United Space Alliance employee has pleaded not guilty .
He was arraigned in a Houston federal courtroom Thursday .
Smith 's federal public defender , Margy Meyers , declined to comment Friday .
The NASA Inspector General 's Office at Johnson Space Center , which investigated the case , also declined to comment .
Federal court records show Smith 's wife was once employed by Boeing 's Flight Group Processing Office , which handled the maintenance of NASA astronauts ' flight suits .
United Space Alliance LLC took over NASA 's contract with Boeing .
Wife found suitcase
While Smith was in the Harris County Jail last year on a charge of domestic violence involving a firearm , his wife discovered a suitcase at their home containing a NASA flight suit with Ride 's name on it , as well as a blue flight jacket made of similar material , a criminal complaint shows .
Smith 's wife made the discovery when she received a list from his mother requesting some of Smith 's property since he was about to be released from jail .
One of those items was a suitcase .
When Smith 's wife asked his mother about it , Smith 's mother responded , “ You know , the suitcase , ” court records stated .
NASA investigators recovered the flight suit when they searched the couple 's home with the consent of Smith 's wife .
She called investigators again several weeks later to report she had found more NASA property .
Investigators returned to the home and collected an Omega watch and various machine parts , including an ERCM safety tether assembly and three airlock parts .
An expert in space flight - related memorabilia and artifacts told investigators the flight suit appeared to be authentic and estimated its worth to be between $ 2,500 and $ 3,500 .
Smith has convictions in Harris County for misdemeanor theft and misdemeanor assault of a family member , court records show .
He received deferred adjudication after being charged with making a terroristic threat .
A charge of violating a protective order is still pending against him .
If convicted of stealing the flight suit and other government property , Smith faces up to 10 years in federal prison , three years of supervised release and a $ 250,000 fine .

Los señalamientos del rector de la Libre de Derecho , sin efecto jurídico , señala la PGR
Se trata de una organización profesional , dice
Haven for Hope had just opened its men's dorm in April when the first discharged patient showed up .
It was evening at the homeless center and Haven CEO George Block was walking along the sidewalk when he spied a woman getting out of a taxi .
She was in a hospital gown and pushing an IV pole , with the intravenous line still attached to her .
“ I asked the taxi driver what he was doing , ” Block recalled .
“ He said he had a note saying to drop the woman off at this address .
The women 's dorms were n't even open yet , so we had no place to put her .
We sent her back to the hospital . ”
Since then , the practice of “ medical dumping ” — in which hospitals try to transfer their still - sick homeless patients to homeless shelters or other hospitals — has increased at Haven , officials allege .
Since last month , when Haven opened Prospects Courtyard , its outdoor sleeping area , about 15 homeless people discharged from area hospitals have shown up at the gate , all too ill to be cared for at the center .
“ One guy still had his EKG pad on , ” said Susan Jenkins , who oversees the courtyard .
Intake Director Vilma Pinto said a woman was found three weeks ago lying face - down on the lawn in front of the campus , in a hospital gown and unable to speak or walk .
“ We saw the cab driving off , ” she said .
“ We got her a wheelchair , but Centro Med ( the on - campus clinic ) said if she could n't walk , she needed to go back to the hospital .
On Prospects Courtyard , we can't have people who can't do for themselves . ”
Medical dumping is a major problem at homeless shelters across the country , said Ann Hutchinson Meyers , vice president of transformational services at Haven .
It was an issue at the SAMMinistries emergency shelter on Commerce Street , where on average a patient would get dropped off once every two weeks , said Navarra Williams , CEO of SAMMinistries .
A federal statute seeks to prevent hospitals from dumping homeless or low - income patients at other hospitals .
Dumping sick patients at homeless shelters that can't provide proper medical care also violates federal regulations , said Dodjie Guioa , a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
But the problem remains prevalent at homeless shelters .
Meyers said Haven 's goal is to stop the trend before it develops into a “ long - term cycle . ”
“ What 's so frustrating is they 're not releasing them to Haven , they 're directing them here when they 're still sick , ” she said .
“ We have a protocol for the homeless outpatient population that has been distributed to all the hospitals . ”
Meyers said Centro Med oversees 35 medical beds at Haven that are designated for the homeless who require some medical care , but that level of care is only primary .
Those requiring more complex care should either be in the hospital or receiving home health care .
She said hospital officials argue that hospitals are only appropriate for acute care , and they 're at a loss in dealing with homeless who no longer require such care but can't be discharged to home health care .
“ It 's all about bed days , ” she said .
“ There 's a specific length of stay for each diagnosis , and if ( patients ) stay past that , the revenue streams are decreased .
So they end up at Haven . ”
The irony , she said , is that it costs taxpayers and hospitals much more to send the homeless through the hospital - shelter - hospital revolving door than it does to simply keep them in a hospital room .
But she said there 's a “ gray line ” :
Who decides eligibility for discharge ?
The doctors do , and that 's where things get ambiguous .
Residents at Haven must at least be able to perform “ activities of daily living ” — using the bathroom , eating and so on .
Meyers said she and her staff have begun compiling information on the medical dumping so they can confront the offending hospitals .
Pinto said the woman who was found prostrate on the lawn had release papers from Brooke Army Medical Center .
Dewey Mitchell , chief of public affairs at BAMC , said the hospital does discharge patients to homeless shelters “ if we know that patient has no place else to go or if the patient says they live there and it 's medically appropriate to send them there .
The ER will contact the shelter and get approval . ”
He added that the BAMC chief of emergency medicine said he'd tried to send medical patients to Haven before but had been turned away because the center was “ too full . ”
“ That 's simply not true , ” Meyers responded .
“ We 've always had medical beds open , so that 's simply not true . ”
Meyers also said they found at least one patient dumped from Christus Santa Rosa Hospital .
But the hospital disputed that claim .
“ Our policy is to never release a patient unless they 're ready to be discharged , ” said Melissa Krause , director of marketing and communication for Santa Rosa .
“ We take care of patients if there 's an acute medical need requiring hospitalization . ”
The new Apple iPad meets the Real World
A review by M. Pinkston
Recently my employer offered to buy myself and all of my coworkers our own iPads .
He wanted us to test them out and give our thoughts about it 's practical use in the work place and where possible , see what other devices it could possibly replace or be substituted for .
This review is presented as a series of 12 such possible uses for the iPad .
I basically have challenged the iPad with 12 tests .
With this , I attempt to illustrate what you can expect , performance wise , from your new Apple iPad .
Excited to get started the iPad arrived via FexEx and was express shipped to me directly from China .
I tore into it like a kid on Christmas morning .
Let 's get started , shall we ?
1. Paper Weight
Does this one even count ?
I mean what can't be successful as a paper weight ?
Another Piece of paper perhaps ?
Nonetheless , for the sake of due diligence , here 's proof that the new Apple iPad performs as an adequate paper weight .
Note that there is actually a breeze coming thru that open window and that Apple iPad invoice is staying put .
Result : Success
2. Toaster Oven Tray
The new Apple iPad worked wonderfully in this capacity .
I was pleasantly surprised when it fit quite nicely in the toaster oven and the door closed unobstructed .
It 's the perfect size for this .
It should also be said that it worked great as a plate right from the toaster oven .
No need to get another dish dirty .
Way to to go Apple !
Result : Success
3. Cup
With the recent victory in the previous test I was certain the new Apple iPad was going to put on a good show for this one .
Sadly , I was wrong .
The new Apple iPad just did n't make that great of a cup .
Even with the iPad 's drastic failure as a cup , I could n't help but notice that my juice looked way cooler on the iPad .
Seemed to taste better as well .
Result : Fail
4. Scratching Post
How hard could this be , right ?
One thing I have noticed is that cats do n't seem too picky about what they will scratch .
It 's almost like they just want to tear into everything ... carpet , couches , flesh .
They just do n't care about what they sink their claws into .
That is why I was completely baffled about the results of this test .
I even placed the iPad as close to the cat as possible .. as if to say , " hey kitty , go ahead and tear into it . "
The cat barely looked at the iPad .
Perhaps this is by design ?
Could Apple have built the iPad to repel cats ?
Your call here .
From what I saw , iPad was never going to be a scratching post .
Result : Fail
5. Sort & Fold Laundry
So the new Apple iPad is supposed to be full of usefulness .. apps for just about everything , right ?
Wrong !
Yet another thing the iPad failed miserably at .
In fairness to the iPad , the cat you see in the picture would n't fold laundry either ... go figure ?
Result : Fail
6. ZX - 14 engine
This next one would be a stretch .. and I admit , unlike the other absolutely plausible tests I conducted , this was meant more as a joke .
Two pictures to prove it can't power a Kawasaki ZX - 14 to move .
Could n't even figure out where to connect the coils let alone the chain .
Result : Fail
7. Wheel Chock
Since I was out in the garage it was only a few steps over to the trailer .
I was n't counting on much but I was pleasantly surprised by the competence of the iPad as a wheel chock .
Hard to believe it I know .. but the picture proves it .
Result : Success
8. Screw Driver
What a shameful thing this is .
Here the iPad is out done by a $ 10 screw driver .
Come on Apple .. what were you thinking ?
Screw Driver : $ 2 - 15
i Pad " $ 499 - $ 829
Result : Fail
9. Rear View Mirror
Honestly , I was sure the iPad could do this .
Not included are the 10 or so pictures I took trying to find the right angle .
I was sure the new Apple iPad could do this simple task , what with its boasted " large Multi - Touch screen and advanced capabilities " along with being able to view in both " portrait or landscape on the large Multi - Touch screen " , it did not allow viewing anything .
What a joke !
Sadly the New Apple fell short once again .
So sorry Apple .. you suck .
Result : Fail
10 . Lawn Mower
Nope !
Would n't even budge .
I sat there for like 10 minutes ... nothing !
Finally had to call my yard care guys and plead with them to add me back to their route .
What a fool I was made to look like .
Sheesh !
Result : Fail
11 . Pull Weeds
I swear this is a genuine shot .
That damn iPad was happy to just play in the dirt .
You can see it here literally trying to hide from me amongst the weeds .
As if I was n't going to see it .
Unreal !
I almost drop kicked the new Apple iPad back to last month .. a time before I ordered it .
So lame !
Result : Fail
12 . Passenger for car pool Lane
Saved the best for last .
Convinced the iPad was pretty much useless , only succeeding and the simplest of tasks that basically allowed it 's lazy ass to just sit there ..
I thought ..
" OK , I got a task for you that even an unconscious homeless man juiced up on $ 4 bum jug could do .
" Just sit there and we 'll take the HOV lane to the auto body supply place for some primer .
How hard can this be , iPad ? "
We got 2 miles !
I plead with the officer to cut us some slack for the sake of scientific research .
He was n't impressed .
Then again , neither was I. $ 350 fine .. nice !
Result : Fail
In conclusion , the iPad just is n't all it 's cracked up to be ... failing more tests than it passed .
Disappointed is an understatement .
Drake sings or raps the word " I " 410 times on his debut album .
Even in the realm of hip - hop -- a style famous for its unswerving solipsism -- this is a feat .
For comparison 's sake , noted mirror watcher Kanye West managed to work only 220 " I " 's into the verses and hooks of his big break , The College Dropout .
Illmatic ; 210 .
Reasonable Doubt ; 240 .
With Thank Me Later , Drake attempts to enter the pantheon of those rap game - busters by the sheer force of first person singular pronouns .
All eyes are on him -- especially his own .
But considering this mixed race , half - Jewish , all - Canadian " Degrassi : The Next Generation " alum looks and sounds unlike any major rap star before him , betting the house on nothing but himself turns out to be a wise gamble .
Drake is the guy you get drinks with who talks about himself for a few hours -- if you 're lucky , he might ask you for advice on one or two things .
But this is OK because Drake 's stories are better than yours .
Like the one about how Lil Wayne befriended and signed him at the height of Weezy 's powers .
Or how he got with Rihanna last year .
Or that time he flashed from a Toronto has - been to a top - flight hit maker off the strength of a self - released mixtape .
Of course , there 's the classic about sipping a few too many glasses of Ace of Spades and asking Nicki Minaj to marry him .
Sounds like a sweet existence .
But there 's a problem .
Even though he's a rich and handsome 23 year old spreading his music around the world in a five - star fashion , Drake really wants to be in the bottom bunk , hooking up with a girl next to the laundry basket at Totally Normal University , as he raps , " I wish I was n't famous / I wish I was still in school /
So I could have you in my dorm room / I would put it on you crazy . "
Elsewhere , the irony is not lost on him , but he 's not taking anything back : " I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle / I 'm lookin ' forward to the memories of right now . "
Simply , Drake is in love with his own lovelessness .
But instead of lashing out against his would - be wifeys à la 808s and Heartbreak or falling into token misogyny , his relationship with women is more complicated .
Whereas the unofficial mainstream hip - hop LP rulebook previously demanded a couple " ladies ' night " tracks that were often pandering , insulting , or both , Drake lives for such softness .
The brilliant and spare " Karaoke " finds him singing about a girl who can't deal with his newly jet - setting ways .
" I was only trying to get ahead / But the spotlight makes you nervous , " he says , sounding more committed than a host of melisma - drunk heartthrobs .
His relatively progressive and gentlemanly style is contagious , too ; on the soon - to - be smash " Fancy " , T.I. ditches the " superficial gold - digging bitches " he once praised on songs like " Whatever You Like " , instead opting for a single lady with her own BMW and Jaguar in the garage .
As if that was n't enough , Mary J. Blige spiritually co-signs the sentiment by adding some subtle harmonies as the song draws to a close .
Meanwhile , Drake 's fellow Young Money upstart Nicki Minaj adds to the gender ambiguities , out - manning her host on the diabolical " Up All Night " , and the album 's steamiest pairing has him teaming with The - Dream for the uber - slow jam " Shut It Down " .
That song ends with Drake shamelessly trying to get in a new acquaintance 's pants -- " take those fuckin ' heels off , it 's worth it , girl , " he suggests .
He 's no angel .
But even when this Romeo starts tossing dollar bills at a strip club on " Miss Me " , his ogling is somehow lonely and level : " I do n't judge her but I could never love her / ' Cause to her I 'm just a rapper and soon she 'll have met another . "
As much as rap is built on artful navel - gazing , it 's also founded in struggle .
And just as Drake 's dramatically exposed selfishness is unique to hip - hop , so are his adversities .
He grew up in an affluent Toronto suburb and was graced with everything but a functional pair of parents , who split when he was three .
Like Kanye
West before him , Drake vies for superstardom while embracing his non -drug - dealing , non-violent , non -dire history -- one that connects with most rap fans in a completely reasonable way .
And , suddenly , all that " I " turns into a lot of " we . "
We 'll spare you the rhetoric on standard , non-rechargeable batteries -- if you really need to hear our thoughts on those again , feel free to have a look here .
We went into this test with a couple of primary goals .
First , we wanted to ensure that each of these offerings could power a Nikon SB - 600 for an extended period of time , given that many of the weaker rechargeables simply can't provide enough juice to these high - draw flashes .
Second , we wanted to see which brand lasted the longest .
We obviously have n't had these long enough to truly test out the longevity , but here 's the published facts : PowerGenix says its cells can be recharged " hundreds of times , " Energizer 's new 2300 mAh units can be recharged " up to 500 times " ( 250 more than the prior 2400 mAh models ) , and Sanyo's Eneloop batteries ( US version ) are good for 1000 recharges .
So , we 'll just get right down to it : all three brands managed to power our SB - 600 flash , so it 's safe to say that any of 'em will suit you just fine when it comes to handling high - draw wares .
Now , we 're sure you 're eager to hear which brand tanked and which one lasted for eight months without having to revisit the charger ; unfortunately for the drama queens in attendance , we wo n't be delivering any shockers here .
We originally found that the PowerGenix cells would last around 300 to 400 shots in our flash , months in our wireless keyboard and 4 x to 6 x longer in our Wiimote than standard , non-rechargeable alternatives .
Lo and behold , the options from both Sanyo and Energizer lined up almost exactly , with no significant delta to report between any of them .
Boring , we know , but it 's true .
Both Energizer 's batteries and the four Eneloops mustered around 350 flash shots ( give or take a few in either direction based on weather , frequency of flashing and the alignment of the moon ) , and we 're still waiting for our wireless keyboard to grow exhausted after three solid months of use .
So , if each of these align in terms of performance , what 's the difference in cost ?
Excellent question , Watson .
A four - pack of PowerGenix cells can be had right now for around $ 11 , with a four - pack + charger bundle selling for $ 23 .
A four - pack of Energizer 2300 mAh rechargeables is going for $ 12 , with a similar charger + batteries bundle going for around $ 20 .
Sanyo's Eneloop batteries can be found in like configurations for $ 10 and $ 21 , respectively .
Suddenly , this feels a lot like trying to choose a WWAN card when every major US carrier charges the exact same rate per month .
In reality , any of these three will serve you well , and if you 're a heavy battery user , these kits will pay for themselves in just a month or two .
We 'd give Sanyo 's alternatives the edge due to having twice the recharge longevity ( reported , anyway ) than the closest rival , but if you spot a deal on any of the three , click the buy button and never look back .
( Chico , CA ) – Sierra Nevada Jack and Ken ’s Ale has received TTB approval .
Here is the beer description from Sierra30.com : “ Jack McAuliffe is the original microbrewer .
McAuliffe ’s tiny New Albion Brewery in Sonoma , California inspired countless brewers to start small - scale breweries of their own .
Jack agreed to guest brew this very special ale with us in honor of our 30th anniversary .
This American barleywine is a nod to the big ales New Albion served at their legendary summer solstice parties .
It is robust and complex – brewed with 100 % American Cascade hops . ”
The official site projects a release date of mid-July though the second beer in the series was delayed so the dates are certainly tentative .
There is a lengthy piece on the life and times of McAuliffe up on CraftBeer.com .
The article also discusses McAuliffe ’s role in the recent collaboration and the beer itself :
“ According to Sierra Nevada spokesman Bill Manley , the beer known as Jack and Ken ’s
Ale contains two - row Pale , Crystal and roasted barley malts , Northern Brewer , Cascade , Cluster and Brewers Gold hops and the house ale yeast . [… ]
Sierra Nevada will produce about 1,000 barrels of the barleywine ( compare that with the 450 annual barrels produced by New Albion in its heyday ) [… ] ”
Interview with Former Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz ' We Should Reduce Our Military Dependency on Israel '
Relations between Israel and Turkey are strained to the breaking point following last Monday 's raid by Israeli forces on an aid convoy heading to the Gaza Strip .

A few weeks ago I put a question on my Facebook and Twitter pages about what kind of chickens to do next .
There were tons of answers , but my favorites were a Zulu warrior and a Jungle Commando .
They ’ve both been finished for a little while now , but I wanted to wait until I was absolutely sure the oil paint was dry before placing them on my scanner — when I scanned Hanamachi I thought she was dry , but a bit of paint got smeared onto the glass — which is why I ’m only posting the Zulu now .
The Commando will be a bit longer , as the surface is still a bit tacky and I do n’t want to have to clean my scanner again .
For now , enjoy this one , and feel free to wait in anticipation for the next one , once it ’s dry in a few days .

Every Thursday just after midday Hajar Rostami leaves her small flat in the east of Tehran and makes the 12 - mile journey to Behesht - e - Zahra cemetery on the outskirts of the Iranian capital .
When she arrives the 48 - year - old picks her way through the sea of tombs and headstones until she reaches the grave of her middle daughter , Neda Agha -Soltan .
There are normally people gathering around the simple monument and Rostami passes round a notebook so that they can write down their memories of her daughter , before laying fresh flowers and tending the grave .
But even here the mourners are not left in peace .
At a discreet distance , two officials from the Iranian secret police watch as the scene unfolds .
It is almost a year since Rostami 's daughter was killed during an anti-government protest in her home city of Tehran .
Her death has transformed the lives of the family she left behind .
Neda 's final moments were captured on jerky mobile phone footage and within hours the grisly images became the defining moment of the thwarted uprising against the Iranian regime – and a rallying point for a movement in need of a hero .
Since then Neda – and her very public death – have become an internet phenomenon and her image has been printed on placards and brandished at demonstrations around the world .
But back at the small first - floor flat that she shared with her mother , father and brother it is clear that Neda 's posthumous fame has not eased the family 's pain .
" We were not mother and daughter , " says Rostami as she busies herself in the kitchen .
" We were two friends .
Anything that happened , she used to come to me . "
She pauses before adding : " I used to tell her that if I 'm ever ill , bring me to Shariati hospital .
I never believed that we would be bring her to Shariati hospital to die .
I used to tell her to bring tuberose flowers to my grave .
I never believed that I would be bringing tuberose flowers to her grave . "
During the month that Guardian journalist Saeed Kamali Dehghan spent with Neda 's family to film the documentary For Neda , a picture emerged of a typical young Iranian woman .
Neda enjoyed new fashions and make - up , she went to the gym and loved dancing .
She was fiercely independent and a voracious reader whose favourite novel was Emily Brontë 's Wuthering Heights .
Sitting around the kitchen table , this is the way her family remember her – not as a symbol of the resistance but as a dynamic and determined woman , quick to laugh and quick to stand up for what she believed in .
" She was always very brave and defended herself , " says Rostami .
" She was given the nickname Tayeb [ after a 1970s South Tehran street tough ] .
All the children in the streets were afraid of Neda , because she was so strong .
Even her older sister , Hoda , deferred to her . "
Neda married her first love , Amir , in her early 20s but his family 's social conservatism grated against Neda 's more liberal background , and the couple drifted apart .
They remained on good terms , but eventually divorced , and Neda returned to the family home , where she grew close to her 23 - year - old brother , Mohammed .
They shared a passion for music – he used to play the guitar and she used to sing .
A few weeks before she died they went shopping for a piano that he now plays twice a day " to remember her " – once in the morning before leaving for work and once at night .
" I can't still believe that she 's gone – when I play the piano I feel she 's here in this room , " says Mohammed .
" First we were brothers and sisters but in recent years we were like two friends , we had the same group of friends , we used to go to same parties . "
Until last year 's disputed elections Neda had never shown any interest in politics and she and Mohammed used to spend time dancing and going to underground parties .
Since his sister 's death Mohammed has vowed not to cut his hair or beard .
" On the last day of her life , in the morning , we met each other and I had no time to shave and at that time my hair was longer than usual .
She said that she liked me this way , with a beard and long hair .
Since her death , I could n't shave neither my hair nor my beard . "
Neda 's death has also left a hole in her mother 's life .
Unusually in Iranian culture she has decided to keep her daughter 's bedroom exactly as Neda had left it : Neda 's favourite teddy bears are scattered on the bed , a poster of Dire Straights guitarist Mark Knopfler hangs on the wall , her make - up bag is open on the dresser .
But the political circumstances surrounding her daughter 's death have also had an impact on Rostami .
As an Iranian housewife concerned predominantly with her children and their wellbeing she had never shown much interest in politics .
Over the last 12 months she has been thrust into the maelstrom of opposition politics in Iran .
" I 'm not a politician , I 'm a very ordinary Iranian mother , but since Neda 's death I had to keep myself updated by the political news , I can't remain indifferent to what 's happening in my country . "
Rostami now speaks to other mothers who have lost children at the hands of the authorities , attends women 's rights meetings and gives online interviews .
" Because of the world attention to Neda 's death , her story is spread around the world , " she says .
" But what about the story of those others who were killed , raped and tortured after the election and nobody knows about ? "
The authorities take a dim view of her new life and Rostami suspects her home is watched and that the regime monitors her phone calls and keeps tabs on who she meets .
But the family believes the prominence of the case means the government has no choice but to keep its distance .
" The more the government tries to stop people from remembering Neda , the more her story spreads among people , " says Rostami .
Neda lies buried at Behesht - e - Zahra , Iran 's largest cemetery , and a place synonymous with the country 's " martyrs " – the hundreds of thousands of young men killed in the Iran - Iraq war .
Her grave has been desecrated several times .
But Rostami remains defiant .
She says she will not be intimidated and claims the regime is scared her daughter is becoming a martyr for a new generation .
" Although Neda has been murdered and is dead , they are still afraid of her , they come to the graveyard and want to kill her again .
She 's dead but her memory is getting brighter and brighter every day . "
Improved version
An improved version of this path tracer is available here .
The experiment
Click to start .
If it does n't work in your browser and it's not IE or Opera , please write a comment .
The output of the javascript error console would be very helpful too .
Path tracing
Path tracing is a way of solving the rendering equation using monte carlo integration .
It is a form of ray tracing .
According to wikipedia ' Path tracing is the simplest , most physically - accurate and slowest rendering method ' .
Sounds like the perfect target for a javascript experiment !
Implementation
My implementation is currently only calculating the diffuse term of the rendering equation .
The only light source is the sky .
The big sky speeds up the rendering and convergence quite a lot .
The sourcecode is split up into two files .
main.js is the glue for initializing the workers and aggregating the results .
worker.js is where you 'll find the real meat .
I 'm spawning four workers right now to take advantage of modern multicore cpus .
Feel free to ask questions if something is unclear .
Performance
As you can tell from the sourcecode it is clearly not optimized for performance .
What is still interesting though is how various webbrowsers perform .
On my Intel Core i7 machine google chrome ( 4.1 ) is roughly 26 times faster than firefox ( 3.6 ) !
Chrome does 13 iterations /s , Firefox does 0.5 .
Also firefox seems to support only 3 workers , this leaves one core almost idle .
The dev version of chrome is even faster at 18.75 iterations / s.
My congratulations to the chrome and v8 developers .
I hope firefox will catch up soon .
Twitter
On a side note , I created a twitter account for those who prefer it over the rss / atom feeds .
Update
I found a little bug in the code that affected the performance .
I 'm now getting more than 20.5 iterations / s in chrome dev .
I think a faster random function would make it even faster .
The State of Secession
Our first guest post comes from William Miller , founder of Secession News , a daily news - feed of secession related stories and commentary .
He also maintains Secession University , an online resource for secession related material .
–Editor
Partly due to the efforts of the 2009 version of “ Let a Thousand Nations Bloom , ” I started a small service , SecessionNews.com , described by some as a “ Drudge Report ” of secession .
For a year now , I have reviewed each day ’s relevant and significant ( at least , in my opinion ) secession - related articles and news reports .
In doing so , I have read well over 1,000 online articles and posted excerpts from more than 500 of those that I believed would be of value and benefit to anyone interested in the topic .
With a year ’s worth of reading articles and thousands of their related comments , I have acquired some instinct as to the mood of the country on the idea of seceding from an all - too - intrusive and abusive federal government .
Therefore , after a year of being fully immersed in the subject , I offer my modest view on the current state of secession in these not - so - united States of America .
Before getting to the meat of it , I ’ll say it straight away :
It has not been a good year for the notion of secession .
One might think that due to the calamity of the current socialist movement in Washington , the public would be clamoring for workable solutions — say , withdrawing from such government — but so far , the public reaction has been more consternation than action .
That ’s not to say there have n’t been some very positive and noteworthy developments .
Chief among them are the slate of secessionist candidates running for statewide offices in Vermont .
While we must wait until November to gauge the support of Vermonters for an independent and free Vermont , it would be an upset of major proportions should any of them win .
[ Our hope is that they at least make a respectable run of it . ]
Another positive development of significance has been the advancement of secession scholarship by the likes of Russell Longcore ( DumpDC.com ) and Timothy Baldwin ( LibertyDefenseLeague.com ) .
Their thoughtful insights and prolific writing on the subject have lifted the level of discourse and advanced the cause with common sense and logic .
If you spend much time at all pursuing the blogs where discussions of secession are crackling , you often will find little common sense or logic ; therefore , the frequent reflective opines from Longcore and Baldwin become noteworthy .
That is not to say , however , that a number of others have not written thoughtfully and well on the subject , too .
On the national stage , economist and modern thinker Walter Williams did speak favorably of secession to a huge radio audience when he filled in for Rush Limbaugh a month or so ago .
While many like me hold the reasoned opinions of Williams in higher esteem than Limbaugh ’s , he does n’t have the same cachet , does n’t garner the same attention , so his refreshing comments went largely unnoticed by the media .
The same can be said for Judge Andrew Napolitano ’s fearless defense of both secession and nullification on his Fox Business show as well as when he fills in for Glenn Beck .
Unfortunately , the likes of Limbaugh , Beck , and Hannity are much too comfortable with their preeminence to risk the blowback that secessionist talk would bring .
And that , my friends , epitomizes the current state of secession in these un-united States :
It ’s just much too hot of an issue for the politically timid to handle .
Talk of withdrawing from the Compact in the presence of politicians and media elites is akin to raising the Confederate battle flag at an NAACP meeting .
This makes it quite significant that , while not directly secession - related , the idea of nullification has experienced such a truly remarkable rise in acceptance — and application .
A growing number of states are now in various stages of approving state sovereignty bills , effectively nullifying a number of federal encroachments , including ObamaCare , medical marijuana , federal gun laws , and the REAL ID Act .
The implication of this movement cannot be overstated , since it re-legitimizes the long - forgotten sovereign authority of the states .
Public approval of something that , until recently , could have been equated to “ heresy ” means nullification could very well be the first step to the public ’s acceptance of its first cousin , secession , as another valid option to blunt an abusive federal government .
The public need not be convinced of the necessity of full withdrawal from the Union , mind you .
Just the threat of it might be all that ’s needed .
Perhaps my pessimistic view is clouded by the contrast I routinely see with secessionist movements bubbling up in one foreign country after another .
This past year has seen many areas outside the United States openly debate and consider the option of seceding .
Currently , nearly 50 developed and undeveloped countries throughout the world have active secessionist movements , and surprisingly , in the most substantial cases , the United States government generally supports those wanting to secede .
The most amazing contrast exists between the attitudes of the citizenry in third - world and first - world countries .
The concept of withdrawing from an oppressive government is accepted by the public in the less developed countries , whereas the “ sophisticated ” public here in the United States deems secession to be unconstitutional at best and even treasonous by many , demanding that the people remain shackled to their government , no matter how tyrannical it may become .
Yet many Americans feel increasingly oppressed by their government , as witnessed by their ongoing gatherings of protest , waving their “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” flags .
One of these rallies brought on perhaps the most earthshaking event of the past year , when some in the crowd began shouting “ Secede , ” and Texas Governor Rick Perry responded , “ We ’ve got a great union .
There ’s absolutely no reason to dissolve it .
But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people , you know , who knows what might come out of that . ”
At first , one might think this was a positive development for the idea of secession — a governor supposedly egging on his state to secede .
But in reality , the reaction to Perry ’s words turned out to be a setback for the public ’s acceptance of this most sovereign right .
First , the governor did n’t call for secession , and actually praised the Union , saying , “ There ’s absolutely no reason to dissolve it . ”
Granted , he did seem to accept the right of Texas to secede ( a momentous statement for a governor to make ) , even though he did n’t actually say that secession was an absolute right .
This rather innocuous statement resulted in a tsunami of negative reaction that still resonates today .
Virtually every article related to Governor Perry mentioned something akin to , “ Governor Perry called for secession during … . ”
The result of this overreaction was to strike fear into any and all politicians whenever the subject of withdrawing from the Union was broached .
It ’s as if secession is now the new “ third rail ” of politics , never to be mentioned , much less supported .
The problem with secession in this country is the widespread ignorance of the public on the right to secede .
This fact was reinforced just the other day when a Rasmussen poll reported that only 18 percent of the public believed a state had the right to secede .
A year ago , according to a Zogby poll , one - third of the public believed a state had that right .
It was n’t that they were asked if their state should secede , just if they had the right to do so — a very disappointing indictment of the American education system .
Here in Charleston , where I write these words only a few blocks from where South Carolina seceded in 1860 , great fear gripped the city ’s timid and weak leadership this year when it came to proposals for memorializing the sesquicentennial of perhaps the most significant event in this city ’s history — approving the Ordinance of Secession .
It all began when a group wanted to establish a memorial to that event and to those that signed the ordinance , but no official could be found with the courage to back the idea .
Yet , the top contender for the biggest disappointment of the year is the Tea Party movement .
These good folks are sincere , but they have misplaced ideas as to the best solution for tyrannical government .
Somehow , they have convinced themselves that sending “ better ” politicians into the quagmire of corruption called Washington will solve our problems .
Not only do they shun workable solutions such as nullification and secession , but they actively disparage such Founder - like efforts .
An example of such can be found on the Austin Tea Party website where they proudly proclaim , “ We do not support secession . ”
Despite such negative developments , I do remain positive about the outlook for the coming year .
As the nullification movement gains strength , we may benefit from their coattails .
As the public becomes more aware of the sovereign rights and authority of our states , they could also become more accepting of the sovereign right of a state to withdraw from a Compact that has been repeatedly violated by the federal government .
Those who are already in the ranks of the sovereign - rights advocates can help advance the cause of secession .
It is simple , only takes a few minutes of time , and could actually be great fun .
Here ’s how :
When you finish reading an article supporting or rejecting the idea of secession , become a part of the conversation .
Endorse the informed .
Correct the clueless .
If enough of us do this , the public just might become aware of the duty that their state has to reject an abusive and tyrannical government .
Perhaps then , next year ’s report on “ The State of Secession ” will have a few more victories to celebrate .
Two second - half goals gave Mexico their first ever victory over France to leave El Tri well - placed to make the last 16 and the 2006 runners - up on the verge of elimination .
Mexico were the brighter of the two throughout but were unable to take any of their chances until just after the hour , when substitute Javier Hernandez broke the offside trap and rounded keeper Hugo Lloris before slotting home .
Another Mexican substitute , the 37 - year - old Cuauhtemoc Blanco , sealed the victory from the penalty spot after a third replacement , Pablo Barrera , had been felled in the box .
It leaves Mexico level at the top of Group A with Uruguay and a draw between those two sides in their final game in Rustenburg would send France out of the tournament .
Mexico and France met in the first ever World Cup finals match in Montevideo , Uruguay in 1930 , with Les Bleus cruising to a 4 - 1 victory , but this keenly contested encounter was never likely to reproduce such a scoreline .
Both teams showed greater endeavour than in their drawn opening games , with France in particular looking more lively , but for long periods neither possessed the cutting edge to truly punish their opponents .
The French squad is reportedly in disarray , with suggestions of a training ground bust - up between coach Raymond Domenech and midfielder Florent Malouda , who was not selected for their uninspired 0 - 0 draw with Uruguay , and they have been criticised by former midfielder Zinedine Zidane .
However , Malouda was recalled in place of Yoann Gourcuff in a line - up that kept faith with a world class strike - force , spearheaded by Nicolas Anelka , that has failed to register an international goal since last November .
Malouda showed rare glimpses of the form he showed throughout last season for Chelsea , forcing Mexico keeper Oscar Perez to palm over early in the second half , having earlier begun a free - kick routine straight off the training ground that saw Frank Ribery flash a drive across goal .
This was the closest Ribery would come to affecting the game from his central playmaker role and , as against Uruguay , Anelka was largely anonymous and was replaced at half - time by Andre - Pierre Gignac , who also offered little in his 45 minutes on the pitch .
Mexico 's attack is exciting but too often lightweight .
Their forwards missed numerous chances in their opening 1 - 1 draw with hosts South Africa but all three players retained their place in the side - although Arsenal striker Carlos Vela was forced off with an injury on the half hour with only one skied shot to his name .
Another member of their attacking triumvirate , Tottenham 's Giovani Dos Santos , produced another lively display to match the one he produced against South Africa and , but for Patrice Evra 's presence , would have been able to get greater purchase on a shot that bobbled wide just before half - time .
Mexico's chief offensive weapon in the first half was left - back Oscar Salcido , who regularly found himself in advanced positions , but his execution could not match his intent .
He had two good shooting opportunities in the first half but from the first he shot wide of the far post from 25 yards , and then saw a close - range effort blocked by France keeper Lloris after William Gallas had inexplicably backed away from Salcido 's run .
The opening of the second half had seen a clear dip in quality from what had been a decent first 45 minutes , but two positive Mexican substitutes - Hernandez and Blanco - altered that , with a third , Vela 's replacement Barrera , also playing a part .
In the 64th minute , Marquez chipped a ball forward from midfield , Eric Abidal played the Manchester United - bound striker onside and with the French defence static and begging for offside , Hernandez was able to advance onwards , skip round Lloris and slot into the vacated goal .
France 's response was meek at best but the Mexicans , by now full of confidence , continued to press and were rewarded when Barrera was tripped and Blanco charged in from outside the box to dispatch his penalty into the right - hand corner of the net .
OLD BRIDGE , New Jersey ( Reuters ) - A New Jersey woman is waging a campaign to become the world ’s heaviest living woman , admitting that she is as hungry for attention as she is for calorie - rich food .
Donna Simpson , 42 , weighs more than 600 pounds ( 272 kg ) and aims to reach 1,000 pounds ( 455 kg ) .
The mother of two children , ages 3 and 14 , models on a website called supersizedbombshells.com , where admirers and the curious can pay to watch videos of her eating greasy foods or walking to the car .
She has appeared in television interviews and said she welcomes media coverage .
A Guinness World Records spokeswoman said Simpson has submitted a claim for the title of world ’s heaviest woman to give birth , a claim that is being reviewed .
Among the heaviest women ever recorded was one who reportedly weighed 1,800 pounds ( 816 kg ) and another who reportedly weighed 1,200 pounds ( 545 kg ) at the time of their deaths .
Simpson said she has received a book offer and wants her own reality show , partly to give plus - size women more confidence .
She wears size XXXXXL clothing , which she buys mostly online , and calls herself a member of the “ fat acceptance community . ”

“ The bigger your butt is , the bigger belly you have , the sexier you are , ” Simpson said , lounging on the couch of her suburban home 40 miles south of New York .
Simpson has found a man who says he appreciates her size , and they plan to marry in Hawaii this year .
She said airlines are being accommodating of her needs .
Her fiancee , 49 - year - old Philippe Gouamba and the father of her 3 - year - old daughter , said he not only finds Simpson attractive but is also one of Simpson ’s biggest supporters in her quest to expand her girth .
“ You look at her curves and see her full belly and generous hips , ” Gouamba said .
“ It ’s very sexy . ”
Simpson said she gets e-mails from women who think they will never fall in love or have children because of their weight .
“ I just say that ’s not true , ” Simpson said .
“ I would love to be a voice , so that people can see a woman of size having a regular family . ”
Slideshow ( 10 images )
She said she also receives mail from people who say she is putting herself and her children at risk .
Simpson spends as much as $ 750 a week on groceries , suffers from Type 2 diabetes and struggles with basic tasks such as cooking and taking a shower .
But she dismisses critics who warn that her weight can lead to heart problems , aggravate her diabetes and cause pressure on her joints .
“ I ’m very healthy .
I go to the doctor every three months , ” she said .
Simpson has battled weight issues all her life and was mercilessly teased .
But after a friend died following complications from gastric bypass surgery , she decided to quit the dieting and the weight pills and eat what she wanted .
“ I ’ve always been comfortable with myself , ” she said .
“ It was just everybody else that was n’t comfortable with me . ”
Hybrids are taking over the automotive space one model at a time with companies like Ford , GM , Honda and Toyota leading the way .
As expected the world ’s super car builders have been a little slow off the mark here , a little reticent to move away from the V8 , V10 and V12 internal combustion power houses that have made them the desire of schoolboys right through to grandfathers the world over .
But as the saying goes , the times are changing , super car makers Lamborghini announced last year through CEO Stephan Winkelmann that a hybrid Lamborghini is on the way and slated for a 2015 release .
Ferrari have been busy showing off their questionably aphid coloured 599 KERS car at any motorshow that will have it and Porsche has been touting its brain meltingly cool 918 Spyder in a similar fashion , we also know that Bugatti is working on an 800 bhp hyper car as we speak .
This list of marques would be impressive in its own right however we ’re only just halfway there , Jaguar is working on a hybrid XJ model , Aston Martin are said to be working on a hybrid Lagonda , Mercedes - Benz is hard at work on a hybrid version of its C - Class coupe and a beautiful concept car called the F800 and BMW have been showing off their EfficientDynamics hybrid concept car that is widely believed to be a test bed for future BMW sports hybrid models .
The fact that all of these manufacturers have begun walking down the same path towards a hybrid high performance power train is great news however , somewhat interestingly , they are all taking slightly different routes .
Ferrari is developing KERS , Lamborghini is working on a Prius style hybrid system and Porsche is going with an all out plug - in hybrid with the 918 Spyder .
It ’ll be interesting to watch the evolution of the hybrid super car market , in a world where performance is everything it could prove to be the ideal testing ground for technologies we end up seeing in everyday sedans by 2020 .

Previously by Richard Daughty : Guarding Your Money from Government Onslaughts
To show you how things get around , I get this from Ed Steer ’s Gold & Silver Daily , which linked to an essay by Adrian Ash , at bullionvault.com , posted over at safehaven.com , and bearing the title  Gold Gets All Political . 
The thrust is that , as Mr. Steer says ,  Adrian floats the disturbing possibility that governments , looking around for easy sources of revenue , may decide to tax the private ownership of gold . 
Well , I am happy to be the go - to guy when it comes to questions like this , and I am happy that I can put Adrian ’s fears to rest .
He can rest assured that the government will tax the private ownership of gold , and everything else , too , highly reminiscent of the phrase in the Declaration of Independence that reads that the government has erected a multitude of new offices , and send hither swarms of officers to harass our people , and eat out their substance  which , at this point in time since 1789 , is 1 out of 5 workers who are paid from the collection of taxes , and a large system of governments which spends more than half of all income , and spends up to two - thirds of all income if the cost of compliance with government regulations is included !
Nullification : How to ... Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 8.34 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
Everything will be taxed , as things are already bad , as easily seen in an essay by Mike  Mish  Shedlock , of Global Economic Analysis , who writes that the government got less tax revenue remitted , spending went up despite it , thus the budget deficit is rising , the national debt is rising , and all in a pretty dramatic way , too , as he writes ,  The excess of spending over revenue rose to $ 82.7 billion last month compared with a $ 20.9 billion gap in April 2009 .
It was the second April deficit since 1983 . 
In fact , he says ,  April marked a record 19th straight monthly shortfall , highlighting the challenges facing the Obama administration ,  which shows that Mr. Shedlock is mellowing , as he knows , better than most of us , that we are Seriously , Seriously Screwed ( SSS ) , and calling such an unstoppable horror a challenge seems like a joke , and it must be , because it made me smile !
Anyway , more evidence of a certain mellowing in Mr. Shedlock is found when he says ,  Deterioration in the government ’s balance sheet in coming years raises the risk of higher interest rates even as an improving economy helps lift tax receipts ,  which does n’t even sound like him !
The Dollar Meltdown : S... Goyette , Charles Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 4.00 ( as of 04:10 EST - Details )
He says raises the risk when he knows exactly why interest rates would rise ; inflation in prices !
The buying power of the dollar will be falling as a result of all that creation of more money , and the buyers of bonds want to be compensated for that loss , and they will demand higher interest rates to get it .
Well , he does not want to get into that inflation - prediction  swamp with me , and instead said ,  The government has reported budget surpluses in 43 of the past 56 Aprils ,  which is pretty remarkable , but not as remarkable as the fact that  The last time the US had back - to - back April deficits was 1963 — 1964 . 
1963 — 1964 ?
Yow !
I leap involuntarily to my feet , my Powerful Mogambo Brain ( PMB ) whirling in shock when I ominously notice that this is exactly when the long bear market of 1964 — 1982 began !
Yikes !
 Anyway ,  you are perhaps thinking to yourself , maybe it is not as bad as all that , and maybe with a little sense of proportion and dispassion , qualities completely alien to this Mighty Mogambo Moron ( MMM ) , we could discern a small ray of sunshine , whereas he sees nothing but gloom and despair at every turn , like when he turns around and sees one of the kids looking at him while holding a butcher knife , and when he asks ,  What are you doing with that butcher knife ? ’ and the kid says ,  Nothing .
Yet .’
If you think that , then I laugh in Rude Mogambo Scorn ( RMS ) at you , because for one thing , none of my kids is stupid enough to use a knife to attack an angry , paranoid guy who is , as they say , packing heat ,  and for another thing , I am laughing in RMS so hard that I cannot even find the breath to begin to tell you why I make such sport of you !
Hahahaha !
For that , I turn again to Mr. Shedlock , who says the particulars are that , compared to the same month last year ,  Revenue and other income fell 7.9 percent ,  which is a huge drop , although we are still looking at a cumulative $ 245.3 billion in revenue since October .
For reasons that I can only guess are , at the root , a result of the Federal Reserve creating so much money and buying up so much debt and assets from corporations of one sort or another that  Corporate tax receipts totaled $ 77.1 billion for the year to date , an increase of 8.9 percent ,  which seems fairly remarkable in a kind of lying , thieving scumbag kind of way .
The bad news is about us workaday sweat - hogs out here in the real world , doing our stupid jobs while also performing most of the duties of all of the people who were laid off in management ’s continually desperate cost - cutting  strategies , including the only people who knew what they were doing , and now things are hopelessly screwed up , and we are getting whacked , as evidenced by the fact that  Individual income tax collections were down 11.6 percent so far this fiscal year to $ 500.8 billion . 
See what I mean ?
Our incomes are down by almost 12 % !
Wow !
Whacked !
All in all , I do n’t know what , but Something Very Bad ( SVB ) is going to happen before long , which is about how long it will be before gold and silver shoot up in price !
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !

Occasionally poignant , frequently inexplicable , and ALWAYS ludicrous , it is my belief that we should assault the acceptable as though it were totally unbelievable .
A new patent application from Apple describes a new , secure method of digital rights management that would identify the authenticity of a device based on the unique physical emission properties of a " particle gun . "
The application , entitled " System and Method for Authentication Based on Particle Gun Emissions , " was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office this week .
It states that current DRM methods for authentication , but by their nature they can lack security .
" Allowing initial information to be recovered from final information is a major flaw in cryptography systems since the objective of cryptographic systems is to protect the initial information , " the application reads .
" Many authentication systems exist .
Accordingly , what is needed in the art is an improved way to perform authentication , such that it is impossible to extract initial information from final information . "
Apple 's solution would employ a particle gun , which would send an emission with unique physical properties to a receiver which would be able to verify the authenticity .
The receiver would then generate a second value , and compare it with the first .
" Generating the first and second values is based at least in part on input data that provides physical emission properties of the particle gun including at least one of initial speed , electromagnetic fields , mass , electronic charge and time , " it says .
" The method of authenticating based on physical particle gun emissions makes it difficult to recover initial input from output values . "
The application describes the particle gun as a device with a pair of conductive plates that generate two separate , independent and uniform electromagnetic fields .
The physical properties of the particles generated would be calculated based on time , mass , initial velocity , electromagnetic field intensity , and the orientation of the particles when they leave the gun .
These properties would allow both the sender and receiver to create an identical " secret " code that would be extremely difficult to crack , ensuring security .

PORTLAND’S HISTORIC NORSE HALL – HOME TO MEMORIES & DREAMS SINCE 1928
Norse Hall was built and dedicated in 1928 by Norwegian immigrants , members of Grieg Lodge , and has served the Lodge and the community as a home and cultural center ever since .
Located just across the Willamette River from the city ’s downtown core in the vibrant Lower East Burnside neighborhood , Norse Hall is among the last remaining original ‘ ethnic halls ’ in Portland .
It features one of the finest ballrooms in town , a large stage , two dining rooms and kitchens , spacious meeting room , beautiful library , Nordic arts showcase and comfortable lounge .
The building was designed by well - known Portland architect Elmer Feig , and covers a quarter of a city block at 111 N.E. 11th & Couch Street .
It is available for use by the community on a private basis .
Recently 2 Chronicles 7:14 has became the central verse for mobilizing the Religious Right … and it happened not long after President Obama won the White House :
If my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land .
Ever since Obama and the Democrats took over , the Religious Right has become convinced that the election was the result of our nation ’s wickedness and the only way to cast off this curse is for its people to humble themselves and plead with God to heal our land .
Thus , this passage has been the foundation of Janet Porter ’s May Day 2010 Prayer Rally , the Global Day of Prayer , the National Day of Prayer , and the FRC ’s upcoming Call 2 Fall event .
And it was also the central theme of Richard Land ’s recent address to FRC ’s Watchmen on the Wall conference , where he warned that without revival , this country was on its way to becoming fundamentally unrecognizable :
Ted and Gayle Haggard , banished by the church they started when his relationship with a male prostitute and alleged drug purchases were revealed , today said they will start a new church , St. James , that will be open to all .
“ St. James is a church for sinners — for people who have hit rock bottom and people who want to help people who have hit rock bottom , ” Ted Haggard said .
“ It is not a gathering for the righteous , except those who are righteous by faith . ”
St. James Church will be more casual than New Life Church , the Colorado Springs Evangelical megachurch the Haggards founded in their home some 30 years ago .
“ Everybody is welcome : Democrats , Republican , Independents , gays , straights , tall , short , addicts and recovering addicts , ” Haggard said .
Gayle Haggard will also be preaching at this church , they said .
The pair also anticipates providing counseling for “ people in the worst crisis of their lives .
“ I think I am qualified to hold their hand , ” he said .
The church will launch Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Haggards ’ home , when potential congregants are invited to talk , play and share food together , he said .
On June 13 , they will meet again at the Haggards ’ home for what he called a planning party .
By then , they expect to know if their potential group includes “ 20 , 200 or 2,000 , ” he said .
The Haggards held two prayer meetings at their home in November , which attracted more than 100 people each time — overflow crowds for the couple ’s living room and even their second venue , the barn .
Haggard was founder and senior pastor at New Life for 25 years until revelations about his extramarital sex life in 2006 led to what he has called his exile in Arizona .

Bruins Sign Andrew Ference to Three - Year Extension by Staff Writer / Boston Bruins
BOSTON , MA – Boston Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli announced today that the club has signed defenseman Boston Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli announced today that the club has signed defenseman Andrew Ference to a three - year contract extension through the 2013 - 14 NHL season .
Per club policy , financial terms of the deal will not be disclosed .
The 31 - year - old Ference is a veteran of 569 regular season NHL games and has compiled 24 goals , 117 assists and 141 points in his 10 NHL seasons .
This season marked Ference 's fourth with the Bruins , as he was traded from Calgary to Boston with Chuck Kobasew for Brad Stuart , Wayne Primeau , and a 2008 fourth round pick on February 10 , 2007 .
He has appeared in 50 games this year for the Black & Gold and has tallied eight assists .
In his three plus years with the Bruins , Ference has played in 182 games and registered 3 - 29 - 32 totals and 137 PIM .
Ference enjoyed his best seasons offensively with the Flames , including a career high of 27 assists and 31 points in 2005 - 06 while also matching his season high in goals with four that year .
Despite playing in a career low 47 games last year with Boston , he still matched the second best offensive year of his career with 15 assists and 16 points in that campaign .
He was originally drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the eighth round ( 208th overall ) of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft .
He played four - plus seasons in the Penguins organization at both the NHL and minor league levels before being sent to Calgary for a 2004 third round draft pick on February 10 , 2003 .
An avid environmentalist , Ference is one of the most active Bruins in the community as he has been involved in a number of charitable causes in the Greater Boston area and worldwide .
He spearheaded the NHLPA 's Carbon Neutral Challenge , whereby players offset the carbon emissions through their hockey related travel with Gold Standard Credits which put money back into renewable energy projects , donated half of his 2009 playoff bonus to the New England Grassroots Environmental Fund , served as a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority encouraging the use of public transportation , spoke about environmental issues at Canada 's New Democratic Party 's National Convention this past August and acts as an athlete ambassador for the Right To Play organization .

Mongolia , located between the nations of Russia and China , is one of the few vast landlocked nations in the world where a roving life still exists .
One of the popular tribe capitals in Mongolia is Bulgan .
You can find a grassy park crowned with pine trees in the middle town .
Because the second largest city in Mongolia is close to Bulgan , this city was n’t given much attention for industrialization and development .
A very few number of jeeps for transportations and hotels can be found in Bulgan .
The weather in Bulgan gets too hot or mostly cloudy so if you plan a travel in Bulgan do not forget to bring your sun protection garments .
Among the things you should bring are sunglasses , umbrella , hats , and sun block lotion .
You can visit the interesting sceneries and landscapes found in Bulgan like the desert nomads , sand dunes , and small lakes .
Going to Bulgan is not quite hard as traffic is not too heavy .
You can get there by getting on a bus , a jeep or a minivan .
When there are quite a lot of passengers , minivans and jeeps travel within Ulaanbaatar to Bulgan for eight hours and vise versa but usually people take the overnight one - hour trip by train from Erdenet .
You can select from the two routes going to Bulgan from Ulaanbaatar .
A southern route is the more direct but you will have to go through a rough road via the city of Dashinchilen while the longer paved route in the north part is via Erdenet and Darkhan .

House Republicans today agreed to a sweeping moratorium on all funding requests for pet projects , known as earmarks .
The move , approved in a closed - door meeting , is an escalation of efforts by Democrats and Republicans to claim the higher ground on ethics in advance of November 's midterm congressional elections .
But it also marks aggressive action to clamp down on a controversial practice that critics argue has opened the door to corruption by encouraging lobbyists seeking earmarks for their clients to donate campaign money to lawmakers .
The Republican ban is not permanent but a one - year moratorium on inserting the special projects into spending bills , The Associated Press reports .
The GOP decision comes a day after the Democrats who control the House announced a ban on earmarks directed to private companies .
Democrats said they still would allow lawmakers to direct billions in federal spending to nonprofit and government entities , such as universities .
In a statement today , House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said :
For millions of Americans , the earmark process in Congress has become a symbol of a broken Washington .
Today House Republicans took an important step toward showing the American people we 're serious about reform by adopting an immediate , unilateral ban on all earmarks .
But the more difficult battle lies ahead , and that 's stopping the spending spree in Washington that is saddling our children and grandchildren with trillions of dollars in debt .
Only then will we have succeeded in bringing fundamental change to the way Congress spends taxpayers ' money .
As we reported in today 's paper , how much the new rules will reduce earmark spending is unclear .
Within hours of Wednesday 's announcement by top Democrats , the Senate 's top appropriator , Sen. Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii , voiced opposition .
Earmark foes in the Senate are calling for action in that chamber .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , said he would offer an amendment today to ban all earmarks " until our budget is balanced and we 've eliminated our massive deficit . "
Updated at 2:15 p.m. ET : Steve Ellis , a vocal earmark critic at the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense , said the moves by both parties in the House could reduce the normal " deluge " of earmark requests by individual lawmakers to a " medium size stream . "
There were 1,208 earmarks worth $ 1 billion solely sponsored by House Republicans in the current federal fiscal year , Ellis ' group found .
Democrats said lawmakers directed about 1,000 earmarks worth $ 1.7 billion to private companies this year , a practice now banned by their new rule .
Together , the changes could add up to a " pretty substantial whack " on earmarks , Ellis said .
Why all the rush to change the rules ?
Earmark requests from House members are due Friday to the House Appropriations Committee .

Today ’s Hall of Fame inductions could have been a great day to celebrate , especially with a few ex-Devils possibly getting the nod .
Deserving player Joe Nieuwendyk , who helped the Devils win the Stanley Cup in 2003 , looked to be a near lock .
Pat Burns , a fine coach whose battling cancer , seemed to be a lock for the honor .
But when the votes were tallied , the Hall of Fame voters dropped the ball .
Both Nieuwendyk and Burns were left out of the hall , leaving two of the most qualified candidates on the sidelines .
The Hall of Fame voters are all esteemed writers and knowledgeable people .
They should have seen that these two were the most qualified in their respective categories .
Yet , the voters could n’t come to a consensus on Nieuwendyk , and they completely left out Burns .
Taking a look at their credentials , it was n’t hard to see that the voters dropped the ball on this one .
Nieuwendyk ’s credential alone put him near the top of this year ’s Hall of Fame ballot .
In his rookie year with the Calgary Flames , the center scored 51 goals , becoming one of only five rookies to ever accomplish this feat .
He also took home the Calder Trophy as the best rookie in the league .
In 1989 , Nieuwendyk helped lead the team to a Stanley Cup championship , the first of his storied career .
On December 19 , 1995 , Nieuwendyk was traded from the Calgary Flames to the Dallas Stars .
Four years later , Niewendyk clinched his second Stanley Cup championship .
He also took home the Conn Smythe Trophy that season .
The center was traded to the Devils in 2002 , and hoisted his third Stanley Cup one year later .
Instead of recognizing these achievements , the Hall of Fame voters put in Dino Ciccarelli .
The former North Stars winger tallied 608 goals , good for 16th all time .
But his career is marred with incidents .
In 1988 , he attacked Maple Leaf defenseman Luke Richardson with a stick , earning him $ 1,000 fine and one day in jail .
A year before that , Ciccarelli pled guilty to indecent exposure .
Why a guy who has these ugly incidents can make it to the Hall while a quality player such as Niewendyk I ’ll never know .
The same thinking somehow followed for the decision to exclude Burns from this year ’s Hall of Fame class .
In the “ builder ” category , the Hall of Fame voters decided to go with longtime Detroit executive Jim Devellano and Daryl “ Doc ” Seaman .
Devellano won three Stanley Cups with the Islanders organization as a scout and assistant general manager in the 1980s , then helped to construct and lead the Detroit Red Wings to their past four Stanley Cup championships .
Doc Seaman , a Canadian businessman , became one of six businessman to move the Atlanta Flames to Calgary in 1980 .
Both were integral to the sport , but none of them were as important as Burns .
Continue reading on for more analysis of the Burns decision .
Burns achieved several milestones in his decorated coaching career .
The coach won the Jack Adams award with three different teams – Montreal ( 1989 ) , Toronto ( 1993 ) and Boston ( 1998 ) .
He ’s the only coach to win the Adams in his first year , and he ’s also the only three - time winner .
In his 16 year NHL coaching career , Burns missed only missed the playoffs three times .
He won the 2003 Stanley Cup with the Devils , the first of his career .
While Devellano and Seaman are both important figures , Burns stands as one of the great coaches in NHL history .
His snub shows the utter failure of this year ’s voters .
Why would the voters not honor a great coach in failing health ?
Several players and fans have tried , but the voters are still reluctant .
The voters this season blatantly dropped the ball this year .
Instead of electing in deserving players , such as Nieuwendyk , the voters decided to let a checkered player with great stats earn his way into the Hall .
Instead of voting in a decorated coach , the Hall decided to go with a lesser known owner in his place .
Hopefully , Nieuwendyk and Burns will earn their nominations soon .
But for this season , the voters missed an opportunity and dropped the ball .

One bomb sent a thick pall of smoke over central Baghdad
An attack on the Iraqi central bank in Baghdad has killed 15 people and left more than 50 injured .
The assault began with a bomb blast .
Gunmen then battled with police as they tried to storm the building .
Five gunmen blew themselves up , police said .
The BBC's Jim Muir Baghdad says it is unclear if it was a bank raid , an insurgent attack , or both .
The attack came one day before Iraq 's new parliament was due to hold its first session .
Many of those killed were bank employees , security officials say .
Our correspondent says that in recent months there have been several well - organised attacks on jewellery stores and banks .
US and Iraqi officials have said they are being carried out by insurgent groups desperate to raise cash to finance their operations .
Television pictures showed a column of black smoke rising over Baghdad from the scene of the explosions and ambulances racing through the city streets .
A nearby generator caught fire along with its fuel store sending up a thick pall of black smoke .
Violence has dropped sharply in Iraq since 2006 - 07 , but unrest has simmered since the general election in March produced no outright winner .
A deal between the various parties to form a government and choose a prime minister has not been reached and may still take weeks of negotiations , analysts say .

New technologies are helping close the gaps for those with physical disabilities .
Each day , the physical capabilities that technology gives us is
incredible , and we ’re not just talking about texting friends at
lightening pace , or the ability to see our energy consumption in real
time .
We ’re talking about the abilities given to us by new tech in the
health industry , either to supplement or restore disabilities
experienced by people across the globe .
Technology is giving us wonderful options for those of us with
physical limitations .
From the blind to the deaf , from amputees to burn
victims , gadgets are creating a whole new realm of abilities .
Here are eight extraordinary technologies that hold promise for an easier life .
1 . The Eyewriter
The Eyewriter is an outstanding invention
for people unable to use their limbs .
It is a set of glasses that can
detect where a person ’s eyes are looking , allow them to literally draw
with their eyes .
Created for people diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis ( ALS ) , the designers ’ goal for the Eyewriter project
is to develop the most simple and inexpensive eye - tracking headset
possible and open source the software so that ALS patients around the
world can create art and images on their own .
2 . The Luke Arm
Named as a Star Wars head nod to Luke Skywalker , the Luke arm is one of
the most advanced prosthetic arms ever created .
DARPA , the Defense
Advanced Research Projects
Agency , awarded $ 18 million in funding to
Dean Kamen in 2005 to bring prosthetics into the 21st century , and boy
did he .
The Luke Arm is the first bionic upper limb to provide 18
degrees of freedom , a step up from its ancestors that only offer 3
degrees of freedom .
It can be controlled by wiring the device to
muscles or nerves , or with a foot pedal .
It even has a tactile feedback
sensor in the hand allowing the wearer to sense what kind of pressure
they ’re putting into their grip .
Here is a video of Kamen showing off
the arm earlier this year .

3. A Dozen Different Legs
For amputees who have lost their legs , simply finding a prosthetic leg
that allows them to move comfortably and freely can be a challenge .
But
what if you want to run in a marathon , or have legs that look natural
for a formal event ?
Athlete , fashion model and activist Aimee Mullins
has helped bring the possibilities for amputees to new heights .
She
shows how prosthetic leg design can transform the body into everything
from a work of art to a super athlete , or simply help a person easily
blend in to a social scene .
Here is Aimee during a TED talk on the
possibilities held within designing high tech prosthesis .
4 . Solar Powered Hearing Aids
Hearing aids are helpful for the hard of hearing but they ’re very
expensive , especially when it comes to the batteries .
For people with
little money to spare or limited access to replacement batteries ,
hearing aids are impractical .
That ’s why Howard Weinstein created the Solar Ear ,
a $ 100 hearing aid with a solar powered battery that lasts as long as
three years .
Weinstein is hoping to chip away at the gap between the
600 million people who have hearing loss and the mere 8 million people
who can afford a hearing aid .
On top of providing the gift of sound to those who might otherwise
go without assistance , the Solar Ear project extends help far into the
deaf community through employment opportunities .
All of the employees
working on Solar Ear devices are deaf .
The project is currently in Brazil , Botswana , West Bank Palestine , and will expand to Mexico , China , India , Canada during 2010 .
5 . Regrowing Stereocilia – The Hairs that Help You Hear
Stereocilia , or the tiny hairs inside our ears , are an integral part of
the hearing system .
But overexposure to noise – such as experienced in
music concerts or blasting tunes from an iPod – can permanently damage
them , degrading a person ’s hearing over time .
Researchers at Stanford ,
however , have hit a breakthrough in growing hair - like cells that
function just like those in our ears .
This could mean solutions for
damaged hearing .
advertisement
The research is still about a decade away from offering a solution
that can be used in humans , but the potential is there for helping to
restore hearing to those with noise - induced hearing loss .
6 . Liquid -Filled Eye Glasses
Sometimes low tech is far more effective than elaborate gadgets .
Such
is the case with Josh Silver ’s eyeglasses that adjust to the wearer ’s
correct prescription simply with liquid .
More or less liquid is added
to the lens until the prescription is just right for the wearer .
The
inexpensive glasses address an important need of more than one billion
people in developing nations worldwide who lack access to eyecare .
Here
is Josh Silver demonstrating how the glasses work and the impact they
can have on people , from improving their productivity to their quality
of life .
7 . Printing New Skin Directly onto Wounds
Skin is an organ that protects our bodies from infection , and for burn
victims , it ’s the loss of that protective barrier that is the biggest
threat .
Skin grafts – surgically moving healthy skin from one part of
the body to the burned area – is one way of aiding recovery .
But what
if new skin could be created in an instant , sprayed on like a printer
sprays ink onto a paper ?
Turns out , we can do that .
Researchers at Wake Forest University have created a device that can
spray new skin cells onto burn victims , supplanting skin grafts as the
standard treatment .
The device can be wheeled directly over a patient
in a hospital bed , where a laser takes a reading of the wound ’s shape
and size , and the precise amount of skin cells is applied exactly where
they ’re needed .
“ We literally print the cells directly onto the wound , ” said student
Kyle Binder , who helped design the device .
“ We can put specific cells
where they need to go . ”
advertisement
The device still needs to undergo testing by the FDA for approved use on humans , but it has proven to be effective on mice .
8 . Wheel Chairs Powered by Fuel Cells and Solar Panels
Wheelchair technology has come a long way for getting people around .
Ensuring they have a charge from a sustainable source of energy is part
of that improvement .
Over the last few years , we ’ve seen Fuel Cell ( Hydrogen - Powered ) Wheelchairs and Solar Powered Wheelchairs
pop up as more environmentally friendly ways of charging up the chairs .
While they ’re not the most streamlined of chairs , using off - grid
charging is a big plus and we ’re certain that in the next few years ,
we ’ll see even more innovative and less bulky ways of incorporating
alternative energy into mobility .

Video : Future TED Talkers – A Water Defender and an Urban Farming Pioneer
About 2 - 1/ 2 years ago I wrote an essay for TNR in which I criticized the so - called new atheists ( primarily Sam Harris , Daniel Dennett , Richard Dawkins , and Christopher Hitchens ) .
A few months later , I followed up with a critical take on Bill Maher ’s Religulous .
In both cases , my focus was politics .
There was , I argued , something deeply illiberal about the new atheists ’ intolerant hostility to the spiritual beliefs of their fellow citizens .
I still believe that , as readers of my forthcoming book will discover .
But the more I read and ponder the writings of the new atheists , the more I find myself rejecting them for more fundamental reasons .
To explain why , let me direct your attention to a recent post by Kevin Drum in response to a powerful essay by theologian David B. Hart .
( For a note on my complicated history with Hart , see here . )
Hart ’s essay irritatedly dismissed the new atheists for two defects :
First , they show no sign of confronting and wrestling with ( or even understanding ) the most serious philosophical arguments of the Christian theological tradition ; second , they show an almost complete lack of awareness of all that was gained ( culturally and morally ) by the advent of Christianity and seem blithely unconcerned about what would be lost ( again , culturally and morally ) were it to vanish from the world .
In response , Drum dismisses , and mocks , Hart ’s own attempt to sketch a more philosophically adequate and rigorous account of God than the new atheists typically engage with .
And that leads to the core of my problem with Drum and the rest of the new atheists .
Toward the end of his post , Drum responds to Hart ’s efforts to highlight the positive influence of Christianity by writing that “ to say merely that Christianity is comforting or practical — assuming you believe that — is hardly enough .
You need to show that it 's true . ”
Now , this seems to be exactly what Hart was attempting to do in the very passages of his essay that Drum dismissed and mocked .
But let ’s leave that aside .
What ’s most disappointing is Drum ’s failure to grasp the culminating point of Hart ’s essay , which , as I take it , is this : the statements “ godlessness is true ” and “ godlessness is good ” are distinct propositions .
And yet the new atheists invariably conflate them .
But a different kind of atheism is possible , legitimate , and ( in Hart ’s view ) more admirable .
Let ’s call it catastrophic atheism , in tribute to its first and greatest champion , Friedrich Nietzsche , who wrote in a head - spinning passage of the Genealogy of Morals that “ unconditional , honest atheism is ... the awe - inspiring catastrophe of two - thousand years of training in truthfulness that finally forbids itself the lie involved in belief in God . ”
For the catastrophic atheist , godlessness is both true and terrible .
Now of course
Hart would prefer that kind of tragic atheism .
He ’s a believer , after all .
But the fact is that a number of atheists themselves have staked out a similar position .
Take the example of physicist Steven Weinberg .
In his 1977 book about the earliest origins of the universe ( The First Three Minutes ) , Weinberg stated in passing that “ the more the universe seems comprehensible , the more it seems pointless . ”
When some of his fellow cosmologists objected to the choice of words , accusing him of expressing , if only implicitly , some form of theological nostalgia for a non-scientific view of the world , Weinberg admitted that he is indeed nostalgic — “ nostalgic for a world in which the heavens declared the glory of God . ”
Associating himself with the nineteenth - century poet Matthew Arnold , who likened the retreat of religious faith in the face of scientific progress to the ebbing ocean tide and claimed to detect a “ note of sadness ” in its “ melancholy , long , withdrawing roar , ” Weinberg confessed to his own sorrow in doubting that scientists will find “ in the laws of nature a plan prepared by a concerned creator in which human beings played some special role . ”
When it comes to God , what Weinberg believes to be true and what he wishes to be true simply do not coincide .

In our society of victims , entrepreneurs are blamed for many of the hardships that ail our economy .
Whether it is because of high prices , low wages , or substandard economic conditions , they are often accused of exploitation in their quest for profits .
The real victims in our economy , however , are usually not workers who voluntarily enter contracts to sell their labor nor consumers who voluntarily purchase products and services but instead entrepreneurs who are involuntarily subjected to the not - so - invisible hand of our government caretakers .
Somehow , it seems completely reasonable to overtly exploit entrepreneurs for their resources in the name of preventing the potential exploitation of anyone else .
Legislators often garner popular support for measures that exploit entrepreneurs by citing ostensibly alarming data : Exxon Mobile made $ 45.2 billion in profits in 2008 when gas prices eclipsed $ 4.00 ; they 're price gouging !
The average compensation of Fortune 500 companies in 2009 was $ 9.25 million , yet they 're paying unskilled workers only $ 7.25 ; the minimum wage is too low !
While drawing such illogical conclusions would n't score a teenager any critical - reading points on the SAT , it does help legislators get bills passed in Congress .
A recent victim of the government 's crusade against entrepreneurs is American Samoa , where in 2007 Congress dictated a 61 % increase in its minimum wage as part of the Fair Minimum Wage Act , despite forceful pleas to the contrary from the island of 65,000 .
As the Wall Street Journal recently reported , StarKist , one of Samoa 's largest employers , will reduce its Samoan workforce 60 % by 2011 , which they directly attribute to the new wage floor .
Unfortunately , they are not the only ones scaling back in Samoa ; Chicken of the Sea closed its operations last September , forcing over 2,000 additional Samoans into unemployment .
Congress 's blatant disregard of the market has wreaked havoc on the Samoan workforce .
However , the minimum wage has severe consequences for entrepreneurs as well — the businesses that have n't come into existence , the projects not pursued , and the lost productivity resulting from the Fair Minimum Wage Act are simply unquantifiable .
Still , minimum - wage advocates argue that price floors are necessary to guarantee a " fair " standard of living for all ; however , it is inconsistent to denounce the effects of low wages on employees without equally condemning the effects of high wages on employers .
After all , are there not struggling entrepreneurs who do n’t know whether they ’ll survive from one week to the next ?
Conservative estimates show that only 50 % of new businesses survive five years or more .
It is only logical , therefore , that minimum wage advocates should also support a maximum wage .
Consider the market for heart surgeons .
Clearly , such a highly specialized field requires a great deal of education and skill .
There are plenty of willing buyers and a limited number of sellers , which drives the average annual salary up to over $ 440,000 .
By commanding seemingly " excessive " salaries , are n't doctors exploiting employers ?
After all , a recent analysis of government data by Thomson Reuters showed that 50 % of the nation 's hospitals were losing money .
Should n't the government intervene and demand that doctors offer their services for what the state determines to be a fair price ?
The money saved from capping these salaries could be used to pay higher wages to less skilled workers , such as administrators and janitors ; or better yet , the excess funds could be refunded to patients to lower the costs of their medical bills .
In the realm of imagination , there are no limits to altruism .
Price floors and price ceilings are two sides of the same coin ; both of them are economically irrational and morally unjust .
In practice , the minimum wage only serves to exploit entrepreneurs by mandating how they 're able to allocate private resources , much as a maximum wage would exploit employees by restricting the value of their labor .
Unfortunately , regulating expenses for entrepreneurs is not enough for government , as they also seek to regulate revenue .
In the midst of two wars , a recession , and widespread debate over illegal immigration , Democratic Senators Mary Landrieu and Ben Cardin are sponsoring a bill to eliminate carry - on baggage fees such as the one that Spirit Airlines will begin levying in August , claiming consumers should n't be charged for transporting essential items .
Their assertion is preposterous .
Generally , usage fees like these for carry - on baggage are associated with activities that increase variable expenses for businesses — as marginal consumption of a given product or service increases , so do the expenses incurred by entrepreneurs .
Usage fees are simply a mechanism to adjust prices based on how much a customer consumes .
Those who consume more will pay more ; those who consume less will pay less .
Such a system is both efficient and equitable .
Baggage fees , including those targeted in the Free of Fees For Carry - On Act , serve to charge passengers for consuming scarce resources such as overhead space , cargo space , and fuel , all of which increase costs .
If legislators were to eliminate these fees , airlines would still need to recoup expenses incurred ; thus , higher ticket prices would likely result .
However , under this scenario , the aforementioned costs would be borne by all passengers , regardless of how much of a particular scarce resource they consume .
Such a system is both inefficient and inequitable .
By mandating what airlines can charge for carry - on fees , lawmakers would be exploiting them for the ostensible benefit of their constituents .
However , this absurd regulation will have little impact on what consumers actually pay , and it will only serve to socialize costs .
Consumers are better off simply including anticipated fees as part of their economic calculations and purchase decisions .
Conclusion
The wealth generators in our economy , entrepreneurs , are often exploited by the wealth destroyers , government officials .
Sadly , the Federal Minimum Wage Act of 2007 and the proposed Free of Fees for Carry - On Act are but two of a myriad of examples of how legislators exploit private business in the name of protecting their constituents .
The only things they 're truly protecting , however , are their seats in Congress .

Look , it ’s a new comic !
And before someone points it out – yes , I know there are more sophisticated versions of the Cosmological Argument that do n’t rely on this sort of reasoning ( like Leibniz ’s appeal to the Principle of Sufficient Reason , etc ) .
There ’s only so much one can take on in the format of a brief stick figure comic , I ’m afraid .
Oh and hey look !
We are now featured in the newest Philosopher ’s Carnival , which you should go and check out !
Now !
Undeadly reader Alexander Peslyak ( a.k.a. " Solar Designer " ) writes in with a note about his passwdqc password / passphrase strength checking and policy enforcement toolkit .
Due to copious slacking by the undeadly editors , we 're a bit late in getting this posted .
In April , I released version 1.2.0 of passwdqc .
This version specifically improves support for OpenBSD , allowing for the pwqcheck program to be specified in OpenBSD 's / etc/login.conf and invoked by the passwd ( 1 ) program .
Previously , this was only supported via " unofficial " rework of older pam_passwdqc code by Damien Miller ( djm@ ) .
Now it became official - immediately providing all improvements found in current and future versions of passwdqc ( since OpenBSD support is to stay ) .
Some recent improvements include fine - tuning of the checks on thousands of real - world cracked vs. presumed - strong passwords , support for 8 - bit characters in passphrase words , and extra entropy encoded into randomly - generated passphrases .
Not so recent improvements include separation of the " core " code into libpasswdqc , introduction of command - line programs ( usable from scripts and now also by OpenBSD ) and extra options to them , and making the PAM module optional ( indeed , it 's not built on OpenBSD , but is useful to have the same password policy elsewhere ) .
Long story short , to enable passwdqc on OpenBSD , build and install it , then insert the line " :passwordcheck=/usr/bin/pwqcheck - 1 :\ " into the " default " section in /etc/login.conf .
This will use passwdqc 's default policy , which may be adjusted with additional command - line options ( there 's a man page documenting those ) .
Unfortunately , as of OpenBSD 4.6 , there 's no way to actually enforce the policy .
If one enters a non-compliant password ( or different ones ) multiple times , passwd ( 1 ) will eventually give up and permit any password to be set .
Hopefully , this shortcoming will get addressed in a later version .

AT&T ANNOUNCES NEW LOWER - PRICED WIRELESS DATA PLANS TO MAKE MOBILE INTERNET MORE AFFORDABLE TO MORE PEOPLE
DALLAS , June 2 , 2010 - AT&T* , the U.S. smartphone leader , today introduced new wireless data plans that make it more affordable for more people to enjoy the benefits of the mobile Internet .
Customers can pick the new data plan that best meets their needs - either a $ 15 per month entry plan or a $ 25 per month plan with 10 times more data .
Current smartphone customers are not required to switch to the new plans , but can choose to do so without a contract extension .
" AT&T helps mobilize everything on the Internet - your favorite web sites , TV shows , music , games and social networks .
Virtually everything previously done while sitting at a computer can now be done on the go , " said Ralph de la Vega , president and CEO , AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets .
" To give more people the opportunity to experience these benefits , we 're breaking free from the traditional ' one - size - fits - all ' pricing model and making the mobile Internet more affordable to a greater number of people . "
Each plan includes unlimited access at no additional charge to more than 20,000 AT&T Wi-Fi Hot Spots in the U.S. Customers can also use unlimited Wi -Fi at home , in the office or elsewhere if available .
AT&T will also help customers manage their wireless data usage by sending free text messages when customers reach different usage intervals , and by providing online tools , including a smartphone app that shows monthly usage information .
The new wireless data plans - including a new tethering option - will be available beginning June 7 .
Current AT&T voice and texting plans are unchanged .
More Choice
The new AT&T plans provide large amounts of data to enable people to enjoy their favorite online activities :
* DataPlus .
Provides 200 megabytes ( MB ) of data - enough to send / receive 1,000 emails ( no attachments ) , send / receive 150 emails with attachments , view 400 Web pages , post 50 photos on social media sites and 20 minutes of streaming video - for just $ 15 per month .
This plan , which can save customers up to 20 percent off their wireless voice and data charges , is designed for people who primarily like to surf the web , send email and use social networking apps .
If customers exceed 200 MB in a monthly billing cycle , they will receive an additional 200 MB of data usage for $ 15 for use in the month .
Currently , 65 percent of AT&T smartphone customers use less than 200 MB of data per month on average .
* DataPro. Provides 2 gigabytes ( GB ) of data - enough to send / receive 10,000 emails ( no attachments ) , send / receive 1,500 emails with attachments , view 4,000 Web pages , post 500 photos to social media sites and watch 200 minutes of streaming video - for $ 25 per month .
Should a customer exceed 2 GB during a billing cycle , they will receive an additional 1 GB of data for $ 10 for use in the month .
Currently , 98 percent of AT&T smartphone customers use less than 2 GB of data a month on average .
* Tethering .
Smartphone customers - including iPhone customers - who choose the DataPro plan have the option to add tethering for an additional $ 20 per month .
Tethering enables customers to use their smartphone as a modem to provide a broadband connection for laptop computers , netbooks or other computing devices .
Tethering for iPhones will be available when Apple releases OS 4.0 this summer .
With the new wireless data plans , pricing for a smartphone voice and data bundle now starts at just $ 54.99 per month for an individual plan , or $ 24.99 per month for an additional line on a FamilyTalk plan , $ 15 per month less than the price of the previous entry level bundle .
For new iPad customers , the $ 25 per month 2 GB plan will replace the existing $ 29.99 unlimited plan .
iPad customers will continue to pre-pay for their wireless data plan and no contract is required .
Existing iPad customers who have the $ 29.99 per month unlimited plan can keep that plan or switch to the new $ 25 per month plan with 2 GB of data .
Wi -Fi at 20,000 AT&T Hot Spots
The vast majority of smartphones that AT&T offers have built - in Wi-Fi , which lets the devices automatically switch from the wireless network to a Wi -Fi hotspot without prompting , making Wi -Fi even more convenient and easy to use .
This enables customers to use Wi-Fi in the home , office and at public locations where available .
Using Wi-Fi does not count against a customer 's monthly data plan usage total .
In addition , virtually all AT&T smartphone customers have access at no additional charge to more than 20,000 AT&T Wi-Fi Hot Spots at Starbucks , Barnes & Noble , and other U.S. locations .
Customers can get more information on how to use Wi-Fi and find the location of AT&T Wi-Fi Hot Spots at www.att.com/wifiaccess.

Its actually impossible to SWALLOW your own tongue .
Danielle does not actually know what the word " swallow " means apparently .
Swallow means
" To pass through one 's esophagus "
If these people on youtube swallowed their own tongue according to Danielle , it would pass through their esophagus and this would only be possible if their tongues were disconnected from their bodies .
The people on youtube simple fold their tongue backward and it is indeed hidden at the top of their throat .
It is impressive , but it is not swallowing .
Next time research things before you attempt to tell people to research things and make yourself look cool and smart Danielle .
WASHINGTON – “ There is a clear link between clean energy and economic development , ” Ron Ruggiero , field director for the Apollo Alliance , told workshop participants here at the America ’s Future NOW !
conference June 8 .
According to Ruggiero , “ Clean energy can lead to a manufacturing revival in this country . ”
“ First we need to create the market demand for green manufacturing through policy priorities , ” Ruggiero said .
“ Second , we need to invest in capacity to meet demand .
Third , we need to capture the jobs and economic opportunity . ”
Currently , manufacturing accounts for 11.5 percent of GDP and sustains 13 million jobs in the U.S. Around 85 percent Americans support expanding manufacturing , especially as manufacturing jobs have historically been good paying union jobs .
Unfortunately though , jobs in the manufacturing industry have been on the decline for the past 30 years .
The Apollo Alliance is currently advocating for a $ 500 billion investment in green industry that would , they say , create millions of green manufacturing jobs .
Kari Fulton , from the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative , emphasized “ engaging communities of color on environmental change . ”
“ We have to learn how to advocate for green jobs in every community , ” she said .
“ We have to create the climate future we want to see by striving for democratic participation , building capacity for green jobs and finding ways to share in green wealth , ” Fulton added .
Workshop panelists also addressed the millions of gallons of oil spewing into the Gulf Coast .
Peter Bahouth said , “ We ’re not just plugging the whole .
This is going to be big oil ’s Katrina . ”
He said , “ There are currently 6,000 oil wells in the Gulf , paid for by $ 80 billion in tax subsidies .
We paid for this oil spill . ”
Additionally , the oil spill in the Gulf was n’t an “ accident . ”
“ It was the direct , predictable outcome of our oil policy , ” he said .
According to Bahouth , the U.S. uses around 20 million barrels of oil a day , spending around $ 1 billion a day on imported oil .
Within our boarders exists about 2 percent of the world ’s oil supply .
However , we use about 25 percent of the world ’s oil production .
If every known oil reserve in the U.S. was drilled it would last about 3 years .
“ We need a national oil reduction plan , ” Bahouth concluded .
Stewart Acuff , from the Utility Workers ’ Union , said , the oil spill in the Gulf “ is destroying a way of life . ”
Tying the struggle for green , sustainable jobs to the economic recovery , Acuff added , “ We cannot dig ourselves out of this job ’s whole without raising consumer demand .
And we ca n’t raise consumer demand without good paying manufacturing jobs , good paying union jobs in a green industry . ”
Also at the Conference , United Steelworkers ’ president Leo Gerard , said “ We need to empower workers and create a new generation of jobs .
We need to get serious about eliminating the failed economic system that got us here . ”

Hydrogen in M51

Explanation : Perhaps the original spiral nebula , M51 is a large galaxy , over 60,000 light - years across , with a readily apparent spiral structure .
Also cataloged as NGC 5194 , M51 is a part of a well - known interacting galaxy pair , its spiral arms and dust lanes clearly sweeping in front of companion galaxy NGC 5195 ( top ) .
This dramatically processed color composite combines M51 image data from the Calar Alto Observatory 's 1.2 meter telescope .
The data include long exposures through a narrow hydrogen alpha filter that trace emission from atomic hydrogen .
Reddish hydrogen emission regions , called HII regions , are the regions of intense star formation seen to lie mainly along M51's bright spiral arms .
Intriguingly , this composite also shows red hydrogen emission structures in the faint features extending even beyond NGC 5195 , toward the top of the frame .
Scatological humor .
Crude drawings mocking revered religious figures .
I am speaking , of course , of Lucas Cranach ’s Birth and Origin of the Pope [ image below ] , one in a series of woodcuts commissioned by Martin Luther in the 1540s under the title “ The True Depiction of the Papacy . ”
In it , an enormous grinning she - devil squats in the foreground , excreting the Pope along with a heap of bishops while in the background another infant pontiff suckles at the teat of a serpent - haired wet nurse .
Forget the South Park dust up ; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day .
If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons , you have to go back to the sixteenth century .
Near the end of Luther ’s life , his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent .
He took to calling his ecclesiastical enemies ‘ asses , ’ ‘ dogs , ’ ‘ pigs , ’ ‘ blockheads , ’ ‘ basilisks , ’ and ‘ pupils of Satan , ’ and the Pope himself ‘ Her Sodomitical Hellishness ’ and ‘ fart - ass ’ ( no , it does n’t sound much more dignified in German — fartz - Esel ) .
Eric Cartman would be in awe .
The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes .
But it is just as much a clash between conflicting religious attitudes , and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion .
For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech , he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience , which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy .
Debased though Luther ’s rhetoric may have been , there was no way to be a reformer without offending the hegemon .
It ’s a story as old as religion .
Orthodoxy = Blasphemy +
Time
Pope Benedict XII began his career as Jacques Fournier , Bishop of Pamiers , an expert Inquisitor who made it his personal mission to stamp out the last pockets of Cathar heresy in France .
He was particularly incensed by those who refused to pay the new taxes he had imposed on livestock , or scoffed at the performance rites by which the Church extracted additional fees .
Regarding the ritual of placing a candle in the mouth of a dying loved one , one cheeky Cathar commented that they might as well shove the candle up the anus .
One of those caught up in the Bishop ’s dragnet was Beatrice of Planisolles .
Like many others persecuted at the time , Beatrice existed on the margins of medieval society .
The scent of freethinking , transgressive sexual behavior , herbal medicine , and witchcraft were already on her when she was called to testify before Fournier on June 19 , 1320 .
Thanks to his meticulous note - taking , we have a remarkable record of her testimony .
She seemed to have a knack for asking disconcerting questions , and confessed to having once asked one of her companions , “ How can it be that God created men and women , since so many of them are not saved ? ”
The incriminating evidence against Beatrice was found in the contents of her bag ( along with some herbs and a rag stained with menstrual blood ) : some crumbs of bread .
To her interrogators , these signaled that she had shared communion with the banned Cathar sect .
She was found guilty of , among other charges , blasphemy , and sentenced to death .
The sentence was later commuted to wearing a double cross on her outer garments to signify her repentance and admission of error .
Back in the day , Yahweh probably would have had her stoned ( see Leviticus 24 ) , but his medieval viceroys wanted her kept alive to proclaim the falsity of her former opinion .
For Beatrice ’s blasphemy was not defilement of God ’s name as such , but defiance of the earthly authorities who had installed themselves as the custodians of His Truth .
The Cathars believed in an angel - like Christ who did not really undergo human birth or death ; their human right to live by this belief was blasphemy to their fellow Christians .
In 1553 Miguel Servetus was executed in Calvin ’s theocratic Geneva for entertaining the heretical thought that Jesus was a human being in every way .
Servetus ’ insight would become essential to the religious life of millions of later Christians — the Unitarians .
Jesus himself was a blasphemer , if you were to ask some of his fellow Jews .
Muhammad ’s revelation relegated Jesus to the status of a great prophet , not the son of God .
The Qur’an states , “ [ p ] agans indeed are those who say that God is the Messiah , son of Mary …
Anyone who sets up any idol beside God , God has forbidden Paradise for him , and his destiny is Hell ” ( 5:72 ) ; and “ [ t ] he Messiah , son of Mary , is no more than a messenger like the messengers before him , and his mother was a saint ” ( 5:75 ) .
Without these doctrines , Islam is inconceivable ; with them , Christianity implodes .
The orthodoxy of today is the blasphemy of yesterday .
From the beginning , the spiritual search for religious truth has not been against blasphemy , but by way of blasphemy .
Depending on where we sit metaphysically , we may want that search called off , or we may want it furthered .
Either way , we must welcome religious offense as the unavoidable consequence of a free religious conscience .
This is nowhere more urgent than in those parts of the world where charges of blasphemy are still used to violate freedom of religious conscience , whether in Pakistan , where members of the persecuted minority Ahmadiyya Muslim community are accused of “ defaming the Prophet ” ; or in Iran , where seven Baha ’i leaders have been unjustly imprisoned since 2008 on charges of “ warring against God . ”
Libertarian Theology
I do n’t mean to compare Matt Stone and Trey Parker to towering reformers and prophets of history or to persecuted religious minorities today .
I ’m not suggesting that South Park has much of a theology beyond a lightweight libertarianism that says we can all get along so long as no one tries to “ impose their beliefs ” on anyone else .
In practice , the creators seemed to acquiesce all too easily to Comedy Central ’s imposition of black bars and bleeps on their episode .
However , Stone and Parker were exercising their freedom of religious conscience , and their supporters and detractors alike — whether they know it or not — are taking a stand on religious questions .
Progressives who oppose the publication of Muhammad images like to think that they are demonstrating tolerance and broad - mindedness by remaining strictly neutral on the culture of the “ Other . ”
They are wrong .
In fact , by responding to some Muslim voices instead of others , by anointing groups like Revolution Muslim as de facto representatives of “ Islam ” and “ Muslim opinion , ” they are taking sides in important theological - political disputes internal to Islamic communities .
And they are taking the wrong sides : with theological conservatives and Islamist governments , against a spectrum of spiritual countertraditions .
The injunction against depicting the Prophet does not appear in the Qur’an but in contested hadith .
Medieval Persian artists routinely included Muhammad in their magnificent painted miniatures .
The Prophet himself approved of pictures of prophets .
According to the earliest biography of Muhammad , upon conquering Mecca he went to the Kaaba to purge the holy site of pagan relics and religious icons — with the exception of representations of Mary and Jesus , which he ordered to be preserved .
From the outside , it is easy to miss the fact that having one ’s saints satirized is a way of being baptized into the American “ civil religion . ”
A community is not a full member of this society until its sacred cows have been slaughtered publicly — preferably on cable television .
Atheists breathed a sign of relief when Richard Dawkins was mocked on South Park , thinking , “ finally , we ’re becoming a part of American culture . ”
And so we say to every newcomer : Welcome , welcome to the fold .
Take the sacrament of laughter .
Now you ’re one of us .
We ’re ridiculous , and we admit it freely .

Scientists Discover Underwater Asphalt Volcanoes
Impressive landmarks hidden for 40,000 years rise from sea-floor
High - resolution bathymetry shows extinct asphalt volcanoes on the sea - floor off California .
April 25 , 2010
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
About 10 miles off the Santa Barbara coast , at the bottom of the Santa Barbara Channel , a series of impressive landmarks rise from the sea floor .
They 've been there for 40,000 years , but have remained hidden in the murky depths of the Pacific Ocean - - until now .
They 're called asphalt volcanoes .
Scientists funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and affiliated with the University of California at Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) , University of California at Davis , University of Sydney and University of Rhode Island , have identified the series of unusual volcanoes .
The largest of these undersea Ice Age domes lies at a depth of 700 feet ( 220 meters ) , too deep for scuba diving , which explains why the volcanoes have never before been spotted by humans , says Don Rice , director of NSF 's Chemical Oceanography Program , which funded the research .
" They 're larger than a football - field - long and as tall as a six - story building , " says David Valentine , a geoscientist at UCSB and the lead author of a paper published on - line this week in the journal Nature Geoscience .
" They 're massive features , and are made completely out of asphalt . "
Valentine and colleagues first viewed the volcanoes during a 2007 dive on the research submersible Alvin .
Valentine credits Ed Keller , an earth scientist at UCSB , with guiding him and colleagues to the site .
" Ed had looked at some bathymetry [ sea floor topography ] studies conducted in the 1990s and noted some very unusual features , " Valentine says .
Based on Keller 's research , Valentine and other scientists took Alvin into the area in 2007 and discovered the source of the mystery .
Using the sub 's robotic arm , the researchers broke off samples and brought them to labs at UCSB and WHOI for testing .
In 2009 , Valentine and colleagues made two more dives to the area in Alvin .
They also conducted a detailed survey of the area using an autonomous underwater vehicle , Sentry , which takes photos as it glides about nine feet above the ocean floor .
" When you 'fly '
Sentry over the sea floor , you can see all of the cracking of the asphalt and flow features , " says Valentine .
" All the textures are visible of a once - flowing liquid that has solidified in place .
" That 's one of the reasons we 're calling them volcanoes , because they have so many features that are indicative of a lava flow . "
Tests showed that these are n't your typical lava volcanoes , however , found in Hawaii and elsewhere around the Pacific Rim .
Using a mass spectrometer , carbon dating , microscopic fossils , and comprehensive , two - dimensional gas chromatography , the scientists determined that the structures are asphalt .
They were formed when petroleum flowed from the sea - floor about 30,000 - 40,000 years ago .
Chris Reddy , a scientist at WHOI and a co-author of the paper , says that " the volcanoes underscore a little - known fact : half the oil that enters the coastal environment is from natural oil seeps like the ones off the coast of California . "
The researchers also determined that the volcanoes were at one time a prolific source of methane , a greenhouse gas .
The two largest volcanoes are about a kilometer apart and have pits or depressions surrounding them .
These pits , according to Valentine , are signs of " methane gas bubbling from the sub- surface . "
That 's not surprising , he says , considering how much petroleum was flowing there in the past .
" They were spewing out a lot of petroleum , but also lots of natural gas , " he says , " which you tend to get when you have petroleum seepage in this area . "
The discovery that vast amounts of methane once emanated from the volcanoes caused the scientists to wonder if there might have been an environmental impact on the area during the Ice Age .
" It became a dead zone , " says Valentine .
" We 're hypothesizing that these features may have been a major contributor to those events . "
While the volcanoes have been dormant for thousands of years , the 2009 Alvin dive revealed a few spots where gas was still bubbling .
" We think it 's residual gas , " says Valentine , who added that the amount of gas is so small it 's harmless , and never reaches the surface .
Other co-authors of the paper are Christopher Farwell , Sarah C. Bagby , Brian A. Clark , and Morgan Soloway , all of UCSB ; Robert K. Nelson , Dana Yoerger , and Richard Camilli of WHOI ; Tessa M. Hill , UC Davis ; Oscar Pizarro , University of Sydney ; and Christopher N. Roman , University of Rhode Island .

MATTHEW
Mitcham has convinced himself he's no one - hit wonder by reprising his Beijing Olympic heroics to win gold at the diving World Cup in China .
The Australian secured his first major international victory since his sensational 2008 Olympic triumph by winning the 10 - metre platform at the premier diving event of the year in Changzhou .

Mitcham 's haul of 562.80 points was his biggest and halted the home nation 's dominance at the meet , with China taking gold in the seven other events .
His dives included a reverse 3 ½ tuck that earned perfect 10s across the board and another newly added to his repertoire as he finished ahead of Chinese duo Huo Liang ( 555.40 ) and Qiu Bo ( 554.70 ) .
Texas congressman Joe Barton has retracted his apology to BP CEO Tony Hayward and apologized for using the term " shakedown " to describe President Obama 's $ 20 billion escrow fund for oil - spill damages .
Barton issued the following statement through his committee office this afternoon :
" I apologize for using the term ' shakedown ' with regard to yesterday 's actions at the White House in my opening statement this morning , and I retract my apology to BP .
As I told my colleagues yesterday and said again this morning , BP should bear the full financial responsibility for the accident on their lease in the Gulf of Mexico .
BP should fully compensate those families and businesses that have been hurt by this accident .
BP and the federal government need to stop the leak , clean up the damage , and take whatever steps necessary to prevent a similar accident in the future .
" I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident . "
After his apology caused an uproar , Barton was forced to retract it or lose his post as top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
" He was told , apologize , immediately .
Or you will lose your position , immediately , " a senior House Republican aide said .
" Now that he has apologized , we 'll see what happens going forward . "
Barton first apologized to Hayward during his opening remarks at this morning 's hearing .

Official reportedly prevented from taking up embassy post after Israel refuses to commit itself not to misuse British passports
Britain has refused to allow Israel 's Mossad secret service to send a representative back to the country 's London embassy following the row over the killing of a Hamas operative by agents using forged UK passports .
Israel 's Yediot Aharonot newspaper reported yesterday that the Foreign Office is digging in its heels because Israel is refusing to commit itself not to misuse British passports in future clandestine operations .
Neither Britain nor Israel gave any details of the embassy official who was ordered to leave the country in March after an investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency showed that the Mossad was behind the passport theft .
But the official was understood to be an intelligence officer who was known to the UK authorities and worked as official liaison with Britain 's MI6 .
There was no suggestion the officer was personally involved in the passports affair .
Israel has never admitted any role in February 's Dubai assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , who was described as a key figure in smuggling Iranian weapons into the Gaza Strip on behalf of the Palestinian Islamist movement .
It has abstained from signing any material that might be construed as a confession .
Britain had made clear in public statements and private meetings with the Israelis that it expected formal guarantees that there would be no repeat of the passport cloning .
The real documents belonged to Britons living in Israel .
Forged or stolen Irish , Australian , French and German passports were also used by the hit squad , whose operation – including the use of elaborate disguises – was extensively recorded by CCTV cameras in the emirate .
Israel conspicuously refrained from retaliating for the expulsion of the Mossad officer , apparently accepting that it was no more than a slap on the wrist before a return to business as usual .
The Mossad and MI6 are known to have a close working relationship especially over terrorism – despite political differences over the peace process , settlements and the Palestinians between the UK and Israeli governments .
Iran 's nuclear programme is likely to be another high - priority issue of common concern .
Yediot reported that Israeli security officials were concerned about the breakdown in relations between the two agencies .
" It is estimated that the affair will only be resolved , if at all , after this week 's UK general elections , " the paper said .
The Foreign Office said it had not been approached by the Israelis about a replacement for the expelled official .
" However we look to Israel to rebuild the trust we believe is required for the full and open relationship we would like , " said a spokesman .
" We have asked for specific assurances from Israel , which would clearly be a positive step towards rebuilding that trust .
Any Israeli request for the diplomat to be replaced would be considered against the context of these UK requests . "
Tens of thousands of Israelis protested in the streets of Tel Aviv last weekend against their right - wing government ’s attack on an unarmed humanitarian aid flotilla sailing in international waters .
International condemnation of the raids continued in foreign capitals .
Meanwhile , in Washington , Democratic congressional leaders were lining up alongside their Republican colleagues to defend the Israeli assault .
Countering the broad consensus of international legal scholars who recognize that the attack was in flagrant violation of international norms , prominent Democrats embraced the Orwellian notion that Israel ’s raid , which killed at least nine activists and wounded scores of others , was somehow an act of self - defense .
The offensive by the Democratic leadership has been led by Gary Ackerman ( D - NY ) , who serves as House Democrats ’ unofficial spokesman on Middle East policy from his position as chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee subcommittee on the Middle East .
According to Ackerman , the killings were “ wholly the fault and responsibility of the organizers of the effort to break through Israel and Egypt ’s legitimate closure of terrorist - controlled Gaza . ”
According to Rep. Ron Klein ( D - FL ) , due to the determination of activists on the ships to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of the besieged Gaza Strip , “ Israel was left with no choice but to ensure the safety of its people . ”
Similarly , Democratic majority leader Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) insisted that in attacking an unarmed flotilla carrying humanitarian aid in international waters , Israel had simply “ invoked its right to self - defense . ”
To rationalize what virtually the entire international legal community recognizes as an act of war , congressional Democrats have engaged in a series of falsifications and radical reinterpretations of international law .
The first involved a radically overextended notion of maritime sovereignty .
The attack took place in international waters , roughly 85 miles from the Israeli coast .
International maritime law has long recognized that territorial sovereignty extends only 12 miles out to sea .
A Libyan effort in the 1980s to extend its claim of sovereignty into the Gulf of Sidra beyond the 12 - mile limit led to a series of deadly clashes between U.S. and Libyan armed forces in order , according to then - President Ronald Reagan , to enforce America ’s “ global Freedom of Navigation program ” to defend “ our rights on and over the high seas under international law . ”
At the time , congressional Democrats joined their Republican colleagues in defending the use of force to challenge Libya ’s illegal overreach of its maritime boundaries .
However , congressional Democrats are quite willing to grant allied governments in the region far more latitude in extending their claims to Mediterranean waters .
Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) argued that responsibility for the violence lay with the organizers of the flotilla , not with “ those who defended Israel ’s borders . ”
Rep. Michael McMahon ( D - NY ) made a similar argument that the Israeli action was justified because Israel “ has the right to maintain and defend its own borders . ”
The flotilla was aiming directly toward the port of Gaza , not toward any area close to Israeli territorial waters , and no country recognizes the Gaza Strip as part of Israel .
Nevertheless , Rep. Kendrik Meek ( D - FL ) insisted that Israel ’s assault on the flotilla was justified because the ships were “ on the verge of breaching its sovereign borders . ”
Similarly , Klein insisted that the ships were “ threatening to breach Israel ’s defenses of its coastal border , ” and therefore “ Israel was left with no choice but to ensure the safety of its people ” by attacking the flotilla .
Redefining “ Self - Defense ”
The Free Gaza campaign had made clear that the cargo was exclusively humanitarian .
Indeed , all of its previous eight voyages over the past two years were completely free of any weaponry or weapon parts .
The plethora of peace and human rights groups participating in the flotilla would have never taken part were there any hint of arms being on board .
Most crucially , customs officials rigorously inspected all the ships at their disembarkation points .
Indeed , no weapons bound for the Gaza Strip were found on any of the six ships on the flotilla seized by Israel or on the seventh several days later .
As a result , no reasonable person could claim that the Israelis had reason to suspect arms smuggling .
The congressional Democratic leadership , however , is apparently not very reasonable .
For example , Rep. Frank Pallone ( D - NJ ) insisted that the Israelis attacked the flotilla to ensure that “ dangerous resources do not reach the terrorist organization Hamas . ”
This kind of paranoia was evident on the Senate side as well , as Senator Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) justified the Israeli attack on the grounds that the peace activists might have been trying to smuggle missiles or even a radiological weapon .
Similarly , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry ( D - MA ) declared that “ Israel has every right in the world to make certain that weapons are not being smuggled in . ”
Rep. Jim Costa ( D - CA ) insisted that “ Israel has every right to defend itself against radical activists ” in order “ to prevent innocent civilian aid from being used as a façade for arms trafficking ” by those “ threatening the safety and security of our ally Israel . ”
Despite the participation of large numbers of pacifists on the ships , Rep. Elliot Engel ( D - NY ) claimed that the flotilla “ was really a Trojan Horse designed to attack the Israelis . ”
The assault against the unarmed flotilla , according to Rep. Gregory Meeks ( D - NY ) , was simply a case of the Israeli government “ defending … their citizens ” and “ exercising its right to self - defense . ”
Paul Hodes ( D - NH ) argued that Israel ’s intent in attacking the flotilla was simply “ to protect itself and its citizens ” while House Majority Leader Hoyer insisted that “ Israel — rightfully so — invoked its right to self - defense on the Mavi Marmara . ”
Rep Patrick Murphy ( D - PA ) also insisted that Israel was simply invoking its right to self - defense , ” while Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) insisted that “ those aboard the Mavi Marmara never intended to carry out a peaceful humanitarian mission ” and that “ It was only when faced with violence that the soldiers reacted in self - defense . ”
The Israelis confiscated all recording equipment from those on board , only showing their carefully edited version of events surrounding their assault on lead vessel in a widely circulated videotape .
The refusal to return any of the recording equipment to the kidnapped activists would normally raise questions as to what the Israeli government might be trying to hide .
But that did n’t bother Democratic lawmakers , who repeatedly cited the Israeli video as “ evidence ” to support their case that the people defending their ship , not the ones attacking it , were the aggressors .
There are conflicting reports of what happened when Israeli forces illegally boarded the Mavi Marmara , but what is known is that Israeli commandos initiated the attack on the ship using stun grenades , teargas , paintballs , and rubber - cased steel bullets .
The initial response from those on board was to try to fend off the attackers off with water hoses while the ship ’s passengers attempted to form a defensive cordon around the wheelhouse to prevent the attackers from seizing the ship .
Michael Oren , Israel ’s ambassador to the United States , acknowledged that the flotilla was simply “ too large to stop with nonviolent means . ”
Despite this , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schulz ( D - FL ) insisted that “ the Israeli Navy worked to plan a non-violent interception of the flotilla and only used force when soldiers ’ lives were at risk . ”
At least 48 activists suffered gunshot wounds and scores of others were badly beaten .
The British newspaper The Independent reported that soldiers fired down on the activists from their helicopters prior to any Israeli soldiers boarding the Mavi Marmara .
One journalist reported that a man standing next to him was shot through the top of his head , killing him instantly .
Rep. Gary Peters ( D - MI ) , however , insisted that the killings were all “ acts of self - defense , ” while Rep. Shelley Berkeley ( D - NV ) blamed “ passengers on the vessel , not Israeli forces , as the instigators of violence . ”
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) said the “ violent force [ was ] in fact initiated by those whose boat was boarded . ”
Though the overwhelming majority of those on the ships were from peace organizations like War Resisters International , the International Fellowship of Reconciliation , Pax Christi , and others , Rep .
Engel insisted that the ships were actually “ filled with hate - filled provocateurs bent on violence . ”
Rep. Mike Quigley ( D - IL ) claimed the responsibility for the killings were “ those who chose to run an internationally recognized blockade and attack uniformed personnel . ”
Though there were no guns found on board any of the ships , Quigley insisted that the activists “ shot Israeli soldiers as they landed on the main ship . ”
Autopsy reports reveal that most of the victims of the Israeli raid were shot in the head at close range .
Fulkan Dogan , a 19 - year old U.S. citizen , was shot five times from less than 18 inches away .
Similarly , despite Israeli troops using stun guns and severely beating passengers on the other ships who offered no violent resistance , Rep. Shelley Berkeley ( D - NV ) insisted that the Israeli seizure of the five other vessels took place “ without incident , ” demonstrating that “ Israeli personnel had no intention to use force and only did so in self - defense . ”
The Turkish crew — which , unlike the vast majority of people on board the ships , had not gone through the mandatory nonviolence training — should not have fought back .
It should be noted , however , that international maritime law clearly gives crew members the right to defend their vessel from attacks in international waters .
Apparently , these congressional Democrats believe , however , if you are attacked by the navy of a strategic ally of the United States , you have no right to defend your ship .
Accusations of Terrorist Ties
The most dangerous accusation by congressional Democratic leaders involves charges that the activists on board and the organizers of the flotilla had ties to terrorism .
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee ’s subcommittee on terrorism , nonproliferation , and trade , called on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecute American participants in the flotilla .
Because the Gaza Strip is currently ruled by Hamas , according to Sherman , any humanitarian aid to the people of that territory is “ clearly an effort to give items of value to a terrorist organization . ”
Sherman also announced he would be working with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the more than 700 non-U.S. citizens who took part in the flotilla would be permanently barred from ever entering the United States .
This would include European parliamentarians and Nobel laureates , as well as leading writers , artists , intellectuals , pacifists , and human rights activists , virtually none of whom is in the least bit sympathetic with Hamas or terrorism .
A series of Democrats in Congress have joined in insisting that the organizers of the flotilla have , in Sherman ’s words , “ clear terrorist ties . ”
Indeed , Frank insists that these groups are “ pro-Hamas people ” and that , rather than provide aid to the people of the Gaza Strip , they were actually “ seeking to land in Gaza to aid and support Hamas . ”
Engel insisted that the organizers of the flotilla have “ links to Hamas and reportedly played a role in the attempted Millennium bombing in Los Angeles . ”
Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) insisted that the United States “ must stand up for the right of Israel to defend herself against terrorism — which is what Israel did when she blocked the attempt by the Flotilla to forcefully breach the blockade . ”
And Rep. Ackerman claimed that the humanitarian relief effort was “ to provoke a confrontation with Israel for the benefit of Hamas and as part of the international effort to delegitimize Israel ’s existence . ”
The very idea that pacifist , feminist , Jewish , and Christian organizations like CODEPINK , Jewish Voice for Peace , and the American Friends Service Committee would ally with a violent , misogynist , Islamic group like Hamas — much less any group that engages in terrorism — should be recognized as absurd on face value .
When prominent Democrats — including the head of the House subcommittee on terrorism — imply that leading American and Israeli peace groups are linked to terrorism , it is no longer simply heated rhetoric in defense of the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip , but a dangerous attack on civil liberties .
These congressional Democrats also ignore the fact that the Free Gaza campaign is supported by such Israeli groups such as Yesh G’vul , the Coalition of Women for Peace , New Profile , and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions , among others .
Such organizations and their members were already being subjected to violent attacks by far right - wing groups , some of whom have openly called for the murder of Knesset members who supported the flotilla .
By falsely accusing these groups of being part of an effort that supports Hamas and other terrorist groups , these members of Congress appear to be willing to put the lives of Israeli peace and human rights activists at risk .
Shutting Out the United Nations
Democratic congressional leaders were quick to praise the Obama administration for blocking the United Nations from criticizing the Israeli attack .
Hoyer reiterated how the “ administration and Congress are determined to prevent condemnation of Israel at the UN Security Council . ”
One clear role for the United Nations — given the conflicting accounts of what transpired during the Israeli attack — would be to launch an international investigation .
A recent public opinion poll shows a clear majority of Americans — including 65 percent of Democrats — favor an international inquiry over allowing Israel alone to investigate the circumstances of the attack .
Despite this , congressional Democrats have also joined the Obama administration in insisting that Israel , not the UN or other international body , should conduct any investigation into the attack .
This comes despite reports from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documenting the right - wing Israeli government ’s notoriously poor record at conducting credible internal investigations regarding possible war crimes by its armed forces .
Rejecting such detailed reports from reputable human rights organizations , Frank nonetheless insists “ the Israeli government … has a very good record of holding the Israeli government to account , ” and that “ the Israeli government has a better record of legitimate self - criticism than almost any other government in the world . ”
Turning the consensus of international human rights organizations on its head , Frank argues that the only a group “ commissioned by the Israeli government ” would have credibility , while “ clearly no inquiry chartered by the U.N. would have the credibility . ”
Other congressional Democrats have also been lining up insisting that the right - wing Israeli government of Benyamin Netanyahu be entrusted with the investigation .
Rep. Brad Ellsworth ( D - IN ) insisted that “ We must allow Israel , not the United Nations . . . to conduct a formal investigation into the flotilla incident . ”
Similarly , Rep. Jesse Jackson , Jr. ( D - IL ) has called for an “ Israeli - led investigation ” as have Rep. Michael McMahon ( D - NY ) and Rep. Sestak ( D - PA ) , who is currently the Democratic nominee for Senate .
Reid underscored his confidence in the right - wing Israeli government in noting how “ Israel has pledged to carry out a transparent and thorough investigation of this incident , and I look forward to its findings . ”
Denying the Humanitarian Crisis
Democrats have also lined up to defend the blockade of the Gaza Strip , even as corporate media outlets such as Newsweek acknowledge that the blockade has little to do with preventing weapons smuggling .
Some have gone as far as challenging the credibility of the UN and a plethora of aid agencies that have documented the public health crisis and food shortages in the Gaza Strip .
For example , Sherman insists “ the health circumstances in Gaza are better than they are in many American cities . ”
In reality , UN officials have called the situation “ grim , ” “ deteriorating , ” and a “ medieval siege . ”
A bare minimum of 400 truckloads of goods needs to enter Gaza each week , and only an average of 171 get in .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , one in 10 Gazans suffer from “ chronic malnutrition , ” and the UN says six in 10 Gaza households are “ food insecure . ”
As reported in the Israeli press , as elsewhere , Israel has repeatedly refused to allow humanitarian goods into the Gaza Strip .
This fact did not stop Reid from claiming that Israel “ put in place a process to ensure that legitimate humanitarian relief reached Gaza . ”
Similarly , Rep. Steve Rothman ( D - NJ ) praised Israel for “ allow[ing ] trucks loaded with humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza on a daily basis , ” ignoring that such vehicles allowed by Israel are far less than what ’s needed .
Rep. Ted Deutch ( D - FL ) insisted that “ there are alternative methods of delivery that are available , ” ignoring the fact that restrictive Israeli checkpoints have repeatedly turned away WHO medical supplies and rejected or delayed the delivery of UN food aid .
Despite efforts to blame Hamas , Israel is in fact the source of the humanitarian crisis .
Yet Democrats continue to be in denial .
‘ Creating an Incident ’
Israel had allowed five of the previous eight ships from the Free Gaza Campaign carrying humanitarian supplies to deliver their goods to the port of Gaza without interception .
So there was some genuine hope that the Israelis would allow this flotilla to dock unimpeded as well .
To leading Democratic lawmakers , such as Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - CT ) , however , “ this flotilla was more about creating an incident than helping people . ”
Similarly , Mikulski insisted that the activists “ cared more about inciting a confrontation that they did about delivering aid . ”
These lawmakers seem to have forgotten , however , the longstanding tradition of strategic nonviolent direct action to “ create an incident . ”
The four African - American students who sat at the Woolworth ’s lunch counter in Greensboro back in 1960 were n’t just interested in a cup of coffee .
Similarly , when civil rights activists protested in downtown Birmingham in 1963 , there was reason to suspect that Sherriff Bull Connor would use force to break up the demonstrations .
When people struggle nonviolently for justice against an oppressive state apparatus , there is no contradiction between helping people and creating an incident .
Relations with Turkey
Much of the wrath of congressional Democrats centers on the government of Turkey , a longstanding NATO ally .
Pallone demanded that Obama condemn the Turkish government for supporting the relief effort and reacting negatively to the attack , which killed nine Turks on board .
According to Rep. Anthony Wiener ( D - NY ) , “ We know this tragedy was instigated by Turkey . ”
Though Turkey remains in NATO , Wiener went as far as referring to Turkey as “ our former ally . ”
Similarly , Rep. John Sarbanes ( D - MD ) argued that criticism of Israel ’s action “ neglects the role that Turkey played in staging the flotilla and Turkey ’s readiness to condone this kind of brinksmanship . ”
Putting the blame on Turkey for the deaths of its own citizens in international waters taking part in a multinational humanitarian relief efforts is particularly ironic given that , as recently as two months ago , many of these same members of Congress refused to support the recent House resolution commemorating the 1915 Armenian genocide on the grounds that it would offend the Turkish government .
In the world view of congressional Democrats , however , defending what is essentially an act of piracy and the murder of nine Turkish citizens is worth damaging relations with this key NATO ally , but acknowledging the genocide of one and half million Armenians is not .
Withdraw Support from the Democratic Party
This is certainly not the first time that Democratic congressional leaders have defended violations of international legal norms by U.S. allies .
The history of supporting the Salvadoran junta , Nicaraguan Contras , Indonesian occupation forces in East Timor , and Moroccan occupation forces in Western Sahara all attest to the way the Democratic Party , like the Republican Party , is wedded to the notion that U.S. allies should be held to a lower standard of adherence to international law than perceived adversaries .
Indeed , one can imagine the reaction of these same Democrats had it been the Iranian navy that attacked a humanitarian flotilla in international waters , killed passengers and crew members , and kidnapped 750 people ( including journalists ) and held them incommunicado for several days in Iran .
Republican congressional leaders have certainly done no better in supporting Israel ’s raids .
Yet many Democrats who have engaged in these right - wing attacks on human rights and international law consider themselves “ progressive . ”
Democratic members of Congress have ended their defense of the Salvadoran junta , the Indonesian dictatorship , and other criminal policies only when pressured by their constituents .
Peace and human rights activists should similarly raise an outcry in response to the dangerously intemperate and inaccurate statements from congressional Democrats and then deny support for the re-election of any member of Congress who continues to support this latest Israeli atrocity .

As I reported in my last post , the aforementioned Kelli Faulkner : remote viewer and medium who was on ABC ”s Indiana New Extra staff has now been left off the station ’s news team .
Hurray !
This is one small step for skeptics and one great leap for rational thinking .
It shows when a few phone calls ( mine ) and and some pressure is brought to bear on peddlers of nonsense who should know much better , we can make a difference .
If you are unaware of Kelli ’s story , read my past blog “ ABC has a Medium on Staff ” from May 22 .
I want to thank Ramon Volz , a teacher who lives in Fort Wayne for stepping up to the plate and DOING SOMETHING .
What Ramon did was brilliant and should be an inspiration to anybody , particularly those who prattled on about who was ultimately responsible and questioned my calling these “ News people ” onto the carpet in the first place .
If the same people had spent half as much time as Ramon did actually doing something about the situation instead of bagging on me for taking a stand , we as a skeptical group would have moved ahead a few more valuable steps much quicker and might do a lot better in the future .
I realize this is a skeptical blog and welcome every one ’s comments , but when push comes to shove , it gets a bit daunting when the point gets lost amongst complaints about typos , legality and well , … just too much skepticism about the little stuff .
In this case the big issue has now been dealt with by somebody who got it .
Ramon wrote a beautiful letter I ’m going to include with his permission .
I ’m sure this had a lot to do with Kelli ’s disappearance :
Subject : Save FWCS !
I am currently a teacher at Lindley Elementary School .
As you all know , our schools are in an economical crisis .
I just had a thought that would make a great promotion for your station , developing news story , and give a Fort Wayne native a chance to be a hero !
I noticed Kelli Faulkner is associated with Indiana ’s NewsCenter , and her gifts could help our community schools !
The INC website says “ as a medium Kelli is able to see those who have passed on … ” I can not see any reason why she would refuse to use her talents to help out the children of Fort Wayne !
I have found an easy way for Kelli Faulkner to raise $ 1 million dollars to help save Fort Wayne Community Schools !
I am very excited about this , because I can not foresee any reason why Kelli would n’t want to help the education of children !
I teach in a classroom of 26 and 25 third - graders !
When they hear about this , they are going to be excited !
I know that she would n’t deny excellent educational opportunities for our children !
She could save the jobs of many teachers , lower classroom sizes , and possibly save a school from closing !
The James Randi Educational Foundation offers a one - million dollar prize !
Their site claims they “ offer a one - million - dollar prize to anyone who can show , under proper observing conditions , evidence of any paranormal , supernatural , or occult power or event .
The JREF does not involve itself in the testing procedure , other than helping to design the protocol and approving the conditions under which a test will take place .
All tests are designed with the participation and approval of the applicant .
In most cases , the applicant will be asked to perform a relatively simple preliminary test of the claim , which if successful , will be followed by the formal test .
Preliminary tests are usually conducted by associates of the JREF at the site where the applicant lives .
Upon success in the preliminary testing process , the “ applicant ” becomes a “ claimant . ”
Here is a link to the challenge : http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html
All Kelli would have to do is what she does best !
I ’m so glad that she ’s so gifted and has the references to back her up , because it will make winning the prize seem that much easier !
She ’s helped out so many grieving families — now she can help save our schools !
I ’m pumped !
Then , the station could follow her up on her challenge and film it as she wins a million dollars for FWCS !
Your station would have a once in a lifetime story on your hands !!!
This could also raise medium awareness , and mediums everywhere could use their gifts to help !
We have absolutely nothing to lose from this , and EVERYTHING to gain !
I ’m sorry if this seems a tad long , but I ’m just overwhelmed with excitement that we have such easy access to one million dollars !
I ’d appreciate a quick reply … if we do this right and quickly , we might be able to save a few jobs in FWCS !
I ’d even be willing to help put this thing together : everything from filling out the application , meeting with Kelli personally , to contacting the educational foundation responsible for this challenge !
Thank you for your time !
Now that ’s putting the ball in the right court .

No response to my emails :(
I recently emailed the station in regards to your association with Kelli Faulkner , and expressed interest in having her win a $ 1 million prize ( through the James Randi Educational Foundation ) which she could then donate to FWCS .
After two emails and no reply , I checked on your website to see if I could contact her directly .
Her information was no longer available on your website .
I have a few questions :
1. Is Kelli Faulkner still associated with INC ?
2 . Is it possible to for INC to do a story in which Kelli uses her talented gifts to win $ 1 million for FWCS ?
I have attached a link to the prize and application as evidence that this would make a fantastic news story about a local hero .
I have already agreed to do the paperwork if necessary to try to help our schools .
If she wishes to keep the money to herself , I am still willing to offer my services .

Tighten those screws Ramon !
And notice how he worded everything with such kindness and elan .
My hat ’s off to him .
Not many station execs couls argue with his approach .

Ramon ,
Kelli is no longer affiliated with INC .
Contact her directly at her website .
Do a Google search for her .
Good luck ,
Corinne Rose
Thanks for the kiss off “ Good Luck ” Corrinne .
If we believed in luck like you apparently believed in Kelli Faulkner , we would be running a skeptical segment on your “ News Extra ” show every day and not any remote viewing / medium nonsense .
I wonder how many bereaved parents of missing or murdered children wasted precious time and money while Kelli was touted as your medium ?
I hope you sleep better knowing you and your station are now one totally unsubstantiated con artist less than before .
Now maybe you will take a closer look at Robbie Thomas too .
You managed to sell a few tickets for his show in Fort Wayne with your segment on his racket despite the fact that he has absolutely no crimes solved under his fat belt and zero credibility with law enforcement .
I guess in Fort Wayne they do n’t let facts get in the way of a good juicy kidnapping or murder story .
If any crimes were truly solved by Kelli ( or Robbie ) personally and you have facts and not anecdotes , we await your news worthy input here at skepticblog .
Perhaps you could hook Kelli up with Robbie and they could go on the road with Indiana ’s News Extra Desk as their sponsor ?
I still do n’t know if it was Kelli herself or the station who pulled the plug .
I tried calling Kelli at her phone number 260- 432-7986 without getting through .
So Kelli , if you want to respond , please do .
You have my number .
We are waiting .
I ’m sure that overall this minor set - back wo n’t make much of a dent in your career as a remote viewer and medium .
I ’m sure you will make good use of your time spent under ABC ’s wing as a good resume point and I ’m also sure you saw this coming without any need for psychic powers of any sort .
If it ’s true that you did voluntarily back off on your own as I suggested last month , I applaud your effort and thanks for doing the right thing .
If not , well , eh , … Good Luck ?
Vitantonio Liuzzi ’s full - time return to Formula 1 has not gone well so far this year .
He ’s been off the pace of team mate Adrian Sutil in qualifying and the races .
Will Force India persist with Liuzzi until the end of the season – or will they draft reserve driver Paul di Resta in before the year is out ?
Sunday ’s race was the latest in a string of poor results for Liuzzi .
He says he is struggling to get to grips with the 2010 tyres :
Basically we had the same problem as Barcelona ?����ǣ there ?
������s a lack of grip overall .
We can not put load on the rear tyres .
I struggle as if the tyres were cold .
We were a bit more optimistic after Monaco because even if the problem had not been solved completely , we found a way to go around the issue .
But Istanbul is a proper track with a lot of high speed , medium speed and low speed , so you need to find a compromise .
And in fact we were struggling like in Barcelona .
Vitantonio Liuzzi
He is 6 - 1 down against Sutil in qualifying and without Vitaly Petrov ’s crash in Monaco the score would probably read 7 - 0 .
But it ’s the scale of Sutil ’s advantage that will be most worrying Liuzzi :
Race Liuzzi ’s gap to Sutil * Bahrain +0.657 Australia +0.697 Malaysia +1.34 ( wet ) China +0.49 Spain +0.869 Monaco - 0.257 Turkey +1.007
His average deficit to his team mate in dry qualifying is over half a second – more than any other driver bar Vitaly Petrov and Lucas di Grassi , who are both rookies with experienced team mates .
His race pace has been off by a similar amount – have a look at his form here .
This kind of gap might be acceptable if Liuzzi was a rookie or if he was up against a driver of Lewis Hamilton or Fernando Alonso ’s calibre .
But Monaco was his 50th Grand Prix and , with all due respect to Sutil , he is not thought of as one of F1 ’s elite .
Force India are a team on the fringes of the top ten and Liuzzi ’s shortfall in performance to Sutil is keeping them from having both cars in the points regularly .
The team may consider that , if they ’re going to have one driver that far behind the other , it might as well be a rookie who they could expect to make a faster rate of progress .
The team has Paul di Resta waiting in the wings and have already put the Mercedes - backed DTM driver in the car in several Friday practice sessions this year .
Is Liuzzi ’s second crack at Formula 1 about to come to an end ?
Should Force India give him longer to prove he can get up to speed – or take a gamble on di Resta ?
Have your say in the comments .

Here ’s an event we do n’t get to see very often .
It is a post - launch activity that is not well publicized and of course , with the retirement of the space shuttles fast approaching , we have just a few opportunities to see it again .
Early Monday morning , the solid rocket boosters used for space shuttle Atlantis ’ launch last week were towed back to Port Canaveral after their recovery from the Atlantic Ocean .
Universe Today photographer Alan Walters captured some images of the return , and in the image above , the Liberty Star — one of two unique ships specifically designed and constructed for this task — returns one booster through the locks at the Port .
Visible is the “ business end ” of the booster .
A spokesperson at Kennedy Space Center said these two boosters will be refurbished , just in case they are needed in the future .
See more images below .
Here ’s a close - up of the nozzle end of the SRB , a little worse for wear after the launch .
After the boosters do their job and are jettisoned from the shuttle , they fall back to the ocean .
The parachutes provide for a nozzle - first impact , so air is trapped in the empty motor casing , causing the booster to float with the forward end approximately 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) out of the water .
Once the boosters are located , divers insert a plug in the nozzle ( the metal object in the middle of the nozzle ) called the Diver Operated Plug .
The divers “ dewater ” the SRBs by pumping air into and water out of the SRB .
This causes the SRB to change from a nose - up floating position to a horizontal attitude more suitable for towing .
The top end of the SRB is visible in this image .
The nose cap is jettisoned at an altitude of 2.9 statute miles ( 2.5 nautical miles / 4.6 kilometers ) and deploys the pilot parachute .
An SRB fully loaded with propellant weighs about 1.4 million pounds ( 635,040 kilograms ) .
They stand 149.2 feet ( 45.5 meters ) tall , and have a diameter of 12 feet ( 3.6 meters ) .
The boosters in use today are the largest solid propellant motors ever developed for space flight and the first to be used on a manned space vehicle .
These boosters will propel the orbiter to a speed of 3,512 miles per hour ( 5,652 kilometers per hour ) .
Approximately two minutes after the Space Shuttle lifts off from the launch pad , the twin SRBs have expended their fuel , and the boosters separate from the orbiter and its external tank at an altitude of approximately 30.3 statute miles ( 26.3 nautical miles / 48.7 kilometers ) above the Earth .
After separation , momentum will propel the SRBs for another 70 seconds to an altitude of 44.5 statute miles ( 38.6 nautical miles / 71.6 kilometers ) before they begin their long tumble back to Earth .
This is the frustum , which holds the drogue shoot .
It is jettisoned from the booster after the drogue shoot stabilizes the SRB in a tail - first attitude , and is separated by a pyrotechnic charge about 243 seconds after SRB separation .
The main parachutes are the first items to be brought on board the recovery ships .
Their shroud lines are wound onto each of three of the four reels on the ship ’s deck .
The drogue parachute , attached to the frustum , is reeled onto the fourth reel until the frustum is approximately 50 feet astern of the ship .
The 5,000 - pound ( 2,268 - kilogram ) frustum is then lifted from the water using the ship ’s power block and deck crane .
The ships enter Port Canaveral , where the booster is changed from the stern tow position to a position alongside the ship to allow greater control .
The ships then pass through a drawbridge , Canaveral Locks , and transit the Banana River to a hanger .
They are lifted from the water with specially made Straddle - Lift cranes and placed on rail cars to begin the disassembly and refurbishment process .
The Liberty Star and the Freedom star each have a crew of ten ; a nine - person SRB retrieval team , a retrieval supervisor , a NASA representative , and some observers , with the maximum complement at 24 persons .
While the ships were built especially for NASA for retrieving the SRBs , they ’ve also been used for other purposes , including side - scan sonar operations , cable - laying , underwater search and salvage , drone aircraft recovery , platforms for robotic submarine operations and numerous support roles for other government agencies .
The ships have a special water jet system in the stern thruster which allows the ship to move in any direction without the use of propellers .
This system was installed to protect the endangered manatee population that inhabits regions of the Banana River where the ships are based .
The system also allows divers to work near the ship during operations at a greatly reduced risk .
Thanks to Alan Walters for getting up early this morning to capture these great , unique images .

Some rough off - screen snaps of a game purporting to be MotorStorm 3 have appeared on the net , showing an apparent move in setting to an apocalyptic , collapsing city for the off - road racing series .
French site PS3 Gen ( via Kotaku ) has the pics , which it calls " stolen " .
A title screen shows the MotorStorm 3 logo over a cracked and burning skyline , identified as San Francisco by a sign in the foreground .
A tuned road car is shown racing along streets as skyscrapers collapse ahead of it in scenes strongly reminiscent of Disney 's recent action racer Split / Second .
Another shot has pedestrians running across the path of the speeding car , and what might be a helicopter on fire .
If genuine , the screens would represent a dramatic change for Sony and Evolution Studios ' racing series , which has so far set its anarchic off - road racing in natural wildernesses : an American desert and volcanisland in the two PS3 entries to date , and the Arctic on PSP and PS2 .
Sony registered the MotorStorm 3 domain earlier this year .
There 's no word from Sony yet on whether these images are genuine and , if so , up to date .
If we knew ourselves , we would n't be able to tell you .
Sit tight for confirmation one way or the other as E3 approaches .
Graphic : Diego Aguirre Preferring to err on the side of caution , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted 10 - 1 to require cell phone makers to post notices in their stores with details on the level of radiation each model emits .
The ordinance requires retailers to post information on what is called the " specific absorption rate " ( SAR ) of its products .
The SAR rates measure the amount of radio wave radiation absorbed into the user 's body tissue .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , who supports the ordinance , is expected to sign it into law .
It would take effect in February , with a $ 300 fine for those found in violation .
Other jurisdictions , including Maine and California , have considered similar legislation , but it appears San Francisco would be the first to enact it .
( To watch a video recording of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors ' vote click here )
Some worry that prolonged exposure to cell phone radiation may cause brain cancer , although scientific studies have proven inconclusive .
The most recent and most comprehensive study , conducted by Interphone and published May 17 , found no increased risk for the two most common types of brain cancer .
The lack of certainty one way or the other poses a conundrum .
If the government issues warnings just to be safe , it may scare consumers needlessly .
On the other hand , if a risk does indeed exist , the government is obligated to alert the public of the potential harm .
The Federal Communication Commission , which regulates cell phone safety along with the Food and Drug Administration , states on its Web site " there is no scientific evidence to date that proves that wireless phone usage can lead to cancer or a variety of other health effects , " but goes on to note that " studies are ongoing . "
The FCC has set a standard that no cell phone sold in the United States can have a SAR in excess of 1.6 watts per kilogram .
Enterprising consumers can find SAR information on the FCC Web site , but they need to have the product 's FCC ID code .
San Francisco's new law would put that hard - to - find data directly in front of consumers in stores .
Not surprisingly , representatives of the cell phone industry oppose the law , citing both the existing FCC standard and the lack of definitive scientific evidence linking cell phone use to brain cancer .
John Walls , a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association , told the San Francisco Chronicle that the law " will potentially mislead consumers with point - of - sale requirements suggesting that some phones are safer than others , based on radio emissions . "
That argument did not sway the lawmakers in city of San Francisco , who say it will serve the public .
" This is a modest and commonsense measure to provide greater transparency and information to consumer , " Tony Winnicker , a spokesman for Mayor Newsom , told the Chronicle .

One of the most striking trends following the flotilla attack has been how quickly Israeli hasbara is being exposed by internet journalists .
The doctored IOF audio clips , where amateurs with mock Arab accents hiss ‘ Go back to Auschwitz ’ to Israeli naval officers .
Well they did n’t take long to pull apart did they ?
Then there are the ( so - pathetic - they ’re - almost - funny claims the flotilla was linked to Al Qaeda .
I laughed out loud to read in an Israeli paper that humanitarian activist ( and former US marine ) Ken O’Keefe was going to Gaza to ; ‘ train a commando unit in Hamas . ’
I know Ken fairly well .
Quite frankly I ’m not sure who should be more insulted by this stupidity him or Hamas ?
Either way flinging the words ‘ Hamas ’ ‘ Jihadists ’ and ‘ Israel ’s security ’ around is no longer having the same shock and awe effect on journalists or the public at large .
The internet now shapes the world ’s story , not the Israeli Foreign Ministry .
Meanwhile , like a soccer star caught cheating on his wife .
Instead of saying ‘ I messed up big time , forgive me ’
Israeli government sources and other shysters are screaming ; ‘it ’s not fair to watch us all the time , that ’s mean ! ’ and ‘ this is our business , leave us alone ! ’
Bad luck for them that as it stands , more of the IDF ’s minging dirty washing , is being aired in public than ever before ; via facebook and twitter .
The Zionists sobs of ‘ no faiirrrr ! ’ are sounding ever more bizarre .
But more about the Isra - bots later on .
Israeli Intelligence ( some mistake surely ? ) have been busy since the massacre .
Erasing the memory sticks and hard disks of what my preliminary research estimates to be some 800 video cameras , around 1200 mobiles and 600 lap tops .
All items , looted from the passengers of the Freedom Flotilla , whilst they kneeled , handcuffed and in stress positions , on the hot deck of the Mavi Marmara for up to 12 hours after the attack .
Before the bots cry ‘ why so much money on board , why so many cameraaas !’
Let me explain , the good individuals on board had been raising money for months in the local communities around the world to take useful gifts tot eh people , schools and children of the besieged Gaza Strip .
Besides which - the cameras were the only ‘ weapons ’ those on board had with which to arm themselves in the event of an attack at sea .
Now , evidence is emerging , that having been forced ( by Turkish hard line diplomacy ) to release all of the kidnapped passengers sooner than it would have liked ; Israel is ( as usual ) taking revenge on the Palestinian relatives of activists onboard .
Those who seek to non violently oppose Zionist policies of Apartheid violence are having loved ones interrogated by the Shabak as you read this for merely sailing with the Freedom Flotilla .
I am not at liberty to say much more for fear of even further reprisals on innocent people .
But as you should by now be aware , the Israeli machine specialises in collective punishment .
This week a spokesman in the US said live on air that ‘ Children in Gaza were under siege because their parents voted Hamas . ’
Too much to say on that , so I ’ll leave it hanging for you to take in
Last night in London , as in so many cities this week , Freedom flotilla passengers addressed a packed open meeting .
At the Conway Hall in Central London half a dozen British survivors , looked in turns spaced out and hardened by their experience , eleven days ago ( is that all it is ?
How the world turns ! ) .
Jamal El Shayyal , is the Al Jazeera reporter who kept broadcasting as gun shots rang out behind him on the upper decks of the Mavi Marmara .
I honestly thought I had heard , read and seen the worst about the Israeli attack on the fleet ’s passengers .
I had n’t .
Believe me , nor have you .
Those three minutes clips , miraculously broadcast live or smuggled out beneath tongues , reveal the merest inkling of the horrors these brave people witnessed .
And suffered .
El Shayyal , told an utterly silent audience he ‘ had been invited by IHH to film every inch of the ship . ’
So he did .
From the bowels of the hull to the uppermost decks he filmed .
‘ I checked and filmed ’ he said ‘ there was not 1 weapon onboard .
Not one gun .
no lethal artillery .
The most lethal thing on the ship was fruit and vegetables . ’
When the Israeli commandos attack began Jamal was wearing his pyjamas under a life jacket as were so many of the allegedly ‘ prepared terrorists on board . ’
Helicopters caused a near hurricane on the decks , all satellite phones were jammed ( deliberately to stop SOS calls to the rest of the world ) .
And , so the IDF hoped , any factual reports of what was about to occur .
At this point , just after four thirty am , Jamal saw a Turkish passenger shot in the top of his head .
He spoke slowly and clearly to make sure he was understood by us all in the hall .
‘ No Soldier was on the ship at this time ’ .
Quickly another passenger removed a white t- shirt from a bag and used it as a white flat of surrender .
When gun shots rang out , greater numbers fell .
It was clear calls for mercy were to be ignored .
That a shoot to kill policy was in place .
An Israeli member of the Knesset and Lubna ( an activist who also speaks Hebrew ) took turns making announcements over the tannoy in English and then Hebrew .
Announcements made at least 8 times ;
‘ We have critically injured people here , please can you come and get them .
We are NOT armed .
We SURRENDER !’
Soon the tannoy connection was cut off .
Sarah Colborne of the PSC and another passenger negotiated with soldiers for the evacuation of some at least of the mounting injured .
Many of the bleeding would not go with the Israeli’s .
Fearing they would be less safe getting ‘ treatment ’ from the troops , than below decks being operated on without anaesthetic .
‘ The Israelis were asked for a stretcher ’ continued Jamal ‘ for a man with severe internal bleeding to be moved .
Use a sleeping bag we were told . ’
The man was moved in agony on a blanket no doubt increasing his injuries .
And his immense pain .
Did he survive ?
We ’ll never know .
As the shooting gave way to the enforced imprisonment of the passengers , or , let ’s give it its right name – kidnapping , Jamal was pushed to the floor , cuffed and beaten .
His possessions taken from him .
It was morning on a bright , sunny , summer ’s day by now .
Hundreds of shocked men were taken on deck , hands bound behind their backs .
Three , then four hours passed .
Pleas were made to use the toilet .
No water was given , they were kicked , spat at and punched by soldiers who passed by every few minutes .
Eventually Jamal persuaded one soldier to let him go to the toilet , ‘ with my hands still bound behind my back . ’
One man in his eighties trying to get back to his family in Gaza , was jeered by soldiers , in his discomfort .
After many hours , he suffered the indignity of urinating on himself , in front of both friends and fiends .
At some point Jamal was taken back downstairs .
The area had been thoroughly ransacked .
‘ There was no respect for human rights or dignity .
Holy books of all faiths had been thrown about , possessions strewn everywhere ” .
He remembers one quietly spoken Muslim brother asking soldiers gently several times for his cuffs to be loosened , just slightly .
The third time he asked one of them tightened them so much that ‘he gave a scream of agony that made us all feel sick to our stomachs . ’
In the afternoon the ship was forced into Ashdod port .
Pushed ashore by armed guards Jamal was greeted with the words ; ‘ Welcome to Israel .
Are you enjoying your time here ?’
The Al Jazeera journalist wanted us all to understand something very clearly .
That the civilian passengers were not ‘ detained ’ nor ‘ arrested . ’
They were plainly and in every legal definition of the word ‘ Kidnapped , abducted . ’
In Beersheva prison , he was placed in a cell , with a leader from the Turkish human rights group , IHH .
They had no food for 24 hours , just a few sips of water .
They had no idea if the world knew where they were or what had happened .
In other parts of the prison , consular reps from Greece , France , Spain and Macedonia could be heard shouting at the Israeli captors demanding the release of their compatriots .
Yelling that rights were not being respected , yelling for food , water , access to legal representation .
From the British consul .
Nothing .
Finally when every other consul had visited the abducted civilians , a British rep turned up .
Jamal described the obsequious nature of the visit in terms that make one cringe .
Bowing and scraping to the Israelis , the British diplomat did n’t even push for the right to see the victims in a private area .
A legal imperative for all detainees during such visits .
He did n’t demand water , or food , or a release time for those he was supposedly representing .
Under the gaze of Israeli soldiers he asked just two questions ; ‘ what is your name and what is your home number in the UK . ’
Then our citizens were left .
Wondering about their fate and that of their comrades ; hungry , afraid , shocked , alone .
When the Israeli ’s knew the game was up , that the world had indeed seen clips of their murderous attack , the Turkish abductees were given the chance to leave quickly , in an hour .
Did they go ?
No .
They refused point blank to leave ‘ before every other nationality has left before us . ’
We salute them .
Jamal , Osama , Alexandra , Sarah , Kevin , and four hundred other internationals were released ONLY because of Turkish support for them .
Not because the international community stepped in .
Not because of action by the UN or ( God forbid ) , the UK government .
Because of the Turkey government .
In all his time as a prisoner , some forty hours plus , Jamal , like all the other Brits , had no legal visit , no phone call home and no proper British representation .
Finally at Ben Gurion airport being deported from a place he never wanted to enter in the first place .
Jamal was given a piece of paper with a photo of himself on it and Hebrew writing .
His interrogator smirked at him and led him towards the plane ‘ Congratulations ’ the man said .
‘ This is your new passport . ’
‘ I want my old passport ! ’
Said Jamal .
‘ Sue me ! ’
Came the reply .
There was more much more from the survivors , which was videotaped and I will post as soon as it comes online .
But let ’s get back to the Zio - bots now .
For alongside Press TV cameras and PSC workers filming the testimonies , there was the compulsory , sulky faced Zionist , shooting footage of the event for some organization opposed to justice , and free speech .
Curiously , as the survivors described their horrors in depth , this woman ’s camera was aimed NOT at the stage .
But at my Press TV colleagues .
I went outside for a cigarette and there she was again .
Instantly recognisable as a tight lipped Proto Zionist .
She asked if I was with Press TV and would I speak to her for “ Israeli TV ? ” Clearly she was not from any broadcaster — as no valid news channel accepts shaky , amateur hand held footage of the sort she was producing .
Curious about her real intentions , I said ‘ with pleasure . ’
‘ So do you think Press TV has done enough to give the Israeli side of events concerning the flotilla ? ’
Did I pause ?
It felt like a must have , just to have the time to process that after an hour of harrowing testimony about a massacre , this woman , had heard and felt – nothing .
‘ The BBC has given Mark Regev enough space for your cause do n’t you think , ’ I replied
‘ Yes but do n’t you think Press TV ought to ….’ and then it happened .
The white rage .
I heard children crying in Gaza , saw fishermen being shot along the coast , phosphorous plummeting onto schools and UNWRA food stores .
I saw the massacre on the Freedom Fleet , the torture , the needless , avoidable death ..
‘ Go fuck yourself , ’ I heard myself saying .
And to make sure I could n’t be misquoted I added .
‘ Just fuck off . ’

Preamble : Afternoon / evening .
Well , I hope you 're all thoroughly enjoying the winter weather that the month of May has kindly brought us .
At least by being stuck in this office my blood circulation has remained intact .
As for this match , a cursory glance at the league table shows me that a point would all but ensure Arsenal finish third this season , thus meaning they do n't have to qualify for the Champions League , while a win will guarantee automatic qualification .
But , to be honest , it still means very little and any enjoyment in the match is likely to be drawn from the skills and flashy flicks that often accompany meaningless kickabouts at the season 's end .
Anyway , I 'll be back at 4.30 pm .
In the meantime have a listen to this ... then buy it if you like , it 's pretty damn good .
The teams are in ...
Blackburn : Robinson , Salgado , Samba , Nelsen , Givet , Andrews ,
Grella , Dunn , Pedersen , Olsson , Roberts .
Subs : Brown , Jacobsen , Emerton , Basturk , Hoilett , Di Santo , Jones .
Arsenal : Fabianski , Sagna , Campbell , Silvestre , Traore , Eboue ,
Diaby , Walcott , Nasri , Vela , van Persie .
Subs : Mannone , Eduardo , Djourou , Arshavin , Gibbs , Eastmond , Henderson .
So Vela makes his first start of the season for Arsenal .
I expect he 'll be employed just behind Van Persie .
He 's looked very impressive in the rare games he 's played for the club and might be the man who , more than any other , will provide those fancy flicks I mentioned in my preamble .
Just to let you know , Colin Hendry and Craig Burley are picking their teams of the season , the catch being that they can't pick a player who was in the PFA team of the season .
I 'll list them above in a second ...
Colin Hendry 's team of the season : ( Discuss )
Jose Reina
Vedran Corluka , Michael Dawson , Nemanja Vidic , Gareth Bale
Dirk Kuyt , Frank Lampard , Tim Cahill , Ashley Young
Carlos Tevez , Fernando Torres
Craig Burley 's team of the season ( Discuss )
Shay Given
Steven Carr , Michael Dawson , John Heitinga , Leighton Baines
Steven Pienaar , Frank Lampard , Wilson Palacious , Florent Malouda
Carlos Tevez , Fernando Torres
4.51 pm : Arsène Wenger says his team always try to play with the " handbrake off " which is an expression I quite like ...
4.53 pm : An email : " Winter weather , Gregg ?
It 's warm and sunny here in North London , " writes Nick Dunkeyson .
" Perfect barbecue weather ( well , nearly ) .
Have you perhaps relocated to Greenland ? "
No Nick .
I 'm just down the road in Kings Cross but when I got soaked in Dalston on my way into work on my bike this afternoon I can assure you that it felt like December .
4.58 pm : The teams make their way out onto the pitch in front of a reasonable crowd at Ewood ( probably 24,000 or so ) .
Just time for one more email : " Kuyt ?
Torres ?
They do realise that Liverpool are seventh , right ? " writes a disgruntled Aidan Gibson of Colin Hendry and Craig Burley 's teams of the year .
" Was Song in the PFA ?
If not how is he not listed here ? "
I do n't think Song was in the PFA list Aidan .
I 'd have him ahead of Cahill , but Palacious has had a very good season too ... anyway , kick - off is imminent .
1 min : Peep !
And Blackburn win a free - kick immediately .
Pedersen swings the ball into the box but Campbell heads clear .
" Surely Colin Hendry is laughing to himself and saying ' I got this one past them ' when he 's writing that team of the season , " huffs Tom Hillyard .
" Corluka ?
Vidic ?
The entire midfield not called ' Frank ' ?
The forward line ?
Only Dawson , Lampard and Reina have any sort of a shout at this . "
Corluka at right - back is the weakest link for me Tom .
3 min : A dreadful miss by Vela !
Silvestre plays a delicious ball out to the right which Eboue knocks down the line with pace to Walcott .
He motors to the byline and clips the ball back to Vela with Robinson in no -man 's land , but Vela scuffs the ball wide of the open goal when only seven yards out .
You could see the flakes of rust come off his boot as he swung at that , the poor scamp ...
5 min : Traore , playing in the unfamilair left - back position , tries to do a stepover and loses possession cheaply .
Dunn picks the ball up and jinks inside Diaby who leaves a leg dangling and downs the Blackburn midfielder 25 yards from goal in a central position .
Pedersen stands over it ...
6 min : Pedersen whips the ball round the wall towards the top - left hand corner but Fabianski pounces over to pluck the ball out of the air and hold onto it .
7 min : Blackburn are snapping into every tackle as if this game actually means something to them , which is creditable , as it obviously means something to the Blackburn fans who are there .
Meanwhile , the Colin Hendry / Craig Burley teams of the year debate rumbles on ...
" How have both men chosen Torres over Bent ? " wonders Alex Seelig .
" Bent 's scored , what , 24 goals this term ?
Torres , brilliant though he has been at times , has played half a season at best .
Also , as a City supporter , I can tell you Given has not been the second best keeper in the league this year .
Great shot stopper , yes , but when it comes to punching , catching , distributing and organising a defence , the man is just about woeful .
His inability to come for a cross has cost us just as many ( if not more ) points as his brilliant saves have earned us . "
Hmm , interesting point about Given , Alex .
10 min : Eboué dwells on the ball when only 15 yards from goal after Vela pulls a cross back to him after a handy run down the left flank .
He should have hit that when he had the chance .
12 min : Walcott has looked a threat everytime he gets the ball on the right .
He wins a corner after hitting a flat cross against Givet .
Goal !
Blackburn 0 - 1 Arsenal ( Van Persie 13 ) :
14 min : Van persie 's cross is headed clear for a corner on the other side , which Nasri takes .
The Dutch striker makes his way into the box and takes up position on the far post .
Sagna flicks on Nasri 's near - post corner and Van Persie rises above his marker to head in with ease from the six - yard box .
16 min : The Colin Hendry / Craig Burley ' teams ' of the season debate continues ... " Gareth Bale ?
At left - back ?
When all of his good performances have been at left - wing ? " writes Adrian Cooper in high - pitched words .
" That 's an odd choice from Colin Hendry .
And has n't Craig Burley picked two left - wingers in Malouda and Pienaar ?
There 's a reason that Hendry and Burley are pundits and not managers , is n't there ? "
Indeed Adrian .
18 min : Rovers have reverted to pumping long balls into the box already .
It 's not a bad tactic .
Samba charges in at Fabianski twice , the first attempt led to the wobbles and a dropped catch which he is lucky not to see land at the feet of a Blackburn player , instead of team - mate Campbell .
19 min : Arsenal 's fans start having a pop at the volume of support at Ewood Park from Blackburn 's fans .
It must be one of the most boring chants ever .
Every Premier League ground 's home fans are generally pretty quiet these days .
It 's hardly a surprise .
Rovers win a free - kick after Van Persie was adjudged to have backed into Samba .
The big defender legs it up to the edge of the box where the ball will be lumped up to him .
This time the much - maligned Fabianski punches above the crowd of players pretty impressively .
23 min : Oh dear !
A long throw - in from Rovers puts Fabianski under pressure again .
The ball is flicked into the box where the keeper runs into Campbell 's wardrobe - shaped midriff and lands flat on the floor clutching the ball and his body in pain .
He 'll get some treatment and allow me to look at your emails .
25 min : Ebouè drives into Blackburn 's half and has his heels clipped by Grella as he looks up to pass the ball .
That 's a booking for Grella .
" Unbelievable that Torres makes that line up , " yelps Josh Harris .
" Bent has had a productive season to say the least ( 24 goals in 36 apps ) and Hodgson 's princess - ly kiss has transformed Zamora from frog to prince for ' fairy - tale team of the season ' Fulham . "
Send your letters of disgust to Craig Burley and Colin Henry c/o ESPN .
27 min :
This is one hell of a bitty game .
Arsenal win a free - kick from a cynical foul from Dunn which Van Persie hits straight into the wall and then Rovers win a free - kick 30 yards out after another long ball from Blackburn .
Pedersen clips it into the box looking to put Fabianski ( who recovered from his injury , I might add ) in further discomfort , but Campbell jumps highest and clears .
29 min : Pass , pass , pass , peep !
Van Persie turns sharply 30 yards from goal and is hacked at and then dragged down by the industrial Nelsen .
Van Persie avoids the wall with this powerful effort but Robinson parries it wide for a corner .
Nasri whips the ball in but Robinson punches clear .
More emails to come ...
33 min : MBM answers your queries section
" Gregg , not to suggest disinterest in this dead rubber , but is there going to be a Football Weekly today ? " asks Simon McGrother .
Yes Simon .
Here it is ... it 's all about squeeky bums and Fulham apparently .
34 min : Another foul leads to a Blackburn free - kick on the right corner of the Arsenal box .
Pedersen drives it around the wall viciously but Fabianksi parries it over the bar from a central position .
The corner is swung into the back - post where at least five Rovers players surround Fabianski , who does well to claw the ball away from under the bar before being shoved into the post .
Does anyone have the number for that anti-bullying service ?
36 min :
If you 're going to do a dumby , let your team - mate know about it .
Andrews runs onto a square ball 25 yards from goal and looks set to hit it , but instead he runs past the ball , leaving it for Dunn , who carries on trotting into the area before stretching back and falling over at an awkward angle .
With his injury record that could have been nasty !
39 min : Here 's Gary Naylor : " Van Persie looks like he 's about to transform into a werewolf in that photograph .
That 's ridiculous , because footballers do not transform into werewolves – not since Roy Keane stopped playing anyway .
And I 'm sure you 'll join me in congratulating Everton Ladies on their FA Cup win . "
Ah yes ! the Toffees ' ladies won 3 - 2 in extra - time I believe .
Being a big Marine FC fan I have no qualms about congratulating the blue - half 's ladies ...
Goal !
Blackburn 1 - 1 Arsenal ( Dunn 43 min )
43 min : That was a messy goal !
A long ball forwards was headed out for a corner by Arsenal .
The ball was whipped in by Pedersen to the backpost where Fabianski flapped at it as Samba headed it down towards Roberts .
A scuffed clearance was worked out to Andrews who drove a ball in low towards Dunn at the backpost , who pounced on a deflection to knock home .
Half - time : Van Persie gets an elbow in the face , which looked accidental .
He gets a little treatment and is back onto his feet to hear the whistle blown for half - time .
That was a strange half in which Big Sam 's tactics were spot on .
It was n't pretty to watch but his plan of crowding Fabianski and targeting him finally paid off .
The corner came in right on top of him with Samba applying the pressure and he was unable to get a strong hand on the ball .
Sets the second - half up nicely .

Half - time emails
" When you said it was a messy goal you did n't mean it was a brilliant solo goal scored by an Argentinian did you ? " parps Ian Copestake .
No Ian , I just like five - letter words that easily come to mind , like sarky .
" As an Irishman , I find Alex Seelig 's attitude to Shay Given to be extremely ungrateful , " harrumphs Mark Grassick .
" Surely , Given has cost them far fewer points than their extremely expensive and bumbling defenders ? "
" Can we have an enormous shout out to Oxford United ( and a tiny one to York City ) , who will be at Wembley on 16 May for the Blue Square Premier play - off final ?
asks Frank Webster .
No Frank , I 'm afraid not .
An MBM is n't the forum for such a thing .
Oh !
45 min :
The second half is delayed for a few seconds while Sol Campbell ambles on to the pitch with all the time in the world .
Thankfully , Walcott ups the pace somewhat when the match resumes with a zippy run down the right which leads to a corner .
The ball is whipped into the nearpost but Samba clears .
47 min : Salgado bodychecks Sagna and Arsenal play a short free - kick and keep possession .
Diaby finds Walcott again on the right , but with his way blocked off he turns and passes the ball backwards , which reminds me of this email from Ian Copestake in reference to Arsène Wenger 's comments before the match .
" Liverpool have also been a team playing with the handbrake off all season which explains why they have raced uncontrollably backwards . "
50 min : Salgado sends Nasri tumbling to the turf .
Traore picks the ball up after some tippy - tappy stuff in the middle of the park and completely mishits his ball out to Walcott .
Pedersen picks up possession and looks long for Roberts , but the ball is overhit and Arsenal pick up possession again .
This is all a bit dreary .
Anything good on the telly ?
52 min : Some dreadful defending by Blackburn and a misjudgment by Robinson leads to an Arsenal corner .
Walcott skinned his marker before playing in what is becoming his usual low , disappointing cross , but Nelsen fails to clear and then Van Persie barges into Samba , which completely bamboozles Robinson and should have been a free - kick .
The corner is wasted anyway , mind ...
55 min : Shock !
Blackburn play some decent football and nearly score .
Instead of lumping it upfield Rovers keep possession in Arsenal 's half before Pedersen plays a neat return pass with Dunn .
He races into the box one - on - one with Fabianski but watches the ball get parried away as he tries to dink it over him .
With the ball almost out of play Campbell tries to block Pedersen 's attempted cross but sends him tumbling .
It was probably a penalty , but does it still count if the ball was out of play ?
The ref does n't give it .
I 'll let you decide on that one ...
58 min : Blackburn sub .
Junior Hoillett comes on for Grella and is immediately involved .
He races up on the overlap past Dunn , who is now on the right and stings Fabianski's palms with a fierce strike .
The Rovers players crowd Fabianksi again as the ball is curled in , but the keeper punches safe under immense pressure .
62 min : Arsenal settle down after a good 10 - minute spell for Blackburn .
They keep possession and entice a foul from Andrews some distance from goal .
Possesesion - play is resumed and Arsenal find Walcott on the right , who floats a delicious ball in to the backpost ( as if to spite me ) which Van Persie collects with instantaneous control .
He turns inside Salgado expertly , but then appears to have his heels clipped as he prepares to strike .
That was a penalty as far as I could see .
65 min :
There 's a fair bit of filth going on out there .
Plenty shirt - pulling and incidents off the ball .
I suppose when cultures clash this kind of thing can happen , even in meaningless games .
Vela , whose most notable contribution was to miss from six yards in the third minute , is replaced by Arshavin .
Goal !
Blackburn 2 - 1 Arsenal ( Samba 68min ) :
68 min : Blackburn 's bull - boy tactics work brilliantly again .
Arsenal concede a corner after a long throw causes havoc in the box .
Pedersen clips it into the six - yard box where Samba leans into his marker among a crowd of seven players standing in front of Fabianksi , he then flicks a header past the keeper , who ca n't jump past the crowd to punch clear and looks like a little boy lost .
70 min : Blackburn have got their tails up after that goal .
A couple of attacks lead to a free - kick , which Dunn sends skimming past the far post by only a couple of inches .
71 min : " I have n't seen that much of Blackburn this season but had heard that Salgado had been having a few problems earlier in the season adjusting to the Premier League / Blackburn 's style .
Has he attempted to get back in favour with the locals by disguising himself as former favourite Tugay ? " asks David Wall .
It 's a good point David , he 's a spit for him .
I suppose he 's old and slow like Tugay too .
73 min : Walcott goes one - on - one with Givet and chases him all the way to the byline .
The Arsenal winger bashes the ball off Givet 's nose and then crashes into an advertisement board for Eto jeans .
Has anybody ever bought a pair of Eto jeans ?
I imagine they 're horrific - like those jeans that used to have cartoon characters on their pockets in the late 80s .
Prove me wrong , please .
Oh , the corner comes to nowt in case you 're interested .
76 min : Nasri is penalised for what did n't appear to be much by my reckoning .
Dunn takes the frree - kick and Rovers keep possession .
77 min : Eboué is replaced by Eduardo as Wenger looks for the point .
78 min : " Excellent typo on 68 mins .
Though comparing yourself to Fabianski may be a touch demeaning to yourself , " quips Phil Wainwright .
Ah , I see that rogue M would suggest I am very much like Fabianki and a ' little boy lost . "
I can often appear that way in Guardian Towers where there are some awfully tall sub-editors .
Arsenal have regained their composure after conceding the goal , but Blackburn are defending gamely .
81 min : Arsenal win a corner after Walcott 's cross deflects off Givet .
In stark contrast to Fabianki , Robinson punches clear under no more pressure than a single man stood a yard away from him .
I think it was Van Persie if it helps you to paint a head - picture .
83 min : Pass , pass , pass , pass , pass , pass .
Sagna crosses into the Blackburn box but it 's played too close to the front post and is cleared easily .
Sagna is shoved by Samba while jumping and lands heavily .
That 'll have winded him .
Suck it in son , suck it in .
Dunn has a pop at Wenger as he 's substituted .
He 's replaced by Phil Jones , who 's a defender .
Expect Blackburn to sit deep and try to hang on for the win .
And that 's the end of my short sentences .
87 min : " Hey Blackburn fan following from Argentina here , " writes Niall Waters .
MBMer conjures up pictures of the barrio and kids playing football in the street and other stereotypical Argentinian things that are probably far from reality .
" I think Jason Roberts does n't get the credit he deserves .
How he has managed to convince Sam Allardyce and a few managers before him that he is good enough to play top - flight football is quite remarkable .
Good work Jase . "
Cheeky Niall ...
90 min : Blackburn look too strong for Arsenal , who have resorted to lumping the ball forwards themselves .
Apparently , Jason Roberts has been awarded the Peter Taylor the Jewellers man - of - the - match award .
Did you hear that Niall ?
I think Roberts might have recently bought a sovereign ring from said jeweller .
He 's been hardworking but far from MOM in my humble one ...
90+3 min : Arsenal are faced with a wall of blue and white as they tap the ball around in front of the penalty area .
They can find no way through .
Arsène Wenger turns away in disgust and heads into the tunnel without shaking Sam Allardyce 's hand as the final whistle is blown .
Full - time :
It might not have been pretty but Big Sam got his tactics spot on and exposed Arsenal 's all - too - familiar weakness between the sticks .
It might have bordered on the boundaries of legality at times , but the high balls in and the crowding of Fabianski paid off with two goals .
Wenger will likely moan about it , but sometimes Arsenal need to show more aggression when facing such tactics – and today they did n't .
Thanks for all your emails .
Enjoy the rest of your bank holiday .

There 's no end in sight in the struggle for justice for Israel 's attack on a U.S. ship .
THE ISRAELI military has attacked a flotilla of international peace activists , killing as many as 19 innocent civilians while they were bringing 10,000 tons of aid to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
This is not the first time the Israeli military has attacked a non-threatening entity in international waters .
On June 8 , 1967 , while sailing in international waters , the U.S. Navy intelligence ship USS Liberty was attacked by air and naval forces of the state of Israel .
Of the Liberty 's crew of 294 , more than half were killed or wounded .
More than 40 years later , survivors are still seeking justice .
The Israeli forces attacked with full knowledge that the Liberty was an American ship , yet survivors have been forbidden to tell their story under oath to the American public .
Joe Meadors was on the Liberty during the attack .
" I watched some jets pass us , then turn left after they passed our ship , then they started strafing [ attacking repeatedly with bombs or machine - gun fire from low - flying aircraft ] us , " Meadors told Truthout .
" The attack lasted 90 minutes , during which we got a message off to the Sixth Fleet asking for assistance .
We learned later that Joe Tully , commanding officer of the USS Saratoga , launched aircraft within minutes of the attack , but he told us later they were recalled before they reached the horizon .
We found this out 20 years after the attack . "
Meadors said he and his group , the USS Liberty Veterans Association , believe that Rear Adm .
Lawrence Geis , the Sixth Fleet carrier division commander at the time of the attack , was following orders from Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , who called off the Navy 's rescue mission for the USS Liberty .
Meadors , along with other survivors of the attack , have been engaged in what has evolved into a more than 40 - year struggle to find justice .
" The most frustrating thing has been a lack of reaction from the U.S. government , " Meadors explained , " On June 8 , 2005 , we filed a war crimes report , and they [ the U.S. government ] are required to investigate these allegations .
They 've created reports about our mission , but they never did conduct an actual investigation of the attack itself . "
Meadors and the other veterans he works with to bring about a governmental investigation of the attack take the position that they should not have to force the government to do this .
IN 2003 , an independent commission of highly regarded experts was created to look into the matter .
The Moorer Commission , named after its chairman , included retired Adm. Thomas H. Moorer , a former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Gen. Raymond G. Davis , a former assistant commandant of the Marine Corps .
The findings of this commission included : " Israel launched a two - hour air and naval attack against USS Liberty ... Israeli torpedo boats later returned to machine - gun at close range three of the Liberty 's life rafts that had been lowered into the water by survivors to rescue the most seriously wounded ... Israel 's attack was a deliberate attempt to destroy an American ship and kill her entire crew . "
Ray McGovern is a senior CIA analyst who served under seven presidents -- from John F. Kennedy to George H.W. Bush .
McGovern is clear about why he believes the U.S. government continues to refuse to launch an investigation :
For the same reason that President Johnson called back the fighter / bombers ; i.e. , so as not to embarrass our friend Israel .
It is my view that the killing of 34 USS Liberty crew and the wounding of more than 170 others , and the fact that the U.S. Navy , Congress and the executive branch not only prohibited the survivors to speak about it , but also launched faux " inquiries , " is the poster child for what is wrong with the U.S. relationship with Israel , showing the penchant of senior U.S. officials to sacrifice honesty , justice and U.S. servicemen on the sacral altar of " compassionate attachment " to Israel .
McGovern added that , in his view , the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty is " the archetypical example of how Israel was given convincing affirmation of its belief that it can get away with murder , literally , and the U.S. Gulliver would be bound to ignore it ... or even mount ' official ' inquiries to explain it away . "
Bryce Lockwood survived the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty and was awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions during the attack , when he saved at least one wounded sailor 's life .
Lockwood , like McGovern , feels there is no doubt whatsoever that the attack was no accident .
" It was deliberate , " Lockwood told Truthout .
He went on to explain why he thinks Moshe Dayan , who was appointed as Israel 's Defense Minister in 1967 , ordered the attack :
I only learned recently , via a document released by the CIA , that Dayan ordered the attack , despite objections from his staff members .
Our ship had the capability of monitoring virtually everything ... all communications .
The Israelis had nuclear capability , and it was extremely important to the Johnson administration that the Israelis not use the nuclear option .
We could monitor all of this , even when it was done by the Israelis .
The Israelis wanted unbridled use of the nuclear option , and they did n't want us to know about it ... that 's why they attacked us .
Another reason why Lockwood is so certain that the attack was deliberate is because he watched Joe Meadors hoist three U.S. flags up a pole in an attempt to ensure that the Israeli pilots knew they were firing on a U.S. ship .
" The Israelis claim they did n't see a U.S. flag , but they shot down two , and Joe raised three of them , since they kept firing on them , " Lockwood explained .
" They riddled the third with bullet holes , but it stayed up . "
In addition , writing in his memoirs , Richard Helms , the director of Central Intelligence at the time of the attack , explained that the CIA undertook a " final " investigation after more evidence became available , and he offered the following information concerning the CIA 's final finding :
Israeli authorities subsequently apologized for the incident , but few in Washington could believe that the ship had not been identified as an American naval vessel .
Later , an interim intelligence memorandum concluded the attack was a mistake and not made in malice against the U.S....
I had no role in the board of inquiry that followed , or the board 's finding that there could be no doubt that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing in attacking the Liberty .
I have yet to understand why it was felt necessary to attack this ship or who ordered the attack .
MEADORS ' AND Lockwood 's struggle to find justice spans decades , and there does n't appear to be an end in sight .
Meadors is measured in his explanation of how he perceives the politics behind the lack of an investigation : " Politicians feel the Israeli lobby is so powerful , that if they do anything about this , it will cost them votes .
Nobody thinks it was a mistake , everybody knows it was deliberate .
But they wo n't investigate it because they feel it would damage the relationship between the U.S. and Israel . "
As Lockwood concluded : " I 'm disgusted with our country and our representatives .
My country does n't give a damn about me or the people on the Liberty .
I 'm terribly disappointed in the way our country has dealt with us . "
While both Meadors and Lockwood urge people to contact their Congressional representatives and demand an investigation , Meadors is moving ahead with looking for an attorney who will help the USS Liberty Veterans group to which he belongs determine if they have a course of action through federal courts .

I was high today and happy cuz it was so nice out that I high - fived a tree along the side walk .
Then I thought wow , I 'm pretty high .
I just high - fived a tree !
Then I thought it would be a funny euphemism for smoking , as in , " dude , lets go high five some tree "
Actor JOHN C. REILLY was left red-faced on the set of romantic comedy The Good Girl when he had to simulate sex with a clearly - uncomfortable Jennifer Aniston .
The pair star as husband and wife in the 2002 film and one scene sees the odd movie couple get intimate in the bedroom .
But Reilly admits what was meant to be a sexy scene was far from steamy because Aniston insisted on covering up from head - to - toe and using a prop cushion to ensure the stars did n't get too close for comfort .
He says , " It 's all dark and she 's a little tense ' cause a sex scene is going to happen .
So I get there and she 's under the covers and I 'm like , ' OK , I guess they just want me to get in position here . '
So I climb into the bed , she opens up the sheet and I swear , she had two pairs of sweatpants on , winter socks , a long - sleeved T - shirt .
Her body is basically like a burqa from the neck down .
" And I go , ' OK , I guess I 'll just get on top of you now ' , and she 's like , ' Can I get the chastity pillow please ? '
I 'm like what the hell is a chastity pillow ?
And they bring out this big black pillow that she puts between her legs .
And from that moment on , I went from Robert Palmer to the Hunchback of Notre - Dame .
' I 'm sorry , I guess I 'll just hump the pillow ! ' "
The Check is Not in the Mail : Obama Administration to Start Direct Deposit
No more paper checks ; government to save $ 120 million a year .
June 13 , 2010 --
What 's better than getting a check from the government ?
Not much , except maybe getting that money via direct deposit .
On Monday the Obama administration will announce that all payments from the government will now be made to consumers electronically , ABC News has learned .
Americans receiving payments for Social Security , unemployment insurance , veterans benefits , railroad retirement , and government benefits will now find the money automatically deposited into their personal bank accounts .
Americans without bank accounts can get paid using the Treasury Department 's Direct Express Debit MasterCard program .
Why the shift to direct deposits ?
Two reasons : one , it will be easier and faster for consumers to get paid and , two , it will save taxpayers money – an estimated $ 303 million over the first five years and about $ 120 million each year after that .
For instance , despite repeated attempts to get recipients to convert to electronic payments , the Treasury Department still mails out more than 136 million benefit checks each year .
Now , as part of President Obama 's effort to eliminate waste and modernize government for taxpayers , that will change with Monday 's announcement of a complete shift to direct deposits .
" [ The ] announcement is a win-win for the American public because it makes government more convenient and cost - effective while generating significant savings for the country , " said Office of Management & Budget director Peter Orszag .
" This is precisely the type of smart , streamlined improvement that this administration is committed to making across government to boost efficiency and modernize how we do business . "
While savings of a few hundred million dollars a year might sound impressive , though , remember that just last month the government ran up $ 135 billion in red ink .
The administration will make the direct deposit announcement on Monday when Treasury publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to begin a 60 - day period of public comment .
Once the final rule is published , the administration will roll out the changes with a public education campaign .
The new rule will primarily take effect in March 2011 , with a few exceptions that will not take effect until March 2013 .
To some extent , the shift to direct deposits began years ago .
85 percent of federal benefit recipients already receive their payments electronically .
One million Americans are now using the Direct Express payment system , launched in the summer of 2008 .
Men evolved willing to risk death for sex , partly explaining why men die faster than women in virtually every country worldwide .
But monogamy and economic equality could counteract this trend — by assuring men they are likely to get some loving , a new study suggests .
The study was published in the current issue of the journal Evolutionary Psychology .
Willing to risk it all for sex ( and kids )
" The name of the game in evolution is to get your genes in the next generation , " said study researcher Daniel Kruger of the University of Michigan .
Reproductively speaking , men have more to gain , and less to lose , from risk - taking behavior than women , researchers have long said .
Essentially , it 's okay if the guy dies , because at least once he 's done the initial deed , there a chance his offspring will survive .
While having an involved father increases the odds of a child 's social and reproductive success , not having a mother , even if she disappears after weaning , is often fatal , especially in developing countries , several studies have shown .
Therefore , women , unlike men , may have evolved to avoid physical risks , theorizes researcher Anne Campbell of Durham University in England who was not involved with the study .
Men , meanwhile , are busy trying to impress women , especially pretty women , by taking the risks women avoid .
Men know , at least subconsciously , that women , because of their greater physical investment in childbearing and rearing , are most receptive to men who seem like good providers — outwardly denoted by " status and stuff , " Kruger said .
And throughout evolution , men have used violence , shows of physical prowess and other forms of risk - taking to not only acquire status and stuff , but to advertise it .
These tactics ( in addition to flashing platinum credit cards and jousting with verbal taunts ) continue to be instinctually used by today 's men to one - up one another and attract women .
Assessing the competition
These risky flaunts , and so male life span , could be affected by economic circumstances , Kruger figured .
Comparing 70 countries , he looked at cultural factors that likely exacerbate sexual competition among men .
He found that economic inequality and acceptance of male promiscuity disproportionately affected the life spans of men , while women were comparatively immune .
In countries like Norway , that are relatively egalitarian , male mortality rates are more equal to those of women , with a difference of 4.5 years on average .
But in countries like Columbia and , to a lesser extent , the United States , where there are more significant differences between the rich and the poor , men out - die women faster , in part because they are competing — either violently or stressfully — for status , stuff and , ultimately , sex , Kruger said .
The lives of men in Columbia and the United States are on average shorter than their female counterparts by 7.8 and 5.2 years , respectively .
Even fictional economic inequality may have an effect on male life span .
" Status - conscious networks — like MTV or whatnot — show a lot of affluence , " Kruger said .
" People look at that and think , ' Oh wait , that is what I should have , too . '
Their expectations go up . "
And then the striving and competition intensifies .
Acceptance of polygyny — one man mating with many women — also correlates with male mortality rates .
Polygyny means one dude can impregnate many gals , leaving men lower on the totem poll with fewer opportunities to have their own children .
This makes the benefits of rising to the top of the hierarchy that much greater — and makes the risk of injury , and even death , seem relatively inconsequential .
Other studies have suggested that men who are not looking for sexual conquests , presumably either because they are happily mated or otherwise distracted , are less likely to engage in risk - taking behavior .
In all , the research suggests that monogamous , egalitarian societies would do a lot for a man 's life span , Kruger said .
" And just about all men could benefit from taking a step back from working ourselves to the bone , trying to keep up with the Joneses , " Kruger said .
It may be an instinctual drive , but it does n't necessarily benefit one 's quality of life .
And it may even shorten it .
Do you remember how your breakfast plate was arranged this morning ?
Even if you do n’t , your hippo­campus might — and growing evidence suggests that there is a way to retrieve this unconscious memory : through your eye movements .
The latest study comes from the University of California , Davis , where neuroscientist Deborah Hannula and her team showed participants photographs of faces superimposed on scenes .
Later the volunteers saw the individual scenes again and had to pick the matching faces .
By tracking their eye movements , Hannula and her co-workers saw that even when volunteers picked the wrong face , their eyes were drawn for a longer time to the correct one .
Previous studies yielded similar results , but the findings have been controver­sial because of difficulties replicat­ing them , Hannula says .
Her study also showed that the participants ’ hippocampus was ac­tive during the process , indicating that , contrary to conventional thinking , the brain region is involved not only in conscious memory processing but in other memory tasks as well .
The findings suggest that eye movements can be a sensitive measure for both unconscious and conscious memories , Hannula says .
This fact could open up new avenues for working with cognitively impaired patients , who may not be able to verbally or otherwise report what they remember .
The results also have im­plications for crime scene in­vestigations , Hannula says .
For example , eyewitnesses may unconsciously remember the face of a perpetrator .
Even the eye movements of the person who committed the crime could betray important information .
“ Imagine the perpetrator used a knife that was in the butcher block on the counter next to the refrigerator , ” she says .
Viewing pictures of that scene would likely draw their eye movements to that butcher block .

The loud trumpets called vuvuzelas will continue to be allowed for the time being at the World Cup , despite complaints from some international broadcasters , players and fans , the tournament ’s organizing committee said Monday .
On Sunday , Danny Jordaan , the chief World Cup organizer , told the British Broadcasting Corporation that use of the trumpets was “ something we are evaluating on an ongoing basis . ”
He said he would consider banning the horns “ if there are grounds to do so . ”
Some broadcasters have been complaining since last June ’s Confederations Cup here that the vuvuzelas are too disruptive to the international television feeds , subduing announcers ’ voices and irritating viewers .
Patrice Evra , France ’s captain , complained to Agence France - Presse that the horns played a role in his team ’s lackluster 0 - 0 draw with Uruguay on Friday , saying , “ We ca n’t hear one another on the pitch because of them . ”

Given the awe - inspiring failure of MacGruber , it 's unlikely we 'll see another SNL - based movie any time soon .
Which is a shame , because Tracy Morgan 's scifi-serial - blaxploitation mashup is a idea just waiting to make someone money .

Just listening to that retro- bossa nova theme song conjures images of a Mad Men-esque '60s romp through the stars , following a wanton - hedonist spaceman as he goes from planet to planet trying to sleep with things .
An Astronaut Jones movie should look cheesy , so you would n't need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to shoot it — and risk it ballooning out of proportion , like Land of the Lost .
And Tracy Morgan could not be more beloved right now , thanks to his continuing lunacy on 30 Rock .
If you manage your expectations , Hollywood , this could be an easy stand - up double .
Lasers , gratuitous nudity , and foam boulders on backlot planets ?
Where in the hell do I sign up ?
Did Keanu Reeves
Really buy all of the special FX guys on The Matrix motorcycles and drive some rando 60 miles in his Porsche after her car broke down ?

The National Post 's Don Martin reports that the copyright bill could be introduced next week with confirmation of the broad outlines of the bill I reported on earlier this month .
Martin , who , describes the forthcoming bill as heavy - handed , reports :
All signals suggest Heritage Minister James Moore has triumphed over the objections of Industry Minister Tony Clement , setting up Canada to march in excessively protected lockstep with a United States that boasts the toughest laws against pirated music or movies on the planet .
It may well be a legal constraint that 's impossible to enforce , but the rumble out of the PMO suggests the new law will ignore the extensive public consultations that advocated a go - easy take on copying of CDs and DVDs in favour of robust anti-consumer limits on transferring or sharing content .
If this comes to pass , the federal government will be headed for a very bad week when the House of Commons reconvenes on Tuesday .
While that is not how I would describe the outcome of the consultation – fair copyright is not the same as " go- easy " – Martin 's report is wholly consistent with my earlier reporting that the PMO has sided with the out - of - touch Moore , who has emerged as a staunch advocate for a Canadian DMCA .
While the bill will undoubtedly include some elements designed to garner support from consumer and education groups , the U.S. - style approach to digital locks will effectively undermine the current fair dealing provision and any additional user - oriented reforms that find their way into the bill .

I prepared so hard but I was surprised by Flash ’s aggressive attack .
From set 3 , a lot of people gave me helpful words and I was able to concentrate better .
Q : A re-game was called on game 1 .
Did it affect you at all ?
A : It could sound like an excuse , but the waiting time after the original game 1 was really long .
My mind became weaker during that time , so I could n’t play as well as I wanted .
It surprised me that there was a re-game in such a big stage .
Q : You played offensively starting game 3
A : I played aggressively starting game 3 .
I prepared strategies depending on the spawn locations .
I spawned on locations where I could play aggressively and I played too cautiously until game 2 .
I decided to play fully starting game 3 .

If I put my guard down too early , I could have lost so I tried my best until the end .

Rather than thinking I should win the game , I played without any pressure .

- 우승을 차지한 소감이 어떤가 ?
▲ 박세저어 선수와 이영호 선수가 경기할 때 내심 이영호 선수가 올라오길 바랐다 .
내가 결승에 가게되면 최강의 프로게이머인 이영호와 붙는다면 09 년 김정우의 실력을 보여주고 싶었다 .
이영호 선수가 굉장히 잘하셨는데 내가 운이 조금 더 좋았다 .
정말 기쁘다 .
- 첫 결승이었는데 긴장되지는 않았나 ?
▲ 국내에서 이렇게 많은 분들 앞에서 경기한 것은 처음이다 .
하지만 난 체질인 것 같다. 사람이 많으면 경기가 더 잘된다 .
관중이 적으면 오히려 게임이 잘 안되는 것 같다. 사실 0:2 상황까지는 스스로 화가 많이 났다 .
준비를 정말 많이했는데 이영호 선수의 거센 공격에 당황하고 말았다 .
3 세트부터 주위에서 좋은 조언도 해주시고 , 집중한 것이 좋았다고 생각한다 .
- 1세트에서 재경기 판정이 내려졌는데 , 지장은 없었나 ?
▲ 변명으로 들릴지는 모르겠지만 1세트 재경기 이후 대기 시간이 길었다 .
그 때 마음이 약해지기도 했다.
제대로 플레이를 하지 못했다 .
큰 무대에서 재경기 판정이 나서 당황스럽기는 했다 .
- 3세트부터 공격적인 플레이를 펼치던데 .
▲ 3세트부터 공격적인 플레이를 했다 .
준비를 많이 한 만큼 위치에 따라 전략을 생각해 놓았다 .
공격적인 플레이를 할 수 있는 자리가 걸리기도 했고 , 2 세트까지 너무 소극적이었다고 생각했다 .
그래서 적극적으로 경기를 하려고 마음 먹었다 .
- 0:2 상황에서 어떤 조언을 들었나 ?
▲ 0:2로 지고 있었지만 경기는 끝난 것이 아니지 않나 .
나는 재재재재경기도 했다. 결승전 경험이 있는 ( 변 ) 형태 형이 평소와 다르게 너무 잘해줬다 .
부담갖지 말라고 조언을 해줬다 .
그 덕분에 마음을 잡을 수 있었다 .
감독님도 비슷한 말씀을 해주셨다 .
- 재재재재경기의 경험이 오늘 도움이 된 것 같은데 .
▲ 재재재재경기 이후로 확실히 내가 바뀐 것 같기는 하다 .
0:2 로 밀리고 있었지만 미동도 하지 않았다 .
좋은 조언까지 들어서 역전을 할 수 있었다 .
- 4세트에서 이영호의 센터 배럭을 발견했다 .
▲ 사실 다전제를 많이 해보지 않아서 어떤 식으로 해야할 것인지 감을 잘 잡지 못한 상태였다 .
하지만 오늘 하면서 많은 것을 깨달았다 .
3 세트에서 손쉽게 승리를 따냈는데 , 4 세 트에서는 이영호 선수가 약이 올라서 그런 전략을 할 것 같았다 .
원래 준비한 것은 이게 아니었다 .
내 감을 믿고 중앙에 오버로드를 보냈다 .
중앙에서 배럭을 보고 '걸려 들었구나 '라는 생각을 했다 .
이겼다고 생각하면 역전을 당하는 경우가 많았기 때문에 마음을 놓지는 않았다 .
- 마지막 세트는 어땠는지 궁금하다 .
▲ 1세트 때 한번 재경기가 나오면서 굉장히 고민이 많았다 .
5 세트는 우승을 하겠다는 생각보다 부담없이 게임을 하자는 생각을 했다 .
- 5 세트에서는 이영호의 생더블을 염두에 두고 있었는가 ?
▲ 염두에 뒀다기 보다는 1세트 때 이영호 선수가 입구를 막았다 .
그래서 굉장히 고민을 많이 하고 준비한 빌드다 .
생더블이나 배럭 더블 등 빠른 멀티를 노린 빌드였다 .
- 입장할 때 크레인틀 타고 내려왔는데 무섭지 않았나 ?
그리고 이영호의 등장신이 조금 더 멋있었는데 질투나지는 않았는지 궁금하다 .
▲ 원래 놀이기구를 잘 타는 편이다 .
별다른 느낌은 없었는데 흔들리는 바람에 약간 어지럽더라 .
이영호 선수가 나보다 멋있게 등장하기는 했는데 지난 시즌 우승자이고 , 최강의 선수니까 그 정도는 어쩔 수 없다고 생각한다 .
- 많은 팀원들이 도와줬을 것 같다 .
▲ 항상 말해왔는데 우리 팀 테란 선수들이 가장 잘하는 것 같다.
우리 팀 테란 선수들이 정말 열심히 도와줘서 고맙다 .
도와준 만큼 내가 크게 한 턱 쏴야할 것 같다 .
- 상금은 어떻게 사용할 생각인가 ?
▲ 성인이기는 하지만 아직 부모님께서 내 수입을 관리해주고 계신다 .
일단 부모님께 드릴 생각이다 .
- 요즘 e스포츠 뿐만 아니라 CJ에도 안 좋은 일이 있는데 .
▲ 안 좋은 일이 많은 요즘이다 .
지금부터 열심히 해서 팬들의 상처를 치유해줘야 한다고 생각한다 .
앞으로 우리 팀도 내 우승으로 인해서 분위기를 타서 확 달라질 것 같다. 프로리그에서도 힘차게 올라갈 수 있을 것이다 .
- 더 하고 싶은 말이 있다면 ?
▲ 오늘 정말 많은 팬들이 와주셨다 .
가족과 친척도 서른 분 정도 오셨다 .
굉장히 많이 오셨는데 모두 감사드린다 .
앞으로도 더욱 많이 응원해주셨으면 좋겠다 .

One thing I would like to ask from all of you is to stay away from extreme fanboyism / fangirlism since the LR is exploding with them already .
Both of them played well in such a pressuring environment .

Fund manager John Hussman ( via PragCap ) , who 's been bearish for awhile , says it 's now clear that a double - dip is coming .
Based on evidence that has always and only been observed during or immediately prior to U.S. recessions , the U.S. economy appears headed into a second leg of an unusually challenging downturn .
A few weeks ago , I noted that our recession warning composite was on the brink of a signal that has always and only occurred during or immediately prior to U.S. recessions , the last signal being the warning I reported in the November 12 , 2007 weekly comment Expecting A Recession .
While the set of criteria I noted then would still require a decline in the ISM Purchasing Managers Index to 54 or less to complete a recession warning , what prompts my immediate concern is that the growth rate of the ECRI Weekly Leading Index has now declined to - 6.9 % .
The WLI growth rate has historically demonstrated a strong correlation with the ISM Purchasing Managers Index , with the correlation being highest at a lead time of 13 weeks .
Taking the growth rate of the WLI as a single indicator , the only instance when a level of - 6.9 % was not associated with an actual recession was a single observation in 1988 .
But as I 've long noted , recession evidence is best taken as a syndrome of multiple conditions , including the behavior of the yield curve , credit spreads , stock prices , and employment growth .
Given that the WLI growth rate leads the PMI by about 13 weeks , I substituted the WLI growth rate for the PMI criterion in condition 4 of our recession warning composite .
As you can see , the results are nearly identical , and not surprisingly , are slightly more timely than using the PMI .
The blue line indicates recession warning signals from the composite of indicators , while the red blocks indicate official U.S. recessions as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research .

In a response letter sent to Alan Grayson , the Fed chairman has the following brief retort to the question of whether " the Federal Reserve - alone or in concert with the Treasury Department or any part of the government - ever taken any action with the purpose or effect of supporting the stock market or an individual stock " : " The Federal Reserve has not intervened to support the stock market or an individual stock . "
Shocking .
And we are confident that the fine people at Liberty 33 just sit all day , twiddling their thumbs now that the Fed is no longer in the MBS and UST monetization business .
Furthermore , anyone who reads anything into the fact that the FRBNY is continuously ramping up its hiring of traders , both credit and equity , as posted in assorted public venues , is simply paranoid and does not understand that this is only due to Brian Sack 's fascination in being surrounded by 400 traders daily .
On the other hand , at this point pretty much everyone is aware of the sad state of FRBNY intervention , whether it is in the FX market or the gold market , and indirectly via the discount window and the repo system , in which banks purchase bonds at auction , using discount window or other zero cost capital , only to repo it back , and to use the proceeds to bid up stocks .
Maybe Mr. Grayson can ask the Chairman whether the Fed is actively endorsing primary dealers to bid up risky assets to create the impression that since the market is ramping higher ( on no volume , mind you , but who cares ) that the economy is doing so as well ( we will shortly have something to say that refutes this thesis , compliments of none other than Goldman Sachs ) .
All cynicism aside , Grayson at least still continues to ask the right questions : among these are 1 ) How does the fed plan on dealing with the $ 1.7 trillion in MBS on the Fed 's balance sheet , 2 ) Why Greenspan and Bernanke were so wrong in keeping the FF rate for so long , and how does the Chairman plan to reconcile the same bubble creation that blew up the economy last time ZIRP was around , with the deflationary threat to the economy , 3 ) Why does the Fed think a Tobin tax is bad ( and , incidentally , why does the Fed even have an opinion on tax policy ) , 4 ) Why is the Fed failing at pushing unemployment lower even with ZIRP and QE , 5 ) How the Fed is lobbying on behalf of its , and Wall Street 's interest , 6 ) How much gold should the US government own , and many others .
Yet the most interest question in our opinion is whether or not the Fed , via its prior and ongoing liquidity swap operations , is actively pumping dollars into foreign CB at the unwind of a swap that has differing entry and exit cross fixings .
This is actually a great question which will demand much more thorough analysis , as during the last liquidity crisis , the Fed pumped over $ 500 billion in capital in foreign banks at a time when the DXY was at then - all time highs , only to unwind these swaps as the dollar subsequently crashed , resulting in a massive net flow of dollars from the Fed to foreign banks .
As such liquidity swaps are far more than mere liquidity backstops - they are yet another shadow mechanism to pump money into foreign CBs .
Furthermore , the money outflowing in this manner , far outweighs any interest earnings on swaps , which Bernanke determines amounted to about $ 2.1 billion in 2009 .
Another wonderful question to which Bernanke , unless he had completely lost his mind , gives a negative anwer , is whether any foreign banks that were the recipients of FX swaps , used the proceeds to buy US Treasuries .
Obviously , Bernanke 's answer is no , as this would be yet another shadow monetization process .
We do , however , wonder just how Bernanke knows precisely what foreign CBs did with all the excess cash : surely , this money thus created out of the Chairman 's printer thin air , is completely fungible , and to say that foreign CBs did not use that money to purchase USTs , would mean that foreign central Banks did not buy USTs at all during the period in question .
Bernanke surely sees this problem as in another question he himself notes : " Because money is fungible , in general it is not possible to determine whether a counterparty used funds obtained from loans or through other transactions for a specified purpose .
It is not possible to specifically connect the extension of particular loans by the Federa Reserve with the acquisition of US government debt . "
And herein lies the rub - by outright denying that FX swaps were used to monetize debt , Bernanke may have cornered himself , as the next logical question is just what did foreign CBs buy with any FX lines that were not used up in further downstream liquidity facilitating operations .
Does Bernanke in essence say that foreign Central Banks never purchase US Treasuries ?
That would be an amusing claim , and is certainly refuted by the definition of Indirect Bidders , conveniently provided by the Fed itself .
We surely do hope Mr. Grayson will take his line of questioning to the next logical step , which is catching the Chairman in outright lies .
At this point , with so many loose ends over at Liberty 33 and the Marriner Eccles building , it is just a matter of time .
Full response by Bernanke to Grayson .

For some time I 'd been hearing rumours of a pizzeria where the cooking was akin to alchemy , where the chef harnessed all the forces of nature , where the pizzas were magical .
Italian friends were unable , or unwilling , to tell me how to find this place .
I 'd collected a few clues , and I knew the region was Campania , but I 'd yet to work out its exact location .
Then , quite by chance , as I planned a house hunting trip to the area , an estate agent recommended a little hotel " where they make the most delicious pizza " .
Had I stumbled across the location ?
A few phone calls all but confirmed my hunch .
I immediately booked flights to Naples , rented a car , reserved a room and bought a map .
I suppose I was expecting somewhere grand – an old palazzo perhaps , a temple to Italian cuisine – but Pizzeria Anna , in the small town of Agropoli , is a place without pretension .
The dining room is brightly lit , none of the chairs or tables match and there are three TVs showing football and game shows .
I ordered the pizza a sorpresa , the surprise , which turned out to be divided into eight sections , each representing a different selection from the menu .
It arrived like a painting , like a masterpiece you see , smell and eat .
The base was light and crisp – not too crisp , but nowhere near soft or spongy .
One section was a sample of the remarkable and rare duchessa – a ham and mashed potato pizza , which tasted much better than it sounds , and was not at all stodgy or bland .
Another section held perfectly cooked squid and huge , succulent prawns .
Yet another was a triangle of salad , with rocket leaves , slivers of carrot and what I think were pumpkin flowers .
Elsewhere there was creamy mozzarella , fragrant basil and a rich , sweet , almost fruity tomato sauce .
I travel to Italy regularly and I eat plenty of pizza so believe me when I tell you that this was extraordinary .
Pizzeria Anna is run by Anna Scola .
Her husband Domenico is the chef or pizzaiolo ; her daughters Caterina and Maria Carmela are the waitresses .
Domenico's nickname is Baffo , meaning moustache , on account of his facial hair .
The girls are known as the Baffo staff .
Despite the laid - back dining experience , the cooking is handled with the utmost seriousness .
There are certificates on the walls confirming that the tomatoes used in the sauce are indeed sweet San Marzano plum tomatoes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius , there are framed letters assuring customers that the mozzarella is most definitely from buffalo reared in the marsh meadows north of Naples .
There are citations from numerous organisations : L'Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana and La Nazionale Italiana Pizzaioli .
Baffo's business card reads " specialist in the research and development of the noble art of the pizza " .
Pizzeria Anna even has its own vineyard , producing the perfect wines to accompany the food .
I cannot recommend it more highly .
Pizzeria Anna is right on Agropoli's seafront in the Cilento national park .
The Cilento is a wild and rugged landscape , where wolves and wild boar roam among abandoned medieval villages and ancient Greek temples .
The beaches are pristine white and the coastal waters are a vivid turquoise .
But you wo n't find many tourists there because the area is not well served by international airports .
So you can use Italy 's great rail network , or do what I did – fly to Naples , pick up a hire car and head south along the coast .
You can call in at Vesuvius , Pompeii , Sorrento , Positano , Amalfi and Paestum on the way to Agropoli – a great way to build up an appetite .

Toronto police violently suppress G20 protests , arrest over 600
By Paul Franklin
28 June 2010
Riot police mobilized in downtown Toronto .
Police would use tear gas , plastic bullets , and pepper spray
More than seven thousand riot police , plain clothes officers and mounted patrols have been deployed in downtown Toronto in a naked violation of the democratic rights of not only the thousands of youth , trade unionists and social and environmental activists protesting the G20 summit , but of the entire Canadian population .
Over the past 48 hours , as leaders of the G20 governments moved to coordinate a massive global austerity program directed at the international working class , police — for the first time in Toronto ’s history — deployed snatch squads , tear gas and rubber and plastic bullets to disperse groups of peaceful protestors attempting to march to the fenced in perimeter of the G20 venue .
By Sunday evening , over 600 people had been arrested , many in the so - called “ free speech zone , ” and detained in a make - shift holding pen on the grounds of a local film studio .
Reports emerged of beatings and other violent actions against peaceful demonstrators .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s government has spent $ 1.2 billion to date for the security of the summit .
The decision to hold the event in the heart of Canada ’s largest city , not to mention the outrageous expenses incurred , has been roundly criticized by broad layers of the Canadian population faced with ever deeper cuts to their wages , pensions and social services .
In the week before the arrival of the G20 leaders , downtown Toronto exhibited all the hallmarks of a city under a state of siege .
Six kilometres of fencing , topped with concertina wire and anchored in concrete encircled the “ red zone ” — the actual meeting area .
Police checkpoints fanned out another kilometre from the convention location .
Snipers were stationed on the city ’s high rise rooftops .
American Navy Seals patrolled the harbour .
Citizens in the vicinity were instructed to carry picture identification and expect curb - side interrogation .
Canine units waited in the side - streets .
Phalanxes of federal , provincial and municipal police stood at every corner buttressed by more mobile bicycle and horse patrols .
Even truck drivers have been approached to act as “ look - outs ” for the police .
In addition , a thousand private security guards were deployed throughout the city ’s adjacent financial and entertainment districts .
Seventy - seven new closed circuit surveillance cameras monitored all movement on the streets .
Water and sound cannon were moved into place .
Police helicopters hovered constantly overhead .
Security Service operatives swept through the hotels , and Canadian Armed Forces soldiers stood “ on the ready ” at “ undisclosed locations ” .
A section of Saturday 's 10,000 - strong protest against the Toronto G20 summit
Despite the fact that several peaceful protests had proceeded through downtown streets over the past week , police raiding parties on Friday night made several “ preventative arrests ” , entering a house without showing a warrant to drag away demonstrators asleep on the floor .
On Saturday afternoon , about ten thousand demonstrators marched from Queens Park — the grounds of the provincial legislature and the police designated “ free speech zone ” — in a “ People First ” protest organized by the Canadian Labour Congress and the Ontario Federation of Labour .
In heavy rain , the march proceeded to within four blocks of a massive fenced perimeter that has sealed off Toronto ’s Convention Center area for the past week .
The march , however , was stopped on Queen Street by hundreds of heavily armed police .
Whilst thousands of marchers , after being confined and “ kettled ” by the police on the narrow street , returned to the “ free speech zone , ” about two thousand stayed in place and insisted on their right to march .
During the stand - off , about 75 people — purported members of anarchist groups — broke away from the demonstrators and proceeded to spray paint graffiti and smash several dozen shop windows and bank branch ATM’s .
A police car was vandalized and set alight .
A reporter noted that the gas cap for the car had been removed prior to the “ Black Bloc ’s ” arrival .
Shortly thereafter , at the corner of Bay and King — the centre of Canada ’s financial district another police car was set ablaze .
It was at this time that local television stations , followed by CTV and the CBC — the country ’s national news network — broke away from regular programming to breathlessly broadcast for hours on end “ live ” saturation coverage of events in the streets of the city .
Video of the burning patrol car was then looped and re-looped into the country ’s living rooms throughout the afternoon and into the night .
As always , police provocation may well have played a role in isolated acts of vandalism .
The patrol car , torched by three or four individuals , was done in full view of a whole phalanx of riot policemen who stood idly by at the intersection .
“ Backup !
Put your batons down ” , shouted the attending police captain to the riot squad .
No attempt was made to arrest the perpetrators .
Fire extinguishers possessed by the police were not deployed .
The Toronto Fire Department , which can respond to any downtown emergency within minutes , did not arrive for over an hour as camera teams gathered from all the networks .
As the small group of anarchists proceeded onto Yonge Street , Toronto ’s main shopping district , to smash more windows , reporters noted that despite the mobilization of thousands of police officers , not one could be seen on the city ’s busiest thoroughfare .
Shortly thereafter , the office of Prime Minister Stephen Harper — the man who has shut down parliament twice in the space of two years to circumvent opposition to his government — issued a statement .
“ Free speech is a principle of our democracy , but thugs that prompted violence earlier today represent in no way , shape or form the Canadian way of life ” .
The incident spurred Police Chief Bill Blair to appear before the news media in the early evening to denounce violent demonstrators and to assure the population that the Integrated Security Force would bring the full force of the law down on the protest .
Throughout the rest of the night and into Sunday , police rampaged through the ranks of the various peaceful demonstrations marching in the downtown core .
In the “ free speech zone ” protestors staging a sit - in were arrested en masse .
Young people were clubbed and kicked .
A CTV producer , Farzad Fatholahzad , covering the protest was arrested .
En route to the detention centre on the prisoner ’s bus , he reported that detainees were bruised and bleeding .
One man , suffering from concussion , was slipping in and out of consciousness .
All were denied medical attention .
At the University of Toronto , seventy youth sleeping on a college lawn were assaulted and arrested .
At a Novotel hotel , that had been struck earlier in the week by members of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees union , a small group of protestors gathered in solidarity after midnight .
Riot police violently broke up the peaceful demonstration .
Steve Paiken , a lead journalist for public television broadcaster TV Ontario , tweeted the following on - the - spot report : “ ( The Police ) repeated they would arrest me if I did n’t leave .
As I was escorted away … I saw two officers hold a journalist .
The journalist identified himself as working for the Guardian .
He talked too much and pissed the police off .
Two officers held him .
A third punched him in the stomach .
Totally unnecessary .
The man collapsed and the third officer drove his elbow into the man ’s back .
The demonstration on the Esplanade was peaceful .
It was like an old sit -in .
No one was aggressive and yet the riot squad moved in . ”
On Sunday morning , police used tear gas and more plastic bullet to disperse friends of detainees who had gathered at the detention centre to greet released comrades .
More violent arrests were made , including of legal advisers .
Scores of detainees were released without any charge having been laid .
They reported abysmal conditions in the cells .
Most were denied water , toiletries and food for up to fourteen hours .
A police officer referred to the previous night ’s dragnet as a “ catch and release ” program .
Police and the government seized on the acts of vandalism to justify this brutal crackdown .
The police released a statement Saturday night declaring , “ We have never tried to curtail people ’s rights to lawfully protest .
All you have to do is turn on the TV and see what ’s happening now .
Police cars are getting torched , buildings are being vandalized , people are getting beat up ( sic ) and the so - called ‘ intimidating ’ police presence is essential to restoring order .
That is the reality on the ground ” .
Arrests and demonstrations in Toronto continue .
The World Socialist Web Site carries no brief for those groups of anarchists who , by engaging in vandalism , arm the agents of the state with the propaganda to intensify their attacks on the democratic rights .
Their actions play directly into the hands of the very forces they claim to oppose .
As observers of other international summits are well aware , the police do not hesitate to infiltrate agents - provaceteurs into their ranks in order to create the sort of mayhem that allows for the unleashing of police terror against the general population .
It would not be the first time such tactics were used to create the conditions for further curtailment of democratic rights .
In 2007 , at a North American leaders ’ conference in Montebello , Quebec , police dressed as demonstrators were filmed carrying rocks and agitating amongst the crowd to join them in violent acts .
And in 2001 at the Genoa , Italy , G8 conference , police agents were discovered to have instigated violence during protests .
The media plays its role through all - night saturation coverage , preempting virtually all network programming , highlighting the vandalous actions of some seventy - five people .
In comparison , when a hundred thousand people demonstrated in Toronto against the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the largest social movement of Canadians in the country ’s history , it rated a minute long sound - bite on the nation ’s networks .

Any guess which company supplies Bank of America 's hackable ATM systems ?...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/12/2010 , 5:45 pm PT
As we have long tried to get across to anyone who would listen , the greatest threat to " secure " computerized systems --- such as the electronic voting systems , incredibly , still in use in all 50 states for this year 's crucial election cycle --- comes from insiders .
Late last week , another report , this one via ComputerWorld , underscored the point yet again :
BofA insider to plead guilty to hacking ATMs IDG News Service - A Bank of America computer specialist is set to plead guilty to charges that he hacked the bank 's automated tellers to dispense cash without recording the activity .
Rodney Reed Caverly , of Charlotte , North Carolina , is scheduled to plead guilty to a computer fraud charge next Tuesday in federal court in Charlotte , according to his lawyer Christopher Fialko , who declined to comment further on the case .
Caverly was charged last week with one count of computer fraud for allegedly writing a malicious program that ran on Bank of America 's computers and ATMs , according to court filings .
...
He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison .
Caverly had worked in Bank of America 's IT department where he designed and maintained computer systems , including those used by the ATMs .
The alleged scam ran between March 2009 and October 2009 .
The gullible are welcome to buy into the Rightwing propaganda that ACORN is somehow stealing elections , despite the complete dearth of any actual evidence that any vote has ever been illegally cast in any election vis a vis an improper registration by an ACORN worker .
But the facts , demonstrated yet again by the BofA story , are much as non-ideological computer scientists and security experts have been trying to warn for years in regard to electronic voting systems : the greatest threat to such systems comes from insiders , such as election officials who can manipulate results simply and directly and in such a way that they are unlikely to ever get caught doing it .
Even the sham 2005 Rightwing - created Baker / Carter National Election Reform Commission --- created almost entirely to put an " official " - appearing imprimatur on the call for disenfranchising Photo ID restrictions at polling places --- was forced to admit as much in their final report ...
" There is no reason to trust insiders in the election industry any more than in other industries , " they correctly noted in their findings .
Yet we " trust " such insiders in virtually every election run in America --- run largely by private , unaccountable corporations , rather than us , we the people .
For the record , while the IDG News Service article does n't specify which company 's machines were hacked by the Bank of America insider , they use among their ATM suppliers some company known as Diebold --- the same irresponsible company whose fully - hackable , oft - failed e-voting systems are still used for some 40 % of U.S. elections .
If the hacked BofA systems were made by Diebold it would not be the first hack of either its ATMs nor its voting machines ( which have now been hacked many times over ) .
Last year , Diebold was forced to notify customers that malware had been discovered on its ATM systems in Russia .
The malware , as reported at the time , exploited " undocumented features to create a virtual ' skimmer ' which is capable of recording card details and personal identification numbers without the user 's knowledge . "
It was speculated that the malware code was likely " pre-installed by an insider at the factory . "
In response , the company wrote to customers at the time , presumably with a straight face [ emphasis added ] :
" This latest offense against Diebold ATMs is another example of the growing level of sophistication and aggression involving ATM - related crime .
Security is one of Diebold 's absolute priorities and our engineers are working constantly to address emerging ATM security threats . "
As long time readers of The BRAD BLOG know , security has never been a priority for Diebold --- at least not in its voting machine division , as scores of previous articles here have demonstrated time and again over the years .
As early as 2005 , when most in the corporate media regarded such concerns as " conspiracy theories , " we quoted a years - long Diebold insider who told us repeatedly and in no uncertain terms that the company was simply " not concerned about security . "
" They do n't have security solutions .
They do n't want them , " the insider told us at the time .
" They do n't really care . "
Most of the security flaws the source told us about , exclusively , back in September of 2005 , many of which were later confirmed over and again by various independent academic studies and hacking tests , remain in the hardware and software still in use across the nation even today .
Here are just a few , but by no means all , of the articles from among our library of noteworthy Diebold e-voting system security failures throughout the years ...
Other than that , watch out for that dastardly ( if mythical ) ACORN " voter fraud " and remember : " Security is one of Diebold 's absolute priorities . "
Also , Diebold has a swell bridge in Brooklyn that they can sell you for an unbeatable price !

Man , I was working on a different comic for a couple days , writing and rewriting .
Sometimes it seems like such a small thing to get done but it does n't work out !
But I think that comic will have its day .
I 'll come back to it and the pieces will fit together .
Since that day is not today , I got cracking on these instead .
A return to some themes and characters that I liked as well !
A little bit of news , I did a poster for Janus Films , who are putting out a Charlie Chaplin film retrospective .
Information for the event Hello everyone !

Here in Europe , homophobia is alive and kicking – and kicking very hard .
It 's happening right on the doorstep of the EU .
On the other side of the EU 's border , anti-gay repression is as strong as ever , and even worse than the ugly scenes we have seen in recent years in countries like Lithuania and Poland .
Last month , I helped organise the Slavic gay pride march in Minsk , capital of Belarus .
The event was met with the most extraordinary police violence that I have ever seen .
Even the Moscow anti-riot police are saints compared to their brutal Belarusian colleagues .
Most of the 25 participants who were not able to run fast enough were arrested .
They were beaten , humiliated and threatened while in custody .
After being jailed for 48 hours , they were fined .
For what ?
For exercising their right to freedom of expression .
In Moscow , where our pride march has been banned by the mayor for five consecutive years , it is only thanks to a cat - and - mouse game with the police that we managed to march without being arrested .
Last Saturday , in St Petersburg , dozens of brave activists decided to defy the ban imposed on gay pride by the city governor .
Again , five of us were arrested .
Looking back on these violent homophobic events , all those who experienced this repression are proud that they took a stand for freedom .
Some will think that the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) pride protesters in Minsk , Moscow or St Petersburg were simply ignorant of the risk they were taking , and some will call them heroes .
The truth is that they were just young , idealistic , motivated individuals who followed their instinct for social justice .
They believed they were right and , most of all , they understood that to make the future requires action today .
All across eastern Europe , more and more LGBT people are standing up for their rights and joining the movement for queer freedom .
This is not surprising .
Within the LGBT communities of the former Soviet empire , this yearning for equality and human rights is strong and undiminished .
As everywhere else , there are leaders , followers and those who are watching the unfolding queer revolution from the distance , supportive or not .
One would think that activists might be frightened by the police or the beatings , but in fact we are being unwittingly aided by our opponents .
Whether they are religious groups , skinheads , nationalists , neo - Nazis or simply homophobic individuals , our enemies draw public attention to our protests and convince us that what we are doing is right and necessary .
This year in eastern Europe , in Vilnius , Minsk , Bratislava and St Petersburg , old and new groups of LGBT people organised gay pride marches for the first time .
They knew their events were likely to be banned .
Violent attacks were expected , but they still turned out to march .
They defied their detractors and won publicity for the LGBT rights cause ; raising awareness , provoking debate and , sometimes , winning hearts and minds .
EU enlargement has embraced most of the former eastern bloc and in those countries where there is opposition to human rights and gay rights , the EU is pushing to force changes .
In Vilnius , Warsaw , Bucharest , Bratislava and Budapest , EU support is literally flowing .
In a joint statement last May , 16 EU embassies condemned in the violence for the first - ever gay pride march in Slovakia .
In Vilnius , ambassadors of EU member states joined the first gay pride march , also hosting receptions for the participants : the same as they did in Riga and Bucharest .
That 's on the " western " side of the wall .
But on the eastern side , outside the enlarged borders of the EU , things are different .
Activists in Russia , Belarus and Ukraine have little political support .
This is not to say that the EU cares for human rights only within the limits of its territory .
It showed its concern by holding human rights discussions with its neighbours .
But they never materialise .
And here is the paradox .
In Minsk , Moscow and St Petersburg , when LGBT activists turned to the EU and its member states for political support , only negative answers were received .
What the EU can do for eastern European activists within its borders cannot be replicated outside the union .
With Russia , there is what foreign diplomats call " realpolitik " .
Russia is a strong supplier of oil and gas to the EU .
And Russia is also a key partner in the talks on Iran and North Korea .
If Russia was suffering a financial crisis similar to the one it went through in 1998 , I have no doubt the EU would be supporting LGBT rights firmly .
That is how male homosexuality came to be decriminalised in 1993 by President Yeltsin , when Russia wanted to enter the Council of Europe .
But today we are in a different time .
Oil prices are high and Russia showed recently that no one can stop it from doing as it pleases , even if it means invading its neighbours .
Being on the wrong side of the wall , we are the hostages of geopolitical considerations that are outside our control .
The EU is ready to write cheques to NGOs and the European parliament can award prizes to our human rights activists , but what about more effective measures ?
It could impose a travel ban on Russian officials who refuse to comply with basic human rights – for example , those who call for gay people to be killed .
Activists need political backing much more that they need money .
The people who stand for gay rights and human rights dream to live in a society that will accept them as they are .
TThey do n't dream of receiving grants or to leave their country – but to simply live in a more democratic and freer society .
While previous iPhones ' data usage was largely confined to static webpages , simple apps and maybe the occasional song streamed through Pandora , the just - announced iPhone 4's ( available June 24 ) hunger can best be described in one word : video .
In other words :
If you thought the iPhone was a data - hog before , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet .
No wonder AT&T killed their unlimited data plans .
Now for the byte - sucking bullet points .
The new iPhone has :
- The ability to capture 720p HD video and edit it right on the phone using the new mobile version of Apple 's iMovie video editing software .
Users will then be able to send their massive video files into the ether over the AT&T network .
- A Netflix app that can stream entire movies over either Wi-Fi or AT&T 's network .
- A new operating system ( iOS4 it will be called ) that will allow users to keep audio - streaming apps such as Pandora running in the background while they complete other tasks .
This should dramatically increase the usage of these data - heavy programs .
If the previous iPhones ' comparably puny data demands were enough to bring AT&T 's network to a standstill in some cities , what 's going to happen when customers get their hands on these new features ?
Of course , AT&T anticipated this and , just last week , announced the death of their unlimited iPhone data plans .
But while this move may stem some of the bleeding , millions of iPhone users will be allowed to hold onto their grandfathered - in unlimited data plans , meaning it could be years before these caps have a noticeable impact on the network load .
At least their new " FaceTime " video calling feature ( which takes advantage of the new front - facing camera ) is currently Wi-Fi-only ( a disappointing reality , considering the new Sprint EVO 4G does video - conferencing over 3G ) .
So how will AT&T handle this new data load ?
Other than vague comments by Steve Jobs at the recent D8 conference that it will all get better soon , we honestly have no idea .
Even ambitious expansion of cellular network capacity is unlikely to fully tackle the problem — especially when one considers that this great new device will likely cause millions of new users to hop on AT&T 's network .
AT&T : You have our pity .

Those attorneys are trying to save Jean ’s life by persuading the jury to spare him from the death penalty after Jean , 22 , pleaded guilty to capital murder for killing Susana Puente De Jesus , a 37 - year - old Houston woman who was carjacked and abducted outside her Pearland workplace last year .
Judge to decide
Jurors are now in their fourth week of hearing testimony in the case .
Since Jean has already pleaded guilty to capital murder , jurors must decide between sentencing Jean to life in prison without parole or sending him to Texas death row .
On Tuesday , District Judge Patrick Sebesta and attorneys watched a video of the Cops TV show while jurors were out of the room .
The video shows Houston police responding to a home where a domestic dispute involving a gun had been reported .
When police arrived , the video shows Jean , then just 2 years old , standing outside with his grandmother , who told officers she had been struck in the head and threatened at gunpoint by her husband .
Houston police then arrested Jean ’s grandfather while the TV cameras filmed it .
Sebesta must decide whether the jury can see that video .
Despite that episode in Jean ’s early childhood , his mother , Rita Washington , told jurors Tuesday that she did her best as a single mother to give her son a good upbringing .
She said she cannot reconcile the crimes her son is accused of with the son that she knows .
“ I can not make those dots connect for me , ” Washington told jurors and Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne .
Grandfather ’s death
Washington said Jean never misbehaved as a child until his other grandfather , who had been a father figure to him , died very suddenly when Jean was still young .
“ Nick ’s personality changed , ” Washington said Tuesday .
“ After his grandfather died , he turned inward . ”
Yenne worked to show the jury that Jean had many behavioral problems at the many schools he attended , fighting with other students , mocking teachers and spitting on others .
She also asked Washington if she was aware that a teacher at Houston ’s Robert E. Lee High School had asked that Jean be withdrawn from her classroom .
Washington said she was aware of the fighting but said she did not know about much of the other behavior .
Testimony continues today at 9 a.m. in Sebesta ’s courtroom .

Marijuana , Made in Germany A Booming Business in Illegal Cannabis Plantations
German cannabis plantations are now edging imports from Morocco and Afghanistan out of the market .
The trend began after the Dutch government began driving growers out of the country .
But police in Germany are also cracking down , using helicopters and infrared cameras to ferret out illegal hemp cultivators .
Rumor has it Warren Beatty and Annette Bening ’s biological daughter , born Kathlyn Beatty , has been living life as Stephen and wants a sex - change operation now that he ’s 18 .
Stephen ’s celebrity parents had allegedly pulled him from the Buckley School in Los Angeles to home school him out of the public eye , because who needs another reason for prying eyes to infiltrate the privacy of your celebrity bubble ?
“ Warren Beatty is beside himself over the situation , ” a supposed “ source ” tells The National Enquirer .
“ He and Annette have tried to deal with this over the years when their daughter was younger , but she ’s determined to go ahead with the transgender operation , just like Chastity [ Chaz Bono ] . ”
It makes sense that Stephen ’s parents would want to protect him from the creepy paparazzi as a child , but now that Stephen ’s 18 why has n’t he gone ahead with the full transition ?
Have Beatty and Bening discouraged Stephen to go through it or are they keeping the young man hidden from view so he can experience the transformation on his own terms ?
Raising a trans child presents its own challenges .
But maybe Stephen could team up with Chaz as a sort of trans celebrity big brother for support and advice .
After all , Chaz would be a much better choice than the star of Killer Drag Queens on Dope Alexis Arquette .

The latest round of tensions on the Korean peninsula may be linked to efforts by Kim Jong
Il to ensure that power passes to one of his sons :
Experts on North Korea say that its latest act of belligerence — the sinking of a South Korean ship in March , one of the worst military provocations since the end of the Korean War in 1953 — reflects a new force at play : the efforts of the North ’s leader , Kim Jong - il , to establish his 27 - year - old son as a legitimate heir to carry on the family dynasty .
“ His succession to power is the factor that links all other factors when we try to explain why the North is doing what it does these days , ” said Choi Jin-wook , a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification , the Seoul government ’s top research organization on North Korea .
“ Without it , no explanation is complete or convincing . ”
On the surface , the North ’s ever - intensifying policy of confrontation can appear self - defeating .
But , officials and analysts here say , it is all part of Mr. Kim ’s effort to groom Kim Jong - un , the youngest of his three known sons , as his successor .
According to this line of thinking , the sinking of the South Korean ship was intended to create an atmosphere of crisis that would serve Mr. Kim ’s purposes , both by rallying public support and winning the crucial backing of the military .
“ Kim Jong - il needs to create a warlike atmosphere at home to push through with the succession of power to his son , ” said Cheon Seong - whun , another senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification .
“ To do that , he needs tensions and an external enemy . ”
(…)
The elder Mr. Kim “ wants to speed up his military - first policy and nuclear program and wants to consolidate the succession process before his health condition becomes worse , ” a high - ranking South Korean government official told a group of foreign correspondents in Seoul on Friday .
“ His third son is also rushing because as a member of the new generation , he wants to prove himself to be very strong and able to control the military leadership .
In order to do so , he wants to show to the North Korean leadership that he has achieved some major military outcomes , particularly targeted against South Korea . ”
What happens when energy resources , such as oil , deplete ?
Many people believe that oil prices will just go up -- but I do n't see that to be the case .
A more likely result is a future dominated by recession and debt defaults -- similar to what we have been seeing recently , but trending over time to be worse .
In the midst of this recession , the view may be that there is plenty of oil , if only the price were higher .
Because of the large number of comments , this thread is being closed .
Please comment on http://www.theoildrum.com/node/6624 .
Views of Oil Prices
One view is that energy prices will rise , substitutes will be found , and prices will come back down again , perhaps settling at a somewhat higher equilibrium reflecting the cost of producing the substitute energy source .
The economy will continue to function pretty much as before .
The catch is that we are n't finding reasonably - priced , scalable substitutes , so this is n't happening .
Oil prices are down , but not because of substitutes .
Another view , popular among those concerned about peak - oil , is that oil and energy prices will just keep rising .
If scalable substitutes are n't found , some expect that oil prices will rise from their current price of $ 75 barrel , to $ 100 barrel , to $ 200 barrel , to $ 300 barrel , and eventually to $ 1,000 barrel or more .
The problem with this view is that it does n't take into account the amount of money people actually have available to spend .
Just because oil or energy prices rise does n't mean that people will get additional income to cover these higher expenditures .
In real life , prices can't keep going up .
I expect that what really will happen is oil prices may bounce up , but they will soon come back down again , because of recessionary impacts and credit crunches caused by high oil prices .
Most of the time , oil prices will end up in the uncomfortable middle - - too high for the economy to buzz along , but too low to encourage much new oil production , or much new renewable production .
The result is likely to be continuing recession , getting worse over time , because of what will be generally viewed as inadequate demand for oil .
What really happens when energy prices go up
Energy expenditures are not a big share of income for high income people , but they are for the many people getting along on minimum wage , or close to minimum wage .
If oil prices go up , these folks find the price of food and gasoline going up , and perhaps the price of home heating and electricity ( because the prices of the various types of energy tend to move together ) .
They find their budgets stretched , and they either
1 . Cut back on discretionary spending , or
2. Default on loan repayments .
A similar situation happens to the many people who earn more than minimum wage , but live paycheck to paycheck , and pretty much spend all the money they earn .
As the prices of energy - related goods rise , these people too find a need to cutback .
Some will cut back on discretionary goods ; others will default on loan repayments ; some will do both .
Thus , when oil prices rise ( or energy prices in general rise ) , we end up with two main effects :
1. Banks find themselves in worse condition because of many loan defaults .
2 . The economy starts feeling recessionary impact , because so many people cut back on buying discretionary goods .
These impacts are likely to lead to others as well :
1 . Banks become less willing to make loans , because of the problem with defaults .
2 . Many people are laid off from work , because of reduced demand for discretionary goods ( restaurant meals , vacations , new homes , new cars , new home furnishings , for example . )
The cutback in the purchase of new homes , new cars , new home furnishings and the like leads to yet more impacts :
1 . The price of homes drops ( because fewer are upgrading to more expensive homes , and because loans are harder to get ) .
2 . There is less demand for oil ( because oil is used in making cars , new homes , and many other things .
Also , if fewer people take vacations , and fewer people drive to work , this reduces oil usage ) .
3 . There is also less demand for natural gas , coal , and electricity , because all of these are used in manufacturing discretionary goods .
The next round of effects then becomes :
1 . Even more people default on their loans , because with the decline in home values , they owe more on their homes than their homes are worth .
This may also happen if people have lost their jobs , and can no longer afford their homes .
2 . The prices of all energy products drop ( oil , natural gas , coal , uranium , ethanol ) because of reduced demand .
Many fewer solar panels are sold as well .
About this time , governments come in with stimulus funds , bails out for banks , and the problem appears to mostly solved .
It is n't really solved though -- it is mostly transferred from private citizens and from corporations to governments .
But governments find expenditures vastly exceed revenues , and debt is rapidly rising .
Something needs to be done -- either raise taxes and cut services , or default on debt .
Before we talk about these options , let 's talk about timing .
When does all this happen ?
The popular myth among people concerned about peak oil is that difficulties do not really start until oil production begins its down - slope .
In my view , the difficulties start much sooner -- as soon as oil supply cannot be provided at close to a constant price .
Figure 1 . Average monthly West Texas Intermediate spot prices , based on Energy Information Administration data
Oil prices were in the $ 20 a barrel range for many years , but then started rising about 2004 , as Chinese demand began rising .
So this was really the first sign of problems .
A second measure of when this happens is when the growth in oil supplies starts to falter .
The world had been accustomed to a close to 2 % a year rise in world oil production , but slipped onto a production plateau starting in 2005 .
This production plateau has lasted until the present time ( 2010 ) .
Figure 2 . Diagram by author .
Historical data from Energy Information Administration .
So if we compare what production we might have expected in the absence of higher price or credit problems ( green line ) , to the actual production ( blue line ) , a gap started to appear about 2006 .
This is another measure of when we would expect symptoms of energy shortages to start affecting economies .
I know many will say , " Oh , but while we had problems with sub - prime mortgages about then , and housing price drops , it could n't have had anything to do with oil prices . "
I would point out :
1. Recessionary effects happened around the world , not just where there were subprime mortgages .
Japan was affected even before the US , and did n't have subprime mortgages .
2 . The effects that we would expect from higher oil prices had to be manifested somewhere .
It turns out the greatest manifestation was with lower income people , living in distant suburbs where the commutes were longest .
These are precisely the folks one would expect to be most affected by higher oil prices .
3 . The impacts of recession and credit problems have gradually spread more broadly than subprime loans , as we would expect , based on the foregoing discussion of the expected impacts .
I should point out that saying that higher oil prices being instrumental in causing in recession does n't mean that there could n't be underlying weaknesses , that would allow the manifestations to be in particular parts of the economy .
Also , we know that higher world oil usage is closely linked with world economic growth .
One would expect relatively lower oil use to therefore lead to recession -- and that is precisely what seems to be happening in the real world .
What is ahead ?
We are now at the point where the recession seems to be better , because governments have bailed out private citizens and companies ( particularly banks ) .
But this leaves the governments with a huge amount of debt , and with a big gap between revenues and expenditures .
Figure 3 . US government receipts and disbursements as percentages of disposable personal income , based on data of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis
Figure 3 shows what a huge shortfall the US government now has in revenues .
There are many other governments around the world with similar issues .
In addition , state and local governments have serious revenue shortfalls .
If recession continues , it is difficult for governments to continue to borrow more , as expenditures outpace income .
Eventually , governments are left with two options :
1. Raise taxes and reduce services , so as to get revenue and expenses back in line .
2. Default on debt .
Either one of these things will make the situation worse :
1 . If governments raise taxes , the effect on citizens is pretty much like higher oil ( or energy ) prices .
Citizens react by cutting back on discretionary spending or defaulting on loans , and we are back to more of the problems recessionary problems , plus loan defaults we had before .
If governments also layoff workers , this increases the recessionary effect .
2 . If only one or two small governments default on debt , the world can probably accommodate the defaults pretty easily .
But if problems spread to a large number of big countries ( UK , United States , and Japan , for example ) , then international trade is likely to be disrupted , because many sellers of goods will find themselves without payment .
To prevent this happening again , the sellers of goods are likely to set stricter terms -- I will sell you so much oil if you will sell me so much wheat in return , for example .
The amount of trade is likely to drop precipitously , because of the cumbersome nature of such trading .
If governments mainly raise taxes and reduce services , I would expect the result to be more recession , more debt defaults , and lower prices for all energy products .
Everyone will say , there is plenty of oil ( natural gas , coal , uranium ) in the ground .
If prices were only higher , we would extract it .
If there are major international debt defaults , the situation is likely to be somewhat the same ( recessionary impacts and lack of credit ) , but some goods may cease to be available for import .
If these goods are critical goods ( computers , replacement parts for the electrical grid , replacement parts for automobiles ) , the economy could spiral downhill rapidly .
A variation on defaulting on debt is attempting to inflate it away .
This still leaves owners of bonds very unhappy , and can cause many of the same problems as regular default .
What would it take to ramp up oil production ( or a substitute ) so production is again on a trajectory where it is growing at , say , 2 % per year ?
I can see several ways such a ramp - up theoretically could be accomplished .
( Some of these are more ways of circumventing the problem .
Note that these are all temporary solutions .
In a finite world , it is not possible to continue exponential growth forever . )
1 . If conventional oil production is flat to declining , one could ramp up unconventional oil production ( oil sands , oil shale , ultra - deep , and arctic for example ) .
2 . If conventional oil production is flat to declining , ramp up production of other liquids -- ethanol , biodiesel from algae , and coal to liquids , for example .
3 . If conventional oil production is flat to declining , one can try to convert a large share of the auto fleet to electric , and ramp up electrical production .
4 . If conventional oil production is declining , one can theoretically engineer cars to be much more efficient , and ramp up production of these new cars .
Regardless of which approach one uses , one needs :
1. A lot of time .
In 2005 , Robert Hirsch was the lead author or a report for the department of defense called Peaking of World Oil Production : Impacts , Mitigation , & Risk Management .
This report showed that mitigation would take 20 years .
If one stops and works through the details of any of the three solutions proposed above , one can see that each of these require long lead times .
For example , scaling up oil shale would likely require new coal fired power plants in the area , new coal mines , new train tracks from the coal mines to the oil shale area , and new water supplies piped into the arid US West , not to mention building the facilities themselves .
Perfecting the technology for electric cars , and building a whole fleet of these , would be a similarly slow undertaking , as would replacing the current auto fleet with more efficient cars .
2. A lot of capital .
Unless oil prices are higher - - a lot higher -- it is hard to justify large capital expenditures , in ventures such as this .
We have just seen that consumers cannot afford high oil prices , without recession .
3 . Long term subsidies .
If the prices of the new fuels are too high for consumers to really afford , one needs long - term subsidies .
We have just seen that high oil prices seem to hurt the economy badly .
High prices for substitutes can be expected to have a similar effect .
It seems like any one of these issues is likely to be a deal - killer .
Since we are already at a point where conventional oil is falling short of demand , the time requirement will mean that scaling up will be very difficult .
Progress to date on renewables has been very small , as shown on Figure 4 .
Figure 4 . World primary energy production , based on BP 2010 Statistical Analysis – Graph by Euan Mearns
Wind , solar , and geothermal are combined in the tiny red line at the top of the chart .
Since these all produce electricity , not a liquid fuel , they are not good substitutes for oil .
Biofuels are not shown , but are also a very thin line .
What is " Peak Oil " ?
" Peak oil " is sometimes described as the time when conventional oil production begins to fall .
There is still a lot of oil in the ground , though , but what is left is
1 . Very slow to extract .
It is necessary to ramp up huge amounts of production capability to mitigate the downslope of conventional production .
2. Expensive to produce .
The easy to produce oil is gone .
So what peak oil really is , is a turning point .
One can theoretically continue to produce the same amount of oil or more , if one makes huge investment well in advance .
The problem is that it is really too late now .
By the time new production finally gets started , conventional oil production will be down very substantially from its peak level .
The fact that no one ramped up unconventional production ( or alternatives production ) before it was too late leaves us with precisely the problem that the peak oil community has been warning about -- oil production capacity that can be expected to decrease over time , as individual fields deplete .
Peak Oil and Exponential Growth
Oil supplies are expected not just to level off , but to actually decline .
Part of this happens because of the natural decline rate of conventional oil fields , as the finite amount of oil that is in the field is extracted .
The decline is likely to be more severe than historical decline rates ( 2 % to 8 % per year ) would suggest , for two reasons mentioned earlier :
1. Declining credit availability , as high default rates continue among buyers .
Lack of credit will tend to keep oil prices low , and discourage investment .
2 . Higher tax rates on fossil fuels .
Governments are short of funds and oil companies are temping targets .
If tax rates are raised , this will likely cut back production , since oil companies base investment decisions on expected after - tax profit , and this will be lower for many projects .
Meanwhile , we have a huge number of variables growing exponentially :
• Economic growth
• Money supply
• Stock market prices ( hopefully )
• Population
These variables are not independent of energy supplies .
If nothing else , people need food to eat , and oil is used very extensively for food production .
It is questionable whether these variables can continue their exponential growth if oil and other energy supplies are declining in quantity .

“ Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist ” .

More than seven weeks after BP ’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig caught fire and sank , causing the worst environmental disaster in US history , what exactly happened during its final hours remains murky .
There is broad agreement that the platform exploded shortly after a series of safety checks — but just how many tests were done and what they revealed is the subject of intense speculation and debate .
Now a lawyer for some of the survivors says he has new evidence that casts doubt on BP ’s claims that a key safety check was successfully performed just hours before the explosion .
Tony Buzbee , a Houston attorney with a long record of winning settlements from oil companies , is representing Halliburton service supervisor Christopher Haire , who helped perform safety tests on the rig on April 20 , the day of the blowout that killed 11 workers .
That afternoon , Halliburton contractors performed negative pressure testing , a routine safety check that creates a sucking effect to test for leaks in a well ’s cement and casings .
Haire helped with two negative pressure tests , both of which indicated potential problems with the well the rig had been drilling , known as Macondo .
Buzbee says that statements he ’s taken from Haire suggest that an alleged additional test was not actually completed .
Haire was injured when the rig exploded ; Buzbee says his client is “ focusing on his medical treatment ” and unavailable for comment .
BP has acknowledged that two negative pressure tests on the day of the accident were unsuccessful .
A company official told congressional investigators last month that the tests ’ results may have indicated that an influx of gas was causing pressure to mount inside the wellbore .
According to a briefing ( PDF ) given to congressional staff by Halliburton , a negative pressure test is considered successful if no material such as drilling mud , a lubricant injected into unfinished wells , comes up to the surface .
However , the first negative pressure test aboard the Deepwater Horizon returned 23 barrels of drilling mud to the surface of the rig and the second test returned 15 barrels , according to public statements by an attorney for Halliburton .
Haire , who performed the two tests with the help of another rig worker , discontinued the second test at around 7 pm because the tank that held the drilling mud was full , Buzbee says .
He was then told to shut a valve on the well and stand by .
After about 45 minutes , Haire and a coworker began to wonder what was going on and went down to the rig floor , where the platform ’s drilling equipment was set up .
There they found four employees of rig owner Transocean — the driller , tool pusher , and two assistant drillers .
“ At that point , I was instructed by the driller and the tool pusher that they had achieved a successful negative test on the rig floor , ” Haire told investigators from the Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service last month .
( All four of the Transocean employees died in the blast . )
Yet Buzbee now tells Mother Jones that Haire ( pictured below ) saw no evidence that this third and final negative pressure test actually took place .
As Haire had been waiting above the rig floor , his pressure gauges did not show any changes in the well — as they should have if another test had been performed .
“ That ’s why I ’ve always said from the beginning that there never was a ‘ third test , ' ” Buzbee says .
“ The only information that we have about any so - called ‘ third test ’ is the word of BP . ” BP did not respond to a call and email seeking comment .
“ There never was a ‘ third test , ’ ” Buzbee says .
“ The only information that we have about any so - called ‘ third test ’ is the word of BP . ”
Buzbee and Haire ’s description of events is partly reflected in testimony given by Tim Probert , Halliburton ’s chief health , safety , and environmental officer , before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 12 .
Probert said that negative pressure testing had continued “ until Halliburton ’s cementing personnel were advised by the drilling contractor [ Transocean ] that the negative pressure test had been completed , and were placed on standby ” — echoing Haire ’s claims of being told to wait for further instructions .
Probert did not mention any additional testing taking place after that .
BP had final say on all operations on the rig .
An internal email ( PDF ) submitted to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce shows that the company ’s Houston office signed off on a plan for negative pressure testing on April 20 .
Yet the company has offered offered contradictory accounts on whether a successful third negative pressure test took place .
On May 10 , James Dupree , the company ’s senior vice president for the Gulf of Mexico , told comittee investigators that he believed the well blew out moments after the second pressure test .
A day after his testimony , lawyers for BP contacted the committee and “ provided a different account , ” wrote chairman Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) in an opening statement ( PDF ) delivered before a hearing on May 12 .
“ According to BP ’s counsel , ” continued Waxman , “ further investigation has revealed that additional pressure tests were taken , and at 8:00 pm , company officials determined that the additional results justified ending the tests and proceeding with well operations . ”
It was unclear from Waxman ’s statement what “ additional pressure tests ” BP might have been referencing other than the alleged third negative pressure test that Haire mentioned .
Testifying before Waxman ’s committee later that day , Lamar McKay , the president of BP America , would not elaborate on what happened after second pressure test .
“ I think the investigation needs to look hard at …what decisions were made after that point , ” he said .
Two weeks later , a memo released by Waxman ( PDF ) summarizing a briefing ( PDF ) from BP ’s internal investigation of the explosion made no mention of the additional pressure tests .
However , it quoted BP ’s investigator as saying that a “ fundamental mistake ” may have been made in the performance of the second negative pressure test since its results indicated “ a very large abnormality . ”
After this test , according to the BP briefing , there was “ discussion about pressure on the drillpipe ” and well was monitored until 7:55 pm , when the rig team was “ satisfied that [ the ] test [ was ] successful . ”
The Deepwater Horizon exploded less than two hours later .
Waxman ’s office would not comment on its investigation .
Yet on Monday , Waxman repeated accusations that the oil company had cut corners to save money and time on the Macondo well , which was significantly behind schedule at the time of the accident .
In a letter ( PDF ) to BP CEO Tony Hayward , Waxman wrote that “ BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure . ”
His letter did not mention negative pressure testing .
( Read Kate Sheppard ’s latest coverage of Waxman ’s investigation here . )
Adding more confusion to the third - test question was the May 27 testimony of Jimmy Harrell , a top manager for Transocean , who told federal investigators that BP originally had not planned to conduct any negative pressure testing .
Harrell said that the first test had been performed at his suggestion ; the second test was suggested by someone else ( possibly BP or Halliburton ) .
Harrell said that he and BP officials on the Deepwater Horizon had considered both tests successful despite the large amounts of drilling mud that came back to the surface .
He said he did not know of a third pressure test .
The disputed third pressure test has n’t come up again in subsequent public hearings .
Yet the conflicting claims about the Deepwater Horizon ’s safety checks are likely to remain a key focus for investigators trying to reconstruct the rig ’s final hours — not to mention BP , Transocean , Halliburton , and lawyers like Buzbee as they scramble to assign blame for the disaster .

LOS ANGELES , CA – April 8 , 2010 – ( RealEstateRama ) — California homeowners sued Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) on Tuesday claiming the lending giant is intentionally withholding government funds intended to save homeowners from foreclosure , announces Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro .
The case , filed in U.S. District Court in Northern California , claims that Bank of America systematically slows or thwarts California homeowners ’ access to Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds by ignoring homeowners ’ requests to make reasonable mortgage adjustments or other alternative solutions that would prevent homes from being foreclosed .
Hagens Berman filed a similar complaint in Washington state last month .
“ We intend to show that Bank of America is acting contrary to the intent and spirit of the TARP program , and is doing so out of financial self interest , ” said Steve Berman , managing partner of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro .
Bank of America accepted $ 25 billion in government bailout money financed by taxpayer dollars earmarked to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
One in eight mortgages in the United State is currently in foreclosure or default .
Bank of America , like other TARP - funded financial institutions , is obligated to offer alternatives to foreclosure and permanently reduce mortgage payments for eligible borrowers struck by financial hardship but , according to the lawsuits , has n’t lived up to its obligation .
According to the U.S. Treasury Department , Bank of America services more than 1 million mortgages that qualify for financial relief , but have granted only 12,761 of them permanent modification .
Furthermore , California has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation for 2009 with 632,573 properties currently pending foreclosure , according to the California lawsuit .
“ We contend that Bank of America has made an affirmative decision to slow the loan modification process for reasons that are solely in the bank ’s financial interests , ” Berman said .
The complaints note that part of Bank of America ’s income is based on loans it services for other investors , fees that will drop as loan modifications are approved .
The complaints also note that Bank of America would need to repurchase loans it services but has sold to other investors before it could make modifications , a cumbersome process .
According to the TARP regulations , banks must gather information from the homeowner , and offer a revised three - month payment plan for the borrower .
If the homeowner makes all three payments under the trial plan , and provides the necessary documentation , the lender must offer a permanent modification .
Named plaintiffs and California residents Suzanne and Greg Bayramian were forced to foreclose their home after several failed attempts to make new arrangements with Bank of America that would reduce their monthly loan payments .
According to the California complaint , Bank of America deferred Bayramian ’s mortgage payments for three months but failed to tell them that they would not qualify for a home - loan modification until 12 consecutive payments .
Months later , Bank of America came back to the Bayramian family and said would arrange for a loan modification under the TARP home loan program but never followed through .
The bank also refused to cooperate to a short - sale agreement saying they would go after Bayramian for the outstanding amount .
“ Bank of America came up with every excuse to defer the Bayramian family from a home loan modification which forced them into foreclosure , ” said Berman .
“ And we know from our investigation this isnэt an isolated incident . ”
Bank of America continues to ignore TARP regulations and instead creates more financial pressure on homeowners , the court filing states .
The lawsuits charge that Bank of America intentionally postpones homeowners ’ requests to modify mortgages , depriving borrowers of federal bailout funds that could save them from foreclosure .
The bank ends up reaping the financial benefits provided by taxpayer dollars financing TARP - funds and also collects higher fees and interest rates associated with stressed home loans .
Homeowners in Washington and California with mortgages through Bank of America are encouraged to contact Hagens Berman if they received an inadequate response from the bank for a home loan modification request after April 13 , 2009 .

8 Tips to Effective Coupon Stacking
More frequently , stores are allowing coupon stacking , or combining store and manufacturer coupons for multiple savings .
Store coupons are usually found in newspaper fliers , at store websites and on store shelves next to the product .
The Internet also is a great place to find downloadable and mobile coupons .
Store coupons will have the words " Store Coupon " or " Retailer Coupon , " along with the name of the issuing store .
But wait -- there 's more .
Multi-stacking is the practice of combining store and manufacturer coupons with additional money - back offers .
Such deals typically offer instant savings at the register or a money - back coupon that prints at the register for savings on your next shopping trip .
Here are eight basic tips to make your coupons pull double duty .
1. Where To Shop
Many supermarkets , department stores , drug stores and outlet malls allow double stacking .
2. Supermarket Stacking
Check your local paper for sales on grocery items .
Match sale items with coupons you 've already found .
Check the Internet for manufacturer or store coupons .
When possible , totally max out your savings by shopping on the day stores offer double coupons .
3. Department Stores
Department stores frequently try to create a sense of urgency by offering extra discounts on specific sale days or hours .
Shop clearance racks during these sales and double up your coupons for deep , deep savings .
For example , take a pair of shoes marked down from $ 80 to $ 40 .
Combine that with a $ 10 manufacturer coupon and a $ 10 incentive coupon from the store and you pay a grand total of $ 20 for your new shoes .
Make sure the store accepts these coupons before you purchase .
4. Drug Store Discounts
It 's easy to forget that drug stores offer excellent coupon and sales opportunities .
Find drug store coupons in newspaper inserts , weekly sales books and online .
5. Outlet Malls
Because outlet malls have fallen somewhat out of fashion , many are trying to lure back shoppers with frequent - buyer clubs and coupon books .
The clubs offer bounce - back dollars every time you spend money at their mall .
The coupon books apply to specific merchants and often allow you to sign up for email or snail - mail notices of special shopping sales .
6. Free Shipping Coupons
When shopping online , you can further compound your savings with reduced or free shipping coupons .
For example , you can combine amerchant free shipping code with a manufacturer or store coupon .
7. At Check Out
Always hand the cashier your manufacturer coupons first and store coupons second .
8. Keep It Legal
It 's considered coupon fraud to use more than one store or one manufacturer item on a single item .
Wow , I nip out to town for a couple of mahi tacos ( diet cops , shut your yaps ) , stumble back to my desk , and discover that some dude named Jack has parachuted down to Savage Death Island , peered at the curious natives through a 2X magnifying glass , and pronounced ( some of ) us “ smart . ”
Despite the fact that we do n’t care for his “ vague ” antifeminist remarks .
He then attempts to reinforce his superior status with an unflattering lampoon of the Blametariat , and to enlighten us with his unique male viewpoint .
There ’s also some other guy ( “ Flotsam ” ?
“ Fosdick ” ? ) on another thread who ’s really taking up some space with his unique male perspective .
Henceforth such dudes will be known as hanging chads .
These hanging chads , they really never get it .
Because women generally , and radical Internet Feminists in particular , are to them some mystical , unfathomable alien species , they think we do n’t understand them !
It is hilarious , the predictability with which they all , without exception , every single time , enduringly and persistently , are compelled to lecture the ignorant Savage Death Islanders on the finer points of the superior dude civilization back on the mainland .
Because if we just understood them , we would see how wrong we are to experience Chadly privilege as oppression .
“ Do n’t you see ?
When you attack our porn , it makes us insecure , because we love porn , wee wee wee ! ”
Yeah , yeah , feminism makes you insecure so you have to post insults , death threats , and boring lectures on feminist blogs .
What a revelation .
Knock me over with a feather .
Ça alors , c’est une big surprise .
But here ’s the thing .
Now , I do n’t speak for all the feminists , or for the readers of this blog , but this spinster aunt does n’t care about dudes at all .
In fact , I have acute dude fatigue .
The topic of Dudes In Society excites me about as much as expressing the dog ’s anal sacs .
Educational anecdotes concerning the Dude Experience monotonize me to the max .
The rarefied and incomparable Heterosexual Male Perspective bores the living lobe lubricant out of me .
Why ?
Because I ’ve heard it all about 174.8 million times before , and hearing it again does n’t do a fucking thing for me .
It does n’t make the world a better place , it does n’t cut through waxy yellow build - up , it does n’t clean toilets , and it for sure does n’t enlighten me .
What all chads fail to grasp is that , as members of an oppressed class , we have always considered it a matter of survival and our No. 1 priority to grok the fullness of the oppressor .
In fact , we ’ve been grokking the oppressor ’s fullness since the cradle , mostly without even realizing it .
It has n’t been too difficult , since we were all raised in the smelly nutsack of Dude Nation , and continue to be engulfed by and to marinate in dudelionormative swampwater all day , every day .
If there is ever some little dudecentric point here or there that eludes us , not to worry ; dudelionormative socialization protocols are in place to take us back to school and whip us into shape .
The result ?
There is nothing about men that Savage Death Islanders do n’t know .
Nothing .
We know all about your dicks and your glands and what gets you off and how you were socialized and the terrible strain of male privilege .
We get all your dude - jokes .
We know all your antifeminist arguments .
We know all your porn - is - necessary justifications .
We know how you behave when you perceive that someone of a lower caste has challenged your authori-tay .
No need to explain to us that we are doing feminism wrong , because we ’ve already heard it from the 495,312 dudes who thought of it before you were born .
We know that you are not conscious of your own privilege .
And we get that , because your invisible privilege derives from the oppression of women , you hate women .
It turns out that after a lifetime of prophylactic acquiescence to Dude Culture gavage , I no longer give a crap .
I do n’t give a crap if dudes like me , or if dudes like feminists , or if dudes understand basic elements of feminism , or if dudes support the feminist fucking agenda , or if dudes sincerely ask me to educate them about feminism when all they really need is a swift kick in the grill with the boot of basic human decency .
I ’d rather have a root canal than spend even 3 seconds trying to convince some dude that patriarchy exists and that I ’m not just making it up because I ’m ugly and ca n’t get laid .
The only thing that interests me less than educating lazy - ass dudes about their male fucking privilege is explaining to fucking lazy - ass privileged dudes why I am not interested in educating them .
And Jesus Christ , the ennui !
The crushing , stultifying , soporific ennui !
The ennui of writing “ Chad , you seem like a nice enough guy , but you should really check out the Feminism 101 blog before calling me ‘ irrational ’ and alluding to the power of femininity . ”
The ennui of reading “ your a bitch thats why feminism will fail . ”
The ennui of sifting through gibberish like “ Our female ruling class & their collaborators are biggest criminals in history . ”
God , the ennui !
It ’s like living in the goddam Twilight Zone episode where the train keeps pulling into the same station over and over and over .
Nothing wastes my time like a dude .
And at age 51 , I ai n’t got all that much time left .
In other words , the less I see of dudes , and of the gruesome products of their corny - ass fetishes , and of their boring - ass pronouncements on my blog , the more pleasant my day will be .
Look , mang , sometimes a spinster aunt just wants to shoot the shit with interested parties about some stuff , without having to endure douchebags splurting out boring douchebag shit that means nothing to anyone except other douchebags who are trying to out - douchebag each other .
She wants to shoot the shit about stuff like this :
That a world order predicated on domination ’n ’submission oppresses entire classes of people .
That oppression is experienced by these classes of people as discrimination , violence , and hatred .
That discrimination , violence and hatred are unhealthy and injurious .
That a social revolution that obviates the domination ’n ’submission model will have the concomitant effects of liberating the oppressed classes and , it so happens , of neutralizing the arousal quotient of domination , rendering pornography obsolete .
That ’s right .
After the revolution , pornography will have all the allure of cleaning a lint trap .
No dreaded “ censorship ” or “ banning ” required .
It will resolve itself .
Honigtöpfe als Statistikfälscher Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Schon seit Beginn der Debatte um die Sperrung von Seiten mit ( vermeintlich ) kinderpornografischem Inhalt beklagen die deutschen Strafverfolger die schlechte Zusammenarbeit mit den amerikanischen Kollegen - doch die Praxis spricht eine andere Sprache
Wer Schwarze Bretter ( egal ob on- oder offline ) betreut , der kennt die " Spaßvögel " , die stets mit den Nachrichten und Zetteln aufwarten , die sowieso wieder entfernt werden müssen .
Administratoren der offenen Messageboards im Internet haben regelmäßig damit zu tun , neben Spam auch Bilder zu entfernen , die nicht erwünscht sind .
Darunter befinden sich auch öfter einmal kinderpornografische Bilder , die dann schnell wieder verschwinden .
Solcherlei Bilder boten im Jahr 2007 den Grund für einen der " Großeinsätze gegen Kinderpornografie " , die in den Medien breitgetreten und mit nichtssagenden Zahlen garniert werden .
Diese Zahlen täuschen oft über die tatsächlichen Funde hinweg , da sie z .
B. zwar angeben , wie viele DVDs , CDs oder Ähnliches beschlagnahmt wurden , jedoch die Anzahl der Daten , die tatsächlich mit Kinderpornografie zu tun hatten , nicht einmal erwähnen ( was auch nicht möglich ist , da die Auswertung oft Jahre dauert ) .
Im vorliegenden Fall war es das " Ranchi Messageboard " , das dem FBI auffiel ( genauer : ein Verdächtiger hatte Informationen darüber geliefert , dass Benutzer des Ranchi Messageboards Bilder und Videos von Hardcore - Kinderpornografie einstellten , unter anderem sollen sexuelle Handlungen von Erwachsenen mit manchmal nur sechs Monate alten Kindern gezeigt worden seien ) , welches dann tätig wurde .
Dieses Tätigwerden bestand darin , dass das FBI zunächst einmal Dateien , die " Hardcore - Kinderpornografie " enthielten , vom Ranchi Messageboard herunterlud .
Dies geschah in den Monaten Juli bis Oktober 2006 .
Ebenfalls im Oktober 2006 stellte das FBI dann einen Honigtopf auf - auch " Bait File " genannt .
Dies bedeutet , dass ein verdeckter Ermittler selbst eine Nachricht auf dem Messageboard verfasste und den Anschein erweckte , in dem von ihm mitgeteilten Hyperlink befände sich kinderpornografisches Material .
Tatsächlich führte der Link zu einem Behördenserver , die Zugriffe auf diesen wurden protokolliert und das FBI begann nachfolgend , sich mit den Strafverfolgern in den betreffenden Ländern abzustimmen , um gegen die Kinderporno - Kunden aktiv zu werden .
Mit Bitte um Hausdurchsuchung
Im Schreiben , das vom " Office of Legal Attache " der amerikanischen Botschaft in Wien an die entsprechenden Behörden in Wien gesandt wurde ( LG für Strafsachen Wien ) heißt es :
Legat Wien wird später Kopien der restlichen Beweisstücke [...] vorlegen , die von San Francisco geschickt werden .
Wir hoffen , dass diese Informationen und die Ergebnisse Ihrer Ermittlungen hinsichtlich der IP - Adressen in Österreich es dem Bundeskriminalamt ermöglichen werden , Durchsuchungsbefehle für Hausdurchsuchungen bei den identifizierten ausländischen Personen für den 28.02.2007 ( geplantes Datum für die Aushebung der Gruppe der Verdächtigen ) zu erhalten .
Eine der IP - Adressen in Österreich führte zu einem Tor -Server , was die österreichischen Behörden hätten vorab herausfinden können , da es eine Liste der offiziellen Tor -Server gab .
Die Einschaltung / Nutzung von Tor -Servern war insofern interessant und wichtig , als dass im Schreiben an das Legat Wien noch einmal hervorgehoben wurde , dass die Undercoveraktion des FBI auch deshalb notwendig wurde , weil beim " Ranchi Messageboard " auch etliche Kommentare sich auf die Sicherheit / Pseudonymität / Anonymität der Nutzer bezogen .
Unter anderem wurde angeraten , einen ausländischen anynomen Proxyserver beim Zugriff auf das Messageboard zu nutzen .
Viele der auf der Ranchi Website und auf der außerhalb der USA gelegenen Website gegebenen " Sicherheitstipps " machten viele der traditionellen Ermittlungstechniken hinsichtlich Schwarze Bretter für kinderpornografisches Material unwirksam .
Bitte den Zeitplan einhalten
Um zu vermeiden , dass die ermittelten " Kinderpornokunden " gewarnt werden , wurde in dem Schreiben sehr deutlich darauf hingewiesen , dass keinerlei Aktionen vor dem im Schreiben angegebenem Datum , dem 28.02.2007 stattfinden dürften .
Es darf absolut keine Polizeiaktion , d.h. keine Hausdurchsuchungen , Nachschauen , Gespräche oder Einvernahmen anderer Verdächtiger , vor dem 28.02.2007 stattfinden , da dies andere Verdächtige warnen könnte .
Diese perfekte Abstimmung zwischen FBI und europäischen Strafverfolgern lässt insbesondere die Aussagen des BKA Deutschland zum Thema Zusammenarbeit beim Thema Kinderpornografie in einem anderen Licht erscheinen .
Das BKA hat vermehrt deutlich gemacht , dass z.B. Websperren deshalb notwendig seien , da die Strafverfolgung in den USA nur sehr langsam auf Hinweise bzw .
Amtshilfeersuchen reagiert .
Eine Kritik , die auch von dem derzeitigen Bundesinnenminister vertreten wird .
Erst im April 2010 wurde daher angekündigt , dass BKA und FBI besser im Kampf gegen Kinderpornografie kooperieren sollten .
Nun stellt sich angesichts der koordinierten Aktionen wie jener im Jahr 2007 die Frage , worin tatsächlich die Probleme liegen .
Das erste Schreiben des FBI im Fall des Ranchi Messageboards ist datiert auf den 29.11.2006 , das nachfolgende Schreiben auf den 16 .
Januar 2007 , die Hausdurchsuchungen fanden am 28.02.2007 statt .
( Kleine Anmerkung am Rande : Einer der Verdächtigen wurde von den Strafverfolgern darüber informiert , dass sie ihn aufsuchen würden .
Die Hausdurchsuchung fand dann ca. 1 Stunde später statt - eine Zeit , in der der Verdächtige seine Daten leicht löschen hätte können . )
Es war hier somit möglich , innerhalb von einem Vierteljahr eine konzertierte Aktion gegen " Kinderpornokunden " zu planen und durchzuführen .
Dass dies bei den deutschen Strafverfolgern nicht möglich wäre , ist kaum anzunehmen .
Umso seltsamer mutet es an , dass eine solche Zusammenarbeit nicht auch in umgekehrter Reihenfolge , also ausgehend von den europäischen Strafverfolgern , nur schwerlich umzusetzen ist .
Sollte das FBI also bei der Bitte um Löschung inkriminierter Seiten tatsächlich nur langsam agieren , so ist anzunehmen , dass es sich bei den Seiten entweder um jene handelt , die zwar der europäischen Definition von Kinderpornografie , nicht aber der US - amerikanischen , entsprechen - oder dass das FBI die Seiten aufrecht hält , um sie als Honigtopf fungieren zu lassen .
Dies dürfte den europäischen Strafverfolgern jedoch mitgeteilt werden .
Davon ausgehend , dass das FBI wie im vorliegenden Fall , seinerseits auch Links zu vermeintlicher Kinderpornografie ins Internet stellt , stellt sich auch die Frage , ob es sich bei einigen der inkriminierten Seiten nicht bereits jetzt schon um Honigtöpfe handelt , was letztendlich einmal öfter zeigt , welche Schwierigkeiten mit verdeckten Ermittlungen , die auch ungesetzliche Handlungen einschließen , mit sich bringen .
Wenn das FBI nämlich einige der Seiten betreibt / online lässt , die in die geplanten Sperrlisten mit einfließen , dann wird auf diese Weise nicht nur die Statistik gefälscht , es werden auch Fakten geschaffen , die dann als Begründung für die Websperren herhalten müssen .
So schafft die Strafverfolgung die Gründe für ein stärkeres Eingreifen - das Vertrauen in die Strafverfolgung aber sinkt weiter .
Das FBI kennt durch seine Möglichkeiten der Straftatenvortäuschung dieses Problem bereits seit langem - und das BKA hat sich auf den gleichen Weg begeben .
Beim Thema Websperren / Kinderpornographie geriert sich das BKA nun selbst als hilfloses Opfer , dem keinerlei Handhabe möglich ist .
Dass dies nicht nur kontraproduktiv , sondern schlichtweg falsch ist , hilft nicht wirklich dabei , das Vertrauen in eine Behörde zu stärken , die sich zunehmend wie ein zweiter Geheimdienst gebärdet .

Brett Ratner
The Rush Hour 3 director talks to The Advocate about his latest blockbuster and why people think he is a bear .
Brett Ratner is
everywhere right now .
With exposure including a
multipage spread earlier this year in Vanity
Fair -- where he is a contributing photographer -- and
special features in industry standard Variety ,
the prolific director has charmed his way onto
Tinseltown 's A - List .
With his first
seven films , including the Rush Hour franchise and
X - Men : The Last Stand , netting roughly
$ 1 billion , Ratner is one of Hollywood 's most bankable
directors .
The 37 - year - old — who has romanced such
women as supermodel Naomi Campbell and Rebecca
Gayheart — is also among its most in - demand
socially .
As Ratner sits
down to discuss Rush Hour 3 , which heads to
theatres August 10 , he is full of questions .
While he
sings praises for series stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker ,
Ratner gets an education in gay lingo and makes a
shocking revelation .
Ratner :
So , during my last gay interview , the
guy was on the Internet and said , “ I 'm looking at you
right now , and you 're a bear . ”
What 's a bear ?
The Advocate : For starters , it means you 're hairy .
There 's no hair on my ass .
I have no hair on my
balls .
So why am I a bear ?
Is there hair on your chest ?
[ Pulls down his collar ]
A little bit , but
barely .
Look at my legs !
[ Pulls up his pant
leg ]
Look at my legs .
I 'm not a hairy " bear . "
I do n't
even have hair on my back !
Maybe you 're a " cub " ?
Like a teddy bear ?
The term " cub " implies you 're younger , you 're fuzzy .
So they 'd like me in prison ?
Maybe ?
I 've never been to prison .
Are there bear bars ?
Oh , definitely .
And only bears go in there ?
Hmm .
I 'll have to
check it out .
[ Laughing ]
The author , Paul Pratt , and Brett Ratner
So what brings you back to the Rush Hour series ?
I love Jackie and Chris .
They 're my friends .
I 've known them for years and years and years .
They 're
a great comedic duo .
There are very few of them that
exist in the history of film .
The combination of Jackie's
physical comedy and Chris 's verbal comedy , it 's just an
amazing combination .
I love making these movies .
They 're fun .
Rush Hour 3 follows a trend in action films .
Being gay has
increasingly become a punch line .
It happens several
times in this film .
Which ones ?
Where ?
I do n't remember .
What about when the girl takes off her wig and
Chris
Tucker becomes angry and accuses her of being a man ?
No , no !
That 's from my personal experience .
My
first blow job was from a man , but I did n't know it
was a man .
That 's where that comes from .
It 's based on
personal experience .
It happens to a lot of people .
Is that common knowledge ?
No !
Well , among my friends , but I 'm not
homophobic or uptight about it .
That happens to a lot
of heterosexuals .
You meet a girl in a bar , and it
turns out she 's not a girl .
I think a girl should tell you
if she 's a girl or a man -- that way it 's your
preference .
It 's comedy .
Look , in this movie we do n't
pull any punches .
We make fun of black people .
We make fun
of Chinese people .
We make fun of French people .
We make fun
of gay situations .
We make fun of whites .
It does n't
matter .
It 's the type of movie it is .
It 's a
fish - out - of - water comedy .
You have to have those types
of situations to have the comedy .
That specific idea was
because it 's happened to me .
It 's happened to my
friends .
We 'll get together with a girl , and it'll
turn out to be a guy .
The reaction is “ Oh ,
shit ! ” if you 're not gay , which is funny , I
think .
Getting into the situation is funny .
I laugh
whenever I see one of my friends talking to a girl , and
I 'll ask , “ Is that a man or a woman ? ”
It's
funny , especially if you do n't know about it .
If you
know about it , fine .
If that 's your preference …
I never expected that answer .
I know !
I know .
I 'm too good an interview .
Did
you expect me to challenge you ?
Let 's do some word association .
I 'll name people
you 've worked with or know .
You tell me the first thing
that comes to mind .
Madonna .
Gay .
[ Both laugh ]
No. Madonna ?
Brilliant !
Britney Spears .
I have n't worked with her… but I 'd like
to .
[ Giggle ]
Why ?
Because she 's hot ?
No , just because she 's complex .
She 's talented .
I like her music .
I think she 's good .
I think she 's a
little lost and confused right now , but she 's good .
Naomi Campbell .
Nuts . [ Giggle ]
In a good way or a bad way ?
Good way .
I like nutty people .
Who else ?
Roman Polanski ?
[ He plays a cop that gives Chris
and Jackie a body cavity search in Rush Hour 3 . ]
Legend !
I mean , he 's my hero .
The guy is
like …
He 's a fan of Rush Hour .
That 's how I got
him to be in it .
We 're friends , but we met because he
saw Rush Hour and loved it .
Then we became
friends .
I asked him to be in the movie , and he said ,
" OK , you 'd better write a sequel . "
I called to tell
people , and they said “ Roman Polanski is not going to
be in this movie . ” I said , " Yes , he is , " but
they did n't get it .
You do n't like the finger up the
butt ?
Is that the gay thing you mentioned ?
That 's one of the things .
But that feels good sometimes !
Mobile aficionados with a serious need for processing speed should be all smiles this morning , as Qualcomm has announced that it is now shipping its third - generation Snapdragon processors to its hardware clients .
Known as the MSM8360 and the MSM8660 , both dual - core chipsets top out at 1.2GHz and provide support for 2D / 3D hardware acceleration , OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenVG 1.1 acceleration , 1080 p video encoding and decoding , integrated GPS , and 24 - bit WXGA displays .
Where they ’re different is that the MSM8360 supports HSPA + while the MSM8660 plays nice with HSPA +/EV -DO Rev. B. Qualcomm wo n’t disclose who has already taken ownership of the chipsets , but we imagine it wo n’t be long before the usual suspects start rolling out new handsets featuring these two lovely ladies .

" The best way to appreciate your job is to imagine yourself without one . "
~ Oscar Wilde
Welcome to AT WORK , a digital exhibition presenting and exploring images of labour in 20th century Saskatchewan .
The exhibition was produced by the University of Saskatchewan Archives in partnership with archives throughout the province .
As Beth Bilson , legal scholar , has recently noted , Saskatchewan " conjures up waving wheatfields , not smokestacks ; grain elevators , not factories .
The history of labour in Saskatchewan has not been the subject of extensive study .
It is a subject that repays closer examination , however , for it reveals that , as with many aspects of the political , economic , and social history of the province , this history has features that mark it as distinctive and unique in Canada . "
[ Perspectives of Saskatchewan ( 2009 ) , p. 197 ] .
Contradicting the province 's agrarian stereotype in June 2009 the Saskatchewan Ministry of Advanced Education , Employment and Labour reported that the provincial labour force of 557,500 included 140,400 employees working for salaries in the public sector and an additional 294,900 in the private sector .
Only 44,400 , less than one tenth the total number of workers , were employed in agriculture .
To provide manageable limits we were guided by definitions of labour as " the social class who does manual or physical work for wages " and " productive , especially physical , work done for wages . "
Beyond our scope was the very considerable work of farm owners , who frequently wish to be seen as small business operators , providing both capital and management skills , in the pursuit of profit .
Similarly there is no attempt to document here the unpaid work , usually done by women , in their homes .
We have not sought to highlight the work of those working in professions , although many are paid wages for their work .
Within these parameters we have attempted to show how varied waged work has been in Saskatchewan and to describe how economic and social conditions have affected employment .
Some of the images have been selected to suggest how issues of race , ethnicity and gender , have influenced labour .
The reproduced images were discovered at several of Saskatchewan 's largest archives including the Regina and Saskatoon offices of the Saskatchewan Archives Board , the City of Saskatoon Archives , and the Special Collections unit of the University of Saskatchewan Library .
The Local History Room of the Saskatoon Public Library was a particularly rich source of images , as was the University of Saskatchewan Archives , which , in addition to documenting the history of the University , preserves the very extensive records of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool , once one of the province 's largest and most influential employers .
We were happy to uncover hundreds of intriguing and / or dramatic photographs that described and evoked Saskatchewan 's labour past .
However only a few of the discovered images predated Saskatchewan 's achievement of provincehood in 1905 .
Since the selection was made from archival collections already acquired and processed , there are consequently few depictions of work and work sites from the most recent decades .
It was our determination to give preference to previously unpublished images and to include photographs from a variety of Saskatchewan communities and from different historical periods .
How well or how badly have the occupations of the working class been documented by archives , better known for recording the achievements of our political , economic and artistic elites ?
The conclusion is mixed .
A cursory exploration suggests that some occupations - e.g. firefighting , police work , custom threshing , mining and lumbering - are well represented .
On the other hand only a handful of images of newspaper boys , hired men and girls , and cleaners and sanitation workers were discovered .
Visitors to the site can interact with the material in various ways .
To highlight some of the most interesting images and to give very brief context , a small selection of the scanned images have been included with text on theme pages .
The much larger and complete collection of images can be searched independently by exhibition themes , occupations , keywords and dates .
The ' merely ' curious can select from a random presentation of images .
A bibliography of both print and digital resources concerning Saskatchewan labour history is available , including access to full text copies of several articles and theses .
Professor Joe Cherwinski has generously provided an educational resource to provide more context to the images .
We hope that our exhibition shines new light on the history of work in Saskatchewan .
It is our especial hope that AT WORK will act as a mirror for current workers , directly linking their current situations and challenges to the experiences of those who have gone before .
Mr Cooper said : " We really have no idea how he got across .
There are a couple of pedestrian subways , but he would have no idea where they were so it 's possible he just made a dash across the traffic . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans spend twice as much as residents of other developed countries on healthcare , but get lower quality , less efficiency and have the least equitable system , according to a report released on Wednesday .

The United States ranked last when compared to six other countries -- Britain , Canada , Germany , Netherlands , Australia and New Zealand , the Commonwealth Fund report found .
“ As an American it just bothers me that with all of our know - how , all of our wealth , that we are not assuring that people who need healthcare can get it , ” Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis told reporters in a telephone briefing .
Previous reports by the nonprofit fund , which conducts research into healthcare performance and promotes changes in the U.S. system , have been heavily used by policymakers and politicians pressing for healthcare reform .
Davis said she hoped health reform legislation passed in March would lead to improvements .
The current report uses data from nationally representative patient and physician surveys in seven countries in 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 .
It is availablehere .
In 2007 , health spending was $ 7,290 per person in the United States , more than double that of any other country in the survey .
Australians spent $ 3,357 , Canadians $ 3,895 , Germans $ 3,588 , the Netherlands $ 3,837 and Britons spent $ 2,992 per capita on health in 2007 .
New Zealand spent the least at $ 2,454 .
This is a big rise from the Fund ’s last similar survey , in 2007 , which found Americans spent $ 6,697 per capita on healthcare in 2005 , or 16 percent of gross domestic product .
“ We rank last on safety and do poorly on several dimensions of quality , ” Schoen told reporters .
“ We do particularly poorly on going without care because of cost .
And we also do surprisingly poorly on access to primary care and after - hours care . ”
NETHERLANDS RANKED FIRST OVERALL
The report looks at five measures of healthcare -- quality , efficiency , access to care , equity and the ability to lead long , healthy , productive lives .
Britain , whose nationalized healthcare system was widely derided by opponents of U.S. healthcare reform , ranks first in quality while the Netherlands ranked first overall on all scores , the Commonwealth team found .
U.S. patients with chronic conditions were the most likely to say they gotten the wrong drug or had to wait to learn of abnormal test results .
“ The findings demonstrate the need to quickly implement provisions in the new health reform law , ” the report reads .
Critics of reports that show Europeans or Australians are healthier than Americans point to the U.S. lifestyle as a bigger factor than healthcare .
Americans have higher rates of obesity than other developed countries , for instance .
“ On the other hand , the other countries have higher rates of smoking , ” Davis countered .
And Germany , for instance , has a much older population more prone to chronic disease .
Every other system covers all its citizens , the report noted and said the U.S. system , which leaves 46 million Americans or 15 percent of the population without health insurance , is the most unfair .
“ The lower the performance score for equity , the lower the performance on other measures .
This suggests that , when a country fails to meet the needs of the most vulnerable , it also fails to meet the needs of the average citizen , ” the report reads .
If you 're like me , when you think of world records you think of that weird guy in the Guinness Book ca. 1980 with the really really long fingernails that curled around and around .
Those sort of odd records continue to intrigue me so I came up with a list of 8 that are equally , if not slightly more wacky .
1. Most Spoons Balanced on the Face
In 2004 , twelve - year - old Jonathan Friedman made it into the Guinness Book of World records for balancing 13 stainless steel spoons on his face for two minutes .
Tim Johnston , who balanced 15 spoons for 30 seconds , quickly shattered the record a couple months later .
The current reigning champ is nine - year - old Joe Allison who managed to balance 16 spoons on his face in 2008 .
He continues to practice and hopes one day to break his own record , but says his face needs to grow a bit first so he has more room to rest the spoons .
2. Longest Speech
Lluis Colet holds the title for the world 's longest speech , which lasted a staggering five days and four nights — 124 hours in all .
The epic speech was about Spanish painter Salvador Dali , Catalan culture and various other related topics .
This is not the first world record title for Colet who scored the longest speech title originally in 2004 with a 48 - hour speech .
But the record was later broken by a man who delivered a 120 - hour speech .
Colet was determined to win his title back .
Fittingly , he dedicated his win to all those who work to promote and preserve the Catalan language and culture .
3. Most Piercings In One Session
All world records demand stamina but some are downright , er piercing .
Twenty - one year - old Matt Robinson recently walked into a piercing studio with 27 piercings and left with 1,143 .
He received 1,116 new piercings on his back and arms to break the world record .
Kam Ma had originally set the record in 2002 with 600 in one session .
Robinson had set a goal of receiving 400 more than Ma to shatter the record .
However , when Ma got wind of Robinson 's plan , he decided to break his own record with 1,115 piercings just days before Robinson 's scheduled session .
So Robinson upped his number to 1,200 !
However , after hours of torture , he decided to just break the record by one piercing and stopped at 1,116 .
And get a load of this :
He had the piercings removed a few days later , all except number 1,116 which broke the world record .
4. Eating the Most Hot Peppers
Pain comes in many forms .
For Anandita Dutta
Tamuly , the pain of eating 51 hot peppers in 2 minutes has to be weighed with this fact : the peppers were ghost peppers known to be the hottest peppers on Earth — twice as hot as Red Savina Habaneros .
In 2002 , Anita Crafford set the record by eating 8 jalapeÃ±os in 1 minute .
The ghost peppers that Tamuly consumed were 100 times hotter than the jalapeÃ±os in the original record .
Tamuly says she developed a taste for ghost peppers as a child when the paste had been smeared on her tongue to cure a childhood illness .
She would even pick and eat ghost pepper while other children in her village were busy picking berries .
To prove how resilient she was to the peppers , she smeared 25 of them in her eyes before consuming them .
5. Side Wheel Driving Through Smallest Gap
Dave Ackland broke the world record for side wheel driving when he drove his Vauxhall Viva on 2 wheels through an opening that was only 67 cm wider than the car was high .
The previous record had been set by Terry Grant at the Santa Pod Raceway , Wellingborough , UK on October 17 2006 .
Ackland is a professional stunt driver and had been practicing for a long time ( first on a bicycle ! ) to earn himself the title .
As a kid , her looked up to such daredevils as Evel Knievel and Eddie Kidd .
Ackland hopes to go on tour with his own stunt show that he says will include new blindfolded stunts and audience participation .
Yeah , you can count me out of the audience of that show !
6. Most Pumpkins Carved in One Hour
Schoolteacher Stephen Clarke has a special talent that has not only earned him two world records but a lot of notoriety .
He held the record for fastest pumpkin carver for sculpting a Jack O'Lantern in just 54.72 seconds .
However , he broke his own record in 2006 by carving a pumpkin in just 24.03 seconds .
Clarke also was published in the Guinness Book of World Records for carving 42 pumpkins in one hour on CBS's The Early Show , in 2002 .
In 2008 as a part of Publisher Scholastic Media 's promotion of Goosebumps Horrorland , the company 's first interactive game system , he broke his own record , carving 50 pumpkins in 1 hour before 3,200 witnesses !
7. Oldest Bungee Jumper
Ninety - six year - old Mohr Keet became the oldest bungee jumper in the world when he jumped off of the world record highest bungee jump location , Bloukrans Bridge outside Mossel Bay , on April 7 , 2010 .
The title had previously been help by James Talbot Guyer at 74 years 47 days old .
Guyer still holds the record for oldest base jumper which he earned after parachuting off the 486ft high Perrine Bridge in 2002 .
These guys are proof that extreme sports are not limited to the young .
Keet began bungee jumping at 88 and had actually set the record for oldest bungee jumper jumping off the highest bungee jump three times , but he did n't apply to get the feat certified as a world record until the April 7 , 2010 jump .
8. Most World Records Record
In 2009 , Ashrita Furman set a new world record for holding the most world records at one time : 100 simultaneously .
Furman has spent the past 30 years of his life training for and breaking world records .
He says his interest in breaking world records stems from childhood .
As a kid , he would much rather be reading the Guinness Book of World Records than playing sports .
In all , Furman has set 236 world records and currently holds 98 .
His records range from pogo stick jumping and peeling and eating a lemon to poetry recitation and underwater juggling .
The most records anyone person has held simultaneously since Furman set his record is 20 .
Furman feels confident that no one is catching up to him anytime soon , but just to be safe he continues to practice for and set world records .
Maybe we can convince him to set the world record for leaving the most comments on a mental_floss blog post , which should n't be too hard considering the present record is only about 10 !
Toronto FC plodded to a scoreless draw against the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday night , as nearby G20 Summit protests paralysed the city 's downtown core and appeared to prevent several thousand fans from attending the game at BMO Field .
Subway shutdowns , altered bus routes and the uncertainty over road closures contributed to the lighter - than usual crowd , as teams renewed the Major League Soccer season following a break for the World Cup .
Attendance was announced as 18,809 , though it did not reflect the actual number of fans in the stands .
Los Angeles arrived with the best record in the league , but without stars Landon Donovan and Edson Buddle , members of the U.S. team eliminated from the World Cup in a 2 - 1 loss to Ghana earlier in the day .
The Galaxy tied a league record by opening the season with a 12 - game unbeaten streak , a run that placed the team atop the overall MLS standings .
Los Angeles entered its game against Toronto with 10 wins in 13 games , having allowed only four goals all year .
Neither team was at its best in the first half on Saturday night , though , after a two - week layoff to accommodate the World Cup .
Toronto and Los Angeles each managed a lone shot on goal in the opening 45 minutes , with the hosts enjoying only marginally better chances .
Toronto midfielder Nick LaBrocca sent a curling shot wide across the face of goal in the 35th minute after a few unsteady touches on the sideline with teammate Jacob Peterson .
It was followed minutes later by a speculative drive from captain Dwayne De Rosario , who fired from 30 yards out .
Black smoke hung over BMO field
Toronto coach Predrag ( Preki ) Radosavljevic shuffled his cards early in the second half , substituting forward Chad Barrett and midfielder Julian de Guzman onto the field .
The changes , however , had little effect , and the game ended in a stalemate .
" It was a typical game after three weeks of not playing , " Preki said .
" I do n't think either of the teams was very sharp .
It was a tough fight .
I thought if anybody made a mistake , that was going to be how the game was decided .
But neither team really made any big mistakes . "
Some of the most interesting developments unfolded just over the horizon .
Evidence of the nearby G20 Summit hung over the stadium , with a thick plume of black smoke rising from downtown Toronto .
There were reports it was from the latest in a string of police cars set ablaze by protesters , and it would have been burning a 20 - minute walk from the upscale hotel where the Galaxy had been staying .
Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment issued a statement to offer absent ticket holders the chance to attend another game this season .
Tickets to that other game will be subject to availability .
" We made a decision to hold this game based on the security information we were receiving and given the location of BMO Field , " MLSE executive vice - president Bob Hunter said in the release .
" With the Galaxy and officials all in the city , there was never any thought given to cancelling the game . "
For the Galaxy , the thoughts after the game drifted toward their teammates at the World Cup .
It is not known when Donovan and Buddle will return to action for Los Angeles , which has only lost once in 13 games this season .
" They 've had a long , tough World Cup , " Mathis said .
" Those guys have been on a whirlwind , so it 's time to bring those guys back down to earth , a little bit . "
Defending the indefensible : a how - to guide
Powerful states often do bad things .
When they do , government officials and sympathizers inevitably try to defend their conduct , even when those actions are clearly wrong or obviously counterproductive .
This is called being an " apologist , " although people who do this rarely apologize for much of anything .
Some readers out there may aspire to careers in foreign policy , and you may be called upon to perform these duties as part of your professional obligations .
Moreover , all of us need to be able to spot the rhetorical ploys that governments use to justify their own misconduct .
To help students prepare for future acts of diplomatic casuistry , and to raise public consciousness about these tactics , I offer as a public service this handy 21 - step guide : " How to Defend the Indefensible and Get Away With It . "
The connection to recent events is obvious , but such practices are commonplace in many countries and widely practiced by non-state actors as well .
Here are my 21 handy talking - points when you need to apply the whitewash :
1 . We did n’t do it !
( Denials usually do n’t work , but it ’s worth a try ) .
2 . We know you think we did it but we are n’t admitting anything .
3 . Actually , maybe we did do something but not what we are accused of doing .
4 . Ok , we did it but it was n’t that bad ( " waterboarding is n’t really torture , you know " ) .
5 . Well , maybe it was pretty bad but it was justified or necessary .
( We only torture terrorists , or suspected terrorists , or people who might know a terrorist … " )
6 . What we did was really quite restrained , when you consider how powerful we really are .
I mean , we could have done something even worse .
7. Besides , what we did was technically legal under some interpretations of international law ( or at least as our lawyers interpret the law as it applies to us . )
8 . Do n’t forget : the other side is much worse .
In fact , they ’re evil .
Really .
9 . Plus , they started it .
10 .
And remember :
We are the good guys .
We are not morally equivalent to the bad guys no matter what we did .
Only morally obtuse , misguided critics could fail to see this fundamental distinction between Them and Us .
11 . The results may have been imperfect , but our intentions were noble .
( Invading Iraq may have resulted in tens of thousands of dead and wounded and millions of refugees , but we meant well . )
12 . We have to do things like this to maintain our credibility .
You do n’t want to encourage those bad guys , do you ?
13 . Especially because the only language the other side understands is force .
14 .
In fact , it was imperative to teach them a lesson .
For the Nth time .
15 .
If we had n’t done this to them they would undoubtedly have done something even worse to us .
Well , maybe not .
But who could take that chance ?
16 .
In fact , no responsible government could have acted otherwise in the face of such provocation .
17 . Plus , we had no choice .
What we did may have been awful , but all other policy options had failed and / or nothing else would have worked .
18 . It ’s a tough world out there and Serious People understand that sometimes you have to do these things .
Only ignorant idealists , terrorist sympathizers , craven appeasers and / or treasonous liberals would question our actions .
19 .
In fact , whatever we did will be worth it eventually , and someday the rest of the world will thank us .
20 .
We are the victims of a double - standard .
Other states do the same things ( or worse ) and nobody complains about them .
What we did was therefore permissible .
21 . And if you keep criticizing us , we ’ll get really upset and then we might do something really crazy .
You do n’t want that , do you ?
Repeat as necessary .
Some called it a political convention .
But in reality , it was where worlds collided .
Late Friday afternoon , as Maine ’s Republican State Convention fanned out from the Portland Expo to county caucuses at nearby King Middle School , GOP loyalists from Knox County found themselves directed to Classroom 110 – the domain of eighth - grade social studies teacher Paul Clifford .

Now this , in case you have n’t heard by now , was no ordinary county delegation .
The insurgent Knox County conservatives , heavily steeped in the Tea Party Movement , would manage by the time the convention was over to replace a run-of - the - mill party platform with a new set of planks imported from , well , another political planet .
It ’s a place where all of the borders are sealed , global warming is a myth ( and a potentially illegal one at that ) , health care is by no means a right , Austrian economics rule and you will never , ever witness the creation of “ a one world government . ”
It ’s also a place where , according to Section V , item k , “ It is immoral to steal property rightfully earned by one person , and give it to another who has no claim or right to its benefits . ”
Which brings us back to the worlds colliding – and a more - than - slightly irritated Paul Clifford .
When he went home for the weekend on Friday , one of Clifford ’s most prized teaching tools – a collage - type poster depicting the history of the U.S. labor movement – was affixed to his classroom door .
Clifford uses it each year to teach his students how to incorporate collages into their annual project on Norman Rockwell ’s historic “ Four Freedoms ” illustrations .
The poster includes this quote from the labor organizer and one - time presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs : “ Intelligent discontent is the mainspring of civilization .
Progress is born of agitation .
It is agitation or stagnation . ”
“ It ’s one of my favorite posters , ” said Clifford .
“ I ’ve had it sitting there for seven years . ”
Enter the Knox County Republicans , whose weekend convention coup has attracted national attention as a harbinger of a movement that knows a thing or two about agitation .
Details are sketchy – as they often can be when political passion gives way to apparent criminal activity .
But this much we know :
When Clifford returned to school Monday morning , his cherished labor poster was gone .
In its place , taped to the same door , was a red - white - and - blue bumper sticker that read , “ Working People Vote Republican . ”
“ So I start laughing at first , thinking , ‘ All right , that ’s funny , ” ‘ said Clifford .
“ But then I go inside my room thinking the poster will be on my desk – and it is n’t .
And so now I ’m like , ‘ You know what ?
This is baloney ! ” ‘
It gets worse .
While Clifford used his break time Monday to bang out a few pointed e-mails to GOP leaders asking for help in getting his poster back , King Middle School Principal Mike McCarthy started getting phone calls from rank - and - file Republicans who were upset by what they said they had seen in Clifford ’s classroom .
They objected to other “ freedom ” posters produced by kids from past years – one depicts former President George W. Bush with no eyes over the caption “ I feel like I can see evil . ”
They objected to a sticker attached to a filing cabinet in the corner that reads , “ People for the American Way – Fight the Right . ”
( Clifford says he did n’t put the sticker there – it was on the cabinet when he salvaged it from another classroom . )
They also objected to the contents of a closed cardboard box they found near Clifford ’s desk .
Upon opening it for a look - see , they found copies of the U.S. Constitution printed and donated to the school by ( gasp ) the American Civil Liberties Union .
McCarthy , who happens to be this year ’s Maine Middle Level Principal of the Year ( for the second time ) , tried to reason with the one of the anonymous callers .
“ What you saw was a snapshot after school of what was up in the room on that day , ” he noted .
“ You have n’t been privy to all of the different ideas that have been talked about in that classroom . ”
The caller ’s reaction ?
“ She just got more and more agitated , ” McCarthy said .
That ’s when McCarthy reminded the caller that a teacher ’s poster actually had been stolen .
Her response , he recalled , was , “ Well , it should have been because it should n’t be in that classroom ! ”
“ Well , that ’s not how we do business around here , ” replied McCarthy , by now somewhere between simmer and full boil .
“ We ’re more than willing to discuss ideas , but we do n’t steal . ”
Contacted on Tuesday at his home in Rockport , Knox County Republican Chairman Bill Chapman said he has no idea who took Clifford ’s poster .
As for the classroom ’s decor , Chapman said , “ We were wondering just what kind of picture he was painting to the students .
( The posters ) all , as I saw them , had the same theme behind them , which was very anti-American , anti-free enterprise , anti-religious . ”
Christie - Lee McNally , executive director of the Maine Republican Party , struck a more apologetic note .
While she has no idea who took Clifford ’s poster , she said , she ’ll do everything she can to have it returned or replaced .
“ That ’s not something we condone , ” McNally said .
“ I apologize for the bad behavior of a few people .
It ’s unfortunate that it happened .
It does give us a black eye . ”
As for the critiques of Clifford ’s classroom , McNally said , “ If my child was in that particular classroom , it might be a different story .
But other than that , I do n’t think it ’s my place ” to call the principal and complain .
Speaking of the children , they got into the act Tuesday after a note from “ a Republican ” was found in Clifford ’s classroom .
“ A Republican was here , ” it read .
“ What gives you the right to propagandize impressionable kids ? ”
Responded eighth - grader Lilly O’Leary , one of several students who sent e-mails to this newspaper decrying the behavior of their weekend guests , “ I am not being brainwashed in his class under any circumstances .
I am being told that I have the right to my own opinion . ”
She added , “ These people were adults and they were acting very immaturely . ”
Time will tell whether its dust - up with the Knox County Republicans will land King Middle School back on the national stage – only three years ago , the school ’s policy on contraception for sexually active students was the buzz of the cable news circuit .
But should the fallout continue , Principal McCarthy just might supplement that Republican platform plank about how it ’s “ immoral to steal property ” with a wall hanging of his own .
He ’s thinking something authoritative .
Something weighty .
Something that will remind future visitors , in no uncertain terms , to keep their sticky fingers to themselves .
Mused McCarthy , “ Maybe we should have the Ten Commandments up there . ”

MEDCO Drug Trend report ( 2010 ) : children who are covered by health insurance are the drug industry ’s fastest growing market .
In 2009 , prescription drug use for U.S. children increased by 5 % , while prescription drug spending for children increased 10.8 %
According to MEDCO , the growth in prescription drug use among American children was nearly four times higher than the rise seen in the overall population .
" While H1N1 caused a spike in antiviral use among children last year , the far more alarming trend since the beginning of the decade is the increasing use of medications taken by children on a regular basis and in some cases , for conditions that we do n’t often associate with youth , such as type 2 diabetes , " said Dr. Robert S. Epstein , Medco ’s chief medical officer and president of the Medco Research Institute . "
In 2009 , the FDA facilitated the expanded use of adult drugs for children when it expanded the labels for pediatric use of drugs for the indications for cholesterol control Welchol® ( colesevalm HCl ) and Crestor® ( rosuvastatin ) ; for hypertension Atacand® ( candesartan cilexetil ) ; for migraines Axert® ; for heartburn Protonix® ( pantoprazole ) ; and , worst of all , atypical antipsychotic medications Abilify ® ( aripriprazole ) , Seroquel® ( quetieapine fumarate ) and Zyprexa® ( olanzapine ) .
At no other time in history have doctors become partners of drug manufacturers prescribing dangerous drugs with serious medical side effects for vast numbers of children .
Doctors who prescribe such drugs are disregarding the documented risks of harm for children .
Clearly children ’s vulnerability is being exploited : they are being exposed to adult prescription drugs for chronic adult diseases to meet industry marketing goals .
At no other time in history has the US government–i.e. , the FDA–lent its seal of approval to the dubious use of such adult drugs for children .

MEDCO News Alert
New research : Kids ’ consumption of chronic medications on the rise
— Single year prescription utilization growth hits five percent for children largest jump among all age groups —
More than one - in - four children take medications to treat ongoing health conditions ORLANDO , Fla. , May 19 , 2010 – In growing numbers , children across America are adding a dose of medicine to their daily routine .
In 2009 , drug trend for children – a measure of prescription spending growth – increased 10.8 percent , driven by a 5 percent increase in drug utilization and higher medication costs , according to the Medco 2010 Drug Trend Report .
The growth in prescription drug use among children was nearly four times higher than the rise seen in the overall population .
A corresponding analysis of pediatric medication use found that in 2009 , more than one in four insured children in the U.S. and nearly 30 percent of adolescents ( 10 - 19 year olds ) took at least one prescription medication to treat a chronic condition ; the most substantial increases were seen in the use of antipsychotic , diabetes and asthma drugs over the past nine years .
" While H1N1 caused a spike in antiviral use among children last year , the far more alarming trend since the beginning of the decade is the increasing use of medications taken by children on a regular basis and in some cases , for conditions that we do n’t often associate with youth , such as type 2 diabetes , " said Dr. Robert S. Epstein , Medco ’s chief medical officer and president of the Medco Research Institute .
" The fact that one - in - three adolescents are being treated for a chronic condition points to the need for additional health education and lifestyle changes that can address the obesity issue that is likely a driving force behind such conditions as type 2 diabetes and even asthma . "
Type 2 Diabetes continues climbing in kids
Type 2 diabetes medication use by juveniles increased 5.3 percent in 2009 , the largest increase across all age groups , and higher than overall utilization growth of 2.3 percent .
Since 2001 , the number of children ages 19 and younger using these medications has risen more than 150 percent , with girls between 10 and 19 showing the greatest jump at nearly 200 percent .
While growth in use of these treatments is substantial , the actual number of children using these drugs is still far less than is seen in adults .
The obesity epidemic may also be responsible for a higher prevalence of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) in youngsters .
From 2001 to 2009 , there was a 17 percent increase in the use of antihypertensives in children , with the greatest growth ( 29 percent ) seen in boys ages 10 - 19 .
The number of children on proton pump inhibitors , used to treat heartburn and GERD , and in some cases prescribed for colic in infants , increased by 147 percent from 2001 to 2009 .
Last week ,
The Archives of Internal Medicine published a study showing that daily use of these drugs increases the risk of infection by Clostridium difficile , a harmful intestinal bacteria .
Changing behaviors
Utilization and costs of behavioral drug treatments continue to rise in children .
In 2009 , 13.2 percent of the prescription drug benefit dollars spent on children went to ADHD treatments .
However , the greatest spike in utilization growth last year was not seen in the youngest demographic but rather in adults aged 20 - 34 where use of these drugs rose 21.2 percent .
Among the drugs that have experienced substantial gains in the pediatric population are atypical antipsychotics ; traditionally used to treat schizophrenia , these drugs have more recently been prescribed for a variety of psychiatric disorders .
The nine - year analysis revealed that the use of these treatments in children has doubled over that time period .
While atypicals are still more prevalent among boys , the rate of growth ( 130 percent ) was greatest in girls ages 10 - 19 .
" Atypical antipsychotics are extremely powerful drugs that are being used far too commonly – especially in children – given their safety issues and side effects , " said Dr. David Muzina , a specialist in mood disorders and national practice leader of the Medco Therapeutic Resource Center for Neuroscience .
" We ’re seeing them prescribed for a number of different conditions including depression and anxiety for which there is not good evidence that they are an effective treatment and yet we ’re exposing children to the possibility of extreme weight gain that could lead to a host of health problems including diabetes . "
Questions of safety did have a major impact on curbing antidepressant use in young people , dropping about 23 percent since 2004 when the FDA issued its strongest safety warnings on the risk of suicidality in children using these medications .
Asthma alert
Respiratory drug use grew 5.0 percent for children in 2009 and was up 42 percent since 2001 .
Rising asthma rates accounted for much of the increase , as well as greater awareness of the disease and the importance of early intervention in controlling disease progression .
This class of drugs was responsible for the highest proportion of net costs of medications among children .
The H1N1 factor
Children saw a 46 percent spike in the use of antiviral drugs , by far the largest increase of all age groups and driven by the high incidence of H1N1 in the young .
Children ’s usage was primarily responsible for the 9.0 percent rise in utilization for the overall population .
Additional pediatric drug developments
In 2009 , the FDA expanded to pediatric patients the indications for cholesterol drugs , Welchol® ( colesevalm HCl ) and Crestor® ( rosuvastatin ) ; Atacand® ( candesartan cilexetil ) for hypertension ; Axert® for migraines ; heartburn treatment Protonix® ( pantoprazole ) ; and atypical antipsychotic medications Abilify ® ( aripriprazole ) , Seroquel® ( quetieapine fumarate ) and Zyprexa® ( olanzapine ) .

Big Pharma Makes More Money On Kids , Use Of Medications Among The Young Rises
May 19 , 2010
The pharmaceutical industry has found a growing source of sales –the prescription of medicines , primarily used by adults in the past , to children .
A portion of the sharp increase in drugs used by children last year was due to H1N1 doses .
But , the majority of the “ improvement ” in sales was because children are being treated for a rising number of chronic illnesses .
According to an annual study done by Medco Health Solutions , Inc. ( NYSE : MHS ) :
An analysis of pediatric medication use found that in 2009 , more than one in four insured children in the U.S. and nearly 30 percent of adolescents ( 10 - 19 year olds ) took at least one prescription medication to treat a chronic condition ; the most substantial increases were seen in the use of antipsychotic , diabetes and asthma drugs over the past nine years .
The data showed that Type 2 diabetes medication use by juveniles increased 5.3 % in 2009 .
There was a 17 % increase in the use of antihypertensives in children .
Both of these trends are almost certainly due to the rise in childhood obesity .
The underlying cause of the illness and the need for treatment will almost certainly continue into adulthood and overweight children remain overweight as they age .
The growing use of asthma treatments was also significant .
Respiratory drug use moved higher by 5 % for children in 2009 and was higher 42%t since 2001 .
For psychiatric disorders , the largest spending on drugs for children was treatments for ADHD .
During 2009 , 13.2 % of the prescription drug benefit dollars spent on children were for ADHD medications .
But the real growth in the psychiatric pharma area was a rise in the prescriptions for severe mental disorders–atypical antipsychotics .
Since 2001 , the use of these drugs in children has doubled .
The medical community is ambivalent about the trend .
“ Atypical antipsychotics are extremely powerful drugs that are being used far too commonly – especially in children – given their safety issues and side effects , ” said Dr. David Muzina , a specialist in mood disorders and national practice leader of the Medco Therapeutic Resource Center for Neuroscience . ”
Several large drug companies benefited as the FDA gave them permission to offer treatments formerly for adults for pediatric use as well .
These include cholesterol drugs Welchol made by Daiichi Sankyo , Inc. and Crestor made by AstraZeneca PLC ( NYSE : AZN ) ; Atacand for hypertension also made by AstraZeneca ; Axert for migraines made by Ortho - McNeil - Janssen Pharmaceuticals ; heartburn treatment Protonix made by Pfizer Inc ( NYSE : PFE ) ; and atypical antipsychotic medications Abilify made by Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ( NYSE : BMY ) , Seroquel made by AstraZeneca and Zyprexa made by Eli Lilly and Company ( NYSE : LLY )
The big pharma industry is under siege as many of its drugs go off patent and their sales are largely replaced by less expensive generics .
Drug companies are finding that their costs of R&D to find “ blockbuster ” treatments remains high but they are simultaneously faced with growing competition from biopharmaceutical companies .
It appears that much of the growth in sales for major drug companies during the decade will be for treating children who are overweight , unable to breathe , or mentally unsettled .

Google 's won the first round of the enormous lawsuit Viacom brought against it .
Viacom is suing Google for $ 1 billion for not having copyright lawyers inspect all the videos that get uploaded to YouTube before they 're made live ( they 're also asking that Google eliminate private videos because these movies — often of personal moments in YouTubers ' lives — can't be inspected by Viacom 's copyright enforcers ) .
The lawsuit has been a circus .
Filings in the case reveal that Viacom paid dozens of marketing companies to clandestinely upload its videos to YouTube ( sometimes " roughing them up " to make them look like pirate - chic leaks ) .
Viacom uploaded so much of its content to YouTube that it actually lost track of which videos were " really " pirated , and which ones it had put there , and sent legal threats to Google over videos it had placed itself .
Other filings reveal profanity - laced email exchanges between different Viacom execs debating who will get to run YouTube when Viacom destroys it with lawsuits , and execs who express their desire to sue YouTube because they can't afford to buy the company and can't replicate its success on their own .
On Wednesday , U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube was protected from liability for copyright infringement by the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
The DMCA has a " safe harbor " provision that exempts service providers from copyright liability if they expeditiously remove material on notice that it is infringing .
Viacom 's unique interpretation of this statute held that online service providers should review all material before it went live .
If they 're right , you can kiss every message - board , Twitter - feed , photo - hosting service , and blogging platform goodbye — even if it was worth someone 's time to pay a lawyer $ 500 / hour to look at Twitter and approve tweets before they went live , there just are n't enough lawyers in the universe to scratch the surface of these surfaces .
For example , YouTube alone gets over 29 hours ' worth of video per minute .
Viacom has vowed to appeal .
In dismissing the lawsuit before a trial , Stanton noted that Viacom had spent several months accumulating about 100,000 videos violating its copyright and then sent a mass takedown notice on Feb.
2 , 2007 .
By the next business day , Stanton said , YouTube had removed virtually all of them .
Stanton said there 's no dispute that " when YouTube was given the ( takedown ) notices , it removed the material . "
Calling Stanton 's reasoning " fundamentally flawed , " Viacom said it was looking forward to challenging the decision in appeals court .

Their actions are performed with Insight and ruthlessness and the doer is often detached , thus causing Chaos , defying and seeking to ‘ go beyond ’ restrictive forms , structures , laws ans institutions whose purpose are to hold people in thrall .
The Way of the Satanist , the Way of the Dark Warrior is to oppose the oppressors , who are usually of weak character and herd mentality , to fight all who seek to stifle our potential and evolution .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - The Russian Orthodox Church called Wednesday for an end to the “ monopoly of Darwinism ” in Russian schools , saying religious explanations of creation should be taught alongside evolution .

Liberals said they would fight efforts to include religious teaching in schools .
Russia ’s dominant church has experienced a revival in recent years , worrying rights groups who say its power is undermining the country ’s secular constitution .
“ The time has come for the monopoly of Darwinism and the deceptive idea that science in general contradicts religion .
These ideas should be left in the past , ” senior Russian Orthodox Archbishop Hilarion said at a lecture in Moscow .
“ Darwin ’s theory remains a theory .
This means it should be taught to children as one of several theories , but children should know of other theories too . ”
Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution has proved divisive in the United States , where Protestant groups promote Creationism , the idea that God made the world as described in the Bible , and the “ intelligent design ” view positing an unnamed creator .
The atheist Soviet state , which collapsed in 1991 , used Darwin to disprove religious teachings .
The theory , which biologists say gives a verifiable explanation for how life forms develop through natural selection , now dominates in Russian schools as it does in science teaching in most countries .
Hilarion said the theory that one species could evolve into another had never been proved .
Children “ should know about the religious picture , the creation of the world , which is common to all the monotheistic religions , ” he said .
DANGEROUS IDEA
Lyudmila Alexeyeva , a veteran dissident , told Reuters Russian liberals would fight any attempt to introduce religious teaching into Russian classrooms , particularly in science .
“ It ’s a dangerous idea and we will do all we can to stop it , ” she said .
“ We overcame Communism as the state ideology and certain forces want to replace it with Orthodox Christianity . ”
She said it was unlikely religious teaching would replace Darwin in the national curriculum , but it could find its way into some schools with enough pressure from the Church .
Hilarion heads the Church ’s external relations department .
His lecture to Russian Foreign Ministry officials in Moscow was dedicated to fighting “ fanatical secularism ” of liberals hostile to religion , and called for dialogue with moderate secularists and cooperation with Catholics against common foes .
Orthodox Christianity is Russia ’s dominant religion and both President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin regularly attend Orthodox services .
Russia also boasts several large religious minorities -- including around 20 million Muslims in a population of 141 million -- which have at times expressed concern about what they say is the privileged place of the Orthodox Church .
Medvedev on June 1 signed a law making July 28 a national holiday to mark the Church ’s founding with the baptism of Prince Vladimir in Kiev in 988 .
Muslim lawmakers have since asked for a national holiday to mark the arrival of Islam in Russia .
Hilarion said other faiths should not be worried as the baptism holiday was dedicated to all citizens due to the role of Vladimir ’s baptism in the foundation of the Russian state .
“ It is difficult to even imagine Russia -- if there would even be a Russia ... if that choice had not been made , ” he said .
Some industry experts are expressing concern about a proposal from the White House to develop a " National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace , " now up for public comment , saying it is vague , might no longer allow online anonymity , potentially gives government too much access to personal information , and provides a single point of failure for identity thieves .
The plan postulates security tokens such as a " smart identity card , " possibly from state government , or a digital certificate from a smart phone , that would contain all sorts of identity information about a person , rather than people having to remember a long string of user names and passwords for different websites .
The person would need to possess the token to have access to their online information , which the plan says would make identity theft more difficult .
However , while the plan talks a lot about different security layers , and different providers , it does n't talk much about who would actually be doing the providing .
Indeed , Appendix B -- " Participants " -- is blank .
And in an era when people supposedly posting anonymously are finding out that their postings are n't anonymous after all , some people are concerned that the proposal will eliminate anonymous posting altogether .
While the potential smart identity card would allow for anonymous posting , the very aspect of using an identity card makes it inherently un-anonymous , say critics .
" [ A ] nonymous to what extent ? " wrote Lauren Weinstein on his blog .
" Perhaps a blog comment would appear on the Web anonymously , but when the lawyers show up demanding to know who posted that critical comment -- something that 's happening with increasing frequency even now -- I 'll bet you dollars to donuts that the initial authentication records will be available through some means to unmask the poster , or to correlate pseudo - identities that users may prefer to use for different purposes and " roles " on the Net . "
In addition , some people are concerned about giving the government access to all of a person 's identity and security information .
In 1993 , the White House proposed an encryption chip , the " Clipper , " that turned out to have a back door that would enable law enforcement to decrypt information on the chip .
Finally , critics point out that should identity thieves find a way to steal or duplicate the security tokens , they could get access to all of a person 's information , not just that from a single compromised account -- the same sort of criticism that has been levied against the so - called REAL ID driver 's license .
Comments on the plan will be collected through July 19 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday urged consumers to stop using liquid Tylenol , Motrin , Benadryl and Zyrtec medicines for children and infants after a broad recall announced by the manufacturer , although it said the chance of serious problems was remote .
Johnson & Johnson ’s consumer division announced a broad recall of products , including certain liquid infant ’s and children ’s Tylenol , Motrin , Zyrtec , and Benadryl products late on Friday .
A full list of the over 40 affected products made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare is available at www.mcneilproductrecall.com
“ We want to be certain that consumers discontinue using these products , ” FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a statement .
“ While the potential for serious health problems is remote , Americans deserve medications that are safe , effective and of the highest quality .
We are investigating the products and facilities associated with this recall and will provide updates as we learn more , ” she said .
McNeil said it was recalling the products in consultation with the FDA after discovering manufacturing deficiencies that could affect the quality , purity or potency of the medicines .
The FDA said some of the products may not meet required quality standards , and parents and caregivers should stop administering them to children and switch to generic brands , which are not affected by the recall .
They said consumers should not administer adult strength medicine to infants or children since that could result in serious harm .
Some of the products affected by the recall may contain a higher concentration of active ingredient than specified ; others contain inactive ingredients that may not meet internal testing requirements ; and others may contain tiny particles , the FDA said .
The FDA said the chance of an adverse reaction was remote , but urged consumers to contact their doctors and the FDA if their children exhibited any symptoms .
McNeil Consumer said it was recalling all lots of the over - the - counter products .
The medicines were manufactured in the United States and distributed in the United States , Canada , the Dominican Republic , Dubai , Fiji , Guam , Guatemala , Jamaica , Puerto Rico , Panama , Trinidad and Tobago , and Kuwait .
It said consumers with questions about the recall could contact the company at 1-800-222-6036 or the website .
A hospital in Scotland is to become the first in the UK to use a fleet of robots to carry out day - to - day tasks .
The robots will carry clinical waste , deliver food , clean the operating theatre and dispense drugs .
They are currently undergoing final tests ahead of the August opening of the new £ 300 m Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert , Stirlingshire .
The robots will have their own dedicated network of corridors underneath the hospital .
NHS Forth Valley chairman Ian Mullen said the new hospital would be " packed full of design features to improve patient care and improve the life of staff " .
Analysis
The robots I saw look like forklift trucks .
However , where you would expect to see a driver there is a rotating laser beam , which it uses to find its way around .
The robot carries all the items you would expect a porter to move : food , linen , dirty linen , clinical waste .
There are separate robots for the dirty tasks and the clean tasks .
That 's very important from an infection control point of view .
There are other robots , which I did not see , which perform tasks such as cleaning the operating theatre floors .
They will also have a completely automated robotic pharmacy .
This is the first in the UK where the robots will sort , label and dispense the drugs .
He added : " Members of staff will use a hand - held PDA to call up the robot to move meal trays , or linen , or whatever .
" The robot will come up in the service lift by itself , pick up the item and go back into the lift . "
Tom McEwen , the project manager for manufacturer Serco , said a series of pre-programmed routes would be set out for the robots to follow .
" The robots will follow the system using a series of laser beams which will tell it exactly where it is , " he explained .
Computers on board the robots will be able to tell doors to open , and sensors will tell the robots to stop if anything - or anyone - is in the way .
One of the most valuable aspects of using robots is in controlling infection .
" Traditionally clean and dirty tasks are carried out by the same person , " infection control nurse Lesley Shepherd said .
" Here , you 'll have the robots that do dirty tasks , so they may take dirty linen or clinical waste away , and you 'll have robots that do clean tasks , such as bringing meals and clean linen to patients .
" They have separate lifts so there 's no way they can cross , which is great . "
Other robot models will clean theatre floors and even dispense drugs at the pharmacy .
Managers said the robots would not replace humans , but would free up more time for staff to spend with patients .
They will also have to keep at least one human on standby , should any of the robots break down .
Firstly , if anyone is unfamiliar with Louis Theroux , I suggest you YouTube search some of these documentaries now and watch them .
Right now .
Secondly , this list is purely subjective , but I ’ve tried to rank them in terms of how interesting I found them , how little about the subject I knew before I watched them , and also entertainment and sensationalism value .
Louis Theroux is an award - winning , British - American TV journalist , renowned for his ‘ Gonzo ’ style of journalism – ( a subjective style which is told in the first person , with Louis as the “ main character ” ) .
He became well known in the early 90’s through various newspaper and magazine articles and eventually , in 1998 , he landed his first TV show , ‘ Louis Theroux ’s Weird Weekends ’ .
In these shows he went and spent time with various , ( mostly ) American , lesser - known subcultures and set out to “ discover the genuinely odd in the most ordinary setting ” .
He later went on to film 2 more seasons , including ‘ When Louis met … ’ – in which he spends time with some eccentric figures from Britain , as well as filming various specials all the way up to the present year .
Here are my top 10 Louis Theroux documentaries with short clips from each .
10 Survivalists First aired – 5 February 1998
Survivalism is a movement in which groups of people are actively preparing for a future crisis – these can include changes in the government , pandemics , natural disasters and wars .
Louis meets various people preparing for this major “ shift ” in different ways , including an ex-marine who has founded ‘ Almost Heaven ’ , a small group of conspiracy theorists that claim the New World Order will be in effect soon , and are planning to oppose them .
He meets various people who have moved themselves and their families out of traditional suburban life and gone to live miles away from civilization in an effort to protect themselves .
He follows these people as they patrol their perimeters at night on the lookout for government troops , and also as they buy supplies in a survivalist store called ‘ Safetrek ’ .
The man at the very beginning of this clip is a survivalist called Mike , who lives alone in an underground log cabin he built himself .
Also in this clip he goes on to meet a more extreme group called the Aryan Nations – a white nationalist neo -Nazi organization .
9 U.F.O. Hunters First aired – 22 January 1998
This had to be on the list purely because of how incredibly strange the people featured in it are .
Among relatively tame alien hunters , such as those who travel to Area 51 , in Nevada , he meets the community who run the ‘ Little Ale - Inn ’ in Rachel , the small town near to Area 51 .
Seemingly unperturbed by any amount of strangeness in this documentary , Louis meets a man called ‘ Thor Templar ’ – the self - proclaimed “ Lord Commander of the Earth Protectorate ” , who claims to have killed more than 20 aliens with gadgets he seems to have built from household materials .
The whole thing is too bizarre .
Even more so , he goes in search of a ‘ Reverend Robert Shaw ’ , who claims to be able to channel extra terrestrials and Louis is lucky enough to speak to an alien called “ Korton ” from the system “ Koldas ” , a Saturn - like planet whose inhabitants once occupied our system but had to move because of interstellar warfare …
Their conversation is in the clip .
8 Louis , Martin and Michael First aired – 17 November 2003
Very much a companion piece to Martin Bashir ’s ‘ Living with Michael Jackson ’ documentary shown in February earlier that year , ‘ Louis , Martin and Michael ’ follows Louis ’ efforts to arrange an interview and produce a documentary about Michael Jackson .
His efforts to liaise through Michael ’s friend , Uri Geller , eventually prove futile as Uri denies Louis access to Michael , yet grants Martin Bashir permission instead .
The events run alongside Martin Bashir ’s documentary , as Louis follows Michael to Las Vegas and meets his “ personal magician ” , called Majestik Magnificent – who has lived with the Jacksons for nearly 20 years .
Louis attempts to get closer to Michael through his family members , and eventually has to pay $ 5000 to interview Michael ’s dad , Joe , thinking it will improve his chances meeting Michael .
Ultimately , however , the interview gets boycotted .
In his typical style , Louis does n’t ‘ sugar the pill ’ so to speak , and asks Joe outright questions about Michaels ’ face and beating him when he was young , among other things .
The second interview with Joe is shown above , in which he and Majestik get insulted over Louis ’ definition of ‘ partner ’ .
Despite this , and Joe ’s disturbing answers ( “ he regurgitates all the way to the bank ” for instance ) , Louis keeps composure brilliantly , and despite never seeing Michael himself , creates a great documentary .
7 Wrestling First aired – 6 July 1999
Louis explores what it takes to become a professional wrestler in the United States , visiting both the large WCW shows and meeting wrestlers such as Roddy Piper and Goldberg , as well as smaller , more extreme factions of the subculture , namely the AIWF , which are famous for their use of barbed wire and other weapons .
He discovers a “ school ” of wrestling called the ‘ Power Plant ’ – a place where all professional wrestlers learn their art and along the way meets their hot - headed trainer , Sarge .
During his questioning , Louis tries to establish how much of the action in the ring is planned before hand , and to what extent the wrestlers know what ’s going to happen .
This question angers Sarge , who takes it as an insult to their athletic abilities .
It is interesting to see how openly the smaller wrestling organizations talk about the “ soap opera in spandex ” , and how they plan the storylines , while the bigger corporations give Louis a hard time about it .
When Louis visits the Power Plant , Sarge puts him through his paces to prove a point .
The amusing result is in the clip above , although it does n’t show Louis trying to run away , or him throwing up outside .
6 Black Nationalism First aired – 2 June 1999
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKYvDn095Ew
The principles of Black Nationalism are simply black ‘ unity ’ and independence from the white society .
In this documentary , Louis explores the more extreme spectrum of BN , with ideas bordering on separatism , racism and complete black superiority .
He travels to Harlem , New York , and meets various people involved in the movement , including Reverend Al Sharpton – a black civil rights activist , and Khalid Abdul Muhammed , a black separatist dubbed ‘ the most dangerous man in America ’ .
The film also focuses on the shooting of Amadou Diallo , a young black man who was shot 41 times by a group of white police officers , with Louis attending a protest for his justice with Reverend Sharpton .
A memorable part is when Louis shops with Khalid Muhammed as he reveals his dislike for the white man and how the white race is “ absolutely disagreeable to get along with in peace ” .
Even further along the spectrum is the ‘ Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge ’ – an extreme , all - black group that believe various figures from history including Jesus , Henry VIII and William Shakespeare were undoubtedly all black .
He meets this school in the clip above .
5 Most Hated Family in America First aired – 1 April 2007
Louis Theroux , himself , stated in an interview after finishing this documentary that the Phelps family , ( the family at the heart of this film ) , were the most extreme people he had ever met .
Despite this , however , they were very kind , articulate and , especially the younger members , pleasant .
The Phelps family , which is headed by Fred Phelps , run the ‘ Westboro Baptist Church ’ in Kansas – a hate group with its core message being “ God hates Fags ” .
Their twisted interpretation of the bible has lead them to believe that all tragedies on Earth are because of homosexuality , which is considered to be the worst sin of all , and the public ’s increasing acceptance of homo and bi sexuality .
They were made famous because the church regularly picket funerals of fallen soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan , with signs such as ‘ Thank god for dead soldiers ’ and ‘ God hates fag soldiers ’ .
As with all of his documentaries , Louis manages to keep a level , unbiased opinion of the family despite their extremism , accompanying them on protests and seeing their whole belief “ system ” for what it is .
In this clip , Shirley Phelps explains the basis of their beliefs and tries to claim that ‘ Thou shalt not commit adultery ’ is about homosexuality , also claiming God “ does evil ” .
As you will see , it ’s quite outrageous , but Louis remains utterly calm about it .
4 Behind bars First aired – 13 January 2008
In one of my favorite documentaries of his , Louis spends a few weeks in San Quentin prison in San Francisco , one of America ’s toughest prisons and home to ‘ gangbangers ’ , rapists and murderers .
Louis focuses on a group of prisoners , though not in as much detail as some subjects in his other films .
These include the guards , a gang member called ‘ Playboy Nolan ’ and a man called ‘ David Silver ’ who is serving 500 years plus 11 life sentences .
Throughout the film , the fact that Louis is surrounded by murderers and rapists all the time , not just while in the yard or eating with them , is surreal .
During his stay , he starts to focus on friendships between people of the same race , and also relationships in the prison , including a transgender woman named Deborah , who shares a cell with her boyfriend .
Despite the gloomy aesthetics of the place , it is home to plenty of interesting people with whom Louis connects in some ways .
In other ways , he makes them speak about things a little more than they would like to .
In the clip , he speaks to a group of white men in the prison yard about the racial segregation , and their crimes .
3 Law and Disorder First aired – 30 November 2008
‘ Law and Disorder in Philadelphia ’ and ‘ Law and Disorder in Johannesburg ’ make up the 2008 Law and Disorder specials , where Louis travels to areas of the world that are plagued with crime and trouble .
He rides around with a special policing unit in the city of Philadelphia , and experiences the horrors and threats of gun crime and shootings as they take on the so - called “ War on Drugs ” .
During the episode he speaks to various people who have been arrested by the police for possession of a gun , drug dealers , addicts and even a drug lord .
In Johannesburg , he spends time with various private security agencies , including one that “ arrests ” criminals and beats them .
While being a lot grittier and extreme than Philadelphia , it does n’t feel as serious and despite being present at the beating of a man , and multiple warnings of being shot or mobbed , Louis does n’t seem too shocked or afraid .
Saying this , the scene in which the security firm deal with a disturbance in the street is almost too graphic to watch .
Throughout the documentaries , Louis wears his bullet proof vest and does his usual ‘ wide - eyed innocent ’ routine to get these various people to talk to him , though not in a way he , or anyone watching expects .
The clip shows this brilliantly as Louis meets two South African criminals and has a very disturbing interview where one describes how he ’d get Louis ’ money by cutting his wife ’s throat or by putting his child in an oven .
2 Porn First aired 29 January 1998
Louis finds out there are fewer male porn performers on the planet than there is astronauts , while on a quest to investigate the American porn film industry , from the point of view of a man in the business .
While normally he would be there purely as a journalist , in this episode he gets in relatively deeply with groups that he meets , and in the industry itself , even being offered a part in a porn film .
He enrolls in a ‘ talent ’ agency , and is invited on set during the filming of porn films to find out first - hand about how “ easy ” it is .
He sees the money , and the problems associated with the business , including people destroying themselves with drugs because of it , and also the threat of HIV .
He spends time with a ( then ) up - and - coming pornstar , J.J. Michaels , who seems ignorant of the risks of the industry , and also discovers an actor called Troy who , while claiming to be straight , appears in gay films , and is as the industry says , “ gay for pay ” .
In the clip , a director named Rob Black tries to get Louis into the industry with Louis claiming it ’s “ not something people in England are ready to see ” .
1 Louis and the Nazis First aired – 21 December 2003
Louis gets to grips with the white supremacist and neo -Nazi movement , living among racist people whose world views are among the most abhorrent conceivable .
He meets a man deemed the most dangerous racist in America , Tom Metzger , who was a grand dragon of the KKK in the 70’s , a congressional candidate , and now the leader of a white resistance group .
Among others , he meets a mother who pushes her world view on her two 11 year old daughters who regularly sing at skinhead rallies and are seen singing racist songs during an awkward car journey .
Throughout this documentary , Louis seems to have two objectives ; to see how these ideas influence children who are brought up around them , and also to expose flaws in their thinking and find contradictions .
He follows Tom Metzger and his shady “ agent ” to Mexico and also to a skinhead rally , as well as questioning the two young girls on the morals they seem to uphold ( although being too young to understand them and answering in a way that made their mother ’s brainwashing apparent ) .
Louis finds Tom Metzger to have an immigrant friend from Peru , for whom he fixes televisions , and this provides a basis for the inconsistencies .
In one part , he visits a man called “ Skip ” who ’s whole family are skinheads / racists .
After being accused of being Jewish by them , Louis does n’t answer because he believes answering would mean he accepts that for some reason it should matter what his religion is , when he does n’t think it should .
Despite threats , surprisingly , Louis keeps this up for a while longer , until the two questioning him walk off and Louis leaves alone .
This for me was the most memorable moment of his documentaries , and took quite a lot of balls for him to do , especially after Skip says if he was Jewish he ’d “ Kick his ass and leave him in the street somewhere ” .
In the clip above , Louis meets Tom ’s Peruvian friend , Oscar , and questions him on the way home about his warped view .
Tom gets owned .
Docs ' win on Medicare too late to stop 21 % cut
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Doctors who receive Medicare payments won a round Friday in their bid for a raise - but first they 'll suffer a big cut in their government reimbursements .
The Senate passed a bill Friday rescinding a 21 % cut and adding a 2.2 % increase for Medicare payments .
The bill was passed by unanimous consent after lawmakers found a way to pay for the boost without raising the budget deficit .
The bill now goes back to the House of Representatives , which had previously approved it , because of Senate changes to the measure .
A Democratic leadership aide said the House would take up the bill early next week .
But the delay in congressional action came too late to stop the first reduced Medicare payments to doctors from the scheduled 21.3 % cut that went into effect June 1 .
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that after waiting since May for congressional approval , it can't wait any longer .
So it is processing all claims from June 1 up till now .
" This is the largest reduction that the doctors ' payment has ever experienced , " said centers spokesman Peter Ashkenaz .
With their future payments still uncertain , physicians found little reason to rejoice over the Senate approval .
" It 's going to go back to the House now , and it looks like they 're not going to be in session until Tuesday afternoon , " said Dr. Lori Heim , president of the American Academy of Family Physicians .
" It 's definitely something that physicians are concerned about , " said Jack Hoadley , research professor at Georgetown University 's Health Policy Institute .
Hoadley said Congress usually makes fixes such as this one retroactive .
But , he added , " even if it turns out there 's a retroactive fix , there 's a real cash issue . "
Heim said she knows physicians who " already decided that they could no longer continue to see Medicare patients if the cut went through .
There are other physicians that I 've heard from who have decided to stop taking Medicare patients . "
" This is really outrageous , " she added .
The American Medical Association also weighed in .
" Congress is playing Russian roulette with seniors ' health care , " said AMA President Dr. Cecil B. Wilson .
" Congress has finally taken its game of brinkmanship too far , as the steep 21 % cut is now in effect and physicians will be forced to make difficult practice changes to keep their practice doors open . "
More than 43 million Americans receive medical care through Medicare .

Usually a store is just a store .
But a few stores are attractions in and of themselves .
So it is with these six incredibly cool - looking bookstores .
Next you are in Maastricht , Beijing , Porto , Buenos Aires , Paris or Mexico City , add these stores to your list of must - see attractions — even if you do n’t plan on buying a book .
# 1 Selexyz Dominicanen
Maastricht , Netherlands
It ’s tough running an independent bookstore .
To make such a business successful it helps having God on your side .
Perhaps that ’s what the proprietors of the Selexyz Dominicanen Bookstore were thinking when they decided to house their establishment in a 13th century Dominican cathedral in the center of Maastricht , Holland .
Though , in truth , the cathedral has n’t been a center for worship since Napoleon put the kibosh on services after he invaded Maastricht in 1794 .
Since then the cathedral has been alternately abandoned , used as a warehouse and turned into what was probably the world ’s most sanctified indoor bicycle parking lot .
Despite the fact that the cathedral had n’t been a working cathedral for more than 200 years , turning the space into a bookstore was an enormous challenge for Selexyz Dominicanen ’s architects .
A city ordinance required that the cathedral be completely preserved , meaning that no permanent modifications to the building of any sort were allowed !
So how do you create a three - story bookstore in a cathedral when you can’t drill any holes into the building or attach anything load - bearing to its walls ?
Selexyz Dominicanen made ingenious use of free - standing black steel scaffolding .
This scaffolding completely supports all the bookshelves and the catwalks to them .
The shelves and scaffolding are close to the cathedral ’s walls but scaffolding never actually touch them .
Add to that a tasteful use of religious iconography ( check out the cross - shaped reading table in the pic , above ) , a nice cafe located where the church choir once sang , and a slew of inviting nooks and comfy reading areas and the result is a bookstore that ’s absolutely divine .

# 2 Poplar Kid’s Republic
Beijing
What a cool design concept : Start with an all white bookstore interior — white floors , white ceiling , white walls , white stairs , white bookshelves , white everything — and to that liberally add rainbow splashes of bright color .
Stock your shelves with a huge multi-language selection of kid ’s books , add reading cubbyholes and padded activity areas , and you have Beijing ’s Poplar Kid ’s Republic , our favorite children ’s bookstore in the world .
( Sadly , our previous favorite children ’s bookstore , the Cheshire Cat outside of Washington , DC , closed down several years ago — we hope endowing our current favored status upon the Kid ’s Republic wo n’t condemn it to the same fate ) .
Our few photos below do n’t really do this huge store justice so check it out yourself next you are in Beijing .
Kid ’s Republic also has a branch , nearly as cool , in Shanghai .

# 3 Livraria Lello
Porto , Portugal
Think a profitable store ca n’t be lush , rich and somehow homely ?
The velvety Livraria Lello in downtown Porto will change your mind .
Not so much the art nouveau exterior as the gold - accented interior with its red carpets , stained glass , wood paneling and flowing central stair case .
Walking into this bookstore , we had an insatiable urge to light a cigar ( and we do n’t smoke ) because , well , this is the sort of place it seems like one should do that .
And , indeed , this is the sort of place where one can do that .
Cigars are sold in the Livraria Lello ’s upstairs four - table coffee shop along with port , coffee ( obviously ) and baked goods .

# 4 El Ateneo
Buenos Aires
Quiz question :
Where and when was the first ever movie with sound shown to a public audience ?
The answer : The El Ateneo bookstore , 1929 .
Of course , this gorgeous building in central Buenos Aires was n’t always a bookstore .
It started its life in 1919 as the Teatro Grand Splendid ; more than 1,000 patrons would fill the theater to watch operas and tango performances .
In 1928 this space was converted into a cinema .
It has been a bookstore since 2000 .
Happily , the El Ateneo architects included many homages to the building ’s theater days including curtains and stage lighting .
There ’s also a wonderful cafe up on the “ stage . ”
Add to that plush seating areas and a huge selection of literature and you have what is by far the best bookstore in South America , arguably the most luxurious in the world , and # 4 on coolest - looking bookstore list .

# 5 Shakespeare & Co. Antiquarian Books
Paris
If you ’ve seen the movie Before Sunset you ’ve seen the inside of the Shakespeare & Co. Antiquarian bookstore — this is where Julie Delpy ’s character reunited with Ethan Hawke ’s during a book signing .
If you ’ve read Time Was Soft There : A Paris Sojourn at Shakespeare & Co. ( and if you have n’t you should ) then you are intimately familiar with this bookstore .
Time Was Soft
There is the lusciously - written memoir of a homeless man who was allowed to sleep overnight in Shakespeare &
Co by the store ’s communist - leaning owner and then refused to vacate when times turned more capitalist .
His bed is still there ( see pic , below ) .
But even if you ’ve never seen the Shakespeare & Co. Antiquarian bookstore in the movies , or read about it in books , you ’ll step through the store ’s doorway and sense that this is the sort of quaint , quirky place that should be in cinema and literature .
The isles are piled with books .
The writer ’s room has a working piano for patrons to play .
Poets regularly read their work in one of the back rooms .
And if you ca n’t get to Paris personally then at least visit the store ’s supremely well done website — poking around it is almost as much fun as poking around the store itself .

# 6 El Péndulo
Mexico City
Originally this post was envisioned as a list of five bookstores .
We had to expand it to six in order to squeeze in Polanco branch of El Péndulo .
This bookstore is n’t as amazingly stunning or history - filled as the above five selections are .
But it is bright , spacious , huge and gloriously plant - filled .
Plus the store ( and attached cafe ) is n’t shy about using air conditioning , which makes El Péndulo a wonderful literary escape on a hot Mexican day .

This is a phenomenon that cuts across class lines , cultural lines and even hard - to - cross political lines in the US .
There are conservative Christian homesteading families who grow their own because they believe God has called them to do so and leftist hippies meditating as they plant their salad greens .
People who think that climate change is real and people who think it is all a conspiracy meet together to share an order of baby ducklings and rhapsodize about homemade sourdough .
Maccabeus is a Great Pyrenees dog , which means he 's the size of a pony and looks a little like a cross between a polar bear and a lion .
His job is to protect the livestock on my farm , and he takes this job very seriously .
He 's also a giant sweet - natured marshmallow that loves every living thing with passion and energy , and a still - growing puppy who does n't quite realize he weighs more than 100 pounds .
All of which sort of explains why I was out in the freezing yard , ankle - deep in mud , wrestling a spit - covered and peeved - looking Angora rabbit out of my dog 's paws .
As best I can tell , sometime in the night Mac had accidentally knocked over one of the bunny hutches , and onto the porch popped a fluffy rabbit ( whose coat will eventually become a scarf ) .
Mac recognized that this was not how things were supposed to be and did good work ensuring that the rabbit not escape under the gate or get eaten by predators .
Having captured the rabbit , he expressed his love for it ... apparently for hours .
Pyrs are a drooly breed .
I carried the sopping wet , muddy bunny into the bathroom , where I dumped him in the tub so he could warm up and dry off before going back outside .
I gave him water , oats , and an apple slice , washed off my muddy feet , and began to get ready to milk the goats , feed the chickens , ducks , and turkeys , and then start seeds for spring .
After that I 've got some apples turning mealy that need to be canned up for applesauce , wool to spin into yarn , and a barn to clean .
Oh , and a rabbit to detangle .
I might as well clip the other Angoras as well while I 'm at it .
And THEN the usual homeschooling , cooking , and cleaning .
I was not raised on a farm .
My parents or grandparents were NOT farmers .
My husband comes NOT from farming people but from an apartment in New Jersey .
Both of us are overeducated people who trained for firmly non-agrarian careers : my husband teaches astrophysics and I used to teach Shakespeare and early modern poetry .
Even I find it reasonable when people ask me why it is I 'm digging in the dirt all day , instead of all the other things that I could be doing .
Heck , on mornings that involve spit - soaked rabbits before my tea , I may even agree with them that it seems crazy .
If my life is a little nuts , and it may be , I 'm not the only woman out there who has consciously chosen a crazy subsistence life .
Among professional farmers , the only fast - growing segment of American agriculture is independent women farmers .
The state of Pennsylvania alone , which lost 2,000 farms in the net last decade , added nearly 1,000 farms run by women .
But with only just over 1 percent of Americans working on farms , we can't get a sense of the scope of women 's participation in self - sufficiency projects looking only at professional farmers .
There 's a real sea change occurring in the relationship everyone has to food , especially the primary provisioners .
From 2007 to 2009 , for example , there were an estimated 2 million new vegetable gardens grown in the U.S. alone , and while it is hard to know exactly how often women are the primary or collaborative gardeners , previous evidence suggests that women constitute about 60 percent of all gardeners .
There has also been a boom in backyard chicken keeping and other forms of small - scale husbandry , and a return to home baking , jam making , and preserving .
Some people attribute this to growing concerns about ethics and safety in food supplies , others to a new back - to - the - land movement .
It is undeniable that movies like Food , Inc. and books like Michael Pollan 's The Omnivore 's Dilemma and Barbara Kingsolver 's Animal , Vegetable , Miracle have made it harder for people to be unconscious about their food choices .
Now that everyone is talking about carbon footprints and we 've all heard that we burn ten calories of oil to get every calorie of food we eat , the logical next step is to change this .
For many people , safe food is something that you have to either get locally or grow yourself .
Taking care of our families got more complicated as we learned more about our food system - but we also started to find some of the deep appeal of doing things for ourselves .
I know a lot of these women .
My other job , besides farming , is writing about food , small - scale agriculture , energy , and environmental issues .
More than 60 percent of my readership is female , and almost all of them are involved with their food at some level , whether planting gardens and raising backyard chickens , doing serious farming or preserving and putting up their own .
And they are n't doing it because they feel guilty , but because they love it .
In a recent New York Times article , Peggy Orenstein wrote about the ways that backyard chickens have become ubiquitous , and argued that for women with coops and compost , raising food is a way out of the Mommy wars , the trap that offers women the choice of corporate labor and coming home to do all the housework or staying home and being accused of wasting their time and educations wiping noses and behinds .
In this , she builds on the work of Shannon Hayes , author of Radical Homemakers , who argues that for women caught between two unpalatable choices - a career with a heavy domestic burden or an isolating life as a stay - at - home parent - this offers a meaningful third way .
Orenstein wonders if there 's something fundamentally precious about middle - and upper - class women building chicken coops and thinking about food .
In this , I think she echoes concerns expressed by a lot of people : is this preoccupation with dinner really important ?
Should n't we be doing something else bigger , more substantial ?
Caitlin Flanagan recently wrote a screed against school gardens in the Atlantic , arguing that we can't afford to waste precious educational time on something as intellectually unimportant as dinner .
Other people wonder why anyone would stand over a canning kettle or scrub their own floors , shovel manure , or milk a cow when someone else will do it for you .
I think Orenstein 's focus on upper - middle - class trendsetters ends up being distracting - most of the people I see raising food are doing it because they can't afford to eat the way they want to any other way .
And while we tend to erase what how we eat by putting it in the category of " personal choice " and thus insignificant , 300 million personal choices add up to a lot .
I think it is telling that during wars or times of crisis , campaigns are mounted to get people to grow Victory gardens and reduce food waste - precisely because these activities are n't purely personal , but deeply political .
In the era of climate change , this does n't seem to need much arguing .
Of the half of all the world 's food that is produced by women , the majority of it comes from small farms and backyard gardens .
Most of those women are impoverished , and they are the people most victimized by climate change impacts and rising food prices .
It is n't easy to figure out how to deal with the complex system of our dependencies on corporations and the harm we do to the poor , but this is one solution , a way of saying " well , at least my dinner will be as honest as I can make it . "
Perhaps that 's why this cuts across class lines , cultural lines , and even hard - to - cross political lines in the U.S.
There are conservative Christian homesteading families who grow their own because they believe God has called them to do so and leftist hippies meditating as they plant their salad greens .
People who think that climate change is real and people who think it is all a conspiracy meet together to share an order of baby ducklings and rhapsodize about homemade sourdough .
Teenagers and their grandmothers can talk canning , low - income neighbors can share produce , seniors can offer their memories of days when subsistence work was ordinary .
Along with more independence , what emerges is an inter-dependence .
This interdependence is the most important aspect of all , and the reason why the slimy bunny is just one more piece of the puzzle - we talk about self - sufficiency , but that 's not the central point .
It is wonderful to eat a meal that came from your proud labor , to enjoy the exquisite taste of homegrown , but the exercise of learning to produce your own is fundamentally collaborative - whether you are working a community garden plot or shopping the farmer 's market , sharing a recipe or bartering eggs for grass - fed beef .
What emerges is a connectedness - a connection to the past , to everyone 's grandmother and the women that fed us before , to the women who tend their flocks and gardens all over the world , and to other women , here and now , slowly becoming less dependent on corporations and more dependent on each other .
Everyone knows that Lionel Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney are the star men for their sides – here are six more relatively unsung heroes that could be crucial for their respective teams .
Yoann Gourcuff , France
Who is he ?
The new Zidane .
Or , more realistically , a fantastically intelligent and skilful 23 - year - old playmaker who has returned to form at Bordeaux after struggling to make an impact at Milan .
Why should we watch him ?
France ’s new 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 formation means he is playing in a different role that he is slightly unaccustomed to , but the new shape also means he does n’t have the sole burden of playmaking , as he did in France ’s 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 .
Ribery is off - form and Malouda is complaining about his new position , so Gourcuff ’s creativity might be vital .
Matias Fernandez , Chile
Who is he ?
A small 24 - year - old attacking midfielder , a great dribbler and a dead ball specialist .
Has struggled for playing time at Sporting Lisbon since his move last summer .
Why should we watch him ?
Chile ’s exciting 3 - 3 - 1 - 3 formation means he plays a crucial playmaking role behind the front three , but the strange nature of the wing - backs means he often gets a surprising amount of space between the lines , and finds himself with plenty of options in the attacking third .
Georgos Karagounis , Greece
Who is he ?
The veteran captain of Greece , who has just won the league title with Panathinaikos , their first since 2004 .
Plays as an attacking midfielder , looking to pick the ball up in spare wherever he can .
Also an excellent set - piece taker , both when shooting directly at goal and crossing for teammates .
Why should we watch him ?
He can really get Greece playing , and visibly inspires others when he takes charge of a game .
At 33 he plays a more reserved role than at his peak , but remains one of the most intelligent passers of a football in Europe .
Gerardo Torrado , Mexico
Who is he ?
31 - year - old Mexican captain .
Is capable of getting stuck in in the central midfield area , but his main attribute is his passing range – if he was a decade younger , he’d be called “ The Mexican Xavi ” .
Why should we watch him ?
Mexico ’s flexible system seems to give him a lot of time and space when on the ball , and with Mexico playing an attack - minded front three with very offensive wing - backs / full - backs ( depending on the formation ) Torrado hits both steady short - range passes and spectacular long - range ones .
Mesut Ozil , Germany
Who is he ?
A third - generation Turk who has made a huge impact for Werder Bremen this season .
Still only 21 , he ’s a busy left - footed playmaker who has added a goal threat to his game .
Why should we watch him ?
He ’ll be given a vital role in the centre of the pitch in Germany ’s 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , and playing ahead of two talented passers , should be receiving the ball in dangerous positions in and around the penalty area .
He can pass , shoot and dribble and is very difficult to stop .
Marek Hamsik , Slovakia
Who is he ?
Napoli ’s tough but creative attacking midfielder .
The 22 - year - old has been tremendous for the past three seasons , and is attracting interest from all the usual suspects .
Why should we watch him ?
Because he ’s Slovakia ’s most talented player by far .
Even when not having a great game , he always comes looking for the ball , and is a real goalscoring threat from midfield .
The pace of Stock and Weiss on the wings should stretch the play , and give Hamsik room to work his magic .

Advanced Micro Devices today announced its latest Opteron processor , the 4100 family , aimed at the mid-market concerned with power efficiency and performance per watt .
It fills out the Opteron server line just below the eight - and 16 - core “ Magny - Cours ” line for high - end users .
Coming in below AMD ’s high - end Magny - Cours design , the Opteron 4100 is aimed at x86 server customers concerned with power efficiency and long - term compatibility .
Developed under the codename “ Lisbon , ” the Opteron 4100 line is the definition of an entry level part , as the cheapest model will sell for just $ 99 for quantities of a thousand or more .
Lisbon is a four - or six - core processor with clock speeds ranging from 1.7GHz to 2.8GHz , and power envelops as low as 32 watts and as high as 75 watts .
Wattage and clock speed are , not surprisingly , tied together — the faster the clock , the higher the power .
With the new line , AMD ( NYSE : AMD ) is targeting markets especially concerned with efficient power use , according to Gina Longoria , senior product manager for servers and workstations at AMD .
“ We ’re showing the world ’s lowest power per core processor , which is great for a hyperscale and datacenter perspective .
You ’re able to get full server - class computing at extremely low power levels , ” she told InternetNews.com .
The 4100 series is part of AMD ’s “ San Marino ” platform of one or two processor configurations for workstations , Web , cloud and infrastructure servers .
San Marino features a new CPU socket , called C32 , which upgrades AMD ’s rather aged Socket F to support dual channel DDR3 memory .
AMD has gotten a lot of mileage out of Socket F , providing several generations of Opteron chips that were socket - compatible over the years .
A nice upside surprise for server buyers is that AMD ’s upcoming Fusion processor family will be socket - compatible with Opteron 4100 servers .
The Opteron 4100 features an updated core architecture which AMD calls the Direct Connect Architecture 2.0 . DCA 2.0 consists of the complete AMD Virtualization ( AMD - V ) technology with IOMMU and extended migration capabilities , AMD - P power management , HyperTransport 3.0 with two 16 x links for transferring data at up to 6.4 gigatransfers per link , and the DDR3 controller .
DDR3 means speeds up to 1333MHz , an improvement over DDR2 ’s 800 Mhz speed , and transfer speeds of up to 21.3 GB per second of bandwidth .
AMD took a lot of features like PCI slots and legacy ports out of the motherboard , which brings in significant power savings .
In an idle state , it can reduce power by up to 62 watts when compared against the prior generation , the “ Istanbul ” generation of Opteron processors .
AMD is launching with Dell ( NASDAQ : DELL ) as its first tier one partner , with more to come .
Both IBM and HP also offer Opteron - powered servers .

EATING seafood these days comes with a catch .
With three - quarters of the world 's oceans overfished or fished right up to their limits and 18 out of the 98 fish stocks assessed by the federal government considered as ' ' overfished ' ' or '' subject to overfishing ' ' , buying is becoming harder for those concerned with sustainability .
On ice ... overfishing has put many fish on the threatened species list .
Credit : Jacky Ghossein
Last month Greenpeace released a damning study of canned tuna brands sold in Australian supermarkets .
It found most were poorly labelled or contained overfished species such as yellowfin .
The best fish to eat , according to conservationists , are species that reproduce quickly , are still in good supply and are caught using methods that minimise by - catch and damage to the ocean floor .
Report of Insane Bike / Car Road Rage Incident ( Involving Assault With Axe Body Spray ) Today
There 's road rage .
And then there 's absolutely WTF .
Portlander Joe Keshishian called in today to describe a road rage incident he says happened to him on NE MLK and San Rafael .
Keshishian says he was crossing MLK east to west on his bike when a black car pulled up so close behind him that it bumped his back wheel .
According to Keshishian , the driver then sped around him , flipping him off and zooming past him .
Keshishian shouted , " Fuck you ! " at the driver and then caught up with him at a stoplight .
Assault with Axe
" He stopped his car and got out , saying , ' You think the road belongs to you , self - righteous prick ! '
He 's holding something in his hand and I realize it's a can of deodorant , that Axe body spray stuff , " says Keshishian .
" I held up my bike lock to defend myself and he proceeds to wail on me with the deodorant ! "
Keshishian says the man struck him with the can in the head and arms before pushing him over , off his bike .
As Keshishian lay there on the ground , he says guy lifted up his bike and threw it on him before getting into his car and driving off .
Several people saw the alleged assault , one snapping a photo of the car ( which is below the cut ) .
Keshishian is shaken up , but okay with just small scrapes on his elbows and a tacoed bike wheel .
He filed a report with the Portland police and is expecting to get in contact with a bike lawyer to figure out whether he should press charges .
" He just had this rage , this intense hatred ! " says Keshishian .

NEW YORK – As Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s budget axe continues to hang over public workers and services – threatening schools and students , libraries , parks and virtually everything else on which New Yorkers rely – the city ’s labor movement , residents , and now a large section of the City Council is pushing to the top of the agenda another way to resolve the budget crisis : tax the rich .
The councilmembers want to increase taxes on people who make more than $ 250,000 by 0.6 percent and raise taxes on those earning over $ 500,000 by 1.2 percent .
That would bring more than $ 1 billion in revenue for the city .
“ Wall Street had a profit of $ 61 billion last year – $ 61 billion – and they were bailed out by the average taxpayer ’s dollars , ” said Councilmember Daniel Dromm , who represents Jackson Heights , Elmhurst and other parts of northwest Queens .
Dromm is a member of the council ’s Progressive Caucus , formed earlier this year to fight for progressive values and combat Bloomberg , a mayor who has often , in the words of caucus co-chair Brad Lander , “ undermined grassroots democracy . ”
So far , 12 of the city ’s 51 council members have joined the caucus .
The caucus commissioned a study to determine exactly how New Yorkers want the city ’s nearly $ 5 billion budget deficit filled .
According to the study , 89 percent of New Yorkers favor protecting public services by increasing taxes on those with higher incomes .
Only 11 percent of respondents were in favor of balancing the budget through service cuts .
The survey asked people how they felt about several deficit - reduction proposals in the Bloomberg budget .
The vast majority of these proposals were overwhelmingly rejected in the court of public opinion .
But Bloomberg has different plans .
According to an op - ed written by Lander and Melissa Mark - Viverito , a council member who represents East Harlem and who is the caucus ’s other co-chair , “ Thousands of low and moderate - income families could find themselves hit by budget cuts on multiple levels and across generations – in just one low - income area in Brooklyn , two child - care centers , a senior center , a health clinic and a public pool are all on the chopping block . ”
According to Dromm , the caucus ’s tax plans would shift the burden of the crisis off the backs of lower - to moderate - income working people to those who can comfortably pay a little bit more .
He suggested that , with the tax hikes of about a percentage point on those making more than $ 250,000 , it would be possible to raise $ 1 billion extra while eliminating all city income taxes on those making less than $ 40,000 per year .
The Progressive Caucus has also proposed other methods of raising the rest of the funding .
They include closing loopholes for hedge funds and private equity managers , which would raise up to $ 200 million ; removing insurance companies ’ tax exemptions , raising up to $ 250 million ; and eliminating tax breaks for vacant residential lots , raising nearly $ 80 million .
The biggest revenue generator that they have proposed , and one supported by more than half of New Yorkers , is a $ 0.007 per share tax on stock trades , which would bring in about $ 2 billon .
Those who support these measures argue that they need to be in place for this year , but , even more importantly for the future .
Next year ’s budget deficit is forecast to be worse than the current one .
Many of these proposals would require state approval , which would be likely if Bloomberg were to lobby for them in Albany , the state capital .
However , that is highly unlikely , said Dromm , so “ we have to create enough of a campaign with people power to force the issue . ”
“ People power ” was on display this past week at the Save Our City rally initiated by AFSCME District Council 37 and the United Federation of Teachers , and attended by participants from dozens of other unions , community groups and religious organizations .
Dromm was quick to point out that the unions did most of the organizing for the rally .
But he noted that the Progressive Caucus “ supportive of that effort , ” and “ were somewhat involved in organizing it as well , and we need more demonstrations like that until we win this battle . ”

Angelo Mike noted a strange aspect of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 : before being broken , the students had made an exceptionally organized life for themselves — a cell of ordered liberty on so - called public property in a totalitarian society .
For a brief time , they lived and experienced the possibility of self - organized social order but failed to see the implications .
So it is whenever people are confronted with the need to make sense of government - owned space ( public property ) .
Without formal law or title , they assume a kind of ownership of the space through a form of homesteading .
Think of annual parades , gatherings before sports or music events , or any other place where the property is common in name only .
The same groups somehow manage to meet year after year in the same spot and hold it for themselves .
In practice , the space — limited by the uses to which its temporary owners put it — is treated as if it were owned by the individuals who use it .
Why is this ?
What does this imply for economics and politics ?
In the Lockeo - libertarian tradition , homesteading is a means to establish an initial claim to a scarce resource .
It consists of the exercise of purposeful action over nature .
The resource is usually land , but it can extend to bodies of water and also animals .
One of the rules of homesteading is that you have to mix your labor with the resource if you are going to claim to own it .
This is perfectly reasonable and intuitively correct .
Christopher Columbus can't show up to North America and declare that he owns it all anymore than the first settler in space can claim to own the galaxy .
The resource must be put to specific use by the claimant .
Today , we rarely see real homesteading in action because much of the land we see already has a legitimate owner .
But we do observe many types of informal homesteading , the practice of which underscores the universality of the idea of ownership .
Let us consider a common example : a day at the beach .
When people head to the beach , they bring chairs , set up umbrellas and roll out towels .
Once their things are in order they have effectively homesteaded that area of the beach for as long as they stay .
The area under their tutelage extends beyond the perimeter of their initial space .
Given cultural and density constraints , groups do not usually set up their belongings right next to one another .
Rather , some breathing space is left for personal comfort and to allow others to walk between groups .
So how much space is legitimate ?
Imagine you are standing at the check out lane at the grocery store and the person in front of you turns around and says , " By the way , I am holding 10 spaces behind me . "
The response would be :
The heck you do !
How about if you are searching for a seat at a theater and are told by one person that he is holding an entire row for some friends who are late ?
Or what if some guy wants to prevent people from parking in a lot because he says he is using every space when there are no cars there ?
In each case , we instinctively recognize the absurdity of those claims .
Homesteading stands on solid ground yet its practical application can often be a gray area .
The Case of Mardi Gras
The last weekend of Mardi Gras is well known for the influx of tourists .
Some might travel there to drink heavily , others to observe or participate in the debauchery , and others to enjoy the parades and admire the floats .
Whatever their reason for traveling to the Big Easy one thing is certain : it is crowded .
And since the parades roll down major avenues , the median ( called " neutral ground " by the locals ) gets packed with revelers and the problem of land scarcity is exacerbated .
There are tens of thousands of people competing for a relatively small amount of space .
To make things worse , many Mardi Gras enthusiasts , particularly the residents , often camp early and set aside space to watch the parades later , homesteading their spot .
Mardi Gras tradition has established that anyone who wants to reserve a space on a parade route must do so by setting down a useful and accepted carnival good .
Generally , people use tarps , chairs , ladders , grills , or coolers .
Let 's return to the hypothetical avaricious homesteader who wishes to claim large spaces for himself .
Suppose that he rolls out a piece of tarp that is 100 feet long and 20 feet wide .
Further , assume that he is alone .
Just as the farmer cannot simply claim he owns land that he himself has not used , our greedy parade watcher does not have a proper claim to the entire area under the large tarp .
What happens with bogus claims ?
Other groups of people would ( and do indeed ) see through the farce and call him on it .
They could very well order him to release most of the space he has falsely claimed as his own .
Other enforcement techniques could go further .
Competing groups could disregard the egregious exaggeration and simply use the wasted space .
It could very well come to the use of force .
But this would be rare , unnecessary , and counterproductive : a rogue homesteader would have to continually battle with everyone else .
These norms did not occur due to legislation or special mandate .
Over the years , people recognized the legitimacy of the first user , the homesteader .
Today , the preoccupation is no longer about whether one can homestead a piece of land to watch parades .
The worry is about getting there early to be the first one and enjoy the show .
The Case of Tailgating
Tailgating is the practice of gathering together with friends before a sports event to eat , drink , and talk until the game begins , and sometimes to watch the game on television if people find themselves too inebriated to walk to the sports ' event .
They sometimes arrive a day in advance , driving their travel trailers and preparing for the long haul .
Far from being a mere picnic , this is a huge institution with a tradition that dates far back .
Vast sums are spent on food , special clothing , decorations , electronic contraptions , transportation , special grills and refrigeration equipment — all in the interest of tailgating .
The tailgaters gather at spots public and private .
The private interests sell space to them for profit .
The public authorities permit them to homestead the space because they are pressured to do so by public opinion .
But it is far from being a free for all .
Tailgating groups constitute private clubs and they congregate in the same space week after week in the football season , and year after year , even for decades .
The groups manage themselves as clubs , with rules letting people in or out of the group .
Some are run like dictatorships and other like democracy , but , in each case , the members consent to the management structure .
The space they occupy is as large as necessary for the group , which usually consists of between five and thirty people .
Each group claims a space by putting up a tent , parking a trailer , or setting up a large screen television with chairs in front .
A claimant who insisted on possessing more than is necessary is quickly set straight by other would - be claimants of this scarce space .
There are enforcement mechanisms to keep people out .
Interlopers are scolded , shunned , and sometimes blasted with exhaust fumes and horn blasts .
In the culture of tailgating , people have a surprisingly certain sense of ownership , and even others are willing to assist in the enforcement of order lest their own homesteading assumptions come to be challenged .
Year after year , it comes to be known that certain allocations belong to certain tailgating groups .
Here is the Jones group .
There is the Smith group .
There is the Jefferson group .
Surprisingly , these homesteading rights are even transferable .
If one group falls apart or fails to come together one year , another would - be claimant is notified and given permission to use the space .
This pattern of ownership repeats itself over many acres and even miles of property , with lots of various sizes and shapes honeycombing all available space .
To watch a town be transformed in a matter of hours , from unoccupied to completely occupied , and do so in an orderly fashion , without any titles to property being issued , and conflict kept to a minimum , is a thing of enormous beauty , a testament to the capacity of people to organize themselves in the absence of central planner , formalized rules , formal title , or even the opportunity to trade their property at a profit .
So the Lockean rule about mixing one 's labor should conjure up no great controversy .
It is a principle that is practiced on a regular basis .
When public property is truly in demand , it is effectively privatized by the actions of individuals who understand that ownership precedes order .
And their claims , however temporary or intertemporally elaborate , are reasonable and enforced by widely accepted norms : what Rothbard called the Relevant Technological Unit , the size of which depends on the type of good or resource in question .
The reality of informal homesteading also illustrates that the concept of ownership is not something that must be imposed by the state or even law .
It is built into the very fabric of human action in a world of scarce resources , and it requires massive force to undo .
Conjure up visions of equality and collective sharing if you must but in the real world , property and ownership are part of the way we think , act , and get along in the world .
