And the Barclays deal has defenders on the authority ’s governing board .
“ It ’s not like Taco Bell saying it wants Grand Army Plaza or something like that , ” said John H. Banks III , a board member since 2004 .
Would Mr. Banks oppose that idea ?
“ A year and a half ago ?
Yeah , ” he said .
“ Tomorrow ?
No . ”
Still , while selling station names could bring the authority revenue it needs , advertising experts say companies may not be as well - served .
“ To be effective , the viewer needs to understand the relevance of the ad , ” said Allen Adamson of Landor , a branding firm .
“ To rename the 59th and Lex stop the McDonald ’s stop  it ai n’t going to work .
I do n’t think it will stick . ”
Indeed , other cities have tried this with little success .
Boston , for example , tried auctioning off four historic stations a few years ago and received no bids .
Though Citigroup paid $ 400 million to sponsor the new Mets stadium in Queens , the company refused to pay the authority to rename the stop nearby , which is now known as Mets / Willets Point .
To determine its asking price for the Brooklyn station , the authority studied a few successful efforts , like a monorail in Las Vegas named for Nextel , the communications company , and streetcars in Tampa , Fla. , named for a local electric utility .
And the popularity of the station  the second - busiest in Brooklyn last year  was taken into account .
“ It ’s grounded in reasonable business practices , ” Mr. Banks said .
“ Obviously Van Siclen on a No. 2 is not going to be as valuable to a corporate entity as Atlantic Avenue . ”
The station name change is scheduled for the opening of the arena , timed for 2012 .
The exact punctuation of the new station name has yet to be determined , the authority said , although hyphens or slashes are likely to be used .
New signage would be paid for by Forest City Ratner , and the authority plans to introduce the revised name gradually in maps and timetables after the arena opens .

Dear Community ,
As some of you have heard , we had a layoff at Openmoko on Monday , May 25th .
First of all let me second the comments made here congratulating the Openmoko team on all that was accomplished .
And let me add that everything accomplished was only possible because of the amazing efforts of the community .
Bringing the Neo products to market , first the 1973 and then the Freerunner , has been the most exceptional experience of our lives .
I can undeniably say that the most important thing we have learned over these years is that the power of people bound by ideals , rather than contracts , cannot be underestimated .
These phones are your success .
From simple things like group sales to complex undertakings like developing and maintaining entire distributions , you made this happen .
You always came through for us .
As CEO , I have to determine the best path forward for our phone business .
And after long discussions with my key people and Board , we 've decided that the best path foreword is to turn the future of the Freerunner over to the community .
We 've always said that the talent and creativity of those outside the company is superior to that inside the company .
We have stuck to these principles .
We 've have opened up more than any other phone , from any other company , in the history of this industry .
Every time we chose openness over internal control , we have been rewarded .
Former Openmoko employees have already started redesigning the Freerunner hardware ( gta02 - core ) using only Free Software tools .
Werner Almesberger , working with many others , has made great progress .
Recently , we have released more information to accelerate their efforts .
In the coming weeks , all the design information will be handed over to the community along with all of openmoko.org ( Wiki , GIT , Trac , Planet , ... ) .
Openmoko Inc. then will act as the sponsor of this effort .
We will continue to fund all necessary server infrastructure and support , in areas where corporate help is needed , future open phone development .
( Parts of this process will require legal work - so I request your patience . )
I am extremely excited about the idea of an entirely community - built open phone .
Especially since , when the next design is complete , it will have the benefits of everything uncovered since the Freerunner shipped last July .
It will be buzz free , glamo free , and free of the recamping bug ( # 1024 ) - which I am happy to announce has been solved this past week .
We promise to support these efforts with additional resources such as components to build prototypes of the new design .
We will help to empower you to build the open phone of our future .
After all this , there is one last thing that Openmoko the company can do : we can enable the community to use the Openmoko brand and trademark for these efforts .
For us , the Openmoko brand is synonymous with the people who built the products : Harald , Mickey , Werner , Raster , all of my coworkers in our Taiwan office , Sureda , Tuxbrain , Bearstech , and countless others .
I personally want to give an extra special thanks to Steve Mosher who has taught me so much about marketing , writing , and well ... life .
Without his guidance , this all would have only been an idea in my notebook .
I have asked Steve to lead an effort , over the next few weeks , to gather input from the community on how best to implement this transition .
( He will follow up shortly on the community mailing list . )
As always we can expect some negative comments , that comes with the territory .
But we believe a community that owns everything of importance , with regard to the Freerunner , will focus efforts and energies on the future - not the past .
Sales of the current FreeRunner ( A7 ) , will continue as before .
We have plenty more in stock .
Now that the phone is freed , and its future entrusted to the hands of the community , Openmoko Inc. will start another effort on an altogether different type of device .
We 've sized our company to go do that task .
Please wish us the very best of luck !
More details will follow in the coming months ...
Sincerely , Sean Moss - Pultz
This Thursday , for a second time , the G - 20 leaders in London will embrace free trade and commit themselves to avoiding protectionist measures , just as they did four months ago in Washington .
Their efforts will likely fail .
Not that they have n’t failed already , mind you .
According to a report by the World Bank , several countries implemented trade - restricting measures after the G - 20 November meeting , including 17 countries that were in the meeting .
And although the scope and depth of these measures is small relative to the size of the world market , they bode poorly for the near future .
However , it is not that the G - 20 leaders are hypocritical .
I think that most of them agree that trade is , in general , actually good for their countries and benefits the majority of the population .
So what ’s going on ?
Well … politics .
In properly working democracies the president or the prime minister cannot just do what he or she wants .
The legislative branch often interferes in the presidential decision making process –as we see happening plenty nowadays in the US Congress .
Some would argue for the better , others for the worse , but then that ’s the classic democratic separation of powers in action .
Additionally , these also are not normal times , which only make things more difficult .
The economic crisis has exacerbated economic nationalism .
As people lose jobs they become angry and look for someone to blame .
First on the list usually are all things foreign , followed by large corporations .
Take a look at the Mexican trucks dispute in the US , where a pilot program allowing trucks to enter the US has ended in part to protect the jobs of Teamster truck drivers .
Some congressmen are keen to capitalize on these feelings and pander to those constituents making the most noise .
While doing so , they make consensus a difficult task , affecting governability and presidential maneuverability .
Sadly , we ’ll see things get worse before they get better , as the economic crisis persists –and it will .
This is dangerous , of course .
Protectionism favors specific industries and specific people , usually backed by powerful lobbies and strong unions .
Free trade , on the contrary , benefits most industries and the majority of people , rich and poor alike , but it lacks the big and organized defenders .
Now , do n’t expect this argument to stick in Congress , even if your president is the one saying it .

Iran restored access to Facebook yesterday after a block on the social networking website last week generated accusations that the government was trying to muzzle one of the main presidential campaign tools of the reformist opposition .
Facebook was cut off on Saturday , depriving challengers to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of a critical means of reaching out for the youth vote in the 12 June election .
The main pro-reform candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , is seeking a strong turnout from young voters and has used Facebook to try to mobilise support .
Authorities have not directly commented on the Facebook outage and the reason for its return was not immediately clear .
It is not known whether the renewed access is permanent .
In the past , Iranian authorities have restored then reimposed blocks on websites .
Iranian authorities often block specific sites and blogs considered critical of the Islamic regime .
Critics said the shutdown of Facebook forced Iranians to rely on the government for information , depriving the election debate of important independent voices .
More than half of Iranians were born after the 1979 Islamic revolution and young voters make up a huge bloc – which helped the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , to back - to - back victories in 1997 and 2001 .
But the youth vote failed to rally strongly behind Ahmadinejad 's opponent , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , four years ago .
Young voters are now strongly courted by Mousavi as the possible swing factor .
An aide to Mousavi said over the weekend that the Facebook block was a reaction to a major pro-Mousavi rally on Saturday in a Tehran sports stadium that included an appearance by Khatami and many young people waving green banners and scarves – the symbolic colour of the Mousavi campaign .
Making < time > safe for historians
The HTML 5 spec introduces the < time > element to mark up a date or time .
Although I support the inclusion of these semantics in HTML , I believe that the current specification of the < time > element is vague because it avoids the question whether the element is safe for historians .
Right now it hurts historical research more than it helps .
In this entry I ’ll explain why .
Although I will concentrate on the HTML5 syntax here , what I have to say also applies to the microformats datetime design pattern .
The Microformats site adds one important detail to the discussion that the HTML5 spec overlooks : the point of having a < time > element ( or a datetime design pattern ) at all :
Use the datetime - design - pattern to make datetimes that are human readable also formally machine readable .
Who needs machine readable dates ?
As far as I can see there are two target audiences for this operation .
The first is obviously social applications that have to work with dates , and where it can be useful to compare dates of two different events .
An app must be able to see if two events fall on the same day and warn you if they do .
However , as a target audience social applications are immediately followed by historians ( or historical , chronological applications ) .
After all , historians are ( dare I say it ? ) historically the most prolific users of dates , until they were upstaged by social applications .
This raises the question whether the < time > element should be tailored for historical use at all .
When I started writing this entry I was convinced that it should .
In keeping with the definition of its purpose I the see the < time > element as a tool for an Internet - wide chronological search - and - compare system .
Such a system will be a boon to historians , who would be allowed to quickly and easily look up events that happened around the same time as the event they ’re writing about .
In history , just as in other academic disciplines , serendipitous discoveries are the meat of exciting new theories .
A history - compliant use of the < time > element that allows automatic search and compare would broaden the horizons of historians .
However , now that I ’ve reviewed some of the more common problems that have to be solved in order to decrease potential harm , I ’m starting to doubt whether the < time > element can easily be made to fit history .
Right now , though , the specification is a vague compromise that does n’t make the < time > element useful for historical research , but still allows it to be used historically .
I feel this ambiguity should be removed .
I feel that the specification should clearly state whether the < time > element is meant for historical use or not .
The current vague , implied “ No ” should be changed to a clear answer .
I prefer Yes , but I can live with No .
If the < time > element should be made safe for historians , there ’s quite a bit of work to be done ; some of which is discussed in this article .
If it should not be made history - safe , we have to add a cut - off date to the specification .
Dates before this cut - off date would be ignored .
A cut - off date
The basic problem ( that we ’ll discuss in great detail below ) is that the current specification requires the use of the so - called proleptic Gregorian calendar .
Although that makes perfect sense in the modern age , it becomes progressively more pointless as we travel back in time , and somewhere in the late 16th century we reach the point that proleptic Gregorian dates become actively harmful to historical research .
The basic problem is that historians of the Middle Ages and earlier periods use Julian dates because that ’s what the documents of that era use .
If we ’d map them to proleptic Gregorian dates , as the specification demands , they would be worse than useless in any kind of automatic search - and - compare system .
Hundreds of years ’ worth of historical literature uses Julian dates if the people from the era it discusses did so , and therefore a system that uses proleptic Gregorian dates just does n’t find any matches .
The current specification acknowledges this problem — somewhat .
It says :
For dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar , authors are encouraged to not use the time element , or else to be very careful about converting dates and times from the period to the Gregorian calendar
A literal interpretation would have odd consequences .
If I ’d write about the secret negotiations between Louis XIV and Charles II to destroy the Dutch Republic in the early 1670s , I would be allowed to mark up the dates of Louis XIV ’s letters , but not those of Charles II ’s ones .
France used the Gregorian calendar back then , but England stuck to the Julian .
Such a rule is useless for historians .
Besides , it ’s just plain weird .
As to marking up Charles II ’s letters with Gregorian dates , that ’s possible , but it could lead to the same problems we discussed above : the generally accepted date for a letter might be Julian , in which case an automated search for the Gregorian date misfires dramatically .
So I believe this remark is incorrect and should be changed .
The specification should clearly and unambiguously state whether or not the < time > element is fit for historical use instead of trying to find a vague formula that avoids this basic question .
( I do n’t even understand why this question should be avoided .
It ’s a simple one , though the consequences of a Yes are pretty complicated . )
If the answer is No the specification should define a cut - off date that is the earliest date the < time > element ( or automatic search systems based on it ) accepts as valid .
Earlier dates are simply ignored by a compliant implementation .
That neatly avoids the bulk of the problems mentioned in this article , and makes sure that any historical use that falls within the constraints of the specification is actually useful .
Therefore , if historical use of the < time > element is to be disallowed , we MUST ( in the sense of RFC 2119 ) define a cut - off date .
Candidates
The most obvious candidate for a cut - off date is 1 January 1970 , the start of Unix Epoch time .
There ’s one problem , though : if we ’d cut off the < time > element there , many people alive today would n’t be able to mark up their birth dates .
Therefore I ’d like to propose 1 January 1870 instead .
Its relation to the start of the Unix Epoch is clear and it allows everybody alive today to mark up their dates of birth .
Besides , there ’s some vaguish historical justification for this date .
Around 1870 the final phase of European colonial imperialism started , which caused almost the entire world to be divided among the colonial powers .
Not coincidentally , this also caused the Gregorian calendar to spread to even the most obscure corners of the world , and it became a true world standard .
The only problem with that cut - off date would be that Russia still used the Julian calendar in 1870 and continued to do so until 1918 .
Moving the cut - off date to 1918 is possible , but it would mean a few of the very oldest people in the world would not be able to mark up their birth dates .
You may stop reading now
If you ’re convinced that the current specification of the < time > element should not be changed to accomodate historians , you can stop reading here .
The historical overview that follows is not important to you .
You should just :
make sure the specification clearly states that the < time > element is not meant for historical use .
take a decision on the cut - off date .
Thank you for your attention .
What historians need
If you ’re still with me , you ’re obviously interested in chronological problems .
You ’ll get what you want — in spades .
If the HTML5 < time > element is to be made safe for historical use , the specification MUST ( again in the sense of RFC 2119 ) allow
BC dates ( negative dates , in other words ) to be specified incomplete dates to be specified calendars other than ( proleptic ) Gregorian to be specified arbitrary year - naming systems to be specified
Furthermore :
The specification SHOULD allow the use of unambiguous dates that are not in the approved datetime format ; most importantly Easter .
The specification MUST NOT allow arithmetic operations on years before 300 BC .
Of these six rules , I believe that the first five are universal .
Although I will defend them by studying European history exclusively , I think that most other chronologies will be served by them , too .
The sixth rule is specific to European history ; other civilisations will have other cut - off dates for arithmetic operations .
In order to understand all this we have to review the history of dates .
There are two separate problems we have to discuss : the calendar ( i.e. the days and months of the year ) , and the names of the years .
The specification treats the first point vaguely , and ignores the second .
The Julian and Gregorian reforms
The solar year is about 365.2422 days long , which means it cannot be expressed in an integer number of days .
As history progressed , calendars became better at dealing with this problem .
For the purpose of our discussion , the Julian and Gregorian reforms are the most important .
The ancient Roman year was a mess .
It consisted of 12 months that spanned 355 days ; about 10 days too few .
The ancient Romans saw that their year was too short , and solved it by adding a so - called intercalary month , which was alternately 22 and 23 days long , to every second year .
In theory this led to an average year of 366.25 days ; about one day too long .
Unfortunately the decision whether to insert an intercalary month , and how long it was , was up to the Pontifex Maximus , the high priest of the state religion .
Some pontifices ( among which Caesar himself ) did n’t bother too much with this part of their duties .
In 46 BC Julius Caesar , meanwhile having become dictator for life , introduced the Julian calendar .
The months of the year got their modern number of days , and he also introduced the leap year every four years .
Thus , the average length of the calendar year became 365.25 days .
In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII updated the calendar because the Julian calendar ’s average year was slightly too long .
Therefore Gregory decreed that any year divisible by 100 would only become a leap year when it was also divisible by 400 .
This results in an average year of 365.2425 days .
Unfortunately , in 1582 the wars of religion raged in Europe , and the Protestants were not really eager to follow the directions of the Antichrist in Rome , especially if he happened to be right .
The Orthodox also had pressing ( and much older ) reasons to demonstratively ignore the papacy .
Therefore all Catholic countries switched to the new calendar within years , but the Protestant and Orthodox countries refused to follow .
Most Protestant countries went over in 1700 , when the wars of religion had become a vague memory and the actual difference between the two calendars acute .
After all , 1700 was the first year that was a leap year in the Julian calendar but not in the Gregorian one .
Nonetheless , England and Russia continued to use the Julian calendar until 1752 and 1918 , respectively .
( In fact , one Scottish island stubbornly refused to implement the Gregorian calendar until ten years ago or so .
The sheep might get confused . )
To this day , most Orthodox use the Julian calendar ( even though the Orthodox states use the Gregorian one , and some Orthodox churches use the so - called Revised Julian calendar ) .
That ’s why the Orthodox celebrate Christmas ( and sometimes Easter ) on different days than the Catholics and Protestants .
Proleptic Gregorian calendar
Currently the specification decrees the use of so - called proleptic Gregorian dates ; that is , the date a day would have had if the Gregorian calendar had already been in use back then .
Although this makes sense in the recent past , we ’ll see that this decree becomes more harmful the more we go back into history .
Although ( proleptic ) Gregorian makes perfect sense as a default , it MUST be possible to define another calendar .
The onus
Besides , there ’s the matter of onus .
Who , exactly , is responsible for mapping a Julian date to a proleptic Gregorian one ?
The HTML author or some kind of universal date - calculating system ?
In other words , if I , as an historian , talk about 18th century Julian dates , do I have to map them to the Gregorian calendar myself ( possibly by means of software I have to buy and install ) , or can I just trust an Internet - wide system to do so ?
Obviously I prefer the second solution because it ’s less work for me and will probably introduce less errors .
The Russian Revolution
Let ’s take a look at a practical example .
On 24 January 1918 Lenin signed a decree that moved the brand - new Soviet Union from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar .
In order to bridge the 14 - day gap between Julian and Gregorian , 1 - 13 February 1918 were omitted , so that 31 January was directly followed by 14 February .
Now how are we going to mark up this paragraph ?
Let ’s try the proleptic Gregorian calendar :
< p> On < time datetime = " 1918-02-06 " > 24 January 1918 </ time >
Lenin signed a decree that moved the brand - new Soviet Union from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar .
In order to bridge the 14 - day gap between Julian and Gregorian , 1 - 13 February 1918 were omitted , so that < time datetime = " 1918-02 -13 " > 31 January < / time > was directly followed by < time datetime =
" 1918-02 - 14 " > 14 February < / time >.</ p>
This remapping might be confusing for human and machine , but using Gregorian dates still makes sense , especially since the text is about Russia introducing the Gregorian calendar .
However , the 1 - 13 February 1918 bit is a problem .
They ’re dates , but they have never existed .
I think it ’s best not to mark them up at all .
Slightly more confusing is the following :
After the October revolution ( 25 October 1917 ) Russia became a communist state .
This date is Julian ; we ’ll have to map it to Gregorian , but the consequence is that the October revolution takes place in November .
Fortunately we ’re used to this fact ; most history books mention this oddity .
Medieval dates
The use of Julian datetime values becomes mandatory as we enter the Middle Ages .
So let ’s jump eight hundred years more into the past .
Jerusalem was conquered by the crusaders on 15 July 1099 , and a great slaughter was perpetrated among its inhabitants of all races and creeds .
According to the specification we ’d either have to use proleptic Gregorian dates or not use a datetime attribute at all .
Since I feel the second option invalidates the entire < time > element , I ’m forced to choose the first one :
< p>Jerusalem was conquered by the crusaders on < time datetime = " 1099-07-09 " > 15 July 1099 < / time > , and a great slaughter was perpetrated among its inhabitants of all races and creeds .
</ p>
The problem is that the proleptic Gregorian 9 July is worthless .
Every history book uses 15 July as the date of Jerusalem ’s conquest , so an online search by a program that parses datetime values would misfire dramatically .
More in general , medieval historians use whichever date system the people from that age actually used , and therefore all dates in all books about medieval history are Julian , and not proleptic Gregorian .
Because medieval historians use Julian dates , mapping medieval dates to proleptic Gregorian is going to cause widespread confusion .
The machine - readable dates will match those used in history books and source collections .
Thus , the misuse of the proleptic Gregorian calendar will actively hamper historical research instead of aiding it .
In the case of medieval ( and earlier ) history we MUST use Julian datetime values .
We do have to specify that fact , of course , which means we need an extra attribute , which I ’ve dubbed calendar for the moment :
< p>Jerusalem was conquered by the crusaders on < time datetime = " 1099 -07 - 15 " calendar= " Julian " > 15 July 1099 < / time > , and a great slaughter was perpetrated among its inhabitants of all races and creeds .
</ p>
Easter
Easter is an important date ; in fact during most of church history it was the most important holiday of the year .
It ’s not a fixed feast ; it is celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon after the first new moon that falls on or after the March equinox .
( The actual calculation is somewhat more complicated , but this definition will do for now . )
Thus , the definition of Easter depends on the definition of the March equinox .
In the Gregorian calendar it ’s 21 March , and in the Julian calendar it ’s also 21 March , but of course the two 21 Marches are several days apart , and if a new moon occurs in the gap between them , the Julian and Gregorian Easter dates will not match even after the Julian one is mapped to Gregorian .
( This rule still holds for the Orthodox church . )
Because it was so hard to calculate this most important date of the year , considerable ingenuity was applied to the job throughout late antiquity and the middle ages .
In fact , the very survival of chronological knowledge in the dark ages can be ascribed to the need to calculate Easter .
Every church had its paschal tables , which showed the dates for Easter ( as well as chronologically related feasts such as Good Friday and Pentecost ) .
When individual priests or monks started adding extra notes about important events to these tables , chronicles were born .
Concern over the slowly shifting date of Easter was what prompted Gregory XIII to institute his calendar reforms .
He wanted to make sure the modern Church celebrated Easter on the dates prescribed by the Council of Nicaea in 325 .
Easter is an exact date
Let ’s jump four more centuries back and take a look at a practical example .
On Easter 675 , a land dispute between Praejectus , bishop of Clermont , and Hector , count of Marseille , was heard before the royal court .
In order to properly mark up Easter 675 we have to first calculate Julian Easter 675 and then map this date to the proleptic Gregorian one .
A new moon may have occurred between Julian and Gregorian 21 March 675 , after all .
This calculation is not impossible , but the question is on whom the onus should rest .
The author , or some kind of centralised date system ?
( I , in any case , have not attempted to calculate the precise date . )
I feel the onus should be removed from the historian who wants to write about poor Praejectus and his murder and is not interested in HTML5 chronology .
Besides , “ Easter 675 ” is an exact date : both modern historians and people who actually lived in 675 will reach the same result when they calculate it .
The problem is that it ’s so very hard calculate , especially when you insist on the proleptic Gregorian date .
And once you ’ve found the correct result , it turns out nobody is interested .
So let ’s save ourselves a tough job and just do this :
< p> On < time datetime = " 0675 - Easter " calendar = " Julian " >
Easter 675 < / time > , a land dispute between Praejectus , bishop of Clermont , and Hector , count of Marseille , was heard before the royal court .
</ p>
Incomplete dates
This is how early medieval chronological reconstructions work :
The murder of bishop Praejectus probably took place on 26 January 676 .
We know for a fact he was still alive on Easter 675 , and his successor as bishop of Clermont is said to have ruled “ for fifteen years and a bit , ” and to have died in the reign of king Theodoric III .
Since Theodoric III died in April 691 , Praejectus ’ successor became bishop in early 676 at the latest .
Besides , St. Praejectus ’ feast is celebrated on 26 January ; and it is not unreasonable to assume it took place on the anniversary of his murder .
Early medieval historians are quite happy when they can pin such an exact date on an event ; and never mind that the date is Julian .
Now how are we going to mark up all this ?
There are several problems here :
26 January 676 for the murder is a conjectural date ( and Julian besides ) .
The exact date of death of king Theodoric III is unknown , but we know it took place in April 691 .
Praejectus ’s feast was celebrated every year on 26 January Julian , but after the switch to the Gregorian calendar it was celebrated on 26 January Gregorian .
The first date should be marked up fully .
After all it refers to an exact , specific date .
The third date would probably have to be marked up by a < time > element without a datetime attribute .
As to the second date , we MUST use < time datetime = " 0691 - 04 " calendar = " Julian " > , and never mind that that date is incomplete .
The fact that we know the month of Theodoric III ’s death makes this date more precise than most dates from that era .
Any machine - generated historical timeline tool MUST mention “ April 691 ” as the date of Theodoric ’s death , because the fact might be important to chronological research such as determining when Praejectus was martyred .
The Roman calendar
Let ’s go another eight hundred years back and land just in time to see Hannibal victorious against the Romans at Cannae .
This historical battle , sources assure us , took place on 2 August 216 BC .
We do n’t have a prayer of re-mapping this date to a proleptic Gregorian or a Julian one .
The ancient Roman year had 355 days , and in theory every second year ought to have a so - called intercalary month of 22 or 23 days .
The problem was that these months were inserted irregularly , and no chronologist ancient or modern has ever taken the trouble to track down the exact use of the intercalary month .
( Besides , the sources are just not there . )
This means that we will never know exactly on which proleptic Gregorian date the battle of Cannae took place .
The best we can say is that it took place in high summer ; probably in July or August .
However , if a source would say that a certain event happened on 5 August 216 BC , we can be certain that it took place three days after the battle of Cannae .
The Romans saw the use of a reliable chronology and were generally accurate within the constraints of their weird calendar .
Thus , the date of the battle of Cannae should be marked up as :
< time datetime= " - 216-08-02 " calendar= " Ancient Roman " > 2 August 216 BC </ time >
With this final example we ’ve discussed the need for a calendar attribute sufficiently .
Apart from the calendar attribute , this code example contains something else an HTML5 validator would get extremely upset about : the negative year .
The restriction that BC years may not be used is of course totally absurd in a historical context .
The names of the years
That brings us to the second problem : the names of the years , and especially the use of different naming systems .
If you ’re into ancient chronology , it ’s best to see years as having names , not numbers .
Essentially our modern numbering of years from the Incarnation provides a common naming system ; not a numbering system .
In JavaScript terms , the name of the current year is the string " 2009 " and not the number 2009 .
Regnal years
Until the waning of the middle ages , all monarchies used naming systems based on the regnal year of the king or emperor .
Although we talk about 12 August 1274 , a contemporary document would not use the name “ 1274 , ” but would instead say “ the second year of king Edward ” for the English , or “ the fourth year of king Philip ” for the French .
( Of course historians first have to figure out these documents refer to Edward I and Philip III , and not , for instance , Edward III and Philip VI .
Medieval chronology is such fun . )
Christian years
In addition to this traditional naming system , that has been in use since the dawn of history , the Middle Ages used the naming system of years since the Incarnation that the devoutly Christian historians of the age considered the defining moment of human history .
The Book of Revelations clearly states that the Antichrist would be locked up for a thousand years before being allowed to briefly rule the Earth .
The use of the Christian era naming system allowed everybody to get duly upset around the year 1000 , and widespread confusion was sowed .
The Christian naming system was invented by Dionysius Exiguus , a monk living in Rome .
Exactly why he thought that the year that he published his system was the 525th since Christ ’s birth is not known , but his counting has been used ever since .
It is commonly said that Dionysius made a four - year mistake and that Christ was born in 4 BC .
Matthew tells how Herod the Great tried to murder baby Jesus in the slaughter of the innocents , and Herod died in 4 BC .
Thus , Christ must have been born in that year at the latest .
Matthew ’s story is probably pious nonsense .
He ’s the least reliable evangelist historically speaking , writing 150 years after the events , and the others gospels do not mention the killing of the innocents .
Therefore it ’s very well possible that Dionysius was right after all .
Nonetheless , Christ is usually dated as having lived from 4 BC to 30 AD , for a total of thirty three years .
Consular years
Before Dionysius introduced his reform , people used the old Roman system , in which every year was named after its two consuls .
After the Romans had discarded their monarchy in 509 BC they were forced to stop using regnal years .
They needed a new naming system , and they decided to allow their two chief magistrates , the consuls , to give their names to the year .
Thus , “ in the consulate of Cn. Pompeius Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus Dives ” is a historically valid alternative to “ 70 BC . ”
In fact , BC or AD years may be considered a convenient shorthand for the “ semantically ” more correct consular years .
Although the consuls lost all political power after Augustus founded the Empire in 27 BC , the title was still given out to aristocrats who ’d deserved a plum , as wel as to the Emperor himself , until the office was abolished in 541 AD .
The consuls continued to give their names to the year .
( In return they were graciously allowed to squander their fortunes on organising circus games . )
Modern historians have mapped consular years to Christian ones , and have established lookup tables .
The ancient historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus has carefully mapped Greek history to Roman consular years .
( He may have made mistakes , but if he did we ’re not in a position to find out .
We must accept his chronology . )
Thus the Roman consular years give us a common naming system ( a namespace , if you wish ) for 1049 years of Greek , Roman , and early Medieval history .
This naming system can be combined with the Christian one to give us a more - or - less reliable chronology going back about 2,500 years .
The last eight hundred or so of the Roman consular years are universally accepted as historically reliable .
In the more uncertain first two hundred years , even the most radical reviser proposes a shift of eight years at most , so across the centuries this naming system remained pretty reliable .
300 BC : the first certain year
300 BC is the earliest year that we can map with complete accuracy ; i.e. we can say with certainty that the consulate of M. Valerius Maximus Corvus for the fifth time and Q. Appuleius Pansa occurred exactly 2308 years before the present time .
For this reason among others , breaking off chronology at 1 AD , as HTML5 proposes , is pure nonsense .
We ’d miss out on another three hundred years of perfectly good , historically and arithmetically valid chronology .
The year 0 and the start of leap years
The year 0 does not exist .
The consulate of Cossus Cornelius Lentulus and L. Calpurnius Piso , which we call “ 1 BC , ” was directly followed by the consulate of C. Caesar and L. Aemilius Paullus , which we call “ 1 AD . ”
Emperor Augustus ruled from 27 BC to 14 AD , and that ’s a reign of 40 years , not 41 .
While we ’re on the subject of Augustus , he was also responsible for finally setting down a regular pattern of one leap year per four years .
The first leap year in the new system was the consulate of S. Aelius Catus and C. Sentius Saturninus , and because we happen to call that year “ 4 AD ” we ’ve grown used to thinking that a leap year must necessarily be divisible by four .
Varronian years
The Roman consular lists , the fasti consulares , have been preserved in several versions .
The standard version is the one created during Augustus ’ rule by the historian M. Terentius Varro and set up on the Forum Romanum to serve as a public calendar .
It was dutifully updated every year .
Because these fasti were moved to the Capitol after being excavated in the 16th century , they ’re known as the Capitoline Fasti .
Historians are pretty certain that some errors have crept into the Capitoline Fasti .
The first problematic year is 301 BC , when the Capitoline Fasti say a dictator was appointed instead of consuls .
Although this was allowed under the Roman constitution , dictatorships are quite rare , and this particular one is not mentioned in any other source .
Therefore , modern historians have concluded , this dictatorship never actually took place .
Thus the consulate of M. Livius Denter and M. Aemilius Paullus , which we call “ 302 BC , ” was directly followed by the consulate of M. Valerius Maximus Corvus for the fifth time and Q. Appuleius Pansa , which we call “ 300 BC . ”
There are several such problematic years in the Capitoline Fasti before 300 BC .
Unfortunately historians disagree on some of these cases , and therefore they ’ve decided to follow Varro ’s system anyway , warts and all .
Years from 509 to 301 BC are called “ Varronian years , ” and about three to eight of them have never existed .
Therefore Christian years before 300 BC are names , and not numbers , and MUST NOT be used for arithmetic operations .
Varronian years are still being used in history books .
If we say that “ the Greeks defeated the Persian navy in 480 BC at Salamis , and the Persian army in 479 BC at Plataea ” we ’re using Varronian years .
Historians are pretty certain that these dates are in fact three to eight years off , and that we cannot say that the battle of Salamis took place exactly 2488 before the present year .
It ’s more in the order of somewhere between 2480 and 2485 — probably .
Nonetheless , it does not make sense to say the battle of Salamis occurred anywhere from 477 to 472 BC .
All history books say “ 480 BC , ” and people ( as well as chronological search systems ) would get confused if we did anything else .
We MUST continue to use the Varronian year .
So the example has to be marked up as :
The Greeks defeated the Persian navy in < time datetime= " - 480 " yearNames = " Varronian " > 480 BC < / time > , and the Persian army in < time datetime= " - 479 " yearNames = " Varronian " >479 BC </ time >
Before 509 BC
More - or - less reliable chronology starts with the consulate of L. Iunius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus , Varronian year “ 509 BC . ”
All dates before 509 BC are educated guesswork at best .
As we go further back in time the guesswork increases at the expense of the education .
Sure , you ’ll often encounter earlier dates , but these have been painstakingly reconstructed by both ancient and modern historians , and there ’s simply no way we can tell whether they ’re right or wrong .
That ’s the historians ’ problem .
Nonetheless , a history - compatible implementation of < time > MUST allow an arbitrary year - naming system to be specified .
( The actual mapping of such a system to the consular / Christian system is a problem for historians ; not for spec writers .
If an historian would use his own system , he ’d be responsible for creating lookup tables . )
An example will show why this is necessary .
The so - called “ First Dark Ages ”
It is my personal belief that the so - called “ First Dark Ages , ” traditionally dated from 1200 to 800 BC , have never existed ; i.e. 1200 BC was the same year as 800 BC ( roughly speaking , of course ) .
I also feel that earlier chronology is a mess wrongly based on the so - called Thirty Dynasties of Egypt scheme of the historian Manetho , whose work is almost completely lost , and who wrote in a time when Alexander the Great ’s rapacious successors were trying to outdo each other in bragging about the venerable antiquity of the people they were exploiting .
Egyptian and Mesopotamian chronology thus became a tool in a propaganda war , and it has never recovered .
As a result , I think that the Egyptian and Mesopotamian monarchies developed a few centuries later than is generally assumed .
I also think that Egyptian chronology has serious defects and should be re-thought from the ground up .
( Especially the fact that the XXII dynasty was a priestly one concurrent with the last native dynasty , the Persians , and the Ptolemies ought to be recognised . )
Since all other ancient chronologies are based on the Egyptian one , this would have far - reaching consequences .
This opinion is not popular in historical circles ; in fact most professional historians of the age will hotly defend the First Dark Ages and their painstakingly created chronologies .
That ’s fine ; since I ’m the challenger I have to prove my challenge by doing some research .
The point is that in order to mark up my research in HTML I ’d have to create my own year - naming system , while also using the year - naming systems that are currently in use among historians .
To make matters more complex , most Ancient Near East chronologies have a high , a middle , and a low variant ( all of which are wrong , in my opinion ) .
In other words , I have to be very careful to specify which year - naming system a particular < time > element belongs to .
I also have to be able to denote years belonging to my own chronological theory .
Thus , I MUST be able to invent a value for the attribute I ’ve called yearNames .
( Incidentally , this research would greatly benefit from a centralised chronological system I could plug in to to automatically convert dates from other systems to my proposed system .
I ’d have to create lookup tables ( or maybe even arithmetic operations ) , but once I ’d have done that , I ’d be able to move the onus of recalculating centuries of history to an automatic system .
Now THAT would be a benefit of a history - safe < time > element ! )
Making < time > safe for historians
This short treatment of ancient chronology highlights only a few of the most important problems , and it does n’t even try to cover non-European civilisations .
More study is clearly necessary .
In conclusion , making < time > safe for historians is not an easy job , and , as I said at the start , the question is whether it should be attempted at all .
I hope to have given you some useful information that will allow you to take a position on this question .

Dumbest and Funniest Sitcom Characters
DUMBEST TV SITCOM CHARACTERS
There are many ingredients that make up a great sitcom .
You always need a classic set of main characters to base the story on .
But you also need a great supporting staff .
Think about all the amazing side characters that Seinfeld had .
The show just would n’t have been as good if guys like Babu and the Soup Nazi were n’t on .
But I ’m not just talking about that .
I ’m also talking about recurring characters who appear on nearly every episode .
And whether they ’re serious or funny , they have to be good .
One of those characters ?
The dumb guy or girl .
Sometimes poking fun at these characters can take the show to new levels .
Joey Tribbiani – Friends
Played by Matthew Leblanc .
I will admit that I ’m not the biggest fan of Friends but you have to put him on this list .
And I too can admit that many of the scenes with Leblanc were pretty watchable .
Mallory Keaton – Family Ties
Played by Justine Bateman .
Never forget how great a show Family Ties was .
And never forget how awesome it was whenever Michael J. Fox and Bateman were in the same room .
Some classic moments between the two of them .
Phoebe Buffay – Friends
Played by Lisa Kudrow .
I had to put her on this list even though I hated her character .
Why ?
Because I ’d be getting tons of annoying comments saying that I forgot to put her on this list .
Kelly Bundy – Married with Children
Played by Christina Applegate .
I have to say that Kelly and Bud were one of the best brother sister combos in sitcom history .
They were amazing together .
It ’s weird though , Kelly was actually witty at times always poking fun at Bud ’s lack of a sex life .
Even so , she said some awfully dumb things at least once a show .
Woody Boyd – Cheers
Played by Woody Harrelson .
If I were actually making this list a rankings list , he ’d clearly be in my top three .
Harrelson propelled this show to the top .
A Boner and a Woody on TV at the same time .
Will that ever happen again ?
Homer Simpson – The Simpsons
Played by Dan Castellenata .
This is a given .
Chief Wiggum – The Simpsons
Played by Hank Azaria .
This is even more of a given .
I love whenever he says “ take em away boys . ”
Ernie “ Coach ” Pantuso – Cheers
Played by Nicholas Colasanto .
People must never forget who the original dumb guy was on Cheers .
Some of his lines were classic .
Lowell Mather – Wings
Played by Thomas Hayden Church .
I was n’t a huge fan of this show but Hayden Church was pretty funny as dumb repair man Lowell Mather .
Even the name Lowell gives off a stupid vibe does n’t it ?
Peter Griffin – Family Guy
Played by Seth MacFarlane .
An obvious choice .
Man is this show good .
Michael Kelso – That 70’s Show
Played by Ashton Kutcher .
Before this whole Demi Moore and movie thing , he was pretty damned funny on That 70 ’s show .
Hilary Banks – Fresh Prince of Bel Air
Played by Karyn Parsons .
The snotty rich girl .
Gilligan – Gilligan ’s Island
Played by Bob Denver .
It was all worth it if he ever got to screw Ginger or Mary Ann .
Officer Barbrady – South Park
Played by Trey Parker .
I had to get someone from South Park into this list , and who better than the dumbest character on the show ?
Michael Scott – The Office
Played by Steve Carell .
Personally I think the character Michael Scott is the reason this show is n’t nearly as funny as it should be .
However , it ’s tough to have a list like this and not include him .
Who is your favorite dumbest sitcom character ?
By Steve Schifferes
Economics reporter , BBC News
The Tories have accused the chancellor of hiding a " tax bombshell " .
The UK is facing " two parliaments of pain " following the " breathtaking " damage to the economy , the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) has warned .
The government must close a £ 90bn hole to bring the budget into balance , the independent think - tank said .
That would cost every UK family £ 2,840 per year by 2017 - 18 in higher taxes or public spending cuts , it added .
The Treasury said this week 's Budget had set out a plan to reduce borrowing while supporting the economy now .
' Benefit '
The IFS analysis came after the chancellor delivered his Budget which forecast the biggest deficit in UK post - war history .
Alistair Darling told the House of Commons on Wednesday the government would be forced to borrow £ 175bn this year as the recession battered the UK economy .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said the IFS calculations showed the country was facing a " secret tax bombshell " .
But Downing Street insisted it was " not entirely clear " how the £ 2,840 figure had been calculated .
The Treasury said that reducing our borrowing overnight would lead to greater losses in the long term .
The Treasury 's assessment of the fiscal damage wrought by the current economic and financial crisis is breathtaking
Robert Chote , IFS Stephanie Flanders : Rose - tinted realism
" By investing in the economy and protecting our front - line services through greater efficiency , we will be much better positioned to benefit from the recovery when it comes . "
' Mounting austerity '
The squeeze on spending would duplicate that seen during the Thatcher years in the mid-1980s , the IFS said .
The independent think - tank forecast overall public spending would fall by 0.1 % annually in real terms from 2011 to 2014 .
It said if the budget squeeze continued to fall on spending up to 2017 - 18 , total public spending would fall back to the level of 2002 .
This would wipe out all the spending increases made by the Labour party in its last two terms in office .
" The Treasury 's assessment of the fiscal damage wrought by the current economic and financial crisis is breathtaking , " said IFS director Robert Chote .
" It will require two full parliaments of mounting austerity to repair . "
The IFS said the taxes on the rich will raise relatively little money in comparison with the size of the budget gap .
Only 10 % of the gap will be raised by new taxes , while 40 % will be accounted for by spending cuts up to 2014 , it added .
The remainder ( 50 % ) is scheduled for the parliament after next .
The IFS pointed out the government is planning a huge cut in public investment , reducing it by more than half , and reversing its previous approach that aimed at preserving capital investment .
This would mean much less money available was to build new schools , roads , and hospitals after 2011 .
In addition , it pointed out that all of the very modest increase planned in current spending ( on wages and running costs ) would be taken up with the higher cost of debt interest and paying out more social security benefits .
Health and education could face spending curbs
This meant departmental spending ( including areas such as health , education , and policing ) would need to fall by 2.3 % annually .
If these departments , which make up more than half of all departmental spending , were protected , then there would be even bigger cuts in other departments , of up to 5 % .
It was not clear that these can be achieved by " efficiency savings " alone , the IFS said .
And it added that in the following four years , to 2017 - 8 , public spending would also have to grow at just 0.5 % annually to meet the budget cut targets without further tax increase .
Output gap
Its not just the recession that is troubling the chancellor
The need for big cuts in spending or the raising of taxes does not only arise from the depth and the severity of the recession .
The IFS said that it was also due to a permanent loss of output by the UK economy as a result of the credit crunch , and added the Treasury had doubled its estimate for the size of that loss .
The loss of output , and thus of tax revenues , for example from financial sector , had put a permanent hole in the public finances , its report said , meaning the government could not simply rely on the end of the recession to plug the structural gap in the public finances .
And it said that it would be 2032 before government debt returned to the level of 40 % of GDP that had been Mr Brown 's target .
Hitting the rich
The IFS also cast doubt on the Treasury 's belief that it would raise an extra £ 7bn per year by taxing the rich , especially those earning over £ 150,000 per year .
TAXING THE RICH 50 % tax rate : £ 2.6 bn lower pension tax relief : £ 3.1 bn Personal allowances : £ 1.6 bn Source : Treasury estimates
It said there was tremendous uncertainty about how much the new 50 % tax rate would generate , adding that it could raise no money at all if the rich changed their behaviour .
And it warned if some rich people chose to leave the country and spend less in the UK , that would also lower tax receipts in other areas , such as VAT receipts , perhaps by as much as £ 1.5 bn .
It was also sceptical about the plan to reduce tax relief on pension contributions , which the Treasury said would raise £ 3.1 bn .
This scheme is flawed in its principles , it said , and will be difficult to implement in practice .

Advertisement Motorists will be offered subsidies of up to £ 5,000 to encourage them to buy electric or plug - in hybrid cars under plans announced by the government .
It is part of the government 's £ 250 m plan to promote low carbon transport over the next five years .
But ministers do not expect eligible cars to hit the showrooms until 2011 .
The car industry as a whole welcomed the plan , but George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , dismissed the initiative as a " fantasy announcement . "
Critics said the government needed to invest more in places to recharge the vehicles and in public transport .
The strategy includes plans to provide £ 20 m for charging points and other necessary infrastructure .
At present they are very limited .
' Next generation ' Transport Secretary Geoff
Hoon said that there was huge potential to reduce emissions , with less than 0.1 % of the UK 's 26 million cars now electric .
The Labour plan announced today is like giving people a grant to buy an internal combustion engine , without bothering to set up any petrol stations
George Osborne , shadow chancellor
Q&A : Electric cars
How green are electric cars ?
The available funding would only be for fully electric and plug - in petrol - electric hybrids .
As such , currently commercially available hybrids , such as the Toyota Prius , would not be eligible .
There is a limited range of electric vehicles on the market , which range in price from about £ 8,000 to more than £ 80,000 for high - performance models .
Sales have been held back by a number of factors :
They commonly have a limited range of about 40 miles , take several hours to charge , and have only two seats .
But the government hopes to target drivers of a new generation of all electric or plug - in petrol - electric cars , which are expected to go on sale in two years time .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said : " When people see the electric car - the speed , the lack of noise - they are going to fall in love with it . "
" We need to lead this green motoring revolution , " he added .
Speaking at a racing circuit in Dunfermline , Geoff Hoon said the plan was about " encouraging the idea that electric vehicles will become part of everyday life , that people will take them for granted and they will look and feel the same as any other car " .
Jay Nagley , an analyst at Spyder Automotive , said the announcement was very significant for the car industry .
" The big problem is that the next generation of electric cars will initially be very expensive to make - manufacturers say about double the price of a petrol car , " he told the BBC .
" Without subsidies , nobody will buy them , so manufacturers wo n't be able increase production and get the price down . "
Mr Nagley added that by 2020 about a quarter of all cars sold could be electric .
But the RAC Foundation , which lobbies on behalf of British motorists , questioned the amount of money being spent by the government , and how it would be put to use .
" If the whole £ 250 m were divided up so £ 5,000 is allocated per person , this would only put an extra 50,000 electric cars on the road - out of an annual total of some 2.7 million cars sold in the UK , " said director Stephen Glaister .
How green ?
Jorn Madslien , business reporter , BBC News
The future of electric motoring is no longer remote .
Modern lithium - ion batteries have already been installed in prototype cars , such as the Mini E , which handles like an ordinary car and offers a range of 150 miles .
But the batteries are huge , so the car has no back seats .
Plug - in petrol - electric hybrids will soon offer five - seat alternatives .
In these , a petrol engine takes over once the battery has run out .
This is the solution favoured by Toyota .
Alternatively , a small petrol engine recharges the battery whilst driving - the General Motors solution .
Either way , in the future motorists will increasingly buy power from electricity companies rather than from the oil industry .
The future of electric motoring Environmental campaigners Friends of the Earth said that financial support for electric cars was a step in the right direction but said investment in public transport was also needed .
" Electric cars are only as green as the electricity they run on - ministers must do far more to boost the UK's flagging renewable energy industry , " said the group 's transport campaigner Tony Bosworth .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said that the government 's announcement lacked detail on the measures needed to make electric cars a mainstream reality .
He said more information was needed on how the higher demand for electricity would be managed and on how a national network of car charging points would be created .
" The Labour plan announced today is like giving people a grant to buy an internal combustion engine , without bothering to set up any petrol stations , " he said .

Or subscribe to the podcast or listen via the BBC iPlayer The Liberal Democrat shadow transport secretary , Norman Baker , said the government scheme was a gimmick that would only benefit the few .
" Discounts on electric cars are all very well for those who can afford to buy a new car but it cannot hide the fact that the government has forced up rail fares and destroyed many local bus services , " he said .
Trade - in scheme Government incentives to stimulate the sales of cars are spreading .
In a separate initiative , Chancellor Alistair Darling is expected to reveal an incentive scheme for motorists to trade old cars in for new ones in next week 's Budget .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Running cars on electricity is an exceptionally good idea if we could produce the electricity in a green and carbon free manner Michael , Doncaster , UK This could provide £ 2,000 for car owners to trade in their old cars to buy new ones .
The plan is designed to boost demand for new cars and help struggling carmakers who are suffering during the recession .
Similar schemes have proved successful in boosting new car sales in continental Europe .
In Germany , for example , car sales increased by 40 % in March compared with a year earlier .
Critics of the scheme , however , have complained about the environmental impact of encouraging people to buy new cars .
And they have argued that the overall effect on the industry will be limited as they believe buyers have simply brought forward purchases they intended to make anyway .

By Sandra Aamodt and Sam Wang
Inventor Ray Kurzweil , in his 2005 futurist manifesto “ The Singularity Is Near , ” extrapolates current trends in computer technology to conclude that machines will be able to out - think people within a few decades .
In his eagerness to salute our robotic overlords , he neglects some key differences between brains and computers that make his prediction unlikely to come true .
Brains have long been compared to the most advanced existing technology — including , at one point , telephone switchboards .
Today people talk about brains as if they were a sort of biological computer , with pink mushy “ hardware ” and “ software ” generated by life experiences .
However , any comparison with computers misses a messy truth .
Because the brain arose through natural selection , it contains layers of systems that arose for one function and then were adopted for another , even though they do n’t work perfectly .
An engineer with time to get it right would have started over , but it ’s easier for evolution to adapt an old system to a new purpose than to come up with an entirely new structure .
Our colleague David Linden has compared the evolutionary history of the brain to the task of building a modern car by adding parts to a 1925 Model T that never stops running .
As a result , brains differ from computers in many ways , from their highly efficient use of energy to their tremendous adaptability .
One striking feature of brain tissue is its compactness .
In the brain ’s wiring , space is at a premium , and is more tightly packed than even the most condensed computer architecture .
One cubic centimeter of human brain tissue , which would fill a thimble , contains 50 million neurons ; several hundred miles of axons , the wires over which neurons send signals ; and close to a trillion ( that ’s a million million ) synapses , the connections between neurons .
The memory capacity in this small volume is potentially immense .
Electrical impulses that arrive at a synapse give the recipient neuron a small chemical kick that can vary in size .
Variation in synaptic strength is thought to be a means of memory formation .
Sam ’s lab has shown that synaptic strength flips between extreme high and low states , a flip that is reminiscent of a computer storing a “ one ” or a “ zero ” — a single bit of information .
But unlike a computer , connections between neurons can form and break too , a process that continues throughout life and can store even more information because of the potential for creating new paths for activity .
Although we ’re forced to guess because the neural basis of memory is n’t understood at this level , let ’s say that one movable synapse could store one byte ( 8 bits ) of memory .
That thimble would then contain 1,000 gigabytes ( 1 terabyte ) of information .
A thousand thimblefuls make up a whole brain , giving us a million gigabytes — a petabyte — of information .
To put this in perspective , the entire archived contents of the Internet fill just three petabytes .
To address this challenge , Kurzweil invokes Moore ’s Law , the principle that for the last four decades , engineers have managed to double the capacity of chips ( and hard drives ) every year or two .
If we imagine that the trend will continue , it ’s possible to guess when a single computer the size of a brain could contain a petabyte .
That would be about 2025 to 2030 , just 15 or 20 years from now .
This projection overlooks the dark , hot underbelly of Moore ’s law : power consumption per chip , which has also exploded since 1985 .
By 2025 , the memory of an artificial brain would use nearly a gigawatt of power , the amount currently consumed by all of Washington , D.C.
So brute - force escalation of current computer technology would give us an artificial brain that is far too costly to operate .
Compare this with your brain , which uses about 12 watts , an amount that supports not only memory but all your thought processes .
This is less than the energy consumed by a typical refrigerator light , and half the typical needs of a laptop computer .
Cutting power consumption by half while increasing computing power many times over is a pretty challenging design standard .
As smart as we are , in this sense we are all dim bulbs .
A persistent problem in artificial computing is the sensitivity of the system to component failure .
Yet biological synapses are remarkably flaky devices even in normal , healthy conditions .
They release neurotransmitter only a small fraction of the time when their parent neuron fires an electrical impulse .
This unreliability may arise because individual synapses are so small that they contain barely enough machinery to function .
This may be a trade - off that stuffs the most function into the smallest possible space .
In any case , a brain ’s success is not measured by its ability to process information in precisely repeatable ways .
Instead , it has evolved to guide behaviors that allow us to survive and reproduce , which often requires fast responses to complex situations .
As a result , we constantly make approximations and find “ good - enough ” solutions .
This leads to mistakes and biases .
We think that when two events occur at the same time , one must have caused the other .
We make inaccurate snap judgments such as racial prejudice .
We fail to plan rationally for the future , as explored in the field of neuroeconomics .
Still , engineers could learn a thing or two from brain strategies .
For example , even the most advanced computers have difficulty telling a dog from a cat , something that can be done at a glance by a toddler — or a cat .
We use emotions , the brain ’s steersman , to assign value to our experiences and to future possibilities , often allowing us to evaluate potential outcomes efficiently and rapidly when information is uncertain .
In general , we bring an extraordinary amount of background information to bear on seemingly simple tasks , allowing us to make inferences that are difficult for machines .
If engineers can understand how to apply these shortcuts and tricks , computer performance could begin to emulate some of the more impressive feats of human brains .
However , this route may lead to computers that share our imperfections .
This may not be exactly what we want from robot overlords , but it could lead to better “ soft ” judgments from our computers .
This gets us to the deepest point : why bother building an artificial brain ?
As neuroscientists , we ’re excited about the potential of using computational models to test our understanding of how the brain works .
On the other hand , although it eventually may be possible to design sophisticated computing devices that imitate what we do , the capability to make such a device is already here .
All you need is a fertile man and woman with the resources to nurture their child to adulthood .
With luck , by 2030 you ’ll have a full - grown , college - educated , walking petabyte .
A drawback is that it may be difficult to get this computing device to do what you ask .
We ’re grateful to Olivia for the opportunity to write these four columns .

F. Scott Fitzgerald ( The Great Gatsby , 1925 ) .
" American theory of life "
" We Americans have all been taught from childhood that it is a sort of moral obligation for each of us to rise , to get up in the world . "
In the crisis of the Depression , however , that belief appeared absurd .
The United States now confronted what Anderson called " a crisis of belief . "
As Anderson knew , the notion that the United States is a uniquely open society , where the talented and industrious always have the chance to better their lot , is a central element of American self - understanding .
The notion has been a prominent feature of American culture since the days of Ben Franklin , and it remains a core feature of the national ethos to this day .
Indeed , in recent months the election of Barack Obama has reminded Americans of the promise that in the United States opportunity can be open to all .
The Great Depression , however , subjected even the strongest convictions to stark challenge , revealing cracks in the vision of social mobility that the recent prosperity of the nineteen - twenties had managed to obscure .
In truth , the notion that the U.S. was an open and fluid society had always been nearly as much myth as reality -- even when , as was necessarily the case , it was assumed to apply to white men alone .
But the myth had come to an especially paradoxical stage in its development in the years leading up to the crash .
Never in American history had the vision of social mobility been more forcefully asserted than in the 1920s .
And rarely had the image been so far out of keeping with reality .
The Republican Party , which dominated national politics throughout the decade , extolled the twin virtues of economic competition and personal ambition , reminding Americans often that they lived , as Herbert Hoover remarked , in " a fluid classless society ... unique in the world . "
That rhetoric was redoubled by a booming new advertising industry which promised that consumers might vault up the ladder of social status through carefully chosen purchases ( often with consumer credit , a recent invention ) .
And yet , the United States actually became less equal and less fluid in the 1920s , as the era 's prosperity increasingly benefited the wealthiest .
By the end of the decade , the top 1 % of the population received nearly a quarter of the national income , an historic peak that would not be approached again until this past decade .
Indeed , the term " social mobility " was coined in 1925 by the sociologist Pitrim Sorokin , who used the phrase to identify a phenomenon in apparent decline .
" The wealthy class of the United States is becoming less and less open , and is tending to be transformed into a caste - like group . "
The conflict between the American myth of a classless society and the reality of the nation 's deepening caste divisions was the irony at the core of some of the greatest literary works of the 1920s , including Theodore Dreiser 's " An American Tragedy " and F. Scott Fitzgerald 's " The Great Gatsby . "
But it was not until the Great Depression that the traditional vision of social mobility imploded .
Traveling the country , Anderson and his fellow observers found a populace confused by a collapse they could not understand .
Everywhere he turned , Anderson noted , he heard the same refrain , " I failed .
I failed .
It 's my own fault . "
The documentary books that he and his contemporaries created provided a kind of counter - narrative to the conventional American story of personal freedom and individual ambition .
These works featured a journey not upward toward wealth and progress , but back into the hinterlands of a confused and immobilized nation .
That journey was echoed by a whole genre of " road " novels , written by angry young writers like Nelson Algren , who depicted an itinerant population of bottom dogs lurching from one disaster to the next .
These novels answered the classic American vision of opportunity by imagining a nation of wanderers rapidly going nowhere .
So , too , did the cycle of gangster films -- " Little Caesar , " " Scarface , " " Public Enemy " -- which reached the peak of their popularity in the early ' 30s .
Depicting boldly ruthless young men whose quests for wealth and power were doomed to end in self - destruction , the gangster film cast personal ambition as a cruel delusion .
Even the era's light - hearted " screwball comedies , " such as " It Happened One Night " and " My Man Godfrey , " were sometimes fables of downward mobility , where arrogant socialites were brought down a notch by their encounters with ordinary people .
The road novels , documentary books and gangster films of the 1930s depicted the myth of social mobility as a bitter cheat .
The era 's screwball comedies viewed it merely as delightfully laughable .
But all suggested that the Depression had left a core feature of American ideology in disarray , and thus emphasized the extent to which the traditional American language of personal ambition was open to redefinition .
That opportunity would be seized on by a cohort of artists and intellectuals who took the crisis of the Depression as a chance to cast the idea of social mobility less as a framework for individual striving and more as an occasion for collective action .
John Steinbeck 's novel " The Grapes of Wrath " made the Joad family 's flight from the dust bowl into an emblem of people coming together to remake their world .
A similar image was implicit in the very title of Dorothea Lange and Paul Taylor 's documentary book " An American Exodus . "
Even works of light entertainment like the massively popular " Gone With the Wind " or John Ford 's landmark Western " Stagecoach " were in keeping with the prevailing message of the times .
All these works told of epic journeys in which a group of people overcame destructive competition in their discovery of a common destiny .
Each called for Americans to act collectively to remake a democratic society where opportunity would be open to all .
In effect , such declarations helped lay the cultural groundwork for the New Deal , providing the ideological infrastructure for the new governmental institutions created during the '30s .
It is not yet clear whether the current economic disaster will produce anything like the profound transformation that shook the U.S. during the Great Depression .
Our own crises of belief are likely just beginning .
If we are fortunate , however , we will have a generation of artists and intellectuals like those of the 1930s to help us imagine our way past confusion .

In the fall of 1933 , Sherwood Anderson left his home in New York City and set out on a series of journeys that would take him across large sections of the American South and Midwest .
He was engaged in a project shared by many of his fellow writers -- including James Agee , Edmund Wilson , John Dos Passos , and Louis Adamic -- all of whom responded to the Great Depression by traveling the nation 's back roads and hinterlands hoping to discover how economic disaster had affected the common people .
Like many of his peers , Anderson had anticipated anger and radicalism among the poor and unemployed .
Instead , he discovered a people stunned by the collapse of their most cherished beliefs .
" Puzzled America , " the title of the book he composed out of his journeys , said it all .
In particular , Anderson found the people he met to be imprisoned by what he called the -- a celebration of personal ambition that now seemed cruelly inappropriate :
Magical Photospheres by Edward Hill
While taking a photograph we click only whats in front of us , but London - based photographer Edward Hill had different ideas .
He created circular photomontages of a place , that contains everything visible to a person , a total 360 degree view of a place .
These are called Photospheres , which gives a new perspective on photography .
Its like you are in the center and your head moves 360 degrees , capturing everything which is around you , like a panoramic view .
Hill has produced some really eye - catching and intriguing images .
Photospheres are made of around 100 individual images shot from the same spot and digitally stitched to form a striking image .
Hill took ten years to assemble some of his compilations , because he had to paint and draw it all together until digital photography came to his rescue .

Die SPD - Fraktion im Bundestag prüft laut einem Medienbericht die Einrichtung von Störsendern im Reichstag .
Damit solle verhindert werden , dass Abgeordnete aus vertraulichen Sitzungen Nachrichten beispielsweise an den Mikroblogging - Dienst Twitter schicken können , berichtet das Nachrichtenmagazin Der Spiegel .
Demnach sagte das SPD - Mitglied im Ältestenrat des Bundestags , Christian Lange , die Fraktion wolle wissen , ob das technisch machbar wäre .
Es sollten mögliche Erfahrungen mit Störsendern in Parlamenten anderer Länder ausgewertet werden .
Die Süddeutsche Zeitung berichtet , der Ältestenrat des Bundestags habe ein Handyverbot für nicht nötig befunden , die Abgeordneten dürften weiterhin aus dem Parlament SMS schreiben und twittern .
Getwitter der SPD - Abgeordneten Gabriele Hiller - Ohm aus einer Fraktionssitzung
Das Bundestagspräsidium und der Ältestenrat des Parlaments hatten sich vorgestern und gestern damit befasst , dass das Ergebnis der Bundespräsidentenwahl am Samstag im Internet und über SMS verbreitet wurde , bevor es offiziell bekannt gegeben wurde .
Die CDU - Abgeordnete Julia Klöckner hatte Köhlers Erfolg knapp 15 Minuten vor der offiziellen Verkündung verbreitet .
Sie war Mitglied der Zählkommission .
Der SPD - Fraktionsvize Ulrich Kelber hatte noch früher über Twitter Köhlers Wahl mit der exakten Stimmenzahl von 613 Stimmen verkündet .
SPD - Fraktionschef Peter Struck hat Kelber diese Woche laut Medienberichten für seine Plauderei scharf gerügt .
Am Dienstag soll Struck die Abgeordneten in einer Fraktionssitzung aufgefordert haben , das Twittern sofort zu unterlassen .
Einzelne Abgeordnete sollen interne Diskussionen über ihren Twitter - Kanal öffentlich gemacht haben .

Back in February , I heard David Sanger , Washington correspondent for the New York Times , speak at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco .
Sanger 's book The Inheritance , a fascinating read about the myriad of daunting challenges facing the new Obama administration , had just come out , and he was discussing some of the thornier issues on that list .
While most of his talk concerned foreign policy issues , Sanger made the comment that one danger facing the U.S. was that " we could become a risk - averse nation .
The entire mood of the country has swung from taking wild risks to taking no risk , " he observed .
" And that could be bad for the country . "
Sanger was talking about the economy -- he asked , at one point , what would have happened if Google had had to go before a government committee to get funding for the concept -- but his point is relevant beyond the tall towers of Wall Street or the rolling hills of Silicon Valley .
Atlantis astronauts made their final spacewalk to repair and update the Hubble Telescope .
In On Monday afternoon , theastronauts made their final spacewalk to repair and update the Hubble Telescope .
In an earlier post , I talked about the Hubble 's importance ... and the questionable importance of human spaceflight going forward , beyond the Hubble missions .
But I did n't get into another whole aspect of the mission -- which is the fact that it almost did n't happen , because in 2004 , the then - NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe considered the risks too high .
The Hubble is in an orbit littered with a lot of space debris ( we could have another whole discussion on on how that came about ) , and too low for a damaged Shuttle to reach the International Space Station .
Of course , these factors were also true of earlier Hubble missions , but they did n't figure as prominently into the equation until the shuttle Columbia was destroyed in re-entry because of debris damage sustained earlier in the mission .
To be fair , NASA 's in a bit of a tough place , when it comes to the risks it takes with astronauts , because the failures are so public .
The Agency is excoriated publicly , 24 hours a day , for weeks , months , and years .
50,000 people die on our highways every 12 months , and we do n't shut down our highway system .
But lose seven astronauts , and you can endanger the entire space program .
And yet , without risk , there is no accomplishment ... a fact understood by every single astronaut and test pilot I 've ever interviewed .
Every single one of them has chafed at being held back because of Agency or external concern about the risks involved .
" I fully expected to die in one of the planes I was flying , " the famous X - 15 test pilot Scott Crossfield once told me .
" They were putting this five million dollar escape system into the plane , and I told them I 'd fly it sitting on a tomato can if they 'd give me the money instead . "
Not every NASA explorer is as colorful as the legendary Crossfield , of course .
But Dr. John M. Grunsfeld , who performed the last spacewalk on the Hubble on Monday , has said more than once that he considered the telescope " worth risking my life for . "
The pilots , astronauts and shuttle commanders I 've interviewed all say they know the risks .
The astronauts know , as one put it to me , that a Shuttle flight is a one - way ticket , with a chance of a return trip .
And they 're okay with that .
It 's the rest of us that do n't seem to be .
There needs to be balance , of course .
Reckless risk is bad for everyone ( see : credit default swaps ) .
NASA managers speak of a balancing act called " risk versus reach . "
Too little reach , and you discover nothing significantly new .
Too much risk , and you lose the craft and people you need to do the exploring , and you discover nothing at all .
But consider this : not only would Google have trouble convincing a public , risk - averse financial safety board that they were a risk worth taking , but the Wright Brothers would never have left the ground .
Aviation itself could never have evolved , if nobody was allowed to be at risk in the course of its development .
In his classic memoir Fate is the Hunter , Ernest Gann -- one of the early airline pilots , and a brilliant writer -- has a section dedicated to colleagues killed in the line of duty , whose " wings are forever folded . "
The list , single spaced and double - columned , goes on for several pages .
And that 's just working airline pilots , who discovered the hard way the weaknesses in airliners , weather , and navigation systems .
There were hundreds , even thousands , of others who gave their lives in the process of the technology 's maturation .
Exploration , innovation , and entrepreneurship are all risky endeavors .
If the risks taken are going to bring down an entire financial system for the rest of us , that 's one thing .
But if an informed explorer is willing to put their own life , fortune ... or even , to quote a memorable document , their sacred honor ... on the line for a cause , technology , or chance they think is worth it ... perhaps we should rethink our knee - jerk reflex to keep them safer than they wish to keep themselves .
SAINT - DENIS , Réunion , April 27 ( UPI ) --
French cult leader Juliano Verbard , jailed for rape and child molestation , has escaped by helicopter from an Indian Ocean island prison , officials say .
Verbard , 27 , who was serving a 15 - year term on the island of Reunion , was pulled onto a hijacked helicopter along with two prison followers , identified as Alexin Jismy and Fabrice Michel , the BBC reported .

Three accomplices had allegedly hijacked the helicopter after posing as tourists , forcing the two - man crew to fly onto the prison grounds at gunpoint .
Officials told the BBC the helicopter took off from the prison and landed a few hundred yards away , where Verbard , the two other prisoners and the accomplices drove off in a waiting van .
The British broadcaster said Verbard was the leader of the pseudo religious cult called the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary when he was jailed last year for rape and sexual attacks on children .
The helicopter pilot reportedly told a local Reunion radio station that one of the hijackers put a gun to his head while another threatened to light a bottle of gasoline he was holding .
Rep. Alcee Hastings ( D - Fla . ) read a very long list of sex acts not covered by the hate crimes bill on the House floor Wednesday .
The Huffington Post speculated that he “ likely set a congressional record ” for citing the most sex acts of any speech in Congress .
“ I apologize to our transcriber , but I want to put into the record what we have to put up with in the Rules Committee , ” said Hasting .
What followed was a very long and unusual list of sex acts not protected by the proposed bill .

While you may have noticed and admired the recent Snap Judgments featuring women participating in Iran 's political process , you may not have realized why the women in Iran believe this election , taking place tomorrow , is so important .
Advertisement
1. There are 4 main candidates for President : current President Mahmoud Ahmadenjad , who is widely viewed as an opponent of women 's rights and a hard - liner against engagement with America ; reform ( but still conservative ) candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi ; reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi ; and conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie .
All but Ahmadenijad have made deliberate appeals to female voters .

2.Unlike in other countries in the region , women in Iran are encouraged to be well - educated , have a high literacy rate and are very active participants in their political processes .
Iranian women are among the most highly educated and socially active in the Middle East .
Women have a 77 % literacy rate and account for 60 % of university students , according to local census .
Half of the eligible voters in Iran , which has a population of 72 million , are females .
But they still face discrimination in some ways .
Activists say women in Iran are subject to discrimination that makes them second - class citizens in divorce , inheritance , child custody , legal matters and other aspects of life .
Advertisement
They 're also more subject to unemployment then men , in a country with an already - high unemployment rate .
More than 60 percent of Iran 's university students are women but with unemployment in Iran running at 20 percent , employers can afford to be selective .
Many prefer men , and women make up only 15 percent of the workforce .
Advertisement
So , many women are not exactly happy voters at the moment .
3.Current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadenijad 's election resulted in a harsh crackdown on women 's rights in Iran , the results of which some women have felt strongly .
During president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's term in office , several women 's rights activists have been jailed and the morality police , who try to ensure that women are dressed according to Islamic guidelines , have stepped up their patrols .
" Ahmadinejad has tried to put women back in the house for the past four years , " says Koulaie , the former parliamentarian .
Many women have chafed under these restrictions .
" We want the morality police patrols to stop , " says Mahsa Motavalizadeh , a 19 - year old university student who attended [ Mir Hossein Mousavi 's wife Zahra ]
Rahnavard 's rally earlier this week .

Many women are disturbed by the post - Ahmadenijad restrictions on the freedoms they previously enjoyed .
4. In addition , Ahmadenijad 's term in office has been marked by attacks on women 's rights activists in particular .
But activists say dozens of campaigners have been detained since they launched a campaign in 2006 to try and collect one million signatures on a petition demanding greater women 's rights .
Most of them were released after a few days or weeks .

One imagines that prison time in Iran would be a pretty decent deterrent for women who were politically engaged , but these women stayed engaged .
5. In addition , most international observers feel that although even the reform candidates would be unlikely or unable to effect significant changes in Iran 's foreign policy , Ahmadinejad 's reelection would mean that President Obama 's timeline for increasing pressure on Iran would be moved up .
However , some experts say an Ahmadinejad loss may buy Iran more time from the United States .
" If Ahmadinejad wins , there will be no transition and you will see the administration not wanting to waste more time on the negotiations and sanctions , " said Carnegie 's Sadjadpour ,
Advertisement
If he loses , however , the Obama Administration will likely give a new President time to get his arms around the policy .
6.Ahmadenijad 's reported top contender is Mir Hossein Mousavi , who broke with tradition and is actively campaigning with his wife , Zahra Rahnavard .
Rahnavard is , herself , a force to be reckoned with and a strong supporter of women 's rights .
She was active in the struggle to oust the Shah in the late 1970s and is the author of a popular book on Islam and women 's rights .
She went on to earn a master 's degree in art and a doctorate in political science and was appointed as the chancellor of Tehran 's Al Zahra University in the late '90s .
During the same period , she served as a political advisor to Khatami .

Iranian press has dubbed her Iran 's Michelle Obama .
7.Mousavi and Rahnavard have promised to roll back some of the crackdowns against women of the Ahmadinejad years .
She talks about providing women with more rights before family courts , better education opportunities and more jobs .
That is not only appealing to the female half of the estimated 46 million eligible voters — many of their fathers , brothers and husbands also think this the right way forward .
Advertisement
Rahnavard is considered one of the reasons that Mousavi appears to have so much support , especially from women .
8.Mehdi Karroubi , a more liberal candidate than Mousavi , has proposed a variety of reforms , including the elimination of the law requiring women to cover their hair , and talked of appointing women to significant cabinet positions .
Presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi , a reformist cleric , has said he is against forcing women to wear the Islamic veil .
He recently debated with his team the number of cabinet posts women should fill .
Mr. Karroubi's top advisers lobbied for the foreign ministry , speculating that when relations with the U.S. normalize , the new foreign minister could shake hands with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Advertisement
Although no one quite expects him to top Mousavi or Ahmadinejad in the polls , his inclusion in the race is significant because Iranian law allows the top clerics to pick the candidates .
9. Even conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie has reached out and appealed to women voters and spoken of reforms to benefit women .
Conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie , who formerly headed Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , has an advisory team of accomplished women and said he plans to reform the law so it ensures more equality for women .
Mr. Rezaie has said he will place Iranian women in top posts in politics , education and management both in and outside the country .

That means , potentially , female ambassadors , too .
10 . Most observers feel that , like in nearly every election in the States , women will play the deciding role in who becomes ( or remains ) the President of Iran .

But he has since backtracked , saying the mandatory filters would only block content that has been " refused classification " ( RC ) - a subset of the ACMA blacklist - amid widespread concerns that ACMA 's list contains a slew of R18 + and X18 + sites , such as regular gay and straight pornography and other legal content .
" That does n't meet the election promise as far as we 're concerned at all , " Wallace said in a phone interview .
" The promise was clearly about providing a safer internet environment for children and to do that you need to mandatorily block in the first instance pornography and R18 + , and then provide an opt - in system for those adults who want to access it . "
The debate around internet filtering is now distinctly polarised , with technical experts and online users ' lobby groups arguing that trying to censor the internet on a mandatory basis is authoritarian , hinders free speech and is doomed to fail , and religious conservatives arguing the policy does not go far enough .
Although the new Government plan to block just RC content will not prevent adults from surfing for porn , it is still fraught with difficulty as the RC category includes not just child pornography but anti-abortion sites , fetish sites and sites containing pro-euthanasia material such as The Peaceful Pill Handbook by Dr Philip Nitschke .
Sites added to the blacklist in error were also classified as RC , such as one containing PG - rated photographs by Bill Henson .
And the websites of several Australian businesses - such as those of a Queensland dentist - were classified RC and blacklisted after they were hacked by , as Conroy described , " the Russian mob " .
They were on the blacklist even though they changed hosting providers and cleaned up their sites several years ago .
It is a criminal offence to publish the ACMA blacklist .
Details about legal material contained on the list and sites that were added to it in error were revealed only after the list was leaked and published on the online whistleblower site Wikileaks .
To prevent such errors occurring in future and improve transparency , Conroy told a Senate Estimates hearing yesterday that the Government was considering having the secret blacklist reviewed by a panel of eminent Australians or a parliamentary committee .
" It 's clear the Government 's confused filtering policy will please nobody , " said Colin Jacobs , spokesman for the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia .
" By overreaching and making policy on the run they now have an expensive plan that ... has alienated internet users , the internet industry and even filtering advocates like the Christian lobby . "
Eight small internet service providers and Optus are conducting live trials of internet filters and are expected to release their results in July .
Wallace acknowledged that parents were ultimately responsible for protecting their children online but he argued that most parents can't keep up with their kids when it comes to technology , so a mandatory filter was the only solution .
" It 's not the children of responsible parents only that you 're concerned about here , it 's the children of parents who are either bewildered by the thing or are not responsible and do n't protect their children from this unsolicited pornography , " he said .
Asked to respond to Wallace 's claims that the Government was breaking its election promise , a spokesman for Conroy said : " The Government understands the position taken by the Australian Christian Lobby and has made it clear that the pilot trial will inform the development of our filtering policy , including the potential for ISPs to offer optional ISP content filtering products to provide families a further level of filtering for content such as X and R rated material . "
T- Mobile ’s Android Announcement – The myTouch 3G
Just a few days ago T - Mobile unveiled the Dash 3G and gave a hint they ’d be making a much more interesting announcement , one concerning Android , within a week .
Why wait a week when you could announce your new Android phone on …Sunday night ?
The oft - rumored HTC myTouch 3G is now official , and coming to T - Mobile on July 29th .
Customers can start ordering the new phone as early as July 8th .
The phone will start at $ 199 , the same price as the 16GB iPhone 3GS .
The new HTC phone is essentially an upgrade of the G1 , though it does n’t sport the physical keyboard of the G1 , relying instead on the Android 1.5 virtual keypad .
The phone also has a 3.2 megapixel camera and offers support for 3G networks as well as Wi-Fi .
T- Mobile is pitching the myTouch 3G against the iPhone by selling customization .
According to Andrew Sherrard , VP of Product Innovation at T - Mobile , the iPhone has a “ beautiful aesthetic , but you ca n’t change it . ”
With widgets , custom backgrounds , and the ability to learn user preferences , Sherrard believes the myTouch 3G is more than just a phone .
“ This is more than a product launch for us , ” he said .
“ We want consumers to view this as an experience that we are creating for them . ”
The smartphone market is all about creating a total user experience .
i Phone users love the App Store .
Palm
Pre adopters are in love with the new operating system .
Will customization be enough to take people over to T - Mobile ?
Maybe not by itself , but it ’s difficult to ignore Android , the operating system that sold 1 million HTC G1 ’s , the first Android phone from T - Mobile .
The open source development base continues to grow , which means more features and more apps for an exploding customer base .
Android is best positioned as an iPhone contender , and as more apps get developed , and more carriers consider Android devices , I think we ’ll see Android continue to grow as the tech - savvy alternative to an iPhone .
If there ’s one thing I think T - Mobile could have planned better , it ’s timing .
They ’ve known about this release for a while , so why not tell people , particularly with the iPhone 3GS launch .
Plenty of folks have been waiting for that next best thing , and June marks the end of the first iPhone contracts .
Why not pick up the folks who were ready to drop AT&T ?
Why not fight the Palm Pre /3GS in the open field .
As I see it , T - Mobile could have snagged more than a few techsumers who were n’t thrilled with the G1 but might give the myTouch 3G a shot .
Both the Palm Pre and the 3GS may have had enough features to lure those people into new contracts , contracts they ’re unlikely to break so soon .
9 Ways to Make Linux More Secure
1. Use SELinux
Security Enhanced Linux was originally developed for The National Security Agency and is now merged with the 2.6 kernel to provide some additional security measures to the Linux operating system .
Enabling SELinux is probably one of the most important things you can do if you care about creating a ridiculously secure operating system .
“ While problems with the correctness or configuration of applications may allow the limited compromise of individual user programs and system daemons , they do not pose a threat to the security of other user programs and system daemons or to the security of the system as a whole . ”
SELinux
Although SELinux is one of the best things you can do in regards to security , it may not be right for everyone .
The main criticism to SELinux is the difficulty in setting up and maintaining the system .
Fedora comes with SELinux enabled by default .
2. Subscribe to a Vulnerability Alert Service
Often times it is not the operating system itself that is vulnerable .
Vulnerabilities are usually found in the applications and additional services that are installed on the system itself .
One of the best ways to stay secure is to make sure you have the latest version of the application and that there are no known vulnerabilities for the version you have .
Here are some of my favorite alert services :
RSS : SecurityFocus
Mailing List : Bugtraq
If you find your email / rss reader is filling up with too many vulnerabilities that down effect the applications you are using , check out OSVDB and subscribe to vulnerability alerts for only the applications that you use .
3. Disable Unused Services and Applications
We know that applications are almost always the cause of vulnerabilities and for this reason it is best to disable anything that you do n’t use .
OpenBSD is touted as one of the most secure distributions in existence .
According to OpenBSD and their philosophy
All non-essential services are disabled .
OpenBSD claims ,
“ Only two remote holes in the default install , in a heck of a long time ! ” .
Disabling unneeded services and applications is a huge contributor to OpenBSD ’s security record .
Learn from one of the most secure operating system and disable services that you are not using .
4. Check System Logs
If you are subscribed to NixTutor you should have a pretty good grasp on how to monitor logs and search through them .
Checking system logs will often be the first way to check if a system has been compromised or malicious activity is afoot .
Here is a recent example where someone was trying to login to an FTP service with an automated script .
Tue May 19 18:01:49 2009 [ pid 2277 ] CONNECT : Client " 206.155.47.130 "
Tue May 19 18:01:52 2009 [ pid 2276 ] [ Administrator ] FAIL LOGIN : Client " 206.155.47.130 "
Tue May 19 18:01:55 2009 [ pid 2276 ] [ Administrator ] FAIL LOGIN : Client " 206.155.47.130 "
How do we stop this kind of automated attack ?
Well , one solution would be port knocking .
5. Consider Port Knocking
In a nutshell port knocking is a way of opening pre-defined ports on a system remotely using a secret “ knock ” .
The knock consists of sending a special packet to a specific port in a secret sequence .
Once the special sequence of packets have been sent the server will then open a port for your IP address .
If you have open ports consider adding another level of protection with port knocking .
I wrote about setting up port knocking in Linux and FreeBSD in the past .
Port knocking is a really cool solution to prevent automated attacks against known applications .
It virtually stops automated scripts and port scanners completely .
The only problem with port knocking is that it is n’t really suited for public access .
For example if you are going to run the Apache webserver it would n’t make sense to make the client go through a port knock just to visit the site ; however , if your intention is to hide the fact that you have a remote access server like SSH running port knocking is wonderful .
6. Use Iptables
Iptables is a packet inspection framework that is included in the Linux kernel that will allow you to build a state of the art firewall in Linux .
Many of modern day routers are simply embedded Linux machines with iptables , like the Linksys WRT54G .
Learning how to write good firewall rules has a fairly steep learning curve but it is worth learning .
Of course if you do n’t have the time but still want to take advantage of the security iptables can bring check out , FirewallBuilder .
FirewallBuilder is basically a GUI for iptables ( netfilter ) , ipfilter , pf , ipfw , Cisco PIX ( FWSM , ASA ) and Cisco routers extended access lists .
7. Deny All by Default
There are two schools of thought when it comes to creating firewall rules .
One way is to allow everything by default and then restrict access to certain ports and applications .
This is almost always the way firewalls are setup as it is the easiest to setup and maintain .
Allowing all by default is nice for system admins because everything just works , and there are no user complaints to deal with .
The other method of setting up firewalls is to deny all incoming and outgoing traffic by default , only allowing approved traffic through by creating exceptions .
This is a much better way but requires a lot of thought and planning of which types of traffic you are going to allow .
If you care about security , take the extra time it takes to develop a deny by default plan .
A default deny would look something like this :
iptables -P INPUT DROP iptables -P OUTPUT DROP iptables -P FORWARD DROP
8. Use an Intrusion Detection System
An Intrusion Detection System or IDS is a great way to monitor malicious hacking attempts on your machine .
The idea of an IDS is to log traffic and look for certain patterns that are known to be used for malicious purposes .
When the IDS detects malicious traffic it will log and notify you .
This allows you to tweak your firewall to block that type of access or adjust your policies to deal with the attack .
An IDS is not usually setup to block attacks but rather log them and keep tabs on what attackers are doing .
It is up you , the administrator , to refine your firewall rules to block uninvited access .
Using a deny by default policy will make refining rules much easier .
Snort is a great IDS for Linux machines and claims to be the de facto standard for intrusion detection / prevention .
9. Use Full Drive Encryption
According to the 2006 Security Breaches Matrix , a large number of the data leaks were caused due to stolen / missing laptops .
If the data was encrypted these data leaks could have been prevented .
If you have a mobile device or paranoid about security full drive encryption provides peace of mind that your data is yours and only yours .
Distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu are offering full drive encryption options when you install the OS .
Hard drive manufactures are even starting to build encryption right into the hard drives .

Schumer , Gillibrand : Gun Background Check Records Destroyed After Only 24 Hours , Leaving No Way to Trace Gun Purchases When Investigating Major Gun Crimes
Schumer and Gillibrand to Make Push to Repeal Law Which Comes Under Renewed Scrutiny in the Wake of Binghamton Massacre and Mexico Border Violence - Ask President Obama to Leave it Out of His Budget
Today , United States Senators Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand criticized the federal policy requiring that the records from federal gun purchase background checks be destroyed after 24 - hours because it severely ties the hands of law enforcement and stated must be repealed .
In a letter to President Barack Obama , both Senators asked that the dangerous Tiahrt Amendments be kept out of the FY 2010 Federal Budget , which is expected to be released in the coming weeks .
The Tiahrt Amendments have been included in the Bush Administration 's Federal Budget for several years and the Senators are hoping with a new administration , the Amendment 's will finally be left behind .
Schumer and Gillibrand are urging President Obama to reinstate a 90 - day retention period that existed before the current 24 - hour period was implemented by the Bush Administration in 2004 .
" We should n't be tying the hands of law enforcement when they are trying to investigate serious gun crimes .
We should be giving them every available tool to fight these illegal activities , " said Schumer .
" Eighty - five of the guns used in crimes in New York City come from out of state .
Allowing law enforcement authorities simple access to firearms data is sound public policy , will get guns off the streets , and will make New Yorkers safer . "
" As New York 's newest Senator , and more importantly , a mother of two young sons , I want to do everything in my power to give law enforcement the tools they need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous people and reduce gun violence , said Senator Gillibrand .
" I will work with Senator Schumer and President Obama towards common sense solutions that can help solve the problems we face . "
The Amendments , named after Congressman Todd Tiahrt of Kansas , are a series of restrictions on the use of data gathered by the of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives ( ATF )
This data play a critical role in cracking down on gun trafficking and other gun crimes .
Specifically , one of the Tiahrt Amendments requires the FBI to destroy certain National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) background check records within 24 hours .
Schumer and Gillibrand are urging the President to support a return to the more sensible 90 - day retention period that existed before the 24 - hour rule was put in place in 2004 .
Under current law , it is illegal for anyone to purchase a gun if they fall into any one of several categories , including being a convicted felon , having serious mental illness , being an illegal alien , or having a domestic violence conviction .
The NICS check system searches an individual 's background for such information .
It is now difficult to track how many gun crimes could be prevented if the 90 - day rule were reinstated , as the records of all NICS checks in which a buyer is approved to buy a gun are now destroyed in 24 hours .
However , data from before the rule was put in place paint a troubling picture .
A 2002 GAO report showed that during the first six months of the former 90 - day record destruction period , the FBI initiated 235 actions to retrieve guns from buyers who were wrongly approved to purchase guns in the first place .
Of those 235 actions , 228 -- or 97 % -- could not have taken place if the 24 - hour rule had been in place .
Another Tiahrt Amendment prevents ATF from requiring gun dealers to check their inventories for lost and stolen guns .
In 2008 , the ATF reported 30,000 guns missing after inspection of less than 10 % of gun dealers the year before .
A final dangerous aspect of the Amendments restricts states and localities from having full access to aggregated trace data .
As a result , requests for data from traces of guns used in crimes can be made only in connection with individual criminal investigations .
States and localities are not allowed access to data that would allow them to examine gun trafficking patterns .
The restriction 's effect on law enforcement is made clear by the case of Russell Timoshenko , an NYPD officer shot while on patrol in Brooklyn on July 14 , 2007 .
The gun used to kill him was traced to a gun dealer in Virginia who had previously been indicted for gun sales practices .
While the ATF was able to provide the data on the particular gun used to kill Officer Timoshenko , the Tiahrt Amendments did not allow any further data to be shared with New York City .
The gun shop from which the gun originated is now closed .
It is estimated that 85 % of the guns seized in New York crimes originate from out - of - state .
In 2005 , the New York District Attorney and the New York Police Department exposed a Manhattan resident who had sold undercover detectives 18 firearms , including an Uzi and other assault weapons , and significant quantities of methamphetamine , half a kilogram of cocaine , and other drugs .
Trace data confirmed that the defendant had bought the guns from three dealers outside of New York City .
One dealer had not only sold the defendant assault rifles , but also falsified federal records about the sales .
To help identify other traffickers who might have been using the dealer , the District Attorney sought trace data on guns sold by the store and recovered across the state .
The Tiahrt Amendments barred any such request .
The Tiahrt Amendments have been included in the Bush Administration 's Federal Budget for several years and the Senators are hoping with a new administration , the Amendment 's will finally be left behind .
Senators Schumer and Gillibrand are pushing for a smarter , safer approach that would reinstate a 90 - day retention period that existed before the current 24 - hour period was implemented by the Bush Administration in 2004 .
They are urging President Obama to do the right thing and put law enforcement and the public first by leaving the Tiahrt Amendments out of the FY 2010 Federal Budget .
Schumer and Gillibrand also called attention to a related problem raised in a recent troubling report in the New York Times .
The article identified the difficulties in tracking weapons are complicating efforts to crack down on violence caused by Mexican drug cartels .
By law , ATF can conduct an inventory audit of a gun dealer once a year .
However , in practice , because ATF staff is stretched thin , gun dealers are inspected far less frequently than that .
As recently as 2007 , ATF estimated that it would take 17 years to inspect every gun dealer in the United States .
This was far from ATF 's stated goal of being able to conduct routine inspections once every three years .
Schumer and Gillibrand wrote a letter today to Attorney General Eric Holder , asking him for an estimate of how much more ATF personnel would be needed in order for the ATF to be able to inspect gun dealers at least every three years , and perhaps annually .
Mediha Abu Haikal , 70
Our house lies right next to the Tel Rumeida settlement .
For years , I 've had heart , diabetes , and blood pressure problems .
Every day , I take eleven different kinds of medication .
Because of my health , I go to medical clinics and hospitals a lot .
Last Wednesday [ 8 April ] , I had edema in my legs and they turned blue , because of the diabetes .
A Red Crescent ambulance took me from my house to the government clinic .
After I was examined there , the ambulance took me to Aliyah Hospital for further examination .
The physician who usually treats me , Dr. Ibrahim al - Hur , was n't in the hospital , and I was told I could make an appointment to see him at his private clinic in the city .
I made an appointment for 11 April .
I preferred not to go back home in the meantime , because it 's so difficult to get in and out of the neighborhood and because of my health problems .
I stayed at my nephew 's house .
On Saturday [ 11 April ] , at around 10:00 A.M. , I went to the doctor 's office .
He examined me , gave me new medications , and calmed me down .
My daughter , Hanaa , went with me .
After seeing the doctor , I decided to go home .
I called the Red Cross , which called the Civil Administration to coordinate my return home by ambulance .
Then my daughter and I went to the Red Crescent Medical Center , in H - 1 [ the part of Hebron under Palestinian control ] , to get into the ambulance that would take me home .
The medical team was waiting , and Hanaa and I were told to get into the ambulance .
The driver was Shaher Mujahed and the paramedic was Ahmad Makhamrah .
When we got to the checkpoint at Gross Square , the soldier at the checkpoint made a telephone call and then let us pass .
The ambulance drove along a - Shuhada Street to get to our house .
When we passed by the gate of the army base , a soldier stopped us and spoke with the driver .
He asked him why he was riding on this road .
The driver explained that we had coordinated the trip with the Red Cross , and that the soldier at Gross Square let us pass , but the soldier did n't let us continue on our way .
He looked angry and told the driver to turn around .
The rock that the child threw into the ambulance .
Photo : Musa Abu Hashhash , 12 April ' 09 ./>
In the meantime , while the driver was preparing to turn around , I saw a child , who looked about twelve years old , and was dressed in white , was wearing a skullcap and had long , curly hair .
He opened the door on the driver 's side and slammed it shut .
Then he bent over and picked up a big rock .
I was afraid he would throw it at us , and my daughter began to shout and asked the driver to get going quickly , before the child throws the rock at us .
The soldier was still standing on the side of the ambulance , and put his hand on the window .
Then the child threw the rock at the rear door of the ambulance , breaking the window , and it fell on the bed inside the ambulance .
It weighed about three kilograms .
Luckily , Hanaa and I were sitting on the seat and were not injured , but small pieces of glass scattered on my clothes .
I began to shake in fear and to cry .
I shouted and then I was just too overwhelmed to speak .
My daughter and the paramedic tried to calm me .
As they did that , another rock , a small one , flew into the ambulance , landing near the big rock .
This one , too , did n't hit me .
The soldier standing next to us did not stop the child from throwing the stones , and let him run away .
He did n't do anything .
The driver immediately turned around and drove back to Gross Square .
The soldier who had let us cross was still there .
The driver told me that he asked why we had returned .
While the soldier was speaking with the driver , I saw more than thirty children run toward the ambulance .
The children began to throw stones at the ambulance and some of them hit it .
My daughter identified , among the children , the child who had attacked us previously .
I heard the soldier shout at the children , and the paramedic quickly got out of the ambulance , opened the gate , and we passed .
The ambulance returned to the medical center .
I was in shock and did n't stop crying , even when we got there .
The paramedics hooked me up to oxygen .
Afterwards , my daughter took me to my nephew 's house , where I stayed until today .
Because it was holiday , it was impossible to coordinate with the Red Cross to enable me to return home sooner .
Today , a Red Crescent ambulance brought me home .
A police patrol car and a Civil Administration patrol car accompanied us , and this time , settlers did n't attack us .
I arrived home around 12:30 P.M.
Just before reaching the house , we were kept waiting for half an hour because a tanker was bringing water to the army .
Since the incident , I have n't been able to calm down .
I am still frightened , and hear the sound of the window shattering .
I do n't know if I 'll ever dare again to ride in an ambulance , I 'm so afraid .
Mediha A'abeid Hamed Abu Haikal , 70 , a widow with five children , is a homemaker and a resident of Tel Rumeida , Hebron .
Her testimony was given to Musa Abu Hashhash at the witness 's house on 14 April 2009 .
The United States is increasingly dependent on information and information technology for both civilian and military purposes , as are many other nations .
Although there is a substantial literature on the potential impact of a cyberattack on the societal infrastructure of the United States , little has been written about the use of cyberattack as an instrument of U.S. policy .
Cyberattacks -- actions intended to damage adversary computer systems or networks -- can be used for a variety of military purposes .
But they also have application to certain missions of the intelligence community , such as covert action .
They may be useful for certain domestic law enforcement purposes , and some analysts believe that they might be useful for certain private sector entities who are themselves under cyberattack .
This report considers all of these applications from an integrated perspective that ties together technology , policy , legal , and ethical issues .
Focusing on the use of cyberattack as an instrument of U.S. national policy , Technology , Policy , Law and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities explores important characteristics of cyberattack .
It describes the current international and domestic legal structure as it might apply to cyberattack , and considers analogies to other domains of conflict to develop relevant insights .
Of special interest to the military , intelligence , law enforcement , and homeland security communities , this report is also an essential point of departure for nongovernmental researchers interested in this rarely discussed topic .
Here 's a message to ­Labour 's wobbling MPs : grow a backbone .
Watching them now , all a -panic as they contemplate their own political demise , some of them beginning to whisper about a leadership challenge to Gordon Brown , it 's hard not to feel a surge of contempt .
These are the folk who only seem to discover their spines when their own perks – or jobs – are in danger .
For years , most of them loyally trooped into the yes lobbies , voting for all kinds of horrors so long as the polls told them their seats were safe .
But when Brown came after their expenses , they suddenly found the courage to say no .
Now that they can see an electoral bloodbath looming , they 're getting antsy again – and dumping all the blame on the man at the top .
All this would have a touch more credibility if these dissenters had cried havoc earlier , when something other than their own careers were on the line .
Instead , Charles Clarke waits till now to announce that he is " ashamed " of being a Labour MP .
As Ken Livingstone pointed out yesterday , that 's odd coming from someone who faithfully stood by while the government made " all its worst decisions , including those that outstrip anything in the past couple of weeks , most obviously the war in Iraq " .
Of course , denying Gurkha veterans their full rights was wrong in every way .
But it 's hard to see why that prompts Clarke 's shame when bombing and invading a country on wholly false grounds did not .
Labour is , as one MP put it to me ­yesterday , now divided into two clear camps : those who have given up all hope of winning the next election – and are therefore devoting all their energies to the " day after defeat , war - gaming ­various scenarios " – and those who still believe the situation is " retrievable " .
That MP is in the latter camp , though he admits it is getting " harder and harder " to persuade himself , let alone others , that defeat is avoidable .
I understand that sense of despair .
For one thing , the starting assumption has to be that all incumbent parties , no matter how well led , are likely to be ejected from power given the current global slump .
Nor do third - term governments tend to be re-elected : 1992 is the exception , not the rule .
Is is also true that Brown represents something novel in British politics .
­Normally the " electability " question hovers over opposition leaders : will the nation really choose this person as their prime minister ?
That proved to be Neil Kinnock 's undoing in 1992 .
David Cameron has no such problem – not even his most bitter critics describe him as un­electable .
Yet the question still ­lingers over the man who is already prime minister , installed in No 10 ­without winning an election in his own party , let alone the country .
These days Brown 's allies do n't bother to deny that when it comes to communication skills , emotional intelligence or the ability to convey empathy , he is simply lacking .
Nor do they pretend that he looks good on TV or is n't cursed by some ­mysterious bad luck when it comes to imagery : how else to explain how he came to be photographed against a backdrop of swastikas when visiting a London school yesterday .
They insist that it is substance , not smooth style , that will count come polling day .
But that is an expression of hope : they will not be able to prove that Brown is electable until he has faced an election .
All of which makes the gloom understandable .
But those itching to place the revolver at Brown 's temple should hesitate .
Some should ask themselves whether they were n't also agitating to get rid of Tony Blair not so long ago , so that Brown could replace him .
The rest should recall that they failed to put up a candidate to stop Brown .
If they feel they were so wrong two years ago , can they be sure they are right now ?
What 's more , the same problem persists : they do n't have a candidate .
They can while away the tearoom hours playing name games with Johnson , Harman et al , but all of them come with their own problems .
A new face might bring a boost , but any gain would be offset by the image of a party first slaying its leader , then turning inward and fighting itself at a time of national economic ­crisis .
Labour could surely not anoint a prime minister without a public mandate a second time – there would have to be an immediate general election .
Do MPs really fancy their chances now , before even the slimmest green shoot is visible ?
If , after it has weighed all that , the Labour party decides it wants to kill the king , then it should do so now , without delay .
Otherwise , they should stand behind him .
As one insider put it yesterday : " They should try rallying around him before they do him in . "
For those at the top table , that means getting on TV , radio and into the papers making the case for the government they are meant to serve .
Margaret
Thatcher 's cabinet used to do that for her , Blair 's did it for him .
Admittedly , it is yet another indictment of Brown that he does not have a praetorian guard of ministers ready to defend his every action ( just as it is a sign of his weakness that Hazel Blears apparently has no fear of losing her job ) .
But if Brown is such a weak communicator , then it falls to those more gifted to take up the slack .
Ours is not meant to be a presidential system : the PM should not be a solo advocate .
Of course , that task will be made easier if there is a better story to tell – and this will have to be Brown 's side of the bargain .
He cannot hope Britons will re-elect him out of humble gratitude for steering them through a recession ( if he does ) .
He also has to offer a full programme for the next five years .
Some of that is in place already – with a speech on education yesterday and one on crime , at long last , to come soon – but there needs to be more .
If he wants to win the loyalty , even the enthusiasm , of his party , a couple of bold strokes could work wonders : ditching ID cards and Trident renewal .
He will also surely have to amend the part - privatisation plans for the Royal Mail , which Jon Cruddas describes as a " remnant left over from the last era " , one that risks splitting the party down the middle .
Ramming it through with Tory support could shatter any remaining backbench loyalty ; abandoning it altogether could , who knows , trigger ­Peter Mandelson 's third resignation – and the first on a matter of principle .
None of this will be easy .
But if Labour MPs want to concentrate the mind , they should look beyond Westminster to the wider UK .
This week sees the halfway mark for the nationalist minority government in Scotland .
When I met the first minister , Alec Salmond , a few days ago he was in ebullient mood .
" They 're going down to a big , big defeat , " he ­predicted for Labour at the next general election .
Meanwhile , the polls show his Scottish National party riding high , on course to increase its majority at the next Holyrood elections in 2011 .
That opens up a gloomy prospect for Labour .
The assumed upside of devolution was that when one of the main parties was out of office in Westminster , they would rule elsewhere in the UK .
But now it looks likely that Labour could be powerless almost everywhere : in Westminster , in Scotland and , given Boris Johnson 's standing , in London too .
Labour is facing a spell in the wilderness every bit as bleak as the long Conservative exile that began in 1997 .
To avoid that fate , Labour and its MPs need to get out – and start fighting for their lives .

A rival group to the Log Cabin Republicans has been formed by one of its former officers , Ben Smith at Politico reports :
" GOPROUD , the new 527 group , will launch next week , according to a
media advisory .
The contact given for the group is Christopher Barron ,
a former Log Cabin political director who broke with the group .
' Essentially , there 's no voice for gay Republicans or gay
conservatives in particular in D.C. right now .
Log Cabin has been
completely and totally absent here in D.C. for months and months , '
Barron said … Barron praised local Log Cabin chapters but said the group has left a void in Washington .
His group would , he said , focus on traditional Republican issues like private health care and private savings accounts .
' If your main issue is hate crimes or [ federal anti-discrimination
legislation ] or marriage , you 're probably not a Republican , ' Barron
said , saying that while he backs gay groups on those other issues , they
should n't be federal priorities . "
In January , LCR was reported to be having a major financial crisis .
TEHRAN --
In central Tehran on Monday , demonstrators and authorities engaged in what has become a near daily cat - and - mouse routine : Protesters gathered in groups of several hundred shouting , " Death to the dictator . "
Iranian security forces chased them , waving batons and sticks , according to witnesses .
The security forces -- present in large numbers -- also used tear gas and fired gunshots into the air to scatter demonstrators .
They easily dispersed the crowd , arresting men and women , dragging them away in handcuffs and loading them onto buses , witnesses said .
The protest was much smaller than recent demonstrations , and Monday appeared to mark the second day of relative calm in Tehran after security responded in force to demonstrations Saturday .
Supporters of opposition candidates have staged more than a week of sometimes - violent protests since the declared victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June 12 polls .
On Monday , Iran 's Guardian Council , a top review panel responsible for investigating election disputes , said it had uncovered some irregularities in the polls , finding the number of votes in 50 districts exceeded the number of voters .
The announcement , made on state - run media , was the first admission by authorities of voting irregularities .
Iranian officials said over the weekend that 10 to 13 people died in Saturday 's violence , in addition to seven officially confirmed dead in the previous week and hundreds who have been injured .
After doing Java / PHP development from Eclipse in Windows or an X11 environment for almost my entire programming career , I found myself in a job where I basically had to switch to the command line for C/C++ development on a large project .
One year and some off months later , I ’ve taken for granted what I ’ve picked up and feel like I should pass on my knowledge to people who might just be starting out .
What follows is a list of things I wish I had known over a year ago , or how I learned to stop worrying and love the shell .
screen
Cheat Sheet : Screen VT100 / ANSI
Terminal Emulator br Peteris Krumins
. screenrc link : from dotfiles.org
GNU screen is a full - screen window manager for the shell , and is the single most useful command line utility I ’ve come across .
You create multiple windows within screen and you can “ alt - tab ” between them with [ Ctrl-a X ] commands ( X is : ( n ) ext , ( p ) revious , ( a ) last , etc ) .
I found that screen was initially a little daunting because by default it did n’t have a status bar , but you can fix that by creating a . screenrc in your home directory ( check the link above for some example .screenrcs ) .
By exclusively using the keyboard , I ’ve found it a lot quicker to switch between different programs .
I often have Vim open in one screen , cgdb in another , a free shell in another , and a log file in another .
Screen also get you regions where you can split your console in half horizontally and have the top and bottom halves holding different windows ( you switch between them with [ Ctrl - a < tab > ] ) .
Screen lets you keep a persistent work space .
If you ’re ssh'ed in somewhere and your connection drops , screen keeps your session active ; just reconnect over ssh and run [ screen - xRR ] to pull up your session exactly where you left it .
The -x lets you connect to a screen session from more than one location , which means that screen is also extremely useful for collaboration .
If you ’re ssh'ed into a machine and you want to work with someone else , give them your credentials / rlogin access and have them run [ screen - xRR ] to connect to your active session .
I ’ve used this for help with a remote colleague and to teaching colleagues / leading education sessions that involve the shell .
Vim ( for development )
Cheat Sheet : Vim Quick Reference Card by Laurent Grégoire
.vimrc link : from dotfiles.org
I fought this for a while .
I really did .
You could pry Eclipse from my cold dead hands .
I “ grew up ” as a coder using Eclipse for Java and PHP projects , so nothing else seemed to make sense .
The way our development environment is set up though , there was really no good way to use Eclipse because everything is done on a remote development box , and they wo n’t let us run Eclipse and forward over X ( which is reasonable ; Eclipse has a lot of overhead ) .
I tried mounting the filesystem locally with sshfs so my local Eclipse could access the remote files , but I changed connections enough that sshfs was n’t a viable option .
Faced with that fact and that the development machines really only had ( g ) vim and ( x ) emacs , coupled with the fact that many of our source code management utilites used Vim , I decided to take the plunge .
I went with Vim over Gvim so that I could run it from within screen , but that ’s a small detail .
After developing in Vim for about half a year , I ca n’t look back .
I even started programming Python / Django in Vim .
More than just an editor , it ’s kind of changed my entire development mindset , on the same level as switching from any other email client to Gmail .
Vim has changed :
how I navigate code .
If I can remember a keyword for where I want to be , I just search - navigate there with [ < ESC > / Keyword < ENTER > ( ‘ n ’ as needed ) ] .
It ’s a lot quicker than it ever was for me in Eclipse using Find or the mouse .
the amount of code I have to keep in my head at any point in time .
Last night I tried installing Netbeans at a friend ’s recommendation .
What immediately struck me was , “ I ca n’t see the code anymore ! ”
By keeping the code fullscreened all the time , keeping multiple tabs open for different files , and being able to quickly navigate between sections , I remember where stuff is instead of what the stuff is .
Keeping this lookup table in my mind allows me to hold larger chunks of functionality in my head , and quickly jump to implementation when I need details .
Quick tips :
tabs ( Vim 7.x ) : open vim with several tabs by calling [ vim - p file1 file2 ] .
From within vim , [ : tabnew file1 ] will do the same .
[ < ESC > gt ] lets you cycle through tabs
regions : these let you divide the screen into sections .
[ Ctrl-w s ] splits horizontally and [ Ctrl-w v ] splits vertically .
I prefer a vertical split so that I can keep reference source code in one region and where I ’m coding in the region next to it .
Another nice thing about Vim is that a lot of standard Linux utilities use the same syntax .
Search and replace , for example , is [ s/ search / replace /g ] , which happens to be the same syntax for doing a search and replace in sed ( see below ) .
One bug I ’ve found is that using vim with screen is that vim does n’t always redraw the screen correctly ; [ ctrl-l ] is sometimes useful ( although that does n’t always seem to redraw completely either ) .
Note : if you prefer emacs , that ’s fine .
I do n’t care .
It ’s the same thing as Vim as far as I ’m concerned .
gdb/cgdb
Cheat Sheet : GDB Quick Reference from SmashTheStack
If you have to use gdb for debugging C/C++ applications , I strongly recommend cgdb , the curses GNU debugger .
You get a horizontal split screen with Vim at the top and gdb at the bottom .
Vim follows along in the source code as you step through .
I know X11 gdb interfaces exist , but X11 apps do n’t play well with screen , so I avoid them .
Here are some general purpose gdb commands that I ’ve found useful :
set scheduler - locking [ on / off ] – very important for multithreaded apps !
Turn this on and it prevents other threads from running when you ’re stepping through a section of code .
It ’s important to only turn this on after you ’ve hit your breakpoint and turn it back off when you want to continue execution .
set print pretty on – formats objects more prettier for your viewing pleasure .
set logging [ on / off ] – turn it on , print a variable , turn it off .
This will dump the object to gdb.txt in your current directory .
Various command line utilities
xargs : great for piping output of one command sequentially to another .
I ’m trying to cut down on [ for i in `cmd` ] usage in favor of this ; it feels cleaner .
grep : one of the most versatile and useful commands I ’ve used .
Useful options are [ grep -{C , B , A} n ] for n lines of context around , before , or after ; - i for insensitive ; -n for line number .
Very useful input for piping to other commands ( like xargs ) .
sed : stream editor , great for search / replace on the fly ( as well as other simple text commands ) .
awk : great for extracting parts of a line of input , i.e. grabbing a column from a text file or command [ awk ’{print $ 2} ’ ] .
tee : like a plumbers tee ; it takes input from STDIN and passes back to STDOUT while also copying to a file you specify .
Useful in conjunction with sudo when you need to echo something to a file : if file .
txt is root owned , [ sudo echo “ hello ” > file .
txt ] runs echo as sudo and does n’t give sudo access to the >>. [ echo “ hello ” | sudo tee file .
txt ] will do what you want .
nohup : run a process detached in the background ; persists between logouts ( be sure to put & at the end of the command ) .
diff : pretty standard utility , but this is what I use it for : I loop through all the files I ’ve modified and diff to the previous version , then pipe to a grep where I can search for something I think I ’ve changed – but ca n’t remember where .
find : a lot more convenient for recursively listing all files contained within a directory than ls. [ find . ] gets you a list of everything , and [ find / path - name < name > ] lets you filter .
You can use wildcards , just make sure that you escape them so that BASH does n’t expand them before find sees them .
It ’s useful to pipe filenames from find to xargs , use the [ - print0 ] switch if you filenames with spaces give you problems .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) --
The financial sector will make up a smaller part of the U.S. economy in the future as new regulations clamp down on " massive risk - taking , " President Barack Obama said in an interview published Saturday .
Obama , whose young administration has spearheaded a raft of reforms in the banking sector as part of efforts to tackle the financial crisis , said the industry 's role in the United States would look different at the end of the current recession .
" What I think will change , what I think was an aberration , was a situation where corporate profits in the financial sector were such a heavy part of our overall profitability over the last decade , " he told the New York Times Magazine .
" Part of that has to do with the effects of regulation that will inhibit some of the massive leveraging and the massive risk - taking that had become so common . "
Obama said some of the job - seekers who may normally have gone to the financial sector would shift to other areas of the economy , such as engineering .
" Wall Street will remain a big , important part of our economy , just as it was in the '70s and the ' 80s .
It just wo n't be half of our economy , " he said .
" We do n't want every single college grad with mathematical aptitude to become a derivatives trader . "
The Obama administration in March proposed sweeping reforms to curb risk - taking on Wall Street and close regulatory gaps to prevent the kind of excesses that led to the worst financial crisis since the 1930s Great Depression .
The president said in the interview that better regulation would help restore confidence in the U.S. financial system .
" A more vigorous regulatory regime , I think , will help restore confidence , and you 're still going to see a lot of global capital wanting to park itself in the United States , " he said .
Regaining trust and confidence
Obama expressed optimism that the market for securitized products would pick up , though he said that could take time .
The Federal Reserve , with taxpayer capital from the U.S. Treasury , is supporting consumer and real estate lending markets through a loan facility that could reach $ 1 trillion .
Holders of existing asset - backed and commercial mortgage - backed securities can get loans from the Fed by putting up their securities as collateral .
The facility aims to unclog frozen credit markets and jumpstart securitization .
" We 're going to have to determine whether or not as a consequence of some of the steps that the Fed has been taking , the Treasury has been taking , that we see the market for securitized products restored , " Obama said .
" I 'm optimistic that ultimately we 're going to be able to get that part of the financial sector going again , but it could take some time to regain confidence and trust . "
Part of Obama 's regulatory reforms include the creation of a new " systemic risk regulator " with broad powers to seize large non -bank financial firms , such as insurers , hedge funds or private equity companies , if they are deemed to threaten the stability of the financial system .
Large , " systemically important " firms would be required to hold bigger capital cushions .
Obama also said financial rules should be crafted according to what an institution actually does to avoid a regulatory gap in areas such as commercial and investment banking .
" Other countries that have not seen some of the problems in their financial markets that we have nevertheless do n't separate between investment banks and commercial banks , " he said , citing Canada as one example in that area .
" The experience in a country like Canada would indicate that good , strong regulation that focuses less on the legal form of the institution and more on the functions that they 're carrying out is probably the right approach to take . "

Guest blogger Brian Boyer is a hacker journalist who writes about the intersection of technology and journalism .
He ’s worked at public - interest journalism site ProPublica and is now at the Chicago Tribune , building their new News Applications team .
It ’s not news that journalism is in crisis .
CNN turned newspapers into first - day fishwrap and Craigslist killed the business model .
Solutions are scarce , and our democracy is at risk .
I do n’t have a chart to guide our way through the darkness to Citizenry 2.0 , but there are some who can navigate the singularity .
Journalism needs great hackers .
Not just nerds , but programmers who care — about the values of journalism and the power of a free press to hold government accountable .
Luckily , hackers are a freedom - minded bunch .
The free software movement is rooted in many of the same principals that guide journalism .
But news organizations are n’t very sexy places to work — especially now , as layoffs , bankruptcy and closures plague the industry .
So how can we bring nerds to the news ?
One old - skool school is trying .
Free beer school !
Tell your programmer friends :
The Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University is giving away full scholarships , plus expenses , to software developers .
They can get a masters degree in journalism , gratis , from one of the most prestigious J - schools around .
I recently graduated from the year - long program , during which I studied with with one other hacker and ~ 45 brilliant ‘ normal ’ journalism students .
I interviewed lawmakers , farmers and shopkeepers and wrote stories about agriculture , waterways , and the diabetes epidemic in Illinois .
It was difficult to shake my introverted , google - first , face - to - face - as - a - last - resort programmer nature .
But it was also thrilling .
Journalism is an info - geek ’s dream .
You ’re constantly learning new topics , speaking with experts , and distilling real - world issues to their essence — all in the mission of informing the folks who do n’t have time to soak up all that data .
It ’s like being paid to write a new Wikipedia article every day .
We also wrote some software .
My programmer colleague and I banged out enviroVOTE in a frenetic weekend of coding and coffee in the days preceding the election .
The night of , we were tied to our keyboards , tallying results and tweeting updates while the rest of the world was watching TV .
Such is the life of a journalist .
For our final project at Medill , the two coders and four non-coder new - media students built NewsMixer , an experiment in integrating social networks with news coverage .
It was one of the first applications to roll out on Facebook Connect , and remains one of the only apps that explores its full potential .
All the code is GPL ’ed and has already spawned other open - source projects .
This is the time to remake journalism
Programmers have been making an impact in the news world for some time , but until recently most innovation in this space has been in creating new ways to present the old style .
With a few shining exceptions like the datavisuals by the New York Times , most online news could have been written on a typewriter and mailed to Google for indexing .
Then , something amazing happened : Software won a Pulitzer Prize .
Created by hacker journalist Matt Waite and other fantastically clever folks at the St. Petersburgh Times , PolitiFact is form of news that could only exist online .
Aron Pilhofer , leader of the innovations team at the NYT , put it perfectly :
But is it journalism , some people asked ?
There ’s no lead per se , no narrative and no pyramids anywhere to be found , much less the inverted sort .
Journalism is about helping people make sense of important issues , and how those issues affect them personally .
It ’s about uncovering that which someone wants to keep hidden .
It ’s about holding people we place in high public office accountable .
And by those definitions …
PolitiFact more than meets the test .
It takes a traditional form of newspaper reporting — fact - checking what politicians say — and scales it up in a way only possible on the web .
The NYT ’s Represent and its open - source cousin , Repsheet , are innovations much in the same vein , and their existence is a sign of the times .
The tools now available to hackers are so great that we can think far beyond content management systems .
The moment has come when a couple of great hackers can knock out a fully - fledged new form of media in a matter of weeks .
Tell the Twitterati : there are lights in the distance .
Hackers wanted
The news is waiting to be saved .
We have the technology , all we need is more nerds .
So ditch your boring corporate gigs and come to journalism !
Democracy is one hell of a fun problem to hack .
State regulators on Monday fined UCLA more than $ 31,000 for three “ serious ” violations of workplace safety laws in the fatal burning of a staff research assistant in a Dec. 29 chemistry lab fire .
The findings by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health concluded that Sheharbano “ Sheri ” Sangji , 23 , had not been properly trained and was not wearing protective clothing when an experiment exploded , spreading second - and third - degree burns over 43 % of her body .
She died 18 days later .
Cal / OSHA also cited UCLA for not addressing deficiencies noted in an internal safety inspection two months before the fatal fire in professor Patrick Harran ’s organic chemistry laboratory , including a finding that workers were not wearing lab coats .
The 10 - page report , which contained scant detail of the Cal / OSHA investigation , left many questions unanswered about the lab ’s protocols , equipment and supervision , said Sangji ’s sister , Naveen , a Harvard medical student .
“ This report sheds very little light on the incident .
Sheri went to work that day and never got the chance to come home , ” she said .
“ She suffered agonizing injuries , and these . . . pages do not explain what happened or how it happened . ”
Cal / OSHA officials said the UCLA fine was the largest among seven recent cases involving accidents at academic research labs or those in the chemical and biotechnology industries .
Fines in the six previous cases , which included serious injuries but not fatalities , ranged from $ 1,200 to $ 19,135 .
“ The important point to make here is that these penalties are not designed to compensate for injury or loss of life , ” said Dean Fryer , a Cal / OSHA spokesman , explaining that the fines merely address the civil violations of workplace regulations .
As in any accident resulting in death , Fryer said , Cal / OSHA will prepare an additional report to present to the Los Angeles County district attorney for consideration of criminal prosecution .
Cal / OSHA as a matter of routine does not contact the district attorney before civil penalties are assessed .
UCLA officials , who ordered a comprehensive review of lab safety after Sangji died , said they would not appeal the fines .
New measures in place or in the works include increased inspections , a shortened time span for correcting serious violations and the purchase of flame - resistant lab coats .
“ Although substantial progress has already been made , we will continue to thoroughly monitor and assess our lab training and safety protocols as an integral component of our daily operations , ” Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement .
“ The Cal / OSHA report will provide critical assistance with these ongoing efforts . ”
Sangji was transferring about two ounces of t- butyl lithium from one sealed container to another when a plastic syringe came apart in her hands , splashing her with a chemical compound that ignites instantly when exposed to air .
The resulting flash fire set ablaze her rubber gloves and synthetic sweater .
The $ 31,875 fine issued Monday included $ 18,000 for the fact that she was n’t wearing a lab coat , which might have kept her highly flammable sweater from catching fire .
Serious violations carry a maximum fine of $ 25,000 and a base penalty of $ 18,000 , which can be increased or reduced based on the circumstances .
Born and raised in Pakistan , Sangji graduated in 2008 from Pomona College in Claremont with plans to become a lawyer .
While applying to law schools , she took a $ 46,000 - a- year job in October in a lab run by Harran , a researcher with a rising reputation in organic chemistry .
A former member of the faculty at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , he joined the UCLA faculty in July as the first Donald J. Cram Chair in Organic Chemistry , according to his biography on UCLA ’s website .
A day after the fire , Harran told a UCLA investigator that a syringe “ was the appropriate method ” for transferring t- butyl lithium , and that Sangji had been trained how to do it .
But Harran did not know when that training occurred and had no record of it , as required by Cal / OSHA and UCLA lab safety standards .
Two months before the fire , an annual safety inspection conducted Oct. 30 uncovered more than two dozen deficiencies in Harran ’s four labs , including the one where Sangji worked .
Among other things , inspectors found excessive amounts of flammable liquids , and workers who lacked the required lab coats and other required safety gear , such as rubber gloves and eye protection .
Some of the fixes were made immediately , Harran later told colleagues in e-mails , but others were delayed because the lab was in the process of moving to another floor and was to have been reinspected afterward .
A campus safety official agreed to the delayed reinspection , according to UCLA records reviewed by The Times .
In a statement Monday , Harran said that he and his students “ deeply mourn the death of our friend Sheri Sangji , ” describing her as exceptionally gifted .
He also said that although it is important to develop a culture of lab safety , the inspection and training records that have garnered scrutiny since Sangji ’s death had little relation to the accident .
“ Sheri was an experienced chemist and published researcher who exuded confidence and had performed this experiment before in my lab , ” he said .
“ However , it seems evident , based on mistakes investigators tell us were made that day , I underestimated her understanding of the care necessary when working with such materials . ”

Cambodian troops said today a brief gunfight broke out with Thai soldiers at their tense border near the 11th century Preah Vihear temple , the site of increasingly regular conflicts between the neighbours .
Cambodian soldiers fired on some 60 Thai troops after they entered Cambodian territory , sparking a gun battle that lasted about 10 minutes , said Yim Kheang , a Cambodian soldier at the border .
He said no Cambodian troops were wounded .
" We are on alert , and we are ready for fighting at any time , " he told the Associated Press .
" If Thai soldiers come here , Cambodian soldiers will open fire without warning . "
Thai military officials could not immediately be reached for comment .
The two sides regularly dispute each others ' claims .
Yesterday , a Thai soldier in the area lost his leg after stepping on a land mine , but Thai and Cambodian military officials disagreed over which country he was in at the time .
The cliff - top Preah Vihear temple , near the countries ' ill - defined border , has been a source of conflict for decades .
Troops from both countries have been stationed at the border since July 2008 , and two clashes near the temple last year sparked brief concerns of war .
Cambodia and Thailand share a land border , much of which has never been clearly demarcated because the countries refer to different maps .

Stress and anger often go hand in hand .
As your stress levels rise , so do your levels of frustration and tension .
Likewise , repressed or uncontrolled anger can cause aggravation and stress .
If you think you have a problem handling anger and stress in your life , you may want to consider seeing a counselor .
Effectively handling your anger requires a combination of stress and anger management exercises .
You can learn these techniques on your own or discuss them with your therapist for maximum benefit .
Physical Exercise
Physical exercise is one of the most effective methods for reducing anger and stress , according to author Vicki L. Schutt in her book , " How to Effectively Control Your Anger . "
Physical exercise provides you with an opportunity to release your emotions , especially if you feel as if you 're about to explode .
Additionally , exercise can help to reduce stress levels by increasing your body 's production of endorphins , which are natural " feel - good " neurotransmitters that promote feelings of well - being .
The next time you feel stressed or angry , try going for a run or a walk .
Reframing Exercise
Reframing is a mental technique used to diffuse hostile feelings and anger , according to author Richard West and Lynn H. Turner in their book , " Understanding Interpersonal Communication : Making Choices in Changing Times . "
It helps by changing your attitude about a given situation and changing the " frame " around it so you can see it in a more positive , productive light .
Write down your negative , angry feelings for two days .
Any time you experience a negative or angry thought , write it down .
At the end of these two days , see if you can notice a theme in your thought patterns .
Perhaps there is a general feeling or need that is not being met .
Take one of the negative , angry thoughts you 've written down and try to figure out a positive or productive counter - argument .
For example , if you 've written " I hate everyone , " or " Everyone is out to get me , " you could think , " Everyone has bad days , other people have problems , too . "
This exercise is most helpful if you are able to discuss your reactions with a therapist or trusted friend .
Deep Breathing
Deep breathing exercises can help you to relax , take time out and help you to gain control over yourself and the situation you 're in .
Deep breathing can reduce stress and anger by re-focusing your mind on bodily sensations instead of negative , volatile thoughts .
According to the University of Maryland Medical Center , deep breathing exercises can help your body to relax itself .
Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down .
Place one hand on your stomach and close your eyes .
Inhale and focus on filling your abdominal area , then your chest , with breath .
Pause , and slowly exhale .
Continue breathing in this manner until you feel calmer and more relaxed .
Progressive Relaxation
Progressive relaxation is a technique that can relieve stress , anger and tension .
According to the University of Maryland Medical Center , this exercise is best performed lying down .
You consciously tense and relax the major muscle groups in your body .
Close your eyes , and tense your toes and feet for a few seconds , then release .
Next , tense your calves and lower leg , then release .
Continue tensing and relaxing your muscles until you get to your head .
As you tense and relax each muscle , breathe deeply and allow your mind to focus solely on the physical sensations you are experiencing .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Burqas are not welcome in France because they are a symbol of the subjugation of women , President Nicolas Sarkozy said Monday .
Protestors demonstrate against the ban on Muslim women wearing the burqa in public in The Hague , November 30 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Toussaint Kluiters
In his first public comments on an issue fuelling passionate debate , he backed a group of French legislators who expressed concern last week that more and more Muslim women were wearing the garments that cover the face and body from head to toe .
“ The issue of the burqa is not a religious issue , it is a question of freedom and of women ’s dignity , ” Sarkozy said .
“ The burqa is not a religious sign , it is a sign of the subjugation , of the submission of women .
I want to say solemnly that it will not be welcome on our territory . ”
His remarks won strong applause from legislators during a wide - ranging speech at the grandiose Palace of Versailles .
France , home to Europe ’s largest Muslim minority , is divided over how to reconcile secular values with religious freedom .
Many see the burqa as an infringement of women ’s rights and say it is being imposed on many Muslim women by fundamentalists .
“ We cannot accept that some women in our country are prisoners behind a grille , cut off from social life , deprived of their identity , ” Sarkozy said .
He backed a cross-party initiative by some 60 legislators for a parliamentary commission to find ways to stop the burqa ’s spread .
DIVISIVE ISSUE
“ All views must be expressed ... I tell you , we must not be ashamed of our values , we must not be afraid of defending them , ” Sarkozy said .
This new debate is reminiscent of a controversy that raged for a decade in France about Muslim girls wearing headscarves in class .
Eventually , a law in 2004 banned pupils from wearing conspicuous signs of their religion at state schools .
Critics say the law stigmatized Muslims at a time when the country should be trying to heal a rift between mainstream society and many youths from an immigrant background , caused by decades of discrimination on the job and housing markets .
The sight of women in burqas is rare in most parts of France .
Statistics are not available but anecdotal evidence suggests that in some areas the number wearing them is rising .
Cabinet members are divided on whether a ban is appropriate .
The secretary of state in charge of regenerating poor urban neighborhoods , feminist firebrand Fadela Amara , supports a total ban , which a government spokesman said was possible .
But Immigration Minister Eric Besson said a ban would n’t work , while the secretary of state in charge of families , Nadine Morano , warned that some women could end up confined to their homes if they were not allowed to go out wearing burqas .
A government - approved body representing French Muslims spoke out against a ban Saturday , saying it would breach individual freedoms and stigmatize Muslims .

The melting of one of the world 's largest ice sheets would alter the Earth 's field of gravity and even its rotation in space so much that it would cause sea levels along some coasts to rise faster than the global average , scientists said yesterday .
The rise in sea levels would be highest on the west and east coasts of North America where increases of 25 per cent more than the global average would cause catastrophic flooding in cities such as New York , Washington DC and San Francisco .
A study into how the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to global warming has found its disintegration would change the focus of the planet 's gravitational field , so sea levels would rise disproportionately more around North America than in other parts of the world .
If the ice sheet covering West Antarctica disappears , the loss of so much mass from the southern hemisphere would effectively make the pull of gravity stronger in the northern hemisphere , affecting the spin of the Earth and causing sea levels to rise higher here than in the south , where the mass of ice is currently located .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , the scientists also estimated that the global average sea level would not rise as much as previously expected due to the ice sheet melting into the oceans .
This is because parts of the ice sheet are more stable than previously thought , and so would probably not slip into the sea even in a warmer world caused by man-made emissions of greenhouse gases , they found .
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet – one of the three great ice sheets of the world – is often referred to as the " sleeping giant " because it is believed to be inherently unstable , given much of its base rests on rock that is below sea level .
This is thought to make it vulnerable to melting and relatively rapid disintegration , said Professor Jonathan Bamber of Bristol University .
" Unlike the world 's other major ice sheets – the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Greenland – the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is the only one with such an unstable configuration , " Professor Bamber said .
" There 's a vast body of research that 's looked at the likelihood of an ice sheet collapse and what implications such a catastrophic event would have for the globe .
But all of these studies have assumed a five - or six - metre [ 16 ft to 20 ft ] contribution to sea level rise .
Our calculations show those estimates are much too large , even on a 1,000 - year timescale , " he said .
A better approximation , according to a study published in the journal Science , is that the ice sheet would contribute about 11 feet ( 3.3 metres ) to the global average sea level .
However , it is not known how fast the ice sheet might disappear if global temperatures continue to rise , although many scientists believe this would take at least 500 or even 1,000 years .
" The pattern of sea level rise is independent of how fast or how much of the ice sheet collapses .
Even if it contributed only a metre of sea level rise over many years , sea levels along North America 's shorelines would still increase 25 per cent more than the global average , " said Professor Bamber .
With less mass at the South Pole , and more water in the oceans , the Earth 's gravity field would weaken in the southern hemisphere and strengthen in the northern hemisphere , causing water to pile up in the northern oceans , Professor Bamber said .
This redistribution of mass would also affect the Earth 's rotation , which in turn would cause water to build up along the North American continent and in the Indian Ocean , Professor Bamber added .
Why the sea is n't as flat as you think
* Sea levels around the world vary widely on a daily basis because of tides caused by the gravitational influence of the Moon .
They also vary from one region to another because of the variations in the Earth 's field of gravity , and the spin of the planet of its axis of rotation .
* Global average sea levels can vary over time because of the thermal expansion of the sea caused by global warming , as well as the effect of rising sea levels caused by melting ice sheets and glaciers .
Local sea levels can also be affected by land sinking or rising .
Land sinking is partly responsible for causing sea levels in the south east of England to rise .
A search by police and the army is now under way around Bat Ayin A Palestinian attacker wielding an axe has killed an Israeli boy and wounded another in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank , police say .
The incident took place in the Bat Ayin settlement south of Bethlehem .
The attacker is reported to have escaped .
Doctors said the fatality was a 13 - year - old , Shlomo Nativ , while a seven - year - old boy suffered serious wounds .
The military wing of Islamic Jihad and Imad Mughniyeh Group said they carried out the attack , Israel Radio reports .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attack as a " senseless act of brutality against innocents " .
Reports say it appears to be the latest of sporadic attacks by Palestinians in Israeli - occupied territory .

Livni condemns new Israel leaders Musician ordered out of West Bank
It is also the first such incident since the right - leaning government of Prime Minister Netanyahu took office .
There are fears that the killing could heighten tensions between the Israeli cabinet and the Palestinians .
Mr Netanyahu 's foreign minister has declared his government will abandon the Annapolis agreement and go back to the so - called roadmap for peace .
According to the roadmap , the Palestinians first have to take a number of steps on security before going on to solve the final issues involved in creating their own state , the BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says .
Eyewitness account Israeli TV reported that the attacker was a local Palestinian .
A massive search by police and the army is now under way around Bat Ayin , which is inhabited by about 1,000 religious settlers .
Settler leader Shaul Goldstein said security guards managed to shoot the attacker , but he escaped .
One witness , who said his name was Avinoam , described trying to wrestle the man .
" I was near the settlement offices when I saw a Palestinian with an axe running toward me , " he told Israeli television .
" I managed to block his arm , we fell to the ground and struggled but he managed to run away .
" I called for help , another resident fired at him , but missed .
" When I got up , I saw a child wounded in the head .
I cried to warn his mother , who ran toward him , " he said .
More than 400,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , areas which were captured by Israeli in the 1967 war .
All Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territory are regarded as illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .

NEW DELHI 
The ethnic Tamil separatist rebels of Sri Lanka , one of the world ’s most feared and enduring guerrilla movements , acknowledged Sunday that their war of more than a quarter - century for a homeland had “ reached its bitter end . ”
The announcement by their group , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , coming as the Sri Lankan military said it was conducting final mop - up operations on a tiny sliver of coast that had been the rebels ’ last refuge , paves the way for the conclusion of Asia ’s longest - running civil war .
It does not , however , eliminate the possibility of guerrilla strikes .
The L.T.T.E. , as the rebels are often called , are known for suicide bombings .
And the statement by their spokesman , Selvarasa Pathmanathan , posted on the pro-rebel Web site , TamilNet , pointed to the group ’s “ fearless and unending commitment to this cause . ”
" This battle has reached its bitter end , " Mr. Pathmanathan said .
" We have decided to silence our guns . "
The statement made no mention of surrender and did not concede defeat , but the acknowledgment of finality suggested that the rebels knew the war was over .
When a group of fans of the Dune books received a copyright threat from the estate of Frank Herbert , they took the path of least resistance : they renamed and altered their re-creation of the novel 's setting – a loving tribute created inside the virtual world of Second Life – so that it was no longer so recognisable as an homage to Herbert 's classic science fiction novels .
The normal thing to do here is to rail at the stupidity of the Herbert estate in attacking these fans .
After all , they were n't taking money out of the pockets of the estate , the chance of trademark dilution in this case is infinitesimal , the creators were celebrating and spreading their love for the series , they are assuredly all major fans and customers for the products the estate is trying to market , their little Second Life re-creation was obscure and unimportant to all but its users , and the estate 's legal resources could surely be better used in finding new ways to make money than in finding new ways to alienate its best customers .
But that 's not what this column is about .
What I want to ask is , how did we end up with a copyright law that only protects critics , while leaving fans out in the cold ?
Some background : copyright 's regulatory contours allow for many kinds of use without permission from the copyright holder .
For example , if you 're writing a critical review of a book , copyright allows you to include quotations from the book for the purpose of criticism .
Giving authors the right to choose which critics are allowed to make their points with quotes from the original work is obvious bad policy .
It 's a thick - skinned author indeed who'd arm his most devastating critics with the whips they need to score him .
The courts have historically afforded similar latitude to parodists , on much the same basis : if you 're engaged in the parodical mockery of a work , it 's a little much to expect that the work 's author will give her blessing to your efforts .
The upshot of this is that you 're on much more solid ground if you want to quote or otherwise reference a work for the purposes of rubbishing it than if you are doing so to celebrate it .
This is one of the most perverse elements of copyright law : the reality that loving something does n't confer any right to make it a part of your creative life .
The damage here is twofold : first , this privileges creativity that knocks things down over things that build things up .
The privilege is real : in the 21st century , we all rely on many intermediaries for the publication of our works , whether it 's YouTube , a university web server , or a traditional publisher or film company .
When faced with legal threats arising from our work , these entities know that they 've got a much stronger case if the work in question is critical than if it is celebratory .
In the digital era , our creations have a much better chance of surviving the internet 's normal background radiation of legal threats if you leave the adulation out and focus on the criticism .
This is a selective force in the internet 's media ecology : if you want to start a company that lets users remix TV shows , you 'll find it easier to raise capital if the focus is on taking the piss rather than glorifying the programmes .
Second , this perverse system acts as a censor of genuine upwellings of creativity that are worthy in their own right , merely because they are inspired by another work .
It 's in the nature of beloved works that they become ingrained in our thinking , become part of our creative shorthand , and become part of our visual vocabulary .
It 's no surprise , then , that audiences are moved to animate the characters that have taken up residence in their heads after reading our books and seeing our movies .
The celebrated American science - fiction writer Steven Brust produced a fantastic , full - length novel , My Own Kind of Freedom , inspired by the television show Firefly .
Brust did n't – and probably can't – receive any money for this work , but he wrote it anyway , because , he says , " I could n't help myself " .
Brust circulated his book for free and was lucky enough that Joss Whedon , Firefly 's creator , did n't see fit to bring legal action against him .
But if he had been sued , Brust would have been on much stronger grounds if his novel had been a savage parody that undermined everything Whedon had made in Firefly .
The fact that Brust wrote his book because he loved Whedon 's work would have been a mark against him in court .
This is n't a plea for unlimited licence to commercially exploit the creations of others .
It 's fitting that commercial interests who plan on making new works from yours seek your permission under the appropriate circumstances .
Nor is this a plea to eliminate the vital aid to free expression that we find in copyright exceptions that protect criticism .
Rather , it 's a vision of copyright that says that fannish celebration – the noncommercial , cultural realm of expression and creativity that has always accompanied commercial art , but only lately attained easy visibility thanks to the internet – should get protection , too .
That once an artist has put their works in our head , made them part of our lives , we should be able to live those lives .
Just following up on PO’ Neill ’s post ( here ) on the IMF loan to Serbia , where he says :
Finally , since this request would seem to shave another $ 2 billion of whatever headroom the IMF thought it had for such programs , getting them more space to lend might soon be a priority agenda item at the London Summit .
This is absolutely the point .
The Financial Times today quotes Simon Johnson , a former IMF chief economist now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , to the effect that : â€œWe are seeing the consequences of the lack of IMF resources .
Programmes are probably undersized because the IMF is worried about running out of money.â€ and Ken Rogoff , another former chief economist , who said : â€ œThe IMF doesnâ€™t have nearly the resources to backstop all of eastern Europe.â€ 
Mr Rogoff echoed calls from Robert Zoellick , World Bank president , for the EU to take a leading role in rescuing eastern Europe .
But the European Commission has already spent nearly â‚ ¬10bn ( $ 12.6bn , Â £ 8.8 bn ) of its â‚ ¬25bn rescue fund on Hungary and Latvia , and EU governments have yet to provide more resources .
According to the FT the IMF , which has $ 142bn in quickly available resources and $ 50bn it can raise rapidly , recently finalised an agreement to borrow an extra $ 100bn from Japan and is seeking a further $ 150 bn from other member governments .
The question no one seems to be thinking about is the “ what if ” one of possible defaults .
If the IMF borrow $ 100 billion from Japan , and the loans are defaulted on , then who covers the debt , or do we just turn the IMF into another “ bad bank ” ?
I do n’t think people are being at all responsible here .
Ukraine , Belarus and Serbia all have shrinking and rapidly ageing populations , the possibility of defaults here are high , in each case , and it is quite possible we will see continually shrinking GDPs which will effectively turn these countries into IMF economic protectorates ( in the absence of some other multilateral agency being created in the mid term to handle the problem ) .
Hungary and Latvia both look like being dangerously close to default come 2012 if emergency measures are not taken soon ( the IMF programmes as currently structured simply cannot work , in either case ) , and they could quickly be followed down the same road by Bulgaria and Romania .
Basically we need some sort of order putting back into this whole situation before things simply get out of hand , simply talking about reform of the IMF quota system is absurd at this point .
Europe needs to act , and act decisively .
Above all we need something which is sorely lacking from our leaders at the moment , a feeling that they are able to rise to the scale of the problem and start to act , rather than simply react .
If you think what we have so far is bad , you just wait till you get to see what comes next .
Space will be the final frontier for tourists if Sir Richard Branson has his way .
Getting there wo n't be easy on the wallet -- but it wo n't be so hard on the planet , either , contends the British adventurer and Virgin Group founder , who touched down at Washington 's National Press Club recently .
" Very environmentally friendly , " Branson said .
" The [ carbon ] cost of us putting someone into space will be less than flying to London and back on a commercial plane . "
Five years and $ 150 million into his Virgin Galactic venture , Branson has a bona fide spaceship to show for it .
Over the past few months , pilots have conducted several test flights of the space - launch vehicle Eve .
The mother ship -- named after the billionaire 's mum -- is designed to ferry SpaceShipTwo and its two pilots and six astronauts more than 50,000 feet above the Earth 's surface .
From the stratosphere , SpaceShipTwo would blast to a sub-orbital altitude of about 360,000 feet using hybrid rockets .
A " whole new era of space travel " may be nigh , boasted Branson , who plans to go boldly where just a few tourists have gone before .
SpaceShipTwo is slated for completion by the end of the year , he said , followed by about 18 months of testing .
Scientists James Lovelock and Stephen Hawking are among 300 passengers queued up to ride in Branson 's spacecraft .
Contrary to rumors , " Star Trek " alumnus William Shatner is not among them , Virgin Galactic President Will Whitehorn said in an interview .
A ticket to ride is $ 200,000 -- perhaps chump change for Branson but a king 's ransom for the rest of us .
It is the " trip of a lifetime , " Virgin Galactic 's online portal promises .
" Reserve your place in space now and look forward to three days of training in preparation with your crew , " the sales pitch continues .
" Traveling at over three times the speed of sound to a distance of around 360,000 feet above the Earth 's surface , experience weightlessness and enjoy the breathtaking view . "
Shortly before SpaceShipTwo reaches the apogee of its flight path , the vessel would fold its wings for re-entry through the upper atmosphere .
The ship 's wings would flatten out once more at 60,000 feet in order to glide back to terra firma .
Eye on emissions , fuel savings
Virgin Galactic uses a landing strip in California 's Mojave Desert now , but construction crews plan to break ground next month on a state - of - the - art " spaceport " near Truth or Consequences , N.M .
" Spaceport America , " a $ 198 million project funded by the state , will feature a vertical launch pad and a horizontal runway , according to project officials .
Virgin Galactic 's fellow tenants will include UP Aerospace Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp .
The project 's terminal and hangar facility , designed by URS Corp. and Foster +
Partners , will feature solar - thermal panels .
A passive cooling system will draw in hot air from the outside and chill it through a series of concrete tubes .
Virgin Galactic 's spacecraft were also designed with environmental sustainability in mind , Whitehorn said .
Mother ship
Eve's jet engines will run on kerosene initially but are also capable of running on butanol , a biofuel that can be made from algae .
SpaceShipTwo's rockets will burn nitrous oxide -- but only briefly -- as the spaceship would require no fuel for takeoff , re-entry and landing .
According to Whitehorn 's calculations , carbon dioxide emissions per passenger on a Virgin Galactic spaceflight would be about 60 percent of a passenger 's carbon footprint on a round - trip flight between New York and London .
About 70 percent of a spaceflight 's CO2 emissions would come from mother ship Eve , which must carry SpaceShipTwo into the stratosphere .
To lighten the load , both spacecraft are made of carbon - composite materials .
Swiss adventurer Andre Piccard , a hot - air balloon enthusiast like Branson , is building an experimental aircraft of his own with such lightweight materials .
Piccard aims to take his 1,500 - kilogram " Solar Impulse " aircraft around the world using only the power of the sun ( , Oct. 31 , 2008 ) .
" The basic idea of lightweighting spacecraft or aircraft is going to use a lot less fuel , " said Frances Arnold , a professor of biochemistry and chemical engineering at the California Institute of Technology .
" The same is true of any kind of vehicle . "
Virgin Galactic 's use of a mother ship , as opposed to a ground - based launch , will also save fuel , said Rob Anderson , a budding Cambridge University scientist .
He is one of seven students planning a high - altitude rocket launch later this year .
The " Cambridge University Spaceflight " team 's mission is to deliver payload to space as cheaply and efficiently as possible -- or for about $ 32,000 , in this case .
The team plans to send a helium balloon up 18.6 miles , at which point a rocket would blast solo to an elevation of 62.1 miles .
Anderson said a balloon - based model would work best for small scientific payloads ; the latex balloon will eventually pop as its helium expands .
But he predicted that the day when lightweight spaceships carry tourists is not too far away .
" At the speed things are going today , I suspect we 'll see a lot of it , " Anderson added .
' Exciting days '
A half - dozen space tourists have flown to and from the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz rockets since 2001 .
Two years ago , Google Inc. and the X Prize Foundation offered $ 20 million to the first privately funded team that could launch a robot into space , travel at least 500 meters over the moon 's surface and send images and data back to Earth by the end of 2012 .
Eighteen teams from around the world are vying for the " Google Lunar X Prize , " according to the organization 's Web site .
Virgin Galactic hopes to fly 500 people to space in its first year of commercial flights and 50,000 over a decade .
The Federal Aviation Administration has yet to issue a commercial license to the company , Whitehorn said , so its spaceships must fly in the name of environmental science for now .
When test flights begin next year , Eve and SpaceShipTwo will be equipped with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration instruments to measure carbon dioxide , methane and other heat - trapping gases in the upper atmosphere .
NOAA 's weather balloons are limited to conducting research at about 25,000 feet up , Whitehorn noted .
" Hopefully , we will develop a commercial relationship with them in the future once we get the license , " he added .
As for Virgin Galactic 's eventual tourists , will they develop a greener relationship with the blue planet they call home ?
" If the people who have the money to go up there then decide to devote their resources to saving that little blue gem they see , then that would be a good outcome , " offered Caltech 's Arnold .
A recent blog post by Britain 's Guardian newspaper is less sanguine .
" Why does n't Virgin Galactic just call it as it is ? " the blog petitioned .
" Sure , sell your dreams of space flight to the super - rich if you must ... but let 's not keep up the pretence that it is n't one of the most extravagant and self - centered uses of fossil fuel imaginable . "
For what it 's worth , Branson is investing $ 3 billion worth of profits from his " dirty " transportation businesses in clean - energy technologies .
He is also looking beyond the Earth 's orbit .
" Exciting days , " he said .
" Now , whether we 'll ever go to the moon ? ... I think we 'll give the moon a miss and go straight to Mars . "

Boston Magazine has a long , shocking piece about how the people running the world 's greatest university almost bankrupted the school through a series of very dumb financial decisions after a decade of unbelievable growth in the endowment .
Reading the litany of horror -- making bad decisions in the stock market , paying for buildings they could n't afford , learning to hate Goldman Sachs -- it occurred to me that Harvard has never seemed more like average Americans .
First the scary big numbers .
Harvard University 's endowment has lost $ 11 billion .
Do n't cry for Crimson yet -- it 's still got more than $ 25 billion in the coffers , about the same as it had in 2005 .
But in the interim , double digit returns on the endowment made administrators think it would be a good idea to increase the Arts and Science budget by 50 % , from $ 812 million to $ 1.2 billion .
Spending all over the school got a little wacky : $ 800 million * alone went toward building new labs , and Harvard 's debt doubled to $ 1.2 billion .
What happened ?
Harvard has long managed its endowment like an investment banker 's portfolio .
In fact , the school 's nifty money manager Jack Meyer had more than quintupled the endowment ( from $ 4 to $ 22 billion ) when his 15 years ended in 2005 .
That was great during the boom years , but by the market crash , the school was doubled down like a Financial District titan .
Three months after Bear Sterns went under , the endowment was still 105 percent invested .
Today 's it 's looking down the barrel of another $ 11 billion in capital commitments .
In three years , the endowment went from very overachieving to very overleveraged .
There 's also this revelation , which certainly is n't helping Larry Summers ' case for becoming Not Least Popular Person in Cambridge Ever :
Further squeezing Harvard was a transaction Summers had pushed it into in 2004 , when he successfully argued that the university should engage in a multibillion - dollar interest rate swap with Goldman Sachs and other large banks .
Under the terms of the deal , Harvard would pay Goldman a long - term fixed rate while Goldman paid Harvard the Federal Reserve rate .
The main goal was to lock in a low rate for future debt , and if the Fed had raised rates , Harvard would have made hundreds of millions .
But when the Fed slashed rates to historic lows to try to goose stalled credit markets , the deal turned equally sour for Harvard :
By last November , the value of the swaps had fallen to negative $ 570 million .
What happens now ?
Harvard President Drew Gilpin
Faust is n't mincing words when she says the do - everything university might consider " do less - - less research , less teaching , at a lesser level of quality . "
Harvard 's expansion might slow , but even if the endowment simply stopped growing , the school could continue spending at its current levels for another 20 years .
And Faust 's quote certainly seems like the thing I would say if I knew my school had a legions of million - and billionaires on my alumni phonebank Rolodex .
Harvard will still be the world 's greatest research university .
It 's time to start researching new investment strategies .
* Thanks msully .
A small addition to the Banking Code seems like such a minor thing .
But the change , which came into effect at the end of March , has analysts and academics alike alarmed at what it could mean for online banking customers .
Since the 2005 edition of the code ( which dictates how UK banks do business with customers ) , section 12.9 has advised customers to keep their PCs secure .
" Use up - to - date antivirus and spyware software and a personal firewall , " it says .
The contentious addition to the new version is section 12.13 .
" Unless you have acted fraudulently or without reasonable care ( for example , by not following the advice in section 12.9 ) , you will not be liable for losses caused by someone else which take place through your online banking service , " it says .
Thieves in the site
To banking security expert Steven Murdoch , that signals an official shift in liability for online banking fraud to the end user .
" The most likely way the new rules will be applied is that the bank will decide they do n't want to refund a customer , and may choose to quote this rule in their reasoning , " says the researcher in the security group at the University of Cambridge 's computer laboratory .
It 's easy to see why banks might be worried about online security .
Although losses from online banking fraud dropped a third last year compared to 2006 , banks still lost £ 22.6 m to online banking thieves .
And Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at antivirus firm Sophos , warns that banking trojans - malware that watches your PC in an attempt to steal your banking details - is becoming more sophisticated .
" The traditional way they do it is to log your keystrokes , but more sophisticated ones examine your mouse clicks or even take a little movie , " says Cluley , adding that the trojans often target UK banks .
The code seems to allow it , but would banks ever really dictate that customers must use antivirus software if they 're going to be compensated for internet fraud ?
" I would n't say never , but it 's not on the agenda currently , " says Sean Gilchrist , director of electronic banking at Barclays , which already distributes a pinpad which provides two - factor authentication for customers accessing its online banking service .
" I think that there may be particular circumstances where there has been a piece of fraud and we might challenge a customer harder , " says Gilchrist , " but we 're saying that we have an online fraud guarantee , and there 's nothing in our plans to review that stance . "
While at least some UK banks leave their options open , experts worry about other banking industries that have set a precedent by imposing draconian online security measures .
Breaking the bank
The New Zealand Bankers ' Association ( NZBA ) revised its own banking code with a clause giving banks the explicit right to access customers ' computers in the event of a fraudulent transaction .
They could check whether the computer had anti-virus and anti-spyware protection , and if customers refused to hand over their equipment , their fraud claims could be dismissed .
Upset by customer protests , some New Zealand banks subsequently distanced themselves from the NZBA 's code , essentially creating an unofficial , more lenient interpretation .
" If they had gotten away with it , it would certainly have deterred a lot of defrauded customers from claiming , " says Murdoch 's colleague Ross Anderson .
" And what would happen when you bank using your PC at the Guardian , you get defrauded , [ the bank ] demands the PC , and the Guardian says no ? " asks Anderson .
" What if your wife or your daughter says no , as they have personal and sensitive data on the PC ? "
Eric Domage , research manager for security products and services at analyst firm IDC , worries about social exclusion .
If banks decide to interpret the UK Code in a way that forces computer users to guarantee the security of their PCs , a subset of UK society could be affected , he warns .
" Those who ca n't afford to have a PC but use a web cafe PC - including many immigrant workers in the UK - how would they have access ? " he asks .
After all , verifying the security level of a publicly used PC is as difficult as verifying the security of a private PC , weeks or months after a security breach .
Such arguments are premature , according to banking industry spokespeople eager to ease customer concerns .
" This is not an offloading of responsibility , " says one spokesperson at the British Bankers ' Association , which administers the code .
" We do n't envision banks saying ' you lost money online so we 're not paying you ' . "
Mark Bowerman , spokesperson for APACS , argues that the new provisions are there to protect customers by making responsibilities for online banking security clearer .
But where one ambiguity is resolved , others may arise .
" The Banking Code is a recommendation and always vague and high level , " says Domage , who worries that banks may interpret the code as they see fit in the future .
Are APACS and the BBA really in a position to guarantee that wo n't happen ?
The code leaves other ambiguities , too .
" For example , what is a good antivirus software ? "
Domage asks .
Barclays is currently reviewing the F - Secure antivirus software that it provides for free to members of its online banking service and may switch packages .
Would banks be happy for customers to use antivirus software that they did n't authorise ?
Several respected security researchers have a dim view of antivirus software overall .
" It 's not completely worthless , but mostly worthless , " says Joe Stewart , senior security researcher at SecureWorks , who writes his own malware analysis tools from scratch .
Part of the problem is that malware writers increasingly test their work against antivirus engines before trying to infect computers with them , he says , which gives them a head start over the companies writing the antivirus software .
You can't stop them all
Most security vendors agree that there 's no silver bullet for malware , and that a complete security guarantee is unlikely .
But you 're better off with antivirus software than without it , they add .
" You wo n't be able to stop 100 % of the viruses and infections , " says Cody Pierce , a researcher at security research and intrusion prevention firm TippingPoint , " but you 'll stop some of them . "
But if you can't guarantee that you 'll block banking trojans or other malware with antivirus software , how useful is it to mandate it in the Banking Code ( or , as New Zealand 's code did , to explicitly suggest that your fraud claim would be dismissed without it ? )
Bowerman emphasises that banks would only begin to question customers ' online security in cases of obvious negligence .
" If you are the victim of a phishing attack , the vast majority of people get their money back , " he says .
" But if it happens seven times in seven weeks , then the bank is probably within its rights not to give you your money back . "
That would be a clearcut case , but not all incidents are as black and white .
Exactly what constitutes negligence when it comes to online security ?
" Every bank has their own fraud investigation team and will look at each instance on a case - by - case basis , " says Bowerman .
This makes it difficult for customers to know where the line is drawn .
Even though security experts may have difficulty agreeing on how effective online security measures really are , the Banking Code 's new clause seems pretty clear on what insecurity means .
Using such resolute language to address a problem as complex and volatile as online security apparently leaves the banks as the only party with room to manoeuvre .

Your cell phone calls are not private .
The reality is that your cell phone calls , your personal conversations and even your location can be tracked constantly by your cell phone company , by the government and even by enterprising stalkers who are able to get spy software on to your phone .
For any of you who doubt this , please start by watching the incredibly shocking news report below …..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCyKcoDaofg
Have we got your attention now ?
The truth is that cell phone conversations never have been and never will be private .
Not only does the cell phone company have access to your phone whenever they want , but the government has access to all of our calls in order to protect us against terrorism .
If you doubt this , just see what happens if you make a joking remark about airport security over a cell phone while you are headed to board a plane .
You will likely be picked up within minutes .
But as you saw in the video above , an even scarier scenario is that stalkers or criminals could have complete access to your calls if they can get spy software on to your phone .
And with more phones than ever connecting to the Internet , that little hurdle is now easier to overcome than ever .
Not only can stalkers and criminals listen to your calls , but they can also listen to your personal conversations even when your phone is turned off .
They can even listen to you at home in your private moments .
And thanks to GPS tracking , they can follow your location 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
Is n’t technology wonderful ?
Some of you might have heard of Microsoft ’s new search engine which was being developed in stealth mode under the name of Kumo .
Now that it ’s nearly ready to “ fight ” Google ’s dominance Microsoft announced the official name bing and will launch a $ 100 million marketing campaign to introduce the brand .
Too bad , bing means disease in Chinese

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Human females may get offended at dates who expect a little something extra after they buy a steak dinner , but for chimpanzees , the exchange may be a fair one , German researchers reported on Tuesday .
They found that female chimpanzees mate more frequently with males who often share meat with them .
“ Our results strongly suggest that wild chimpanzees exchange meat for sex , and do so on a long - term basis , ” Cristina Gomes of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany said in a statement .
“ Males who shared meat with females doubled their mating success , whereas females , who had difficulty obtaining meat on their own , increased their caloric intake without suffering the energetic costs and potential risk of injury related to hunting . ”
Writing in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE , Gomes and colleague Christophe Boesch said they watched chimps living in the Tai National Park in Ivory Coast .
" The meat for - sex hypothesis is a plausible explanation for male - female meat sharing in this species , as chimpanzees are highly promiscuous , they have a certain degree of female choice and hunters can usually control the sharing of their catch , " they wrote in their report , published onlinehere .
Males were more likely to share meat with females whose bodies showed they were in a fertile period , but even excluding these couplings , it was clear that mating behavior occurred more often between males and the females they were regularly sharing meat with .
“ Our findings add to the ever - growing evidence suggesting that chimpanzees can think in the past and the future and that this influences their present behavior , ” Boesch said .
“ These findings are bound to have an impact on our current knowledge about relationships between men and women ; and similar studies will determine if the direct nutritional benefits that women receive from hunters in human hunter - gatherer societies could also be driving the relationship between reproductive success and good hunting skills , ” Gomes added .

Sgt. Michael J. Sullivan , a patrol cop who became a renowned expert on the Americans With Disabilities
Act after being injured on duty , hung up his spurs Friday after 32 years at the San Francisco Police Department .
Sullivan 's leg and heart were seriously injured in January 1982 when a fleeing suspect 's car landed on top of Sullivan 's patrol cruiser in the Mission District , pinning him inside , police said .
He returned to duty 1 1/ 2 years later , walking with a cane .
When Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990 , Sullivan became the department 's ADA expert , learning how the act related to law enforcement and then implementing those changes .
He ensured that all people had access to police services at local stations , the Hall of Justice and over the phone .
He trained officers on how to better interact with people with mental illness .
He arranged for interpreters for the deaf to be on call around the clock and for special vans to be available to transfer those with limited mobility .
Sullivan 's work has been honored by several mayors , the Board of Supervisors , the state Legislature and Congress .
In 2005 , Mayor Gavin Newsompresented him with a community leadership award for making San Francisco more accessible .
Sullivan received the award on crutches - recovering from his 10th surgery stemming from his original injuries .

Put down the Cheerios : Bizarre landlord - tenant disputes are n't unheard of in our fair city .
But this is one for the history books .
Landlord George David has gone to court to evict a tenant who was living amid so much feces and urine in his 2857 Bush St. apartment that a crime - scene cleanup company charged $ 18,000 to abate the health hazard , court documents show .
The unsanitary conditions also led to tenant Todd McCullough getting his feet amputated after gout in his leg became infected and he developed gangrene , according to court filings .
But McCullough wants to stay in the apartment he 's lived in for the last 16 years and says the landlord is illegally trying to evict him in violation of state law and San Francisco 's rent control ordinance .
McCullough says he 's being discriminated against because of a disability - gout , and now his lack of feet - and that David 's true motive is to evict him so he can jack up the $ 750 - a- month rent for a new tenant .
David 's attorney , Hilary Hedemark , says the case is straightforward : McCullough " caused a life - threatening bio - hazard to exist at the premises " in violation of his lease , ignored requests to clean it up and failed to pay rent .
The city 's Health Department issued two notices to clean up the unsanitary conditions , and photos in the court file are not pretty .
The trial is scheduled for Monday .

RBS 's plans for bosses ' bonuses are in the spotlight Chancellor Alistair Darling has told RBS failure should not be rewarded with huge bonuses , but says he cannot rule out pay - outs for some bank staff .
It comes as reports put the potential total bonus figure at up to £ 1bn for the company 's 177,000 workers .
The Treasury has ordered a probe into general UK bank management to be led by ex-City regulator Sir David Walker .
Opposition parties have expressed anger that his final recommendations may not come until the end of the year .
Anyone hoping for revolutionary recommendations from the Treasury 's review is likely to be disappointed
BBC business editor Robert Peston
Read more from Robert here Sir David , a former executive director of the Bank of England and former chairman of the Securities and Investments Board , he is now a senior adviser at Morgan Stanley International .
His preliminary conclusions are not due until the autumn and final recommendations by the end of 2009 .
The timescale fuelled complaints from opposition parties that the Treasury response was too slow .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said it was " inadequate " and the review would come " far too late " to do anything about this year 's bonuses .
Lib Dem treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : " Instead of dealing decisively with the problem , as President Obama , the Swiss and others have done , the government is clearly playing for time in order to avoid doing anything to upset the bankers . "
The independent investigation will also look at the pay and bonuses of top executives in the industry .
" The chancellor feels he has the right to limit bonuses and set conditions on pay at any bank propped up by us , by taxpayers , which broadly includes all British banks , since they 've all received exceptional loans and guarantees from taxpayers over the past few months , " said BBC business editor Robert Peston .
' Absolute minimum '
Banks were said to be looking to pay a fraction of last year 's bonuses .
But the scale of the reported pay - out at RBS has caused an outcry , after the company had to be taken into 68 % public ownership at a cost of £ 20bn in taxpayer money .

RBS has experienced a year of turmoil , and has already flagged up that it will post a huge loss for the past 12 months .
In January RBS said it was heading for a record loss , and expected to report a deficit before write - downs of between £ 7bn and £ 8bn for 2008 .
Mr Darling told BBC One 's Andrew Marr
Show that " no figure on bonuses has been agreed on " but said he had told RBS no - one associated with the losses should be rewarded .
" I have spoken to the chief executive of RBS , and made it quite clear - and he agrees - that no - one associated with these huge losses should be allowed to walk away with large cash bonuses , " Mr Darling told the programme .
But he added : " Obviously there are contractual problems with some staff .
And ... if you look at your average teller , they 're not terribly well paid , and no - one would quarrel with making sure they are properly rewarded . "
You do n't need a review to answer the simple question : should senior bankers receive bonuses ?
The answer is no
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg
He said that in the past a bonus was a reward for hard work or extra effort , but was now seen as a right by bankers .
He added that the bank wanted " to make sure they cut down these payments to the absolute minimum they have to . "
" They have to understand that these banks would not be here but for the British taxpayers , therefore they have to show the degree of restraint that people would expect . "
' Burst '
The shadow chancellor told the Andrew Marr Show : " The party is over for the banks .
" For senior management , cash bonuses at a time like this for people who have been involved in the higher echelons of a bank is simply unacceptable . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

Mr Osborne added that there had to be a new economic model , and that " the bankers and indeed the government have to understand you can't just reflate the balloon that burst " .
Referring to the Treasury inquiry , he also questioned the need for " yet another review " .
Liberal Democrat party leader Nick Clegg told the BBC's Politics Show : " You do n't need a review to answer the simple question : should senior bankers receive bonuses ?
The answer is no . "
RBS confirmed it was talking to the government about bonuses but declined to comment on any specific numbers , adding that it had contractual obligations to many executives but was trying to do the right thing at the same time .
The bank has said that any bonuses will be dramatically reduced and there will be " no reward for failure in those bits of its business where the losses were concentrated " .
Incentives Meanwhile , former deputy prime minister John Prescott , who runs an online grassroots banking campaign , said : " We are all [ RBS ] shareholders now and the shareholders demand you give up the bonus . "
One of the key issues that will be examined in the Treasury review is the extent to which financial incentives encourage bankers to take risks .
Looking at very detailed as well as general changes to remuneration structures is something that the banks are already doing
Angela Knight
British Bankers ' Association Mr Darling said that it would be wrong to reward people whose excessive risk - taking brought the banks down .
Angela Knight , chief executive of the British Bankers ' Association , said the size of bonuses was likely to come down in future .
" They have seemed very high , " she said .
" What I will say is that I do n't think you 'll see those again . "
She added : " Looking at very detailed as well as general changes to remuneration structures is something that the banks are already doing . "
Last week US President Barack Obama announced a $ 500,000 ( £ 355,000 ) limit on executive pay at US firms that needed substantial fresh government aid .
The move follows widespread public anger over the levels of pay on Wall Street , but is not expected to be applied retrospectively .

There is a secession movement afoot and its proponents are determined to put a halt to the federal government ’s ambitions to destroy and reconstruct an entire economy and dissolve the last remnants of individual liberty .
Twenty - eight states are invoking the law of the land , the U.S. Constitution , by rolling out legislation to assert their sovereignty as free states in order to keep from being undermined by the never - ending swarm of unrestrained federal decrees .
The speed with which the federal government intends to take over private institutions and usurp states ’ rights and individual autonomy is unprecedented .
When the Bush - Obama regime maneuvers are compared to the Hoover - FDR New Deal era , it looks like today ’s hare vs. yesterday ’s turtle .
The state ’s various propaganda arms , from big media to institutionalized special interest forces , are being empowered to publicize and sell the agenda of the totalitarian state by painting it in glossy colors that warm the hearts of unresisting Americans .
There are , however , growing pockets of dissenters who conclude that life , liberty , property , and the futures of their children are more important than the trivial things that occupy the minds of the submissive class .
For that reason , the state ’s militarized police force , which has been given unparalleled powers by the contrived crises following 9 - 11 , has snowballed in size and is being fortified in expectation of confronting rebellion from those citizens who intend to resist the tyranny of an over - reaching Leviathan .
Since the Bush II regime took control and 9/11 became its launch pad for sweeping hegemony , the police state has moved more swiftly than ever to demonize resistance and criminalize dissent .
The most recent example is the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) report that profiled individuals according to their political convictions , especially those ideas that agitate against the institutionalization of unconstitutional acts that are intended to grow state power at the expense of individual liberties .
Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr ( ! ) , guns & ammo , taxes , the Federal Reserve , secession , and resistance to universal government service or anti-privacy actions — all of those topics have become keywords in the crusade to criminalize individuals who refuse to be rounded up like cattle and marched toward serfdom .
Two years ago , a similar thing happened in Alabama when its Homeland Security Department released a report pigeonholing freedom activists as " anti-government types " who " claim that the U.S. government is infringing on their individual rights , and / or that the government ’s policies are criminal and immoral . "
Such groups , the report said , " May hold that the current government is violating the basic principles laid out by the U.S. Constitution … "
Do n’t bother to look up that report , however , because LewRockwell.com blogger Chris Brunner ’s post on the Alabama report spread like wildfire ’round the Internet , resulting in that report being pulled from the website .
In addition , the MIAC report was quickly stifled by hordes of liberty activists , leading Chuck Baldwin to say , " the most effective way to fight an ever - encroaching federal leviathan is to focus on our individual states . "
The struggle for sovereignty , though begun on the part of spontaneous individuals with leanings toward the radical principles of our nation ’s founding , has reached state legislatures across America in the form of sovereignty bills .
According to the Christian Science Monitor , twenty - eight states are now commencing resolutions as a reaction to the sudden and massive expansion of federal powers .
Even the Republic of Lakotah is declaring its withdrawal from all treaties and agreements imposed on it by the US government .
The notion of state secession , once written off as a subject matter for political crackpots and eccentrics , has become a legitimate and practical solution for undoing the years of accumulated assaults on individual liberty that has come from the centralized state .
With revolutionary die - hards behind him , Mr. Pitts has fired a warning shot across the bow of the Washington establishment .
As the writer of one of 28 state “ sovereignty bills ” — one even calls for outright dissolution of the Union if Washington does n’t rein itself in —
Pitts is at the forefront of a states ’ rights revival , reasserting their say on everything from stem cell research to the Second Amendment .
… And although Pitts [ state rep from South Carolina ] hails from Abbeville , the place where the South ’s first secession votes were cast , he insists that today ’s efforts to check federal power are n’t limited to regional pockets or even political affiliation .
“ The mainstream media would portray some of us as rednecks , whether we ’re from Pennsylvania , Oregon , or South Carolina , ” says Pitts .
“ But this is a wake - up call .
And if Washington does n’t heed that wake - up call , revolution is on the horizon . ”
That is from a recent issue of the Christian Science Monitor .
Walter Williams , a respected academic and popular , syndicated columnist , declared this in his most recent column :
Our Colonial ancestors petitioned and pleaded with King George III to get his boot off their necks .
He ignored their pleas , and in 1776 , they rightfully declared unilateral independence and went to war .
Today it ’s the same story except Congress is the one usurping the rights of the people and the states , making King George ’s actions look mild in comparison .
Our constitutional ignorance — perhaps contempt , coupled with the fact that we ’ve become a nation of wimps , sissies and supplicants — has made us easy prey for Washington ’s tyrannical forces .
But that might be changing a bit .
There are rumblings of a long overdue re-emergence of Americans ’ characteristic spirit of rebellion .
Emory Professor and constitutional scholar Don Livingston notes , in his Secessionist Paper No. 19 : What is Secession ? , " talk about secession makes Americans nervous .
For many it evokes images of the Civil War , and is emotionally ( if not logically ) tied to slavery , war , and anarchy .
That the word " secession " is laden with these negative connotations should be surprising since America was born in an act of secession . "
He goes on to describe secession as an act that " does not seek to overthrow or alter the government of a modern state , but seeks merely to limit its jurisdiction over the seceding territory . "
But still , the negative connotations of secession live on , even within some libertarian circles .
Perhaps the most puzzling thing I keep hearing from some libertarians is that those of us who adhere to secessionist ideas are wacky outliers who offer no value " to the movement , " and instead , we only throw up red flags that warn others to avoid us , and libertarianism as a whole .
Thus we are led to believe that our founding fathers , the architects of rebellion and the champions of Jeffersonian principles , were reactionary wackos .
The anti-radical libertarians ask for practical solutions , with " practical " being the code word for something that is acceptable to the majority of the Oprahized masses .
This kind of thought is known as " libertarian lite , " or as I call it , " car wash libertarianism . "
The car wash libertarians persuade others — especially those new to libertarianism — to stay away from the radical , " crazy " stuff and hold true to the agenda of getting " our people " elected through legitimate political means .
The car wash libertarians still have a voice in the modern LP , which is also known as GOP 2.0 .
These libertarians are in the game not for reasons of deep - rooted principles and love of liberty , but for the social , bonding aspects , with some mild libertarianism sprinkled on the side .
They love attending their local meetings and dinners each month and discussing who is going to run for what local post , and when , and applying strategy .
How fun it all is .
City council or board of county commissioners ?
Now those are appointments that will have a significant impact upon an America that is quickly descending into a Communistic hellhole .
Truth is , the car wash libertarians will be the ones cowering in a corner the day they come for our guns ( under a massive , federal gun control act ) and our children ( under federal , child “ protective services ” laws or a national service act ) .
But they may have a post or two at some tiny township , with such important duties as arranging for an annual dinner at the VFW or setting up the car wash fundraiser to pay for new lamp posts along Main Street .
The car wash libertarians tend to have scant knowledge of history , monetary policy , constitutional disputes , and the political philosophers who have , over the years , defended states ’ rights and the natural rights of the individual against the totalitarian , centralized state .
In fact , they tend to shy away from the intellectual life because it ’s not as fun , or as social , as the monthly meetings and supper club invites .
In spite of the radicalism of many of the early LP ’ers , in 30 + years the LP has made no advances whatsoever , except that a few of them hold feeble local offices where it is their brand of politics in charge as versus the other guy ’s rules .
One guy ’s coercion in place of another guy ’s coercion offers us no progress whatsoever in terms of quelling the federal expansion that is speedily choking off life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
The rapid - fire socialization of America , I hope , will have the effect of turning many of these libertarians toward more radical plans of action .
The Feds are engaged in a sweeping series of measures to take complete control of the financial system ( which is forever destroyed ) and selected business entities ; ratchet up plans for perpetual war ; socialize health care ; further implant federalized education and criminalize homeschooling ; grab guns and ammo ; remove children from the homes of dissenters ; commence race wars and class wars ; force young adults into mandatory state service camps ; send protesters to FEMA camps ; and on and on and on .
At this point , none of this can be undone through time - consuming , political means .
Rahm Emanuel , Eric Holder , and the other agents of Obama ’s unfreedom brigade were brought to Washington D.C. for one very specific purpose : to centralize every last bit of property and life and put it all under federal rule , from money to education to personal behavior .
Note the condescending and arrogant behavior of King Obama on the 60 Minutes television show as he laughed at the inability of majority opinion to do a damn thing to stop his freight train of power grabs and federal takeovers .
Perhaps the most significant move on the part of the Feds , outside of crushing the free market through rapid nationalization , is the move on the part of the centralizers to extinguish the single most important characteristic of a free society — the right to bear arms .
A society in which individuals cannot bear arms is a society doomed to eternal serfdom and oppression from self - serving overlords .
Attorney General Eric
Holder has long been an advocate of snuffing out gun rights , yet he got through the confirmation process with nothing more than a few feeble whimpers from helpless Republicans playing partisan games .
Even worse is a recent occurrence that is perhaps unprecedented on the part of modern presidential administrations .
Rahm Emanuel , in his capacity as Chief of Staff , is being utilized outside of his official role and is acting in the role of propagandist by lobbying for absolute and unconditional gun control .
Emanuel , an Israeli citizen , is attempting to target gun owners by categorizing them in terms that will brand them as terrorists ( the government ’s favorite buzz word ) in the eyes of their fellow Americans .
Yet there has been no challenge to Emanuel for stepping outside his role and becoming an official flag - bearer for the disarming of America .
Gun rights is one of the most visible issues causing states to retreat and claim the federal government has gone way beyond its limits .
In Montana , elected officials have signed a resolution declaring that any ruling by the Federal government on the Second Amendment violates its statehood contract .
In fact , Montanans are moving to add more lenient concealed weapons laws to what ’s already on the books .
In Tennessee , state Senator Doug Jackson , a Democrat , has filed legislation that would ban the sale of micro-stamped firearms and ammunition .
Such laws will mean a federal registry of gun owners , and Jackson calls this insanity " a preamble to gun confiscation . "
The other prime mover spurring claims of sovereignty on the part of states is rejection of the Federal Reserve and its illiberal policies that enslave the citizens of states by locking them into its inflationary fiat money machinations and debases their currency .
Legislators in some states , such as Georgia and Montana , have agitated in favor of throwing off the Federal Reserve in favor of instituting a sound money policy advocating the use of gold and silver as opposed to the Fed ’s legal tender notes .
In Montana , Representative Bob Wagner introduced a sound money bill ( HB 639 ) , though it later died in committee along partisan lines .
As times go on and the economic landscape becomes even gloomier , we are more likely to see many more of these kinds of initiatives on the part of state legislatures .
Gold , as such , is a tool for protection against the collapse of the dollar , which is why opponents of the Federal Reserve desire to buy it and hold it .
Guns are the tools with which you defend yourself , not only from the local criminal who wants what you have , but even more so , they provide free men with the capability for physical resistance from a federal government whose expansion of powers and oppressive tactics are out of control .
Think Rahm Emanuel and Eric Holder , and ask why it is that they champion an agenda that puts guns only into the hands of the government and its approved agents .
The only way to get this oppressive tyrant — known as the federal government — off our back is to break away from it and start anew .
That twenty - eight states are starting to fan the flames of rebellion by moving towards a sovereign itinerary is fairly remarkable .
States and people must declare their sovereignty and remove the tentacles of the federal government ’s oppressive laws from their necks .
Only a breakup of this monstrous and out - of - control , despotic giant can restore freedom and keep us all from descending further into the federal government ’s grip .

Environment groups know they are being spied on and the arrest of 114 activists this week looks like more of the same
It was a beautiful , crisp , sunny morning in April 2005 .
At 6.30 am the environmental group was just minutes away from its target – a Land Rover factory in the Midlands .
The meticulously planned action involved people bursting through the perimeter gate , past drowsy guards and occupying the factory line .
Little did they know that almost 50 policemen were already there , drinking cups of tea and waiting for them .
Fortunately for the activists , an advance guard spotted the helmets and the bus carrying the climate change protesters was turned round .
It was obvious that someone had tipped off the police .
There was simply no other explanation .
The mole was identified and never allowed on another action .
This week it was almost certain that the 114 people arrested outside Nottingham were also shopped by an informer .
Nearly a week before the action , police warned all power companies in the Midlands and the north that a major action against a coal - fired power station was likely and told them to increase security .
The police were also confident enough of their source to practically strip Nottingham of police and commit forward intelligence teams , get maps of the school and mobilise a helicopter .
The operation involved some very senior officers .
According to one person arrested , " this was not an ordinary police operation .
We were set up .
They knew where we were going and the resources used were immense . "
Arresting officers openly said that they had known about the action for a week and that the operation was " intelligence - led " .
This could mean that the police relied on covert surveillance such as mobile - phone tapping , computer - hacking and vehicle tracking , but this is unlikely to have provided the authorities with reliable enough information .
Much more likely , they used a traditional mole .
Environment groups know they are being effective when they are being spied on or infiltrated by the state or by corporations .
Last year anti-aviation group Plane Stupid became aware that a man calling himself Ken Tobias was not a climate campaigner .
He was set up , trapped and exposed as working for C2I security , possibly on behalf of the aviation industry .
Greenpeace UK has had a string of moles .
Road protesters in the 1990s were spied on by a security firm employed by the government .
Last week EDF , the French nuclear company hoping to build several reactors in Britain , was charged with spying on Greenpeace in France .
The McLibel 2 famously held one meeting where there were more moles working for McDonald 's than there were activists .
But who tipped off the police about the Nottingham gathering ?
Precise information about the alleged action may only have been known by a few core people .
It is just possible that they were infiltrated , but these people know each other well and have built the climate movement from nothing .
Only a John le Carré mind could imagine such subterfuge .
Far more likely is that one of the 100 or more people " invited " to go to Nottingham was the mole .
The climate movement welcomes new people and while seasoned campaigners went , for some volunteers it was their first action .
It was a dream for the police , corporates or anyone wanting to know what is going on .
All a potential mole has to do is turn up to meetings , lie low for a year or so , fit in , show willing and gain trust and eventually someone will invite them on an action .
He or she probably had no idea which power station was actually being targeted , but all they had to do was nip out to the loo at a motorway service station and make a call or a text .
By the time people had gathered at the school , the police would have known for certain which power station was the target .
The clinching evidence of a low - level mole was that arrests were made not for " conspiracy to disrupt operations " at Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station ( the alleged target of the action ) , but at an unnamed station .
Police surveillance of environmental activists has intensified since the demise of the animal rights movement and parallels the rise of climate change as an international issue with vast sums of money at stake .
People going to public meetings are now liable to be photographed or stopped and searched .
Established groups such as Greenpeace and Plane Stupid have had their premises watched , and forward intelligence teams follow some people for months at a time .
Many activist groups have complained that their websites have been sabotaged .
Rule 1 is to assume you are known .
Rule 2 is not to communicate by email or phone .
Rule 3 is to beware moles .
The following was posted late yesterday by Curtis Cook , one of the listed authors on the plagiarized Conference Board of Canada reports .
Cook 's experience sheds new light on the Conference Board plagiarism story , including interference from copyright lobby funders , the exclusion of deBeer 's research from the report , and the decision to lay blame on Cook , who had left the organization almost a full year before publication of the reports .
Cook 's response has been reposted as a full blog post with his permission :
I have waited a week for the Conference Board to remove my name from its controversial intellectual property publications .
On May 27 I wrote to Anne Golden to :
Remove my name as an author from the publications ( since I have not worked for the Conference Board for almost a year ) ; and Publicly acknowledge that I was not responsible for the plagiarized content .
On June 1 , I finally received a call from Anne Golden who did not address any of my concerns and abruptly ended the call by disconnecting .
Here is what I know :
I was a full - time employee with the Conference Board between September 2007 and July 2008 .
I resigned almost a year ago to take a fulfilling job with a non-profit in British Columbia .
I submitted draft research to my former supervisor for the IP reports in mid-August 2008 .
I finished the research after I moved even though I was neither on salary nor on contract with the Board .
The research I submitted did NOT include the controversial passages or plagiarized content .
I worked with three contract researchers on this project between April 2008 and June 2008 , including Jeremy deBeer , whose work I integrated into the draft .
These researchers did not submit research that included the controversial / plagiarized content .
I had no involvement in any content changes and did not see these papers after I submitted them in August .
My new work was interrupted in mid-September by my former supervisor at the Conference Board to tell me there had been “ push back ” from one of the funding clients about the research and inclusion of Mr. deBeer ’s contribution .
I had quit almost two months earlier so this was of no concern to me .
Around the same time , my new work was also interrupted by a call from one of the funding clients who expressed similar concerns .
Again , I informed him that I no longer had anything to do with these reports .
I received news of its publication on May 26 , 2009 , ten months after my resignation .
I downloaded and read the research after I was informed of the controversy and was alarmed to see the direction it had taken .
I sent my letter to Anne Golden the following day .
The VP of Public Policy e-mailed me on May 29th to ask for my assistance in finding both researchers who could " fix " the reports , as well as external reviewers who would be impartial in reviewing the new work .
His message stated that “ I trust your judgment , experience and knowledge and would value your help . ”
The Conference Board wants my help to fix reports that were published 10 months after my departure .
It wants me to help fix publications that were re-written ( and plagiarized ) months after my departure and after they discarded the research I compiled and submitted .
The Conference Board asks for my help but wo n't acknowledge that it was wrong to put my name on reports that bear little resemblance to the original research I submitted , were substantially reworked , and were published ten months after I resigned .
After Anne Golden laid blame on contract researchers and supervisors late last week , I noticed two of the authors who still were listed on the organization 's web site were no longer on the staff list .
I am not prepared to wait for Anne Golden to conduct the review she promises because I have a pretty good sense of what happened , even though my involvement with the Conference Board and these reports ended with the submission of credible research 10 months ago .
I am curious to see if my account results in some form of backlash , if the Conference Board is prepared to dig a deeper hole for itself or if more fiction will surface .

It remains unclear who Mr Khatami will support in June 's election
Former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has officially announced his withdrawal from the country 's presidential election in June .
In a statement , he said he would pull out in order not to split the reformist vote .
Two other pro-reform candidates are also in the running .
Mr Khatami was president of Iran from 1997 - 2005 and was succeeded by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a hard - line conservative .
Mr Ahmadinejad is widely expected to stand for re-election .
It was not immediately clear if Mr Khatami meant to endorse one of the other candidates .
Early reports that he was quitting the race suggested he would back former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Boost for Ahmadinejad
" I announce my withdrawal from the 10th presidential election , " Mr Khatami said in a statement released after a late - evening meeting with his supporters and campaign officials .
Mir Hossein Mousavi served as PM during the war with Iraq
He called for a " free and fair election " .
His withdrawal leaves Mr Ahmadinejad in a stronger position despite heavy criticism of his management of the economy , the BBC's Jon Leyne reports from Tehran .
Mr Khatami was one of the country 's most liberal president since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 .
But he entered this campaign reluctantly and unenthusiastically , adds our correspondent , and it soon became clear that many of those in power in Iran did not want him to return as president .
One city prevented him from campaigning with the excuse that it would cause traffic jams .
One of his rivals , Mr Mousavi , held office between 1980 and 1988 .
He is also a member of Iran 's Expediency Council , which is the country 's top political arbitration body .
The other pro-reform candidate in the race is Mahdi Karroubi , a former parliamentary speaker .
GRAND RAPIDS --
The family of a Grand Valley State University student shot by police said he did nothing to provoke gunfire in a drug raid at the student 's off - campus apartment .
" All he had time to do was cover his face from a flashlight in his eyes , and they shot him , " George Copp said today .
His son , Derek Copp , 20 , was shot in the upper chest Wednesday night by an Ottawa County sheriff 's deputy , who is assigned to the West Michigan Enforcement Team , a three - county drug unit .
Copp is recovering at Spectrum Health Butterworth Campus .
He was originally listed in serious condition , but his family has requested the hospital not release information .
George Copp said police have not provided an explanation for the shooting .
" We have n't heard anything . "
He declined further comment because " I do n't want to say anything that might hurt my son . "
WOOD -TV also interviewed Derek Copp 's parents , Sheryl and George Copp of Spring Arbor .

Highlights of their interview include :
• Derek told his parents he had lifted his right arm to cover his eyes from a bright flashlight when the shot was fired .
He says he did not know it was police knocking on his door Wednesday night when he was home studying with his roommate before the shooting .
• Doctors plan to remove the bullet from Derek 's chest today .
It entered the right side of his upper chest , broke ribs , ruptured his right lung and went through his liver , his parents said .
• " From what I understand , half the kids in the school may smoke pot , " George Copp told WOOD - TV .
" And he does , he may , too , but he 's not a drug dealer .
He 's a good kid , and he should n't have been shot for that . "
• Copp 's parents said they did n't learn about the shooting until just before 3 a.m. Thursday -- six hours after the drug raid .
They said a nurse and their son called from the hospital .
Copp told his parents he gave police their home number and cell phone numbers .

The past couple of weeks I 've been tracing Matty and I onto large rolls of black paper .
I then cut them out into fun shadow people ,
and taped them onto the walls and sidewalks all around Brooklyn .
I then waited for people to walk by and took a picture at the exact moment they matched up with their silly shadow .
What do you think your shadow is up to ?
Quick !
Turn around and check !

Do you ever wonder if your shadow is playing tricks on you behind your back ?
This is what we do !
This is what makes us tick .
I mean , it could be , right ?
It 's always walking behind you so you never know what 's going on back there !
VPS Comparison between Slicehost and Prgmr
For the last year I 've been using a 256MB VPS from Slicehost to host a low traffic site running Django .
I 've also used the slice as a development platform thanks to screen and vim .
Two weeks ago I came across a mention of another Xen based VPS provider called Prgmr .
What intrigued me was that I could get a 1GB instance for the $ 20 / month I was paying Slicehost for a 256MB slice .
4 times the memory , more than double disk capacity , and 60 % more bandwidth .
Was this too good to be true ?
I decided to rent a 256MB instance from Prgmr ( sets you back $ 8 / month ) and compare it against my trusty old slice with the same memory configuration .
Lets first take a look at the system specifications .
Slicehost first :
# uname - nrmo slicehost.uggedal.com 2.6.24-23-xen x86_64 GNU / Linux # grep " MemTotal " / proc/ meminfo MemTotal : 262316 kB # grep -m 4 -e " model name " -e " MHz " -e " cache size " -e " bogomips " / proc / cpuinfo model name : Dual - Core AMD Opteron ( tm ) Processor 2212 cpu MHz : 2010.300 cache size : 1024 KB bogomips : 4026.86 # grep " processor " / proc / cpuinfo | wc -l 4
And the same output from Prgmr :
# uname - nrmo prgmr.uggedal.com 2.6.26-1-xen-amd64 x86_64 GNU / Linux # grep " MemTotal " / proc/ meminfo MemTotal : 262360 kB # grep -e " model name " -e " MHz " -e " cache size " -e " bogomips " / proc / cpuinfo model name : Quad - Core AMD Opteron ( tm ) Processor 2347 HE cpu MHz : 1909.787 cache size : 512 KB bogomips : 3826.33 # grep " processor " / proc / cpuinfo | wc -l 1
As we can see they are both Running Debian GNU / Linux 5.0 .
As of this writing Slicehost gives you a 2.6.24 kernel while Prgmr provides a more recent 2.6.26 kernel .
Both systems use the x86_64 architecture .
Slicehost uses a dual core Opteron with 1MB L2 cache for each core while Prgmr uses a quad core Opteron with half the L2 cache ( 512KB ) for each core .
This difference is uninteresting as our individual performance is dependant on how many of these CPUs the system has in total compared to how many VPS instances the system hosts .
The output from / proc / cpuinfo only tells us about the amount of cores available to our VPS instance , not how many there are in total .
In reality one VPS instance does not get access to these cores directly .
One are given one or more virtual CPUs ( VCPUs ) .
Slicehost gives us 4 VCPUs while Prgmr gives us 1 VCPU .
How does this relate to performance ?
Truly 4 is better than 1 ?
According to Luke Crawford ( from Prgmr ) :
Giving you more VCPUs increases your peak performance ( that is , you get more CPU when nobody else wants it ) but it decreases your worst - case performance ( that is , when everyone is fighting over the CPUs , the more VCPUs you have , the more context switches you have ) and so I 've chosen better worst - case performance here .
This means that theoretically Prgmr should give you more stable performance and Slicehost should be more performant , except for when your VPS neighbors get really busy .
Django test suite
Since most of my work on my VPS involves working with Django , I decided to benchmark the two providers by timing their execution of the Django test suite .
Unneeded services were disabled and the instances was rebooted before starting the tests .
All tests were run against revision 10108 of the Django trunk , using the sqlite3 database engine .
The following script was used for running the tests :
for i in { 1 ..20 } do time ./runtests.py -- settings = sqlite3conf sleep $ (( 60 * 5 ) ) if [ $ i - eq 10 ] then sleep $ (( 60 * 60 * 12 ) ) fi done
The test suite is executed 10 times with pauses of 5 minutes in between , then we wait 12 hours before running the tests 10 more times .
Note that this approach is highly unscientific .
One can expect increased performance when none of the neighboring instances are doing any work -- since these VPS providers use credit based scheduling .
A better approach would therefore be to run the tests once per hour for a week .
Sadly I can't afford to strip down my VPS for a week of testing .
You should therefore take these results with a grain of salt .
Lets first look at how the test suite run times varies over time :
We see that the 10 first test runs if fairly equal for the two providers .
Prgmr is generally a bit slower and tend to vary more in execution time than Slicehost .
But after a 12 hour sleep something strange happens .
Prgmr becomes more stable and significantly faster than Slicehost .
My take is that we suddenly got the CPU all to our self on Prgmr .
These results indicate that we should perform these benchmarks over a longer time period .
With the skewed metrics in mind , lets take a look at the mean execution time for these two services :
Prgmr " wins " thanks to its sprint after the 12 hour pause .
The differences is not extraordinary large though .
But what if we adjust the run times according to price ?
We multiply the Prgmr runtimes with 8/20 to find the theoretical performance we could get if we spent as much money as we did on the Slicehost rental :
With price in mind , Prgmr gives us almost 3 times more performance than Slicehost .
Note that this is just a theoretical exercise .
The 1GB Prgmr offering should be benchmarked against the 256MB Slicehost offering for finding what you really get for your $ 20 .
Network
Average ping time was measured using Just Ping to find the network latency from several locations around the globe :
The results shows that Slicehost has the lowest latency from the eastern parts of the US and Europe .
Prgmr on the other hand has lower latency from the western parts of the US , Asia , and Australia .
This is largely due to the geographical locations of the two providers .
Slicehost is placed in Saint Louis , Missouri and Prgmr is located in San Jose , California .
Stability
I 've been a Slicehost customer for some time and have never had to restart my slice or had it gone down due to system failure .
Before updating to Debian 5.0 and changing kernels it had an uptime of over 330 days .
As I 'm a brand new Prgrm customer I do n't have any data to compare the two services .
Community
Slicehost has an active community with their forums , IRC , and Wiki .
In addition they have several articles describing how to setup various types of systems .
Prgmr on the other hand has none of these community building platforms ( except for a fairly empty Wiki ) .
If you want to use Prgmr you are pretty much on your own .
This is highlighted on their web page with the phrase :
We do n't assume you are stupid .
Support
Prgmr 's tagline is also apparent in their support software .
While Slicehost provides a flashed out control panel ( SliceManager ) for monitoring and administering your VPS , Prgmr only provides console access through a SSH gateway .
Much of what 's automated over at Slicehost ( like provisioning a new instance ) is handled manually at Prgmr .
I 've only had one encounter with the Slicehost support team .
Upgrading a kernel took about one hour , from when I sent a support request to the VPS was rebooted with the new kernel .
The only encounter with the support staff at Prgmr I 've had was when I ordered my instance .
That process took 3 hours , from placing the order to being able to log in .
Conclusion
We 've seen that it's hard to benchmark VPS instances as factors out of our control largely influences the results .
All in all I think the two offerings is on par performance wise , but more testing needs to be done to see how the load of other customers influences our performance .
I rarely use the SliceManager , and so far Prgmr 's console have served me well .
Slicehost 's network latency is a bit lower for me here in Norway , but not large enough to exclude Prgmr as a worthy contender .
My only concern is the stability of Prgmr , as my Slicehost experience has been stellar .
I think I 'll keep both VPSs for the time being and switch to using solely Prgmr if my long term experience proves to be as good as what I 've seen so far .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
While President Barack Obama 's move to create a quasi -Cabinet - level post to oversee computer - network security is commendable on its face , it seems likely to founder in a sea of impossibly complex problems .
The president announced the creation of the " cyber czar " position Friday .
The post has yet to be filled , perhaps because the job comes with an enormous yet nebulous set of responsibilities .
See related story .
One key question will be where to focus .
Should the cyber czar be responsible for figuring out how to combat problems such as identity theft , an increasingly serious threat to consumers and individuals ?
Or should they be dedicated to preventing foreign governments or nongovernmental organizations from breaking into military and defense networks ?
From Obama 's remarks in announcing the position , it seems likely that the " cyber czar " will act to coordinate private - sector and government - security efforts .
A good deal of the new bureaucrat 's time is likely to be spent arbitrating issues such as so - called network neutrality , which currently gets kicked around the Federal Communications Commission .
Given the administration 's penchant for big new programs , the " cyber czar " undoubtedly will also intrude into one of the few sectors of the U.S. economy that 's doing reasonably well : online commerce .
Of course , the biggest unanswered question will be how to pay for whatever security initiatives are deemed necessary .
If airport - security fees are now a fact of every plane ticket , can there be any doubt that a network - security fee will be part of every Internet service provider 's invoice in the near future ?
Perhaps they can call them microtaxes .

Pants are a staple in many fashion ensembles , but not all pants are fashionable or functional - some pants are innovative , while others are weird , wacky and strangely mesmorizing !
Read on to see the Top 10 Most Innovative and Strange Pants and Jeans !
Strange Pant # 10 .
The Doilie Pant
Reviving fashion perhaps best suited for your Grandmother 's dining room table is the Doilie Pant .
This lacy denim fashion item is the perfect way to take young fashion and make it look old !
Made by fashion designer G+N , these aptly named Glue Jeans are unique , because they are held together by glue instead of thread !
There 's no particular purpose for the Dutch designer 's creation of these jeans ; so consider them a " just because we can " fashion .
Often fashion lovers are forced to choose between fashion and comfort , particularly when it comes to getting that denim jean look .
Fortunately , Second Clothing has come up with an alternative so fashionistas no longer have to choose between their beloved yoga pants and the more fashionable , casual denim alternatives .
Second Clothing Yoga Jeans are stretchy and elasticy just like Yoga wear , but have the look of jeans .
With 92 % shape memory and made from 97 % brushed cotton and 3 % elastane , these pants can bring comfort and fashion to the gym and just about everywhere .
Leggie Legs by ilaniowear combine 80's legwarmer trends with disco-era styles .
The unique fashion items have fun names and come in a variety of fun and flashy vintage - inspired designs .
Since these do not actually provide pant style coverage , if you want to show off these leg warmers , opt for a more revealing skirt or bikini bottom .
Society for Rational Dress has created pants with sky high waistlines .
Steve Urkel does n't have anything on these geek - inspired high fashion pants !
Strange Pant # 5 . Padlock Pants
A new fashion trend emerging in Indonesia is the padlocked pant .
Actually a government requirement in Indonesia to help deter prostitution , the country requires that masseuses padlock their pants to show that they will not engage in any sexual practices .
Strange Pant # 4 . The Tight ... or is it Baggy Pant ?
Ca n't decide between purchasing the ever - popular skinny jeans , or trendy low rising baggy pants ?
Purchase the baggy - tight pants .
Want to show off the junk in your trunk , opt for a shorter shirt .
Prefer to show off your inner gangster , opt instead for a baggy t- shirt and tuck the skinny pant leg into a sneaker .
The baggy - tight jeans even come with built in suspenders and as an added bonus , the tight - fitting top ensures your pants stay up , even with the baggy style !
Okay , so these jeans by Genetic Denim are n't truly spray on , but they are inspired by Krylon paint colors , and so tight that wearers may as well have been painted into them !
Strange Pant # 2 . The Pant Shoe
While these shoes already had honorable mention in " The Top 10 Shoes in Fashion Today " as the # 1 strangest pair of shoes ; I 'm still not certain whether these are truly pants or shoes , so they can't be left off this list either .
Pant or shoe , it does n't relly matter , they 're pretty weird !
Strange Pant # 1. Peripheral Pants
While these scandalous peripheral pants have already had an article all of their own , these scandalous pants that also work as a functional keyboard are without a doubt the strangest and most innovative pants I 've seen all year !

Here is The Wall outside Aida ( Palestinian ) refugee camp in Bethlehem .
The photo below shows Palestinian boys playing next to The Wall , where a hand - painted sign welcomes the visit of the Pope to Palestine .
Another hand - painted sign being written to welcome the Pope to Aida refugee camp – here , The Wall almost looks surreal :
On Tuesday afternoon , just as the Pope is at Mass in Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem , a marching band practices in advance of the Pope ’s arrival here on Wednesday morning , playing drums and marching up and down on a road parallel to The Wall .
And workers were putting the final touches on the preparations , and adjusting the flags flying in Aida refugee camp .
Palestinian security forces are lining the street , but so far traffic has been moving .
It ’s not clear exactly what will happen here tomorrow , but it will start early .
Journalists have been asked to report for security checks at 5 am .
Bethlehem officials and the Palestinian Authority had hoped to receive the Pope on a special stage , or “ amphitheater ” just alongside The Wall — and Vatican officials agreed — but their plans were cancelled by Israeli military order , citing security risks .
Bethlehem , like the rest of the West Bank , is under Israeli military occupation .
In recent days , Palestinians were putting the finishing touches to the amphitheatre being prepared for Pope Benedict ’s visit to Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem .
But Israel has ordered a halt to construction and the Pope may not even use it when he speaks in Bethlehem on Wednesday .
The Pope will almost certainly visit the Church of the Nativity , where Jesus is believed to have been born in Bethlehem .
On the extraordinary success of its Nintendo Wii video game console , Nintendo says it 's due , in part , to making games accessible to wide audiences .
And with an unannounced – but now confirmed – feature built into future Nintendo Wii titles , the Japanese gaming giant is taking this accessibility to the next level .
Beginning with the upcoming New Super Mario Bros .
Wii ( due this holiday season ) , players will be able to pause a game during a particularly difficult level and let the game take over to complete the level .
Press a button at any time to resume playing .
This will help reduce barriers of entry for new or younger players – without purchasing a strategy guide or resorting to websites that list cheat codes .
In an exclusive interview with Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto , the legendary game designer confirmed this optional feature called " demo play " ( tentative name ) is something the development team has been working on .
" In New Super Mario Bros .
Wii , if a player is experiencing an area of difficulty , this will allow them to clear troubled areas and take over when they 're ready " confirmed Miyamoto , through his translator .
" And yes , we 're looking into this for future games , too " Miyamoto says .

Advertisement Governments around the world are hurrying to contain the spread of a new swine flu virus after outbreaks were reported in Mexico , the US and Canada .
At least 100 people are now suspected to have died of the disease in Mexico .
In Europe , health ministers called for an urgent meeting as one case of swine flu was confirmed in Spain .
The UN has warned the virus has the potential to become a pandemic , but said the world was better prepared than ever to deal with the threat .
Stocks of anti-viral medicines are being readied and travellers are being screened at some airports for symptoms .
Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said suspected swine flu cases in his country had risen to 1,614 .
SWINE FLU
Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu - but in Mexico more than 100 people have died Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission
' I could n't get out of bed '
Q&A : Swine flu
In pictures : Swine flu
Of the 103 deaths in Mexico , only 20 are so far confirmed to have been caused by the new virus .
A public health emergency has been declared in the US , where 20 people are confirmed to have caught the virus .
There are also six confirmed cases in Canada and one in Spain , where at least 17 other people are being tested for the virus .
Investigations are being carried out on possible cases in five other countries .
In most cases outside Mexico , people have been only mildly ill and have made a full recovery .
See map showing confirmed and suspected cases
In other developments : • Tests are also being carried out on individuals or groups in New Zealand , Australia , Brazil , Britain and Israel who fell ill following travel to Mexico
• World Health Organization ( WHO ) experts will meet in Geneva on Tuesday to discuss whether to raise the pandemic alert level
• The European Commission also said it was calling an urgent meeting of health ministers to discuss the situation
• The World Bank is providing Mexico with more than $ 200 m in loans to help it deal with the outbreak
• Shares in airlines have fallen sharply on fears about the economic impact of the outbreak Vigilance urged The WHO - the UN 's health agency - has said the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous strain .
The BBC talks to people in Mexico City about the flu outbreak .
In pictures
But officials say they need more information on the virus to determine the threat it poses .
Dr Keiji Fukuda , WHO 's assistant director - general in charge of health security , said all countries were " looking at this situation very seriously " .
" But it 's also clear that we are in a period in which the picture is evolving ... [ and that ] we have to be very careful to collect the best possible information , " he said .
The WHO is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia - like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults , a characteristic of past pandemics .
Most of those who have died so far in Mexico were young adults .
The H1N1 virus is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds .
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain , but severe cases can be treated with antiviral medication .
Dr Fukuda said years of preparing for bird flu had boosted world stocks of anti-virals .
Widespread cases
In the US , eight cases have been confirmed among New York students , seven in California , two in Texas , two in Kansas and one in Ohio .
FLU PANDEMICS 1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times - infecting up to 40 % of the world 's population and killing more than 50 m people , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people .
Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks .
The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die " I do fear that we will have deaths , " Dr Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) told reporters .
The Canadian cases were recorded at opposite ends of the country : two in British Columbia in the west , and four in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia .
In Spain , a young man who had recently returned from Mexico was found to have the virus .
He was said to be in a stable condition .
A number of countries in Asia , Latin America and Europe have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms .
Russia , China and Thailand have banned imports of raw pork and pork products from Mexico and parts of the US .
But Dr Fukuda said that there was no evidence to link exposure to pork with infection .
In the Mexican capital , schools , bars and public buildings remain closed and many people are choosing to stay indoors .
Some people are beginning to worry about the effects swine flu is having on their livelihoods and the Mexican economy in general .
Fear of the virus is expected to lead to many tourists cancelling their holidays and Mexican exports are already beginning to be affected .
Mexico : 103 dead - 20 confirmed to have died from swine flu , 18 confirmed ill with swine flu United States : 20 confirmed cases of swine flu Canada : 6 confirmed cases Spain : 1 confirmed case , 17 others being investigated UK , Israel , Brazil , Australia and New Zealand : suspected cases being tested .
Suspected cases in France tested negative

The fines charged for removing a clamp can often be more than £ 100 Wheel clamping companies will have to conform to tough new licensing regulations in order to operate , under new Home Office proposals .
Under current regulations only individual clampers must be licensed , and motorists complain of unfair fines .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the plans would tackle problems such as " unclear signage and excessive fees " .
A consultation will look at the lack of an appeals process , unreasonably quick towing and excessive penalties .
' Unacceptable ' Ms Smith said : " The licensing of individual wheel clampers has gone a long way to reducing criminality and improving standards in the industry , but it has become clear that the existing licensing scheme does not address all the concerns the public have .
" There are clearly a minority of clamping companies indulging in unacceptable behaviour including unclear signage and excessive fees .
" That is why we intend to look carefully at how we can introduce a scheme for compulsory licensing of clamping companies and will publish proposals shortly . "

Signage , including size and visibility Maximum penalties and payment methods Minimum time between immobilisation and removal Providing evidence wrongful parking has taken place Security and location of pound where vehicles are held Complaints and appeals policy The Security Industry Authority ( SIA ) , which regulates the private security industry in Britain , was asked to assess the feasibility the various options for the regulation of wheel clamping companies , including a company registration scheme .
SIA chief executive , Bernard Herdan , said : " Vehicle immobilisation is a sector that faces criticism due to the nature of the work it does and the behaviour of some operatives in the industry .
" In response to concerns over practices in the sector we have set out how wheel clampers could be more tightly regulated through a new company licensing scheme .
" We expect all legitimate firms will welcome this new approach and will be ready to work with us to make this a success . "
Costas Constantino from Flash Park Wheel Clampers agreed licensing would help get rid of cowboys from the industry .
He said : " There 's going to be set limits on how much a clamp release fee 's going to be and how much a towaway fee 's going to be .
Underhand tactics
" At the moment we have situations where people are going around and they 're charging both fees , so a motorist can be left , for example , up to four hundred pounds out of pocket . "
Motorists have complained of underhand tactics by clamping firms , such as some concealing the signs that inform people they are in a clamping zone .
Pieter Smit had to pay £ 80 to get a clamp released in Peterborough despite being parked correctly , and never got his money back .
He said : " It was just very annoying that a person could be so bombastic and rude .
" It was a very bad experience . "
In May 2008 , a boss of a car - clamping company which operated throughout Staffordshire and Worcestershire was jailed for four years for taking thousands of pounds unlawfully from motorists .
Rebecca Meakin , 27 , was blackmailing drivers by giving them minutes - or even seconds - to pay up to have a clamp removed before their vehicles were towed away .
Clamping is illegal in Scotland , where the definition of theft includes anyone who immobilises a vehicle .
However , in England the clamping or towing away of vehicles is only seen as a temporary measure and so it remains legal .

To show his gratitude to the birds who helped him on the path to rehabilitation , Mr Wilson has devoted his life to feathered pets whose owners are no longer able or want to keep them .
Soon after scientists first isolated influenza A type viruses from pigs in 1931 and humans in 1933 , they watched it break evolutionary barriers with alarming ease — infecting not only humans , but also aquatic birds , poultry , pigs , horses , dogs , and other species .
Now , with an intensifying outbreak driven by the emergence of a new strain of influenza A( H1N1 ) , scientists once again have a unique opportunity to study viral evolution in action .
Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Robert Lamb , a virologist and influenza expert at Northwestern University , has followed the current outbreak closely .
From his office just outside Chicago , Lamb has been conferring with scientific colleagues worldwide and poring over available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and World Health Organization web sites .
Pigs have often been considered a potential halfway house for these viruses because they have receptors for both avian and human influenza .
Robert A. Lamb
He credits the CDC and other public health officials for moving quickly to assemble — and make publicly available — a vast amount of information about samples of the virus obtained from Mexico , the United States , and elsewhere .
Such information , he says , can tell researchers a lot about the genetic and structural makeup of the virus .
What he ’s learned so far about influenza A( H1N1 ) concerns Lamb , but he acknowledges that things are moving fast , and there are many open questions .
“ It is too early to know what will happen next , ” he said .
From a genetic point of view , Lamb describes the virus as a “ complicated reassortant , containing a mixture of genes from influenza viruses that infect Eurasian swine , American swine , birds and humans . ”
Strains of flu virus differ from one another largely in the genes that code for surface molecules called glycoproteins , which are the primary targets of the body 's immune system in defending against flu viruses .
H1N1 belongs to the H1 influenza A virus family , just 1 of 16 subtypes .
Labeled H1 to H16 , each subtype is named for the distinct structural biology of one of the key influenza surface proteins , hemagglutinin ( HA ) .
All H1 viruses , for instance , share a similarly shaped HA protein .
Influenza viruses are further distinguished by the shapes of their neuraminidase ( NA ) proteins , of which there are nine subtypes .
Like a coat of armor , the HA and NA surface proteins stud the tiny influenza virus particle .
When the virus mutates , it essentially " changes coats , " altering the shape of its exterior surface and becoming unrecognizable to the human ( or animal ) immune system .
This is the essence of immune evasion , a hallmark of influenza .
The virus can undergo two types of structural changes that help it dodge the immune system .
Small changes in the virus ’s coat proteins happen continually and result in new strains .
This is a main reason why people can get the flu more than once and why they need to get a new flu vaccine every year .
The virus coat can also change abruptly into a new subtype that has an HA protein or an HA - NA protein combination that has not been seen in humans , at least not for many years .
Most people would have little or no innate protection against this new virus .
And if the virus can spread easily from person to person , a pandemic may occur .
If influenza viruses rarely changed shape , immune evasion would n't keep researchers up at night .
But influenza viruses evolve constantly , and their physical structure is again the reason .
Inside its spherical shell , the virus particle houses eight separate RNA segments — which encode genes for 11 proteins — and this kind of segmented genome is ripe for recombination .
If two different influenza viruses infect the same cell , for instance , they can easily exchange gene segments — generating theoretically up to 256 different offspring .
Scientists call this phenomenon a genetic " reassortment , " and the hybrid viruses are “ reassortants . ”
Flu pandemics in 1918 , 1957 , and 1968 caused millions of deaths .
Both strain H2N2 ( the cause of the 1957 pandemic ) and strain H3N2 ( the 1968 pathogen ) are believed to have arisen by the exchange of genes between avian and human flu viruses , possibly following dual infection in humans .
The deadliest pandemic , in 1918 , was different .
It was the result of strain H1N1 , thought to be derived wholly from an ancestor that originally infected birds .
Swine influenza , which is at the center of the 2009 outbreak , is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that causes regular outbreaks in pigs .
People do not normally get swine flu , but human infections can and do happen .
Swine flu viruses have been reported to spread from person - to - person , but in the past , this transmission was limited and not sustained beyond three people .
Lamb and others are keenly interested in the molecular mechanics that permit viruses , such as influenza A( H1N1 ) , to jump between species .
The specific cause of the jump from one species to another remains something of a mystery , but many researchers believe it has to do with changes in the HA protein , which is responsible for recognizing receptors on the cells the virus infects .
Lamb looks at the present circumstances in light of historical influenza outbreaks , such as 1918 and the more recent outbreak of swine flu in the United States in 1976 .
He notes that there was particular concern about the 1976 strain because at the time scientists thought the devastating 1918 virus was also of swine origin .
That was proven to be incorrect later , but Lamb says that the perceived similarity between the two viruses drove the decision to vaccinate approximately 40 million people in the United States .
Within several months of receiving the vaccine , more than 30 people had died from complications related to Guillain - Barré syndrome , a paralyzing nerve disease .
“ In retrospect , if a mistake was made , it was the decision to vaccinate the U.S. population , ” Lamb said .
It is too early to know how similar the 2009 strain is to the 1976 strain , influenza A / New Jersey / 1976 ( H1N1 ) .
“ The 2009 A ( H1N1 ) virus has made the jump already , ” Lamb said .
“ It is basically a zoonotic that has adapted to infect humans . ”
He says pigs are a likely crucible in which various influenza viruses commingled to produce influenza A( H1N1 ) .
“ Pigs , ” he notes , “ have often been considered a potential halfway house for these viruses because they have receptors for both avian and human influenza . ”
Although many have described the current influenza A( H1N1 ) as a “ novel virus , ” Lamb is n’t so sure how new it is .
“ We do know the genetic changes that led to influenza A( H1N1 ) did not all occur at once .
The cross between parts of swine genes , avian genes and human genes was already in existing ‘ triple reassortant ’ viruses .
By the looks of this strain of influenza A( H1N1 ) , we ’re seeing a switch between swine influenza and this pre-existing triple reassortant . ”
One question nagging at Lamb and other scientists is whether the most recent flu vaccine administered in the United States might confer some small amount of protection against influenza A( H1N1 ) , even though it was produced to tamp down other strains of flu virus .
“ One of the components in that vaccine was against the ‘ seasonal ’ H1N1 virus that was already out there , ” Lamb said .
“ We want to know how much cross-reactivity there is between the seasonal H1N1 and influenza A( H1N1 ) . ”
Cross-reactivity is the reaction against an antigen and an antibody that was directed against a similar but different antigen .
“ It may be that there ’s a small amount of cross- reactivity that ’s hard to measure , but that nonetheless gives you some protective effect and makes the difference between being very sick or mildly sick , ” he said .

Here is the list of those killed and detained in Iran , updated as information becomes available .
The list is by no means comprehensive and does not include the great majority of people arrested at protests on the streets .
The Campaign has the names of 19 people who have been killed by government forces .
The list currently includes the names of 242 detainees , including 121 political personalities , 25 journalists , 9 professors , and 87 students .
These are prominent personalities who have been detained at their homes or places of work by unidentified agents and taken to undisclosed locations .
They are mostly held in incommunicado detention and have no access to legal council .
On 10 July , Tehran ’s prosecutor general , said that more than 2,500 people have been detained in Tehran alone , with 500 still in detention .
The Campaign believes , based on reports received from within Iran , that many more could be under arrest throughout the country .
The following is a list of prominent political personalities , journalists , and students that the Campaign has received .
This list does not include citizens detained during street protests .

Climate Cycle : Chicago Rides Toward Solar Powered Schools
Climate Cycle is a Chicago - based 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-profit organization working to make schools more energy efficient by donating solar panels and empower youth to become leaders in the emerging green economy through education .
Their flagship event , the Climate Cycle bike ride , will take place on May 9 , 2009 along the shores of Lake Michigan .
All money raised will be used to purchase solar panels and donate them to Chicago schools .
Climate Cycle celebrated its first solar inauguration on April 14 , 2009 at Perspectives / IIT Math and Science Academy in Chicago .
Purchased with a grant from the Motorola Foundation and installed by donated labor from the I.B.E.W. Local 134 electrician ’s union , the six solar panels are now in operation .
I had a chance to talk with Joey Feinstein , founder and Executive Director of Climate Cycle , last week while he was busy preparing for the upcoming ride .
Climate Cycle is essentially a blend of his three passions - bikes , education and the state of the environment - driven by his belief in the effectiveness of activity - based change .
Me : How did Climate Cycle get started ?
Joey : Climate Change actually started in my mind in San Francisco .
I went to the Presidio School of Management and that ’s where I came up with the concept .
While at school I took a cross-country bike ride from Wisconsin to the West coast .
On that trip the initial seed was planted by a farmer in North Dakota who spoke to me about climate change on a personal level - he felt it on a visceral level .
From there I started teaching at the Rice Children ’s Center and I felt a need to bring climate change issues up to people it affected .
I considered teaching full time but business seemed like a great way to get the message out there and make a difference .
What kind of turnout are you expecting for your inaugural Climate Cycle ride on May 9 , 2009 ?
We have over 300 registered riders .
There are some great teams and people from all walks of life .
We are really looking at this as “ How do we as a society bring together different groups of people ? ”
One of the key aspects of Climate Cycle is the mobilization of the African - American community on bikes .
There are lots of teams from the South Side of Chicago .
One school has 25 people , a mix of administrators , teachers and students , and they have already raised $ 4,000 !
We have the support of some great organizations .
The Local 134 Union is donating all of the labor for free .
Motorola has been a great sponsor — they have put up a $ 30,000 matching grant for every dollar we raise through the Climate Cycle event .
How does your Energy Efficient School Program work ?
Climate Change raises the money .
A General Contractor oversees the project .
The Local 134 Union donates the labor .
We pay for it and give the solar panel system to the school .
We also do education as a follow up to the installation .
We work with each school to integrate the solar energy system into their curriculum by doing things like installing interactive energy meters that give real - time readings on school energy use and show how weather affects that energy usage .
We set it up so that the meter runs backward when the school is producing more energy than it is using to demonstrate how much energy the solar panels are saving .
How is Climate Cycle looking to grow in the future ?
We are taking a two pronged approach : designing the Climate Cycle events and creating a sustainable initiative in the schools .
For the Climate Cycle events , we want to expand our Chicago event and eventually expand to other cities .
We want this organization to be raising tens of millions of dollars to put solar panels on schools across the country .
In the schools we would like to see this grow into integrating internship opportunities to get the students more involved and collate a body of educational best practices for integrating with school curriculum .
We want to make these events fantastic .
The time is now and we want to be a Sustainability Showcase on Wheels .
What kind of bike will you be riding at Climate Cycle ?
My Trek 520 — same bike I rode across the country in 2000 .
I ’ve got 12,000 miles on that bike , 3200 on that trip alone .
And I ’ve only ever had two flats .

Sure , you use Firefox , but are you really making the most of it ?
I mean , I know plenty of users who never bother to change the home page , even though they always go straight to another site upon starting the browser .
( Just make that site your home page , people ! )
This week I 've got a few useful tricks for your favorite browser .
Four Things You Didn't Know About Firefox Browser Tabs
I 've found that not everyone knows everything they should know about Firefox tabs .
For example :
They 're easy to create : Just tap Ctrl - T to open a new , blank tab .
Or , if you want to open a Web link in a tab of its own , just click it with your mouse wheel .
They 're drag - and - drop :
You can change your tabs ' order just by dragging and dropping them as you see fit .
They can return from the dead :
If you accidentally close a tab you need , just right - click the tab toolbar and choose Undo Close Tab .
( You can also press Ctrl - Shift - T if you 're a shortcut junkie like me . )
Presto :
The last tab you closed magically reappears .
They can multiply on startup :
Want to open multiple tabs every time you start Firefox ?
Say , one for Google and another for PC World ?
( Hey , ca n't a guy squeeze in a little nepotism ? )
Just open the tabs you want ( and close all others ) , click Tools , Options , and then click the Main tab .
Finally , click Use Current Pages .
Now , whenever you start Firefox , those two sites will magically appear !
Of course , do n't forget my all - time favorite tab trick : the PermaTabs extension , which temporarily makes tabs permanent .
Change the Speed of Mousewheel Scrolling in Firefox
After the mouse itself , the mousewheel is the single greatest navigation tool ever invented .
Mine is spinning constantly , especially in Firefox , where I use it to zip up and down Web pages .
By default , however , one " turn " of the mouse wheel scrolls only a few lines at a time -- and I want to move faster .
Fortunately , there 's a fairly easy way to adjust Firefox 's scroll speed .
Even better , there 's a keyboard shortcut that can slow it down again for " precision " scrolling .
First , here 's how to change the default scroll speed :
Open Firefox , then type about : config in the address bar and hit Enter .
In the Filter box , type mousewheel .
withnokey .
Right - click mousewheel.withnokey.sysnumlines and then click Toggle .
This should set the value to False .
Right - click mousewheel.withnokey.numlines and then click Modify .
Bump the value to 6 or so and click OK .
Switch to another tab to see if you like the scroll speed .
( Thankfully , you do n't have to restart Firefox every time you make a change . )
If not , experiment a bit until you find a number you like .
I keep mine at 7 , though there are times when I want -- or even need -- the option of scrolling more slowly .
Solution : I hold down the Alt key .
That drops Firefox back to line - at - a - time scrolling until I release the key .
Add Firefox 's Spell - Check Feature to Forms
Firefox 3 comes with a handy - dandy built - in spell - checker .
If you 've ever used , say , Google Docs or posted a message in an online forum , you 've probably seen it at work : A red line appears under each misspelled word .
Right - click the word to see spelling suggestions ( along with the usual context - menu options ) .
It 's a great feature , but it has just one shortcoming :
It does n't work in Web forms .
Well , not yet , anyway :
It 's a simple matter to tweak the spell checker so it pulls form duty .
Here 's how :
Open Firefox , then type about : config in the address bar and hit Enter .
In the Filter box , type spellcheck .
Right - click layout.spellcheckDefault , and then click Modify .
Raise the value from 1 to 2 . Restart Firefox .
Now the spell - checker should work in most online forms .

In recent weeks , I have been blogging about Miss California and the response from readers has enticed many a heated debate .
It seems that no matter where one stands on the issue of same - sex marriage , they stand firm with their convictions and the discussions in the comment sections have been fascinating and thought - provoking .
Thanks to all who are a part .
This morning , I wanted to update with the newest saga in the Miss California story .
It appears that this time , she might have some ' splaining to do to the Big Guy .
I believe that posing for nude photos might constitute a sin in the Sin Handbook , eh ?
A series of topless photos of Miss C were recently released on the internet .
While I certainly do not think that there is anything wrong with posing topless or nude and is a personal choice for each model , it does not seem to mesh with Carrie Prejean 's " living life according to the Bible " platform that she has recently been sharing with the country .
Alicia Jacobs , an entertainment reporter at KVBC in Las Vegas , has seen all six of the racy photos of Prejean from this spread and said this morning on the Today Show , that some of the others are " more revealing than the one shown . "
Prejean's has issued a response to the surfaced photos :
“ I am a Christian , and I am a model .
Models pose for pictures , including lingerie and swimwear photos .
Recently photos taken of me as a teenager have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith .
I am not perfect , and I will never claim to be .
But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive .
While we may not agree on every issue , we should show respect for others ’ opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean - spirited attacks . ”
I am curious how the National Organization for Marriage ( Prejean is a spokesperson for their new " No Offense " campaign ) feels about these photos and if this is the image they want associated with their organization .
What do YOU think about this newest development ?
South Africa has the world 's highest incidence of HIV / Aids South Africa 's HIV epidemic has levelled off at an infection rate of 10.9 % for those aged two or older , according to a new study .
The survey also suggests the rate of infection in children and teenagers could be falling .
This could be partly attributed to increased use of condoms , it says .
But the survey warned that the overall situation remained " dire " .
South Africa has the world 's largest HIV - positive population , at 5.5 million .
Women aged between 20 and 34 continued to be the worst affected , with 33 % carrying HIV , the report by the Human Sciences Research Council said .
Olive Shisana , an author of the study of 20,826 people released on Tuesday , said there were " promising findings of a changing pattern of HIV infection among children and youth " .
" The good news is that the change in HIV prevalence in children is most likely attributable to the successful implementation of several HIV - prevention interventions , " she said .
Challenges
In children aged 2 - 14 , HIV prevalence had dropped from 5.6 % in 2002 to 2.5 % in 2008 , the report said .
There was also a fall in new infections among teenagers aged 15 - 19 .
There is clearly light at the end of the tunnel
Aaron Motsoaledi ,
Health Minister
The overall level of HIV infection in those aged two and over , at 10.9 % , had moved little .
In 2002 the figure was 10.8 % and in 2005 11.4 % .
Reports of condom use were sharply up among young people .
In 2002 57 % of men aged 15 - 24 said they used a condom at their last sexual encounter - a figure which rose to 87 % in 2008 .
The figure for women in the same age group rose from 46 % to 73 % .
" There is clearly light at the end of the tunnel , " said Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi .
" There is real light . "
However , the survey also listed a series of challenges , including a rise in the number of those who have many sexual partners and an increase in HIV prevalence among 15 - 49 year - olds in some provinces .
Fraser McNeill , an anthropologist at the London School of Economics who has studied HIV / Aids among South Africa 's Venda ethnic group , told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that the report was " great news " if the statistics were reliable .
But he cautioned that programmes to tackle HIV could run up against cultural obstacles .
" I found ways in which Aids intervention programmes are implemented are counterproductive , " he said .
" People on the ground often believe that condoms actually cause Aids , and the women who are involved in the process of Aids education are often framed as vectors of the virus . "

As rage spreads in Afghanistan after US bombing that killed up to 130 people , unnamed Pentagon officials are spinning another cover - up .
Defiant Obama moves ahead with troop increase .
As President Barack Obama prepares to send some 21,000 more US troops into Afghanistan , anger is rising in the western province of Farah , the scene of a US bombing massacre that may have killed as many as 130 Afghans , including 13 members of one family .
At least six houses were bombed and among the dead and wounded are women and children .
As of this writing reports indicate some people remain buried in rubble .
The US airstrikes happened on Monday and Tuesday .
Just hours after Obama met with US - backed president Hamid Karzai Wednesday , hundreds of Afghans — perhaps as many as 2,000 — poured into the streets of the provincial capital , chanting “ Death to America . ”
The protesters demanded a US withdrawal from Afghanistan .
In Washington , Karzai said he and the US occupation forces should operate from a “ higher platform of morality , ” saying , “ We must be conducting this war as better human beings , ” and recognize that “ force wo n’t buy you obedience . ”
And yet , his security forces opened fire on the demonstrators , reportedly wounding five people .
According to The New York Times :
In a phone call played on a loudspeaker on Wednesday to outraged members of the Afghan Parliament , the governor of Farah Province , Rohul Amin , said that as many as 130 civilians had been killed , according to a legislator , Mohammad Naim Farahi .
Afghan lawmakers immediately called for an agreement regulating foreign military operations in the country .
“ The governor said that the villagers have brought two tractor trailers full of pieces of human bodies to his office to prove the casualties that had occurred , ” Mr. Farahi said .
“ Everyone at the governor ’s office was crying , watching that shocking scene . ”
Mr. Farahi said he had talked to someone he knew personally who had counted 113 bodies being buried , including those of many women and children .
Later , more bodies were pulled from the rubble and some victims who had been taken to the hospital died , he said .
The US airstrikes hit villages in two areas of Farah province on Monday night and Tuesday .
The extent of the deaths only came to public light because local people brought 20 - 30 corpses to the provincial capital .
If the estimates of 130 dead are confirmed , it would reportedly be the single largest number of deaths caused by a US bombing since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 .
While Secretary of State Hillary Clinton initially “ apologized ” Wednesday for the civilian deaths and Obama reportedly conveyed similar sentiments to Karzai when they met in person , later in the day Clinton ’s spokesperson , Robert Wood , framed her apology as being based on preliminary information and , according to AP , said they “ were offered as a gesture , before all the facts of the incident are known . ”
By day ’s end , the Pentagon was seeking to blame the Taliban for “ staging ” the massacre to blame it on the US .
Last night , NBC News ’s Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said military sources told him Taliban fighters used grenades to kill three families to “ stage ” a massacre and then blame it on the US .
The senior US military and NATO commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David McKiernan , spoke in general terms :
“ We have some other information that leads us to distinctly different conclusions about the cause of the civilian casualties , ” he said .
McKiernan left the specific details of the spin to unnamed officials .
According to The Washington Post , “ A U.S. defense official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that ‘ the Taliban went to a concerted effort to make it look like the U.S. airstrikes caused this .
The official did not offer evidence to support the claim , and could not say what had caused the deaths . ”
Meanwhile , according to the Associated Press , a senior Defense official who did not want to be identified “ said late Wednesday that Marine special operations forces believe the Afghan civilians were killed by grenades hurled by Taliban militants , who then loaded some of the bodies into a vehicle and drove them around the village , claiming the dead were victims of an American airstrike .
A second U.S. official said a senior Taliban commander is believed to have ordered the grenade attack . ”
As the AP reported , “ it would be the first time the Taliban has used grenades in this way . ”
While the Pentagon spins its story , the International Committee of the Red Cross has stated bluntly that US airstrikes hit civilian houses and revealed that an ICRC counterpart in the Red Crescent was among the dead .
“ We know that those killed included an Afghan Red Crescent volunteer and 13 members of his family who had been sheltering from fighting in a house that was bombed in an air strike , ” said the ICRC ’s head of delegation in Kabul , Reto Stocker .
“ We are deeply concerned by these events .
Tribal elders in the villages called the ICRC during the fighting to report civilian casualties and ask for help .
As soon as we heard of the attacks we contacted all sides to warn them that there were civilians and injured people in the area . ”
Read the entire ICRC statement here .
The Times , meanwhile , interviewed local people who contradict the unnamed US Defense officials ’ version of events :
Villagers reached by telephone said many were killed by aerial bombing .
Muhammad Jan , a farmer , said fighting had broken out in his village , Shiwan , and another , Granai , in the Bala Baluk district .
An hour after it stopped , the planes came , he said .
In Granai , he said , women and children had sought shelter in orchards and houses .
“ Six houses were bombed and destroyed completely , and people in the houses still remain under the rubble , ” he said , “ and now I am working with other villagers trying to excavate the dead bodies . ”
He said that villagers , crazed with grief , were collecting mangled bodies in blankets and shawls and piling them on three tractors .
People were still missing , he said .
Mr. Agha , who lives in Granai , said the bombing started at 5 p.m. on Monday and lasted until late into the night .
“ People were rushing to go to their relatives ’ houses , where they believed they would be safe , but they were hit on the way , ” he said .
In her earlier statement regarding the bombing , Clinton told Hamid Karzai “ there will be a joint investigation by your government and ours . ”
But before that investigation began , the Pentagon was already using its unnamed officials to blame the Taliban .
It also bears remembering that the US track record of thoroughly “ investigating ” US massacres is pathetic .
The UN said there was convincing evidence that last year ’s US attack on the village of Azizabad in western Afghanistan killed 90 civilians , but the military only acknowledged 30 civilian deaths .
Standing between Hamid Karzai and Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday , Obama said the US would “ make every effort ” to avoid civilian deaths in both countries ( which are regularly bombed by the US ) .
But as he was making those remarks , Defense Secretary Robert Gates was arriving in Kabul on Wednesday “ to make sure that preparations were moving forward for the troop increase and that soldiers and Marines were getting the equipment they needed . ”
Jessica Barry , a spokesperson for the ICRC said , “ With more troops coming in , there is a risk that civilians will be more and more vulnerable . ”
For our “ The Cure for iPhone Envy ” ad campaign we leased the window on the BART exit outside the SF Apple Store .
Our contract with BART ’s ad agency specified that the ad would go up on Monday morning , the day of the WWDC keynote .
However , the ad agency jumped the gun and our ad went up on Friday the weekend before .
Shortly after the ad was put up , it was ripped down by a BART employee .
A tipster sent me pictures of this happening :
BART ’s excuse for ripping down the ad was that it was “ too dark ” and not letting through enough light into the BART exit .
However , we have pictures that show there was plenty of light coming through the ad ( the ad is printed on a clear plastic material ) :
We then submitted the following revised ad with a white background .
A white ad would have let even more light through ( notice how bright the bottle is in the original ad above ) .
However , it was rejected for having a solid white background (! ) .
At the ad agency ’s request , we then made the background completely transparent .
It ’s a lot harder to read text on a transparent background …
After complying with all their requests to change the ad , we still have n’t been given a firm date on when the ad will be back up .
Apple is a major BART advertiser ( in the past they ’ve plastered entire BART stations with iPod ads ) .
Apple ’s WWDC conference ends on Friday .
It ’s pretty obvious what ’s going on here …
I ’m sure our ad will conveniently be back up after WWDC ends .

“ Really ! ? ” Warren was stunned .
“ They went with us ?
What ’s wrong with them ?
Why on earth would they have done that ! ? ”
Warren had a good reason to be skeptical .
While his employer , Aderrific , was one of the region ’s top advertising agencies , they were n’t exactly known for building Customer Relationship Management systems .
Yet , their largest client – a major soft drink company famous for a certain challenge – had retained Aderrific to do just that .
“ I guess our price was right , ” Warren ’s fellow developer said .
“ Either way , I ’m sure we ’ll be able to build them something decent .
Or , at the very least , something decent on the ‘ first - ever - attempt - at - anything - that - resembles - CRM ’ scale . ”
Though Warren and his colleague had raised concerns about the project long ago , they were largely ignored by management .
After all , Aderrific was n’t in the business of turning down business , especially when that business paid very well .
Their programming team of two would just have to deal … and build a working CRM system , of course .
Building it Out
Fortunately , Warren did have a fair amount of experience building database - backed applications and had worked with enough clients to feel comfortable gathering software requirements .
He also knew that their existing tools – Microsoft Access for simple internal applications and Perl / MySQL for client websites – probably were n’t the best fit .
Java , having just celebrated its fifth anniversary , seemed to be the right choice for application development , while Oracle ( which their customer already had ) was the logical choice for the database .
After feverously trying to climb as many learning curves as possible , Warren and his coworker spent the next few months designing , developing , and implementing the CRM application .
One decision they made early on was that , above all else , data integrity was critical .
No matter how many bugs or oversights made it into the application , so long as the database was chock - full of constraints , their data would be valid .
One of the key tables in the CRM database was the users table ( named “ usr ” ) .
As the name implies , it contained all the relevant information for a user of the CRM system .
The most important column in the table was the user ’s email address , as that was used as a login and served as the only method for contacted users of the system .
As such , the column had a UNIQUE constraint defined and a rather sophisticated CHECK constraint to make sure the value at least resembled an email address .
The Launch
When their CRM system eventually went live , it had its share of issues .
It was a little slow , a little confusing , and a little shy on features , but it worked well enough .
One exceptionally annoying bug , however , was the fact that users just could n’t seem to understand how to write out their email address .
A quick peek in the users table revealed many failed attempts : jdoe@www.anyco.com , jdoe.www@ , anyco@anyco.jdoe , anyco@www.com / jdoe .
Fortunately , Warren ’s boss had the perfect solution for their launch woes : Aderrific would bring on a SQL Guru to review the design , suggest improvements , and recover the countless invalid email addresses from the data .
Sure , it was a little late , but it was definitely better than never .
The SQL Guru Delivers
The good news was that , after the consultant spent a few days analyzing and tweaking the database , no further changes were needed .
Amazingly , Warren and his fellow developer had done such a bang - up job developing the CRM system .
The bad news , however , was the application had even more bugs than before .
Upon further investigation , Warren found that there were two rows in the user table with the same email address .
Worse still , neither of those email addresses were formatted even remotely correct .
Warren figured that the database must have somehow been damaged while the SQL Guru optimized things , as there were two different constraints that would prevent this situation from occurring .
“ That ’s simply not possible , ” the SQL Guru procalaimed when Warren explained some of the bugs the application was having , “ I hardly touched the database .
It must be your application code . ”
Not quite convinced , Warren decided to dig a little further .
Since all SQL * Plus sessions were logged , he decided to look there .
Following is what he came dug up .

It was only the tip of the iceberg .
Somehow , the SQL Guru had taken their CRM system – which did , at one point , rate very high on the first - ever - attempt - at - anything - that - resembles - CRM scale – and brought it near the bottom of that bell curve .
Tried as they did , Warren and his fellow develop were never quite able to bring it back .
After that project , Aderrific decided to stick to advertising .
And fortunately , they have n’t looked back in the nine years since .
Here are five great unscripted scenes that our movie memories could n't do without .
1. Beginning a beautiful friendship
Perhaps no movie has as many famous one - liners as Casablanca ( 1942 ) .
But they were n't all the work of screenwriters Julius J Epstein , Philip G Epstein and Howard Koch ( who deservedly won an Oscar for their work ) .
Based on Murray Burnett and Joan Allison 's unproduced play Everybody Goes to Rick's , the script was written in a hurry , and was still going through rewrites when filming commenced .
As a result , some of the best lines were improvised .
" Here 's looking at you , kid , "  Humphrey Bogart 's farewell line to Ingrid Bergman , was a popular quote in the 1930s .
Bogart ad - libbed it while filming Casablanca , and it worked so well that was used twice .
In 2007 , Premiere magazine named it the best greatest - ever movie line .
Bogart 's final line , however , was created just for the film .
Who can forget that last shot , as Rick ( Bogart ) and Captain Louis Renault ( Claude Rains ) walk away , planning to escape Casablanca after assisting in a noble cause .
" Louis , I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship , "  says Rick .
The line was created by producer Hal B. Wallis , and dubbed by Bogart after filming was completed .
2. Indy vs. the Swordsman
In one of the coolest and most memorable scenes of Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 ) , Indiana Jones ( Harrison Ford ) , ready for action , is confronted by an evil - looking swordsman .
Rather than engage him in hand - to hand combat , he gives the swordsman a tired , " you must be joking "  expression , pulls out his gun and casually shoots him .
This funny and clever moment , filmed in Tunisia , might never have happened if Ford and most of the crew were n't suffering from food poisoning .
Initially , Indy was supposed to defeat the swordsman in an extended fight sequence , using his famous whip .
However , as he was so ill , the scene just was n't working .
Instead , director Steven Spielberg allowed him to dispose of his foe in this simpler , but no less effective method .
The tired look on Indy 's face , of course , was utterly real .
3 . " You ain't heard nothing yet ! " 
Warner Brothers '
The Jazz Singer , immortalized as the first - ever talking picture , was basically a silent film , with just a few moments of synchronised sound .
The audio was mainly just a few opportunities for the star , Al Jolson , to sing hit songs like My Mammy and Blue Skies ( later a hit for Willie Nelson ) .
The small amount of dialogue was ad - libbed by Jolson and Eugenie Besserer ( who played his mother " “ or his " mammy "  ) .
Jolson spoke a grand total of 281 words in the film , and the most memorable line was his final one : " Wait a minute , wait a minute .
You ai n't heard nothing yet ! " 
It was a prophetic quote , and more than 70 years later , it would earn a place in the American Film Institute 's list of the greatest movie lines .
Because Jolson 's line was so off - the - cuff , it might have been removed from the final cut if Sam Warner , the driving force behind talking pictures , had not insisted that it stay .
Sadly , Warner died of a sinus infection a day before the film 's release , meaning that he would never witness it making history .
4. The Odessa Steps Massacre
One of the most famous and powerful scenes in movie history , still harrowing after 84 years , showed Tsarist troops slaughtering Russian civilians at the port of Odessa during an unsuccessful 1905 revolution .
It was part of Bronenosets Potemkin ( 1925 ) , known to English - speakers as Battleship Potemkin ( or simply Potemkin ) , commissioned by the Bolskevik authorities to a young filmmaker , Sergei Eisenstein , to fill the public with revolutionary zeal .
The sequence originally it took up only three pages of a huge screenplay called The Year 1905 by Nina Agadzhavana - Shutko , a veteran of the 1905 revolution .
It was conceived as an eight - part epic , with action taking place at locations around the Soviet Union , but the shooting was interrupted by bad weather ( it was winter ) , making it impossible to meet the deadline .
While in Odessa , however , Eisenstein decided to focus on one incident : the mutiny by sailors , and the subsequent massacre of civilians who supported them on the steps at Odessa .
To increase the power of the scene , Eisenstein invented " montage "  , editing numerous images in a vigorous and dynamic way .
Soldiers inhumanly mow down the civilians ; people are shot through the head ( in close - up ) ; crowds panic , trampling each other ; and ( most suspensefully ) a mother loses control of her baby 's pram , which bounces down the steps before eventually overturning .
It 's one of the most influential , imitated ( most famously in The Godfather and The Untouchables ) movie scenes , but it might have never happened if the weather had been better .
5 . The Dance of Death
Ingmar Bergman 's 1957 masterpiece Det Sjunde Inseglet ( The Seventh Seal ) is set in medieval Sweden , ravaged by the black plague , where a knight returning from the Crusades ( Max von Sydow ) challenges Death ( Bengt Ekerot ) to a game of chess .
Inevitably , the knight loses in the end .
In one of the final scenes , he and five other characters are led away by Death , in the eerie " Dance of Death "  sequence , shot against an ominous , cloudy background as the sun prepares to set .
This very famous moment was n't in Bergman 's original script ( or in his play , on which it was based ) , but added at the end of the day 's filming , when he noticed the visual effect of the clouds .
Showing the doomed " dancers "  in silhouette makes for a powerful image , but it was also a practical one .
Most of the actors had already gone home , so Bergman arranged some technicians and nearby tourists to throw on the costumes as stand - ins .
To the tourists , this must have been a real buzz .
Spontaneously appearing in a movie is cool , but appearing in one of the greatest scenes of movie history must have been an incredible thrill .

Advertisement The European Space Agency is about to look in detail at how it might upgrade its space station freighter so it can return cargo safely to Earth .
At the moment , the Automated Transfer Vehicle is discarded after delivering supplies to the orbiting platform .
The agency will ask industry in the coming weeks to define the requirements for a far more capable ship .
To be known as the Advanced Re-entry Vehicle ( ARV ) , it could be the first step to an eventual manned vehicle .
A near one - for - one mock - up of what a crewed version of this vessel might look like has been a star turn over the past week at the Paris air show .
AUTOMATED TRANSFER VEHICLE
The ship was produced by a consortium of European companies led by EADS Astrium The ATV is the first completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS
Once the US shuttle is retired , it will be the largest supply vessel going to the space station Many believe it to be a versatile vehicle that could be adapted for crew transportation
Freighter destroyed over Pacific Currently , all European astronauts must hitch a ride on Russian or American launch systems if they want to get into orbit .
Europe would like its own independent system - but only if it is affordable , feasible , and there is a genuine need for it .
The Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) , which made such an impressive debut at the space station last year , is seen as the starting point in all these discussions .
The robotic truck has the ability to find its own way across space and then make a precise , automatic docking at its destination .
What it cannot do is bring down intact to the surface of the planet any portion of its own structure , let alone any cargo .
The maiden ATV ended its re-supply mission to the space station by plunging into the Pacific in a ball of flames .
The 18 - month ARV study will set out the technical and cost implications of altering the ATV to make its cargo carrier section fit for re-entry .
EADS Astrium , which will lead a consortium of companies on the project , envisages a conical 4.4 m - wide module that would separate from its propulsion unit just prior to its race through the atmosphere .
While the propulsion , or service , unit would burn up , the cargo module would be equipped with all the systems necessary to make a secure splash - down .
" The two key technologies for this cargo vehicle are the re-entry technologies - high speed entry and thermal protection systems ; and also the descent and landing capability - the capability to land under parachute , " said Philippe Berthe , head of advanced projects , at Astrium .
In two steps The upload capacity ( station experiments , equipment , etc ) of the cargo ship would be two tonnes ; the download capacity would be about one - and - a - half tonnes .

The upcoming 14 m - euro study , though , will have an eye on something much grander .
While Esa is thinking in the first instance only of producing an unmanned cargo - return module , it wants engineers to think about how they could quickly and easily upgrade the vehicle 's systems to support four seated humans as well .
It is a clever two - stage approach in which the flights of the cargo vessel contribute to the qualification of a later crew version - if European states want to go that far .
" The reason why we are studying the manned version of the capsule is not because we are necessarily going to approve it - we may not ; but what we are trying to do is develop the cargo version already in line with what could eventually become the human version , " explained the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) director of human spaceflight , Simonetta Di Pippo .
" In this way , we would not waste time and money if - as I hope - the manned version is eventually approved , " she told BBC News .
Russian experience Certainly , it would be an expensive next step .
It would mean the Ariane 5 rocket , which currently lofts the ATV , would have to be upgraded also to make it compliant with the enhanced safety measures demanded of human launch systems .
This would involve developing some sort of escape system on the top of the ARV to pull it clear of the Ariane were the rocket to experience an explosive failure on the launch pad or in early flight .

The ARV study will inform any policy proposal that goes before Esa member states at their next major ministerial gathering in a couple of years ' time .
The nations would need to approve a development programme and a budget to start to make the ARV a reality .
But before they do that they will want to be certain there is a need for the vehicle .
This will mean getting some assurances that the space station will be in use up to 2020 and perhaps beyond .
A decision on a manned crewship would come even later , and would depend on there being a clear strategy on human space exploration that goes even deeper into the future - at the Moon and perhaps even at Mars .
" Soyuz started flying in 1967 .
It was intended first to allow Russian access to the Moon and then access to the Russian station , " said Philippe Berthe .
" Now , 40 years on , we are making use of the Soyuz that the Russian designers never foresaw .
We think that if Europe develops its own system , in 2020 for instance , it might fly for 40 years . "

The nixing of Charles " Chas " Freeman from a post as head of the National Intelligence Council is not , as is commonly averred , a victory for the Israel lobby .
It is , instead , a Pyrrhic victory  that is , a victory so costly that it really amounts to a defeat for them .
Sure , they managed to keep out a trenchant critic of their Israel - centric and grossly distorted view of a proper American foreign policy , and , yes , they managed to smear him and put others on notice that someone with his views is radioactive , as far as a high - level job in the foreign policy establishment is concerned .
And yet  and yet .
They  the Lobby  have now been forced out in the open .
" A lobby , " says Steve Rosen , the ringleader of the " get Freeman " lynch mob , " is like a night flower : it thrives in the dark and dies in the sun . "
If so , then the Israel lobby is slated for oblivion , because as frenetically  and pathetically  as they tried to mask the centrality of their involvement , and as much as they tried to make this about other issues ( his alleged ties to Saudi Arabia , his supposed views on China ) , everybody knows it was really all about Israel and Freeman ’s contemptuous view of the " special relationship " which requires us giving Tel Aviv a blank check , moral as well as monetary .
As a foreign policy realist , he thinks we ought to put our own interests first , in the Middle East and elsewhere , not those of a foreign country , no matter how much political clout  and campaign cash  its American fifth column can muster .
This , in the current atmosphere in Washington , is " extremism , " a charge that hung over Freeman ’s appointment from the get - go .
Jonathan Chait , writing in the Washington Post , went so far as to call Freeman a " fanatic . "
A charge which seems counterintuitive , considering that we ’re talking about an adherent of a foreign policy perspective that coldly calculates American interests in what the righteous would disdain as shockingly amoral terms .
Oh , says Chait , he ’s not like those neocons , with their " simplistic " division of the world into " good guys " and " bad guys . "
No , instead , Freeman does n’t recognize any " good guys " he ’s the sort who opposed our bombing of the former Yugoslavia and our support to the narco - Mafioso " Kosovo Liberation Army , " the precursor to Ahmed Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress , which , likewise , lured us into a foreign war under false pretenses .
But the Kosovo war " halted mass slaughter , " says Chait : apparently the death of hundreds of Serbians at American hands is a slaughter not considered " mass " enough to merit mention .
Yet the alleged " genocide " the Serbs were supposedly committing turned out , in the end , to inhabit the same nonexistent country as Saddam ’s " weapons of mass destruction . "
It was , in short , war propaganda , of the sort we have become all too familiar with of late .
To be sure , Chait says : " Realism has some useful insights .
For instance , realists accurately predicted that Iraqis would respond to a U.S. invasion with less than unadulterated joy . "
This is a lot more than Chait managed to do : to this day , he defends his forceful support for the biggest strategic blunder in American military history .
" I do n’t think you can argue that a regime change in Iraq wo n’t demonstrably and almost immediately improve the living conditions of the Iraqi people , " Chait said on television as our troops massed for the attack .
No one would think of uttering such nonsense today  at least with a straight face .
Oh , but do n’t forget , it ’s those nasty realist ideologues  not the neocons or their liberal interventionist allies  who are the real danger .
As the Iraq disaster unfolded , the magazine of which Chait is employed as a senior editor declared " the central assumption underlying this magazine ’s strategic rationale for war now appears to have been wrong , " and yet " if our strategic rationale for war has collapsed , our moral one has not . "
Two years later , however , Chait and his fellow editors issued a shamefaced apology : " The New Republic deeply regrets its early support for this war . "
The " liberal " interventionism that Chait invoked in support of the war actually flew the flag of " humanitarianism . "
One million Iraqi deaths later , such a claim has a rather sinister ring to it .
He also invoked the principle of " international law "  this , in support of a lawless occupation and an unprovoked attack on a people who had no ability to strike back .
" Multilateralism " was another " principle " invoked by Chait , the great liberal  and yet who else but a genuine fanatic would make such an argument about a war that had little to no support from our allies ?
Chait is unconcerned about the actual fanatics who have done so much damage  with his help  to the country and its interests abroad .
Forget the neocons , his erstwhile allies , and let ’s concentrate on the real danger , the enemies of the Israel lobby :
" Taken to extremes , realism ’s blindness to morality can lead it wildly astray .
Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer , both staunch realists , wrote  The Israel Lobby , ’ a hyperbolic attack on Zionist political influence .
The central error of their thesis was that , since America ’s alliance with Israel does not advance American interests , it could be explained only by sinister lobbying influence .
They seemed unable to grasp even the possibility that Americans , rightly or wrongly , have an affinity for a fellow democracy surrounded by hostile dictatorships .
Consider , perhaps , if eunuchs tried to explain the way teenage boys act around girls . "
Putting Israel first is as natural as heterosexuality  but only if you work for Marty Peretz .
Why Chait and his confreres continue their denialism when it comes to the demonstrable power of the Israel lobby  which , after all , has succeeded in blocking Freeman , and many others from positions of influence  is beyond me .
AIPAC went out of its way to deny any hand in the lynch mob that went after Freeman , and yet , as Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Sullivan point out , this is just a subterfuge : their top media relations guy has his fingerprints all over this hit job , and a very effective job it was .
Effective , yet oddly forced and unconvincing : for example , it seems curious to argue that Freeman is afflicted by a " blindness to morality " when it is precisely a sense of justice that gives rise to Freeman ’s apparent sympathy [ . pdf ] for the plight of Palestinians who chafe under the constraints of life in the occupied territories .
It is precisely a sense of offended morality that drives the vast Arab anger at Israel , and causes realists like Freeman to question our unbending fealty to the inhumane and unsustainable policies of the Israeli government toward their Palestinian helots .
If anyone is afflicted with moral blindness , when it comes to this question , it is Chait and the editors of the magazine for which he works .
Chait then cites Freeman ’s by now infamous remarks on the Tiananmen Square incident , and yet this China trope was never really all that convincing .
To begin with , even in the truncated quote served up as evidence of his supposed pro-crackdown views , it is clear that Freeman was not expressing his personal view , but rather that of the average Chinese , as perceived through his own eyes :
" [ T ] he truly unforgivable mistake of the Chinese authorities was the failure to intervene on a timely basis to nip the demonstrations in the bud , rather than  as would have been both wise and efficacious  to intervene with force when all other measures had failed to restore domestic tranquility to Beijing and other major urban centers in China .
In this optic , the Politburo ’s response to the mob scene at ‘ Tian ’anmen ’ stands as a monument to overly cautious behavior on the part of the leadership , not as an example of rash action . "
[ Emphasis added ]
The phrase " in this optic " indicates  to any literate person  that the author is not speaking in his own voice , but in what he imagines to be the voice of the Chinese people .
Does Chait imagine we ’re too stupid to see this ?
I ’m afraid he and the Washington crowd he epitomizes believe precisely that .
But they ’d better watch it : if they get too careless , someone may call them out on it  and then they ’d have to admit that Freeman ’s alleged " links " to China had nothing to do with the real objections of his detractors .
So , he served on the advisory board of a Chinese company  so what ?
If everyone with a commercial connection to China had to drop out of consideration for government work , a large proportion of those currently working in Washington would be missing .
The complete disingenuousness with which Chait made his argument is so transparent that it makes me wonder if , perhaps , the Israel lobby has abandoned all attempts at subtlety , and is now working on the assumption that it does n’t matter any more if they come out in the open .
The nightflower has been exposed to the light of day , and , rather than wilt , perhaps its nurturers have decided that it ’s better to brave the sun .
That ’s why the Mearsheimer - Walt book has become such a target , to the point that anyone who praises it , as Freeman has done , is deemed unfit for office in Washington .
This explains why former AIPAC top lobbyist Steve Rosen , the indicted spy who stole classified information on behalf of Israel , openly led the anti-Freeman movement ( see this timeline ) and did n’t even try to hide his key role in the affair .
The Lobby was desperate to keep Freeman out of the NIC because it ’s an agency that provides key intelligence for the President and Congress .
If you ’ll recall , that ’s how the War Party lured us into fighting an unnecessary war against Iraq  by manipulating the intelligence , and even resorting to forgery to achieve their ends .
With Freeman at the helm of the intelligence - gathering machinery , they ’d never be able to pull if off again .
In his absence  well , they just might .
That ’s just what they ’re getting ready to do in the case of Iran , which , we are told , is gathering " weapons of mass destruction . "
Part of the NIC ’s job is to prepare the daily presidential briefings , and with such access to the President , Freeman would have been in a good position to block the War Party ’s machinations .
Which is why Chait ’s parting salvo is such an outrage :
" This is the portrait of a mind so deep in the grip of realist ideology that it follows the premises straight through to their reductio ad absurdum .
Maybe you suppose the National Intelligence Council job is so technocratic that Freeman ’s rigid ideology wo n’t have any serious consequences .
But think back to the neocon ideologues whom Bush appointed to such positions .
That did n’t work out very well , did it ? "
The neocons uphold a set of beliefs , they have an ideology : so too do the realists believe in a comprehensive worldview .
However , the question is : what do they believe ?
Chait only mentions two realist principles : the pursuit of American interests abroad , and hostility to those who would put the interests of " a fellow imperfect democracy " above the realists ’ " cold analysis . "
Yet rational analysis , however " cold " its temperature may be , seems a necessary antidote to the hysteria that followed in the wake of 9/11 .
And as for that " imperfect democracy " of Israel  what will Chait and his fellow " liberals " do when Avigdor Lieberman becomes its public as well as its private face ?
Freeman himself said it best in his statement explaining his withdrawal :
" The libels on me and their easily traceable email trails show conclusively that there is a powerful lobby determined to prevent any view other than its own from being aired , still less to factor in American understanding of trends and events in the Middle East .
The tactics of the Israel Lobby plumb the depths of dishonor and indecency and include character assassination , selective misquotation , the willful distortion of the record , the fabrication of falsehoods , and an utter disregard for the truth .
The aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process through the exercise of a veto over the appointment of people who dispute the wisdom of its views , the substitution of political correctness for analysis , and the exclusion of any and all options for decision by Americans and our government other than those that it favors . "
The real fanatics are the Israel - firsters , who have used every subterfuge , no matter how low , to maintain their parasitic grip on the American policymaking process .
The really dangerous ideologues are the Likudniks and their American amen corner who willfully distort and deform American policy into a means to empower and succor a militaristic settler colony that is increasingly anti-democratic and aggressive .
The Freeman affair has exposed the Israel lobby for precisely what they are : it has flushed them out of the woodwork , and brought them in from the shadows .
That in itself is a great victory , one that means much more in the longterm than anyone presently imagines .

Steele says he has reached out to Rush Limbaugh to tell him he meant no offense .
Steele to Rush : I 'm sorry
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael
Steele says he has reached out to Rush Limbaugh to tell him he meant no offense when he referred to the popular conservative radio host as an “ entertainer ” whose show can be “ incendiary . ”
“ My intent was not to go after Rush – I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh , ” Steele said in a telephone interview .
“ I was maybe a little bit inarticulate . …
There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership . ”

The dust - up comes at a time when top Democrats are trying to make Limbaugh the face of the Republican Party , in part by using ads funded by labor .
Americans United for Change sent a fund - raising e-mail Monday that begins : “ The Republican Party has turned into the Rush Limbaugh Party . ”
Steele told CNN host D.L. Hughley in an interview aired Saturday night : “ Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer .
Rush Limbaugh — his whole thing is entertainment .
He has this incendiary — yes , it 's ugly . ”
Steele , who won a hard - fought chairman 's race on Jan. 30 , told Politico he telephoned Limbaugh after his show on Monday afternoon and hoped that they would connect soon .
“ I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said were n’t what I was thinking , ” Steele said .
" It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing , and it came out differently .
What I was trying to say was a lot of people … want to make Rush the scapegoat , the bogeyman , and he ’s not . "
“ I ’m not going to engage these guys and sit back and provide them the popcorn for a fight between me and Rush Limbaugh , ” Steele added .
“ No such thing is going to happen . … I was n’t trying to slam him or anything . ”
On Monday ’s show , Limbaugh reacted both to the comment and to the assertion on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel that the radio host is “ the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party . ”
Limbaugh said : “ I 'm not in charge of the Republican Party , and I do n't want to be .
I would be embarrassed to say that I 'm in charge of the Republican Party in the sad - sack state that it 's in .
If I were chairman of the Republican Party , given the state that it's in , I would quit .
I might get out the hari - kari knife because I would have presided over a failure that is embarrassing to the Republicans and conservatives who have supported it and invested in it all these years . ”
On the RushLimbaugh.com home page , the transcript is labeled : “ A Few Words for Michael Steele . ”
On Monday night , DNC Chairman Tim Kaine called on Republicans to " stop following divisive figures " like Limbaugh .
" I was briefly encouraged by the courageous comments made my counterpart in the Republican Party over the weekend challenging Rush Limbaugh as the leader of the Republican Party and referring to his show as ‘ incendiary ’ and ‘ ugly , ’ " Kaine said in a statement .
" However , Chairman Steele ’s reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party , its politics and its obstruction of President Obama ’s agenda in Washington . "
In the interview with Politico , Steele called Limbaugh “ a very valuable conservative voice for our party . ”
“ He brings a very important message to the American people to wake up and pay attention to what the administration is doing , " Steele said .
" Number two , there are those out there who want to look at what he ’s saying as incendiary and divisive and ugly .
That ’s what I was trying to say .
It did n’t come out that way .
…
He does what he does best , which is provoke :
He provokes thought , he provokes the left .
And they ’re clearly the ones who are most excited about him . ”
Asked if he planned to apologize , Steele said : “ I was n’t trying to offend anybody .
So , yeah , if he ’s offended , I ’d say : Look , I ’m not in the business of hurting people ’s feelings here .
…
My job is to try to bring us all together . ”
Athens Bunker : Extraordinary Rendition ?
In 1980 I briefly rented a basement apartment in Athens , Greece ( Lycabettus - Kolonaki district ) .
One day while cleaning , I discovered a framed canvas that covered a metal door in one of the walls .
It looked like a submarine door with an air lock .
I called some friends over to help me open it .
We had to remove parts of the wooden floor - boards .
The bunker walls were a few feet thick .
When we opened the door , we found the evidence of a Nazi torture chamber , which I immediately photographed .
The chair with a hole in it was found near the bloody mattress in a corner of the Lycabettus bunker next to a pile of burnt newspaper shreds from the early 1940s featuring articles about the Nazis .
A small ball of clay or soil , pressed around the foot of the chair , bewildered us .
We later concluded that " feet of clay " were used to psychologically torture a hostage tied to the chair , who was probably ordered not to move , but to remain perfectly still and motionless at all times .
Any movement of the chair would cause the clay lump to crumble and break into smaller fragments .
The guards could then measure even the slightest movements that had occurred while they were not in the bunker , and punish the hostage accordingly .
A hole in the seat of the chair may have been due to an act of extreme violence or a malicious experiment .
I sent the photos to the local police department , but they arrived too late .
When the authorities finally got there about a month later , I had been evicted and the evidence had already been removed .
But the persons who rented the basement apartment after me were leading members of the Greek TV news media , who communicated with the Greek Prime Minister .
Therefore , I cannot rule out the possibility that the bunker may have been examined by intelligence analysts before the local police arrived .
What finally became of the disembodied chair and mattress ?
Did they go to a forensic " area " or were they discarded as rubbish ?
Most of the bunker witnesses later developed abnormal lumps or growth in their bodies .
One died of a brain tumor .
Some time later , newspapers reported that an extremely radioactive substance had mysteriously turned up in a scrap metal junkyard near Athens .
After several months , a Greek - Turkish friend of mine introduced me to the owner of Athens ' most influential newspaper .
But my bunker photos were not published because they raised too many questions .
I did n't have a story .
It haunted me for some time .
The big question was : who was the Lycabettus hostage or victim of this torture chamber ?
I visited libraries and bookstores looking for war photos that might resemble the Kolonaki bunker .
Then in 1997 , I found an official war picture that matched up perfectly .
The mathematical likelihood that similarities between mattress folds , blood spots , and markings on the floor are due to random coincidences is astronomical .
In other words , it is more probable that a comet will fall into your tea cup than for the bunker resemblances to be the results of sheer chance .
Please note that I am not out to " prove " anything with this description .
I mainly wish to publish a report of what was found in the Lycabettus bunker so that legal investigators can establish what may have happened there .
The only problem is this :
The dead person in the official photo appears to be Adolf Hitler 's double .
The alleged body of the Nazi Fuehrer discovered in the Berlin Chancellery garden had only one testicle according to the Russian autopsy report .
The Problem : Important details in the photographs match up - but really should not - because the bunker locations are almost 2000 kilometers apart .
What was a " ghost detainee " doing in the Kolonaki bunker ?
Was this a case of identity theft or extraordinary rendition ?
How long was the victim being held as a tortured hostage ?
How were the Nazis using the Kolonaki - Lycabettus district of Athens during World War Two ?
A war crime appears to have been committed in the Lycabettus bunker .
But why are the authorities today not willing to discover who the victim actually was ?
Before Hitler was : Looking for a Double
Avenging an Allied Hoax
Fierce Conditioning
Occult Nazi Nuclear Rituals
Most of the people who post opinions contrary to mine on race play do not take the time to articulate much .
As I mention , I take into account the opinions and feeling of dissenters whenever I speak or present on the topic .
I am posting here , unedited , and with the express written permission of the original author , LeatherTBird3 , the following blog entry that he additionally cross-posted in response to the Race Play Interview conducted by Andrea Plaid .
I have great respect for ALT ’s Senior Editor Mollena Williams in many aspects and on many levels .
I can certainly acknowledge and admire the courage required to broach the sensitive subject of “ race play ” in her recent editorial INTERVIEW BDSM and playing with Race Sr Editor Mollena Williams interviewed by Andrea Plaid Parts 1 and 2 .
This is a hard subject for me .
My own particular brand of “ PC ” dictates that someone ’s kink is their kink and that is to be respected .
We cannot control the way we are wired or what flips that switch in us .
If I were to be pilloried for all the sick shit that goes through my “ heads , ” it would be a worse tribulation for me than have been the inequities I have endured due to my race .
That said , whatever turns someone on , that hurts no one else , is none of my business unless I am invited to join .
However , I ’m just not so sure that “ race play ” hurts no one else .
Furthermore , I am not sure if “ race play ” alleviates the human need to be culturally and / or ethnically superior by working through it in the realm of fantasy , or simply perpetuates this flaw in the human design that has produced the ugliest of atrocities in our history .
In part 1 of the interview Mollena suggests that fear is what makes the practice of race “ play ” taboo .
I beg to differ with she whom I hold in high esteem .
I simply do not have the heart to “ play ” at that which is still so real in the human psyche and is still a real live affliction suffered by many .
This to me is like picking at a wound that you know is infected .
It is like giving children toy guns to pretend to shoot each other while bombarding them with images of feigned brutality and bloodshed and then wondering why we live in an increasingly violent society .
There is a paradoxical dichotomy within me that comes part and parcel with my African - American heritage .
It is the need to learn the lessons , reap the benefits and garner the strength that seethes within my culture without dragging along the anger spawned of the pain , despair , degradation and indignities which are linked inexorably with being black in America for my generation and the generations before me .
Starting with not knowing from which African nation and culture the African contingent of my family actually came from , to being the target of racial epithets right here on our beloved ALT and having the powers that be fail to enforce their own rules regarding racial attacks , my race , my family and I have fought to attain this small and tenuous measure of equality .
My job as a human is to distill the power and strength of character that can be derived from a culture achieving this new - found equality while casting aside the bitter dregs of anger which can only impede further progress despite its justification .
The struggle is to identify with my African - American heritage without being defined by it .
The struggle to be “ just a man ” while both holding on to and letting go of the experience upon which that man is built .
Many have died and suffered to make this paradox possible .
It took quite a bit of soul searching to come to these conclusions and I will not have that which we have struggled for generation to attain reduced to a sex toy .
Mo goes on to say that her pussy is not interested in uplifting the race .
I am not trying to “ hate ” on Mo but admitting freely to thinking with her genitals on issues of such import supports racist stereotypes and smacks of the “ I ’m gonna get mine , ” slave culture mentality that continues to plague our proud race .
I know that Mo was trying to be humorous but this statement is akin to a patriot who is willing to sellout his country for a blow job .
Miss Williams further suggests that the subjugation of a race or culture is a part of human nature ; an assertion with which I am prepared to agree .
I would even go one step further as to say that Dominance and submission is a part of our animal nature ;
That part of us that so many wish to deny and yet never can quell .
We as humans are the only creatures on this planet with the intellect to govern the instincts we have found to be ineffective , effectively bringing about and guiding our own intellectual evolution .
It is this need to rule our own passions that has spawned the concepts of law and morality .
The overwhelming majority of the world ’s governments have deemed racial discrimination to be unlawful and amoral and for good reason .
To play with race in this fashion is to spit in the face of Rosa Parks , Martin Luther King , Malcolm X and the thousands of black soldiers who fought in American wars as men only to come “ home ” to be treated as they were less than other men who did not do as much for their country .
Abolition of racial and cultural discrimination is the only way to purge it from society .
To make a game out of our on going struggle for sexual satisfaction is to make a mockery of all efforts toward that end .

During the Vietnam War , Stanford students succeeded in banning secret military research from campus .
Last weekend , 150 activist alumni and present Stanford students targeted Condoleezza Rice for authorizing torture and misleading Americans into the illegal Iraq War .
Veterans of the Stanford anti-Vietnam War movement had gathered for a 40th anniversary reunion during the weekend .
The gathering featured panels on foreign policy , the economy , political and social movements , science and technology , media , energy and the environment , and strategies for aging activists .
On Sunday , surrounded by alumni and students , Lenny Siegel and I nailed a petition to the University President 's office door .
The petition , circulated by Stanford Say No to War , reads :
" We the undersigned students , faculty , staff , alumni , and other concerned members of the Stanford community , believe that high officials of the U.S. Government , including our former Provost , current Political Science Professor , and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow , Condoleezza Rice , should be held accountable for any serious violations of the Law ( included ratified treaties , statutes , and / or the U.S. Constitution ) through investigation and , if the facts warrant , prosecution , by appropriate legal authorities . "
I stated , " By nailing this petition to the door of the President 's office , we are telling Stanford that the university should not have war criminals on its faculty .
There is prima facie evidence that Rice approved torture and misled the country into the Iraq War .
Stanford has an obligation to investigate those charges . "

After the petition nailing , I cited the law and evidence of Condoleezza Rice 's responsibility for war crimes - including torture - and for selling the illegal Iraq War :
I was born on April 20 1986 in a village not far from Onsong , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in the north - east of the People 's Democratic Republic of Korea , close to the Chinese border and Siberia .
The city is divided into ku ( districts ) and ban ( classifications ) of 20 families .
My parents lived in ban number three , in a semi-rural zone .
The house was like dozens of others built on the same model and lined up in rows .
There was a door , a single window , and a roof of curved orange tiles .
The walls were white , but they had been painted blue to a height that I must have passed about the age of eight or nine .
Each time the district officials came to check the hygiene of the houses , as they regularly did , they ordered us to change the colour of this lower part : to green , now blue , now light brown , but all the houses in our ban had to be the same colour ; perhaps because dwellings , like everything else in North Korea , are the property of the people .
That means that nothing belongs to anyone .
The origin of a species is generally taken to be the place where its individuals show the greatest genetic diversity .
For humans , when the new African data is combined with DNA information from the rest of the world , this spot lies on the coast of southwest Africa near the Kalahari Desert , the research team , led by Sarah A. Tishkoff of the University of Pennsylvania , said in this week ’s issue of Science .
Dr. Brooks , who spent many years in the area , said that it had some trees but that it also had deep sand and was not particularly garden - like .
The area is a homeland of the Bushmen or San people , whose language is distinguished by its many click sounds .
But the San in the past might not have been restricted to where they are now , she said .
The San are thought to have once occupied a much larger area , one that probably stretched from southern Africa up the east coast to as far as present - day Ethiopia .
Since the geneticists ’ calculations refer to people , not geography , the San  and therefore the site of greatest human diversity  might have been located elsewhere in the past .
Christopher Ehret , an expert on African languages at the University of California , Los Angeles , and a member of Dr. Tishkoff ’s team , has detected traces of words borrowed from click languages in East African languages .
This suggests that proto-Khoisan , the inferred ancestral language of all click - speakers , may have originated in East Africa , Dr. Brooks said .
A swelling number of scientists believe swine flu has not happened by accident .
No : they argue that this global pandemic – and all the deaths we are about to see – is the direct result of our demand for cheap meat .
So is the way we produce our food really making us sick as a pig ?
At first glance , this seems wrong .
All through history , viruses have mutated , and sometimes they have taken nasty forms that scythe through the human population .
This is an inescapable reality we just have to live with , like earthquakes and tsunamis .
But the scientific evidence increasingly suggests that we have unwittingly invented an artificial way to accelerate the evolution of these deadly viruses – and pump them out across the world .
They are called factory farms .
They manufacture low - cost flesh , with a side - dish of viruses to go .
To understand how this might happen , you have to compare two farms .
My grandparents had a pig farm in the Swiss mountains , with around 20 swine at any one time .
What happened there if , in the bowels of one of their pigs , a virus mutated and took on a deadlier form ?
At every stage , the virus would meet stiff resistance from the pigs ' immune systems .
They were living in fresh air , on the diet they evolved with , and without stress – so they had a robust ability to fight back .
If the virus did take hold , it would travel only as far as the sick hog could walk .
So if the virus would then have around 20 other pigs to spread and mutate in – before it would hit the end of its own evolutionary path , and die off .
If it was a really lucky , plucky virus , it might make it to market – where it would come up against more healthy pigs living in small herds .
It had little opportunity to fan out across a large population of pigs or evolve a strain that could be transmitted to humans .

Now compare this to what happens when a virus evolves in a modern factory farm .
In most swine farms today , 6,000 pigs are crammed snout - to - snout in tiny cages where they can barely move , and are fed for life on an artificial pulp , while living on top of cess - pools of their own stale faeces .
Instead of having just 20 pigs to experiment and evolve in , the virus now has a pool of thousands , constantly infecting and reinfecting each other .
The virus can combine and recombine again and again .
The ammonium from the waste they live above burns the pigs ' respiratory tracts , making it easier yet for viruses to enter them .
Better still , the pigs ' immune systems are in free - fall .
They are stressed , depressed , and permanently in panic , making them far easier to infect .
There is no fresh air or sunlight to bolster their natural powers of resistance .
They live in air thick with viral loads , and they are exposed every time they breathe in .
As Dr Michael Greger , director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States , explains : " Put all this together , and you have a perfect storm environment for these super - strains .
If you wanted to create global pandemics , you 'd build as many of these factory farms as possible .
That 's why the development of swine flu is n't a surprise to those in the public health community .
In 2003 , the American Public Health Association – the oldest and largest in world – called for a moratorium of factory farming because they saw something like this would happen .
It may take something as serious as a pandemic to make us realise the real cost of factory farming . "
Many of the detailed studies of factory farms that have been emerging in the past few years reinforce this argument .
Dr Ellen Silbergeld is Professor of Environmental Health Sciences at Johns Hopkins University .
She tells me that her detailed , on - the - ground studies led her to conclude that there is " very much " a link from factory farms to the new , more powerful forms of flu we are experiencing .
" Instead of a virus only having one spin of the roulette wheel , it has thousands and thousands of spins , for no extra cost .
It drives the evolution of new diseases . "
Until yesterday , we could only speculate about the origins of the current H1N1 virus killing human beings – but now we know more .
The Centre for Computational Biology at Columbia University has studied the virus and now believes that it is not a new emergence of a triple human - swine - bird flu virus .
It is a slight variant on a virus we have seen before .
We can see its family tree – and its daddy was a virus that evolved in the artificial breeding ground of a vast factory farm in North Carolina .
Did this strain evolve , too , in the same circumstances ?
Already , the evidence is suggestive , although far from conclusive .
We know that the city where this swine flu first emerged – Perote , Mexico – contains a massive industrial pig farm , and houses 950,000 pigs .
Dr Silbergeld adds : " Factory farms are not biosecure at all .
People are going in and out all the time .
If you stand a few miles down - wind from a factory farm , you can pick up the pathogens easily .
And manure from these farms is n't always disposed of . "
It 's no coincidence that we have seen a sudden surge of new viruses in the past decade at precisely the moment when factory farming has intensified so dramatically .
For example , between 1994 and 2001 , the number of American pigs that live and die in vast industrial farms in the US spiked from 10 per cent to 72 per cent .
Swine flu had been stable since 1918 – and then suddenly , in this period , went super - charged .
How much harm will we do to ourselves in the name of cheap meat ?
We know that bird flu developed in the world 's vast poultry farms .
And we know that pumping animal feed full of antibiotics in factory farms has given us a new strain of MRSA .
It 's a simple , horrible process .
The only way to keep animals alive in such conditions is to pump their feed full of antibiotics .
But this has triggered an arms race with bacteria , which start evolving to beat the antibiotics – and emerge as in the end as pumped - up , super - charged bacteria invulnerable to our medical weapons .
This system gave birth to a new kind of MRSA that now makes up 20 per cent of all human infections with the virus .
Sir Liam Donaldson , the British government 's Chief Medical Officer , warns : " Every inappropriate use in animals or agriculture [ of antibiotics ] is potentially a death warrant for a future patient . "
Of course , agribusinesses is desperate to deny all this is happening : their bottom line depends on keeping this model on its shaky trotters .
But once you factor in the cost of all these diseases and pandemics , cheap meat suddenly looks like an illusion .
We always knew that factory farms were a scar on humanity 's conscience – but now we fear they are a scar on our health .
If we carry on like this , bird flu and swine flu will be just the beginning of a century of viral outbreaks .
As we witness a global pandemic washing across the world , we need to shut down these virus factories – before they shut down even more human lives .

The Obama Administration asked the Supreme Court Friday to give it another 30 days to get help from Congress , or else file an appeal in the Court , to block public release of more than four dozen U.S.
Army photos that are said to show abuse by U.S. soldiers of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In an application ( 08A1068 ) , Solicitor General Elena Kagan sought a delay from June 9 — the present deadline to file an appeal — until July 9 .
“ The additional time … would permit the legislative process to continue and allow the United States to assess further the need to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in light of any new leigslation , ” Kagan wrote .
“ Additional time is also necessary to permit further consultation with other components of the Department of Justice , the Department of Defense , and other affected agencies about this litigation more generally , and to prepare and print the petition . ”
A post discussing this case and the possible appeal can be read here .
Extremely bizarre sounding ... I think he said he 's gonna kick some cat butt ...
a ) Do what you love doing / What you are good at .
b ) Satisfy an unsatisfied niche .
1 ) Transportation business .
2) Security .
3 ) Education .
4 ) Lending money .
5 ) Home business .
I ’ve been asked this a couple times and guess it ’s time to go through a few things again .
I ’m not even going to talk much about jobs specifically .
People will ask “ what jobs ” , but that ’s not really what they want to know .
They want to know how to make money to get by .
Problem is making money and working is n’t always related .
As a matter of fact most people that have a LOT of money work relatively little .
Just like a lot of people that work VERY hard ALL day many times barely make enough money to survive .
You want me to tell you what jobs you ’ll be more likely to find after a crisis ?
Easy .
Security .
I can open the newspaper on the couple pages with job adds , drop my finger with my eyes closed and I can bet good money my super divination powers will tell me what that add is about .
I can even use my prophetic powers and tell you many of the words you ’ll find in the add . :) Serious , it ’s a mathematic fact , since 50 % job offers are the same :
Male , 1,75 height minimum , school diploma , CLU ( gun license card ) Private security job offers are BY FAR , the most common adds you ’ll find in Argentina or in any country that ’s gone through a crisis .
Second most popular add is for the ladies .
Would read something like this : Young lady , excellent presence .
Age 18 - 25 .
No Prior experience required .
Full body photo required .
What ’s this about ?
They want hot looking women for promotions and events .
When unemployment is so high , it ’s been proved that hot looking women advertising and giving away pamphlets works .
Usually its too expensive .
But with a crisis you ’ll have girls that look like models begging for work .
With high unemployment they can afford to audition lots of them .
Then , there ’s the ever popular telemarketer ..
These are jobs you can probably get during the recession .
Salary ?
Well , they ’ll border slavery .
And the private guard gig is as dangerous as swimming with starved crocodiles .
Hmmm .. how about changing the question then ? :) How do I “ make ” money ?
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
I have no secret that will make you rich .
What I can tell you is what I ’ve seen others do that worked well for them .
There are several fronts from where you can attack the problem .
This is always recommended but people hardly listen .
Parents and grandparents usually recommend it , but why ?
Because it works .
Because when you do something passionately you usually do it well , thus greater chances of making money .
Go to college or community college , or learn some craft .
Does n’t matter if you are a doctor , lawyer or carpenter .
Some lines of work do better than others during recession , but if you are good at it your chances are good .
Contrary to what many believe , when there ’s really high unemployment , more people go study and hit the books .
Why ?
Because there ’s no job and it ’s better than staying home depressed .
Then again , in some cases just being very good at something simply is n’t enough .
Sometimes even if you are good , even the best , the economic crisis will hit you and hit you hard .
Blacksmithing for example .
Many survivalists thought blacksmithing for some reason would be in high demand .
Why are the best blacksmiths in the country doing so poorly then ?
Want to know why ?
Because I do n’t “ need ” a fancy handmade blade , certainly not when money is tight .
If I need a knife I can buy one in a store for a fraction f the money and it will still serve me well .
Besides , competition is fierce due to unemployment , even among blacksmiths .
The more competitive , the more they have to lower the prices .
Today I can buy a handmade knife rather cheap .
The handful that refuse to see these and still sell knives at several hundred bucks hardly stay afloat with thanks to a few high end customers , most of them from abroad .
As the crisis spreads all over I fear they ’ll be doing even worse .
This is where many have made real fortunes THANKS to the depression .
I ’m talking about a lot of money in some cases .
The cases I ’ll mention are ones that I know of and that have had lots of success precisely because they satisfy a new need created by the crisis .
These are n’t my “ guesses ” or “ estimations ” .
These are real people doing very real money .
Owning a bus line is very good business .
There ’s more poor , fuel is more expensive , thus , there ’s more need for public transportation .
Does n’t take a genius to figure out why bus companies are making nice money here these days .
“ But FerFAL , I ’m not Bill Gates , I ca n’t afford this BS your talking about ” Well , that happened to some people here too .
But they did n’t cry a river because they did n’t have that kind of capital .
What they did was offer another alternative : Combies .
For 5 bucks , this guy takes a bunch of people in his minibus from suburbia to downtown to work , everyday .
Pay another 5 bucks and they drive you back to suburbia at the end of the day .
It ’s a bit more expensive than the ordinary bus but it ’s faster , you travel seated , does n’t smell like urine , and has working AC , and it ’s still ½ the price of the fuel you ’d need to do that trip with your own car .
These guys started with one or two minibus , then added more , hired drivers .
Then started selling the “ brand ” people with their own buses using the brand name and logistics , for a fair % , of course .
Now that ’s smart .
That ’s learning to exploit the needs of the new market .
Give the economy Nobel prize to the guys that came up with “ Lomas Express ” and “ Adrogue Bus ” .
I ’ve said it a million times .
Private security will be the greatest gig once crime goes up .
If you want , becoming a cop will be an alternative given that USA cops are well paid and there ’s WILL be a growing demand for them .
But for those with the vision , a private security company can mean a lot of money .
Offering security to some high end neighborhood .
You set a guy on a few strategic corners .
It ’s obvious that if you are getting paid by say , 3 blocks , and you only set guards on those 3 places , criminals will start hunting out of the “ guarded ” territory .
Soon the word gets around and they ’ll want a guard of their own to keep an eye on things .
Be serious , be professional , and as crime goes up a private security company will be a good money maker for you .
As public education goes down and the O indoctrination gets worse , you ’ll want better education for your kids .
Mom ca n’t afford to home school any more , she has to work now .
As salaries keep going down , due to cuts or indirectly due to inflation , both parents working becomes more and more common .
A respectable neighbor that parents trusts can set up a private school .
One that ’s not expensive but offers good atmosphere and a good education level .
I ’ve seen it done a number of times , and know of several people that did very well with their schools or daycare centers .
( mom has to work , remember ? ) This would fall both in the “ market need ” and “ things you love doing ” category , since making a school and teaching has to be something you love doing .
Do it just for the money and chances are you wont be good at it .
There ’s no credit , so lending a little money ( usually 1000 or 2000 tops ) is a good deal for some people .
The greatest problem here is that you need some “ muscle ” that will collect those that want to get off the hook .
So this can be a bit “ grayish ” .
Either that or have a collector ’s company that are real sharks .
Anyway , lots of new places lending money , so I guess it ’s good business .
This is a bit more tricky and I probably know more failure stories than success ones .
Starting a business during a recession is “ risky ” to say the least .
Some things are almost certain failures .
A computer shop that just sells hardware and software and assembles PC and offers network and repair service has a poor success rate .
During a recession people buy very little , they try to save as much money as possible , usually take the time and trouble to learn how to assemble stuff themselves .
The one or two successful hardware dealers that I know of operate with HUGE volumes of merchandize , and offer VERY low prices and publicize on line .
These are businesses that required capital , lots of “ know how ” , import contacts , and certainly not for amateurs .
Try opening the friendly computer shop on your own and more than likely you ’ll fail .
Small shops in general do poorly during recessions .
Video rental stores for example , they ’ve closed by the hundreds and few survive .
People have little money and prefer to download the movies themselves to safe a few bucks .
Before they did n’t care , but when money gets tight they do .
Running your own business requires a deep knowledge of the niche and market if you want to have any chance of success .
For example , I know a guy that made a good business with clothes .
He knew the are well , knew that there was still some people with money , middle class , but a middle class less powerful than before .
They could n’t afford the fancy brand name clothing they once did , but he expected to do well if he offered good clothing , nice fashionable designs , but at an affordable price .
The store had to look a mixture of cozy and high end , and a designer was required for the store , a professional graphic designer for the advertisement displayed and labels used in the clothing .
This was how the “ Snowball ” brand was created .
He ended up opening over a dozen stores in the southern suburbs of Bs As . Need a present for someone ?
Most of the time women do the buying , and most of the time they buy clothes .
Snowball is affordable and people like it .
There are many , many other stories and niches that were exploited .
These are just a few business ideas to think about .
Think how you can make money in your region by satisfying the new niches being created by the economic crisis .

Kuwait 's parliament , the oldest in the region , will admit four women
Kuwait has elected its first female MPs following the oil - rich country 's third general election in three years .
US - educated Aseel al - Awadhi and Rola Dashti were among winners in the third district , official results declared .
The 10 leading candidates from each of Kuwait 's five electoral districts are elected to the 50 - seat parliament .
The emir dissolved the previous parliament in March because it wanted to question his nephew , the prime minister , about alleged corruption .
There are no political parties in Kuwait ; the prime minister appoints ministers most of whom are unelected .
" It 's a victory for Kuwaiti women and a victory for Kuwaiti democracy , " Ms Awadhi told AFP news agency .
" This is a major leap forward , " she said .
The right to vote and stand for election to Kuwait 's parliament , the oldest in the Gulf , was extended to women in 2005 .
Former Health Minister Massouma al - Mubarak , who became the first Kuwaiti woman to be appointed to a ministerial post in 2005 , and Salwa al - Jassar , have also secured seats in parliament .
Frozen development
Parliamentary pressure to investigate and question ministers on deals has previously seen the cabinet cancelling or delaying multi-billion dollar international projects and social development plans .
During campaigning , anti-government feeling among some candidates has moved to a higher level - two people were arrested for criticising the ability of the ruling al - Sabah family to govern .
They still hold the post of prime minister as well as the key defence , interior and foreign affairs portfolios .
Many voters had complained about the frozen development caused by the political gridlock .
" Men do n't have credibility anymore .
We 're fed up with crises . "
Ibrahim al - Attar told AP news agency after casting his vote for four female candidates .
One of the first tasks awaiting the new parliament will be to vote on a $ 5 bn stimulus package designed to help the financial sector of the oil - rich state cope with the global economic downturn .
( CNN ) -- " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen " -- the most terrible revenge since Montezuma 's -- is louder , longer and lamer than the 2007 hit it succeeds .
Both Shia LaBeouf and Megan
Fox run away a lot in new " Transformers " -- she in slow motion , says Tom Charity .
Which is saying a lot .
Long story short :
The Decepticons are back , fixed on destroying Sam ( Shia LaBeouf ) , Optimus Prime and the Earth , in that order .
Produced by Hasbro -- the accompanying trailer for " G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra " suggests that the company 's not - exactly - subtle strategy is to mass market war toys for boys -- " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen " is a grotesque exercise in hyperinflation .
At 149 minutes , it 's longer than " 2001 , " " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " or " Star Wars . "
In fact , this may be the emptiest epic ever made .
Director Michael
Bay is famous for blowing things up , but you could invade a small country with less firepower than he expends on this extended - length commercial .
For all his sound and fury , Bay is n't much of an action director .
There 's no rhythm in his slam - bang cutting , no discipline in his orientation , and there 's so little to distinguish an Autobot ( the good Transformers ) from a Decepticon ( the bad ) that at any given moment , it 's a toss - up who is pulverizing who .
A guide to the Transformers »
Combat scenes are a bewildering blur of crunching metal .
On top of that , the humans are essentially bystanders and onlookers here , so that LaBeouf 's primary contribution to the fighting is to run away , duck and cover .
It 's the same deal for Megan Fox , only in lingering slow motion .
Watch the Transformers do their thing »
The Defense Department does get the opportunity to show off its hardware , even if most of the missile strikes fall wide of the mark -- probably because there are n't enough Decepticons to sustain heavy losses .
If he ever needs another job , Bay should consider a move into arms procurement .
At least the nonstop carnage is on a scale to satisfy the demolition derby crowd , down to destroying one of the Seven Wonders of the World .
The effects work is mostly rock - solid , and the Transformers themselves have a chromatic showroom gleam .
As a kind of 21st - century Mechano movie , it could have hit the right buttons .
It 's not the extravagant fireworks display that rankles , it 's everything else : the dull and pompous exposition , the trite characterizations , the tacky love story , the dismal comic relief and incongruous pretensions to the status of a popcorn epic .
Here 's a sample of what Bay throws at the wall in the hope of generating some stray laughs : small dogs humping .
Hysterical middle - aged women .
Autobots with effeminate voices .
A miniature Decepticon dry - humping Fox 's leg .
John Turturro improvising .
Tasers .
A cowardly Latino .
A short Arab .
Snails .
None of these things is funny .
Not in this movie , anyway .
The truth is , Bay is a rotten fit for this assignment ; he 's much too self - important to recalibrate his approach for the younger audience this material demands .
Memo to Michael :
It 's a toy movie .
Your audience is predominantly teen and pre-teen .
My kids do n't need to see your salivating soft - porn fantasies or your reactionary militaristic politics .
Most of all , none of us needs to sit through 2 ½ hours of this inane and mind - numbing movie .
Better it should be melted down for scrap .
" Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen " is rated PG - 13 and runs 149 minutes .

Amid the general love - fest over the Amazon Kindle , its DRM is beginning to bite some users in the butt as they are getting locked out of their accounts and , subsequently , their e-book purchases .
The incidents highlight once again that the customer does n't really own the content when it comes to DRM ; even when it 's so loose that it 's not apparent day to day , it can still hurt you in the long run .
Kindle users have been grumbling lately about Amazon locking them out of their accounts , reportedly due to an overly high volume of returns on their Kindle books .
ChannelWeb draws attention to the plight of one user who admitted to three " high - priced returns , " though he denied abusing Amazon 's return policy .
Despite this , Amazon banned him from making more purchases from the online store , which also locked him out of accessing his already - purchased Kindle items .
This particular user eventually got his account reinstated , with Amazon warning that it could revoke access again in the future .
Though the phenomenon is n't common enough to be considered an epidemic , a number of other users reported that they had a similar account lock - out from Amazon , turning their Kindles into $ 360 paperweights .
Certainly , this is the type of thing that gives old - school bibliophiles �reason to continue trashing the Kindle .
A bookstore that locks you out because you treated it like a library does n't take away the collection already sitting on your bookshelf , after all .
Incidents like this remind us of what happened in the digital music realm when MSN Music , Yahoo Music , and Wal - Mart decided to turn off their DRM authentication servers �after their music services went dead .
This still left users with playable music files , but no DRM servers meant that they could n't authorize any new devices in the future , therefore limiting them to the devices ( and operating systems ) they had already set up .
Ultimately , customer complaints got loud enough that all three companies decided to leave the servers online for a while longer , but to pretend this could n't happen with already - purchased Kindle books would be an act of willful ignorance .
Amazon is perfectly capable of yanking customer access to their books at any time — whether the service shuts down or not .
The only way to get around it would be to break the user agreement with Amazon and crack the DRM , but that , too , puts you at risk of being barred from purchasing new books .
Amazon 's DRM wo n't disappear anytime soon .
It 's mostly - benign existence reminds us that , while DRM may be dead for music , it 's definitely alive and well in other forms of media .
Washington — Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner ( R - Wis. ) and a handful of colleagues walked impeachment papers from the House of Representatives to the Senate on Wednesday , part of a process that could lead to the removal of a federal judge in Texas .
The judge , Samuel B. Kent , is serving a prison sentence after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice .
" However , he is still collecting nearly $ 477 a day , $ 174,000 a year , while sitting in prison , " Sensenbrenner said in a statement .
" This waste of taxpayer dollars is outrageous as it stands , but during these tough economic times , it is outright unacceptable . "
The House voted to impeach Kent .
Now he must be tried in the Senate , which on Wednesday took the first procedural steps toward putting Kent on trial .
Sensenbrenner has the distinction of serving for the third time as a House impeachment manager for a Senate trial .
The other cases involved President Bill Clinton and U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon .
Since 1803 , only one other House member has been manager for three impeachment trials , a Texas lawmaker who served in the first half of the 20th century .
THE CBD Metro will run as much as 87 per cent empty during the height of the morning rush hour when it opens in 2015 , the Transport Minister , David Campbell , has conceded .
Although the $ 5.3 billion metro between Central Station and Rozelle will have a capacity of 30,000 passengers an hour , as few as 4000 to 5500 passengers will use it , the Government estimates .
That means the equivalent of 26 of the 30 trains running each hour in the peak will be empty .
Off - peak passenger loads are likely to be half again .
By contrast , 27,650 passengers travel along CityRail 's western corridor to the city in the one - hour morning peak , which includes services from the west , inner-west and northern lines .
The figures , supplied by Mr Campbell 's office , show most CBD Metro trains will be empty for decades .
By 2031 , just 7250 people an hour will travel on the CBD Metro in each direction according to the Government 's forecast , which means it would be operating 76 per cent empty at the busiest time of day .
“ I cannot prove that if a function is injective , it has an inverse , ” Hideki Hashimoto posed this question to me a while ago .
It turned out that this was not the property he really wanted , but it got me into thinking : is it possible at all ?
Preliminaries
Let us start with some basic definitions .
A relation from A to B is denoted by the wavy arrow :
_↝_ : Set → Set → Set1 A ↝ B = A → B → Set
Given a relation R : A ↝ B we can always take its converse R ˘ : B ↝ A , and a function can be lifted to a relation by fun :
_˘ : ∀ { A B} → ( A ↝ B ) → ( B ↝ A ) ( R ˘ ) b a = R a b fun : ∀ { A B} → ( A → B ) → ( A ↝ B ) fun f a b = f a ≡ b
A relation R : A ↝ B is simple if it does not map one input to multiple outputs .
It is entire if everything in A is mapped to something in B — a more familiar word may be “ total ” .
simple : ∀ { A B} → ( A ↝ B ) →
Set simple R = ∀ {a b₁ b₂} → R a b₁ → R a b₂ → b₁ ≡ b₂ entire : ∀ { A B} → ( A ↝ B ) →
Set entire R = ∀ a → ∃ ( λ b → R a b )
A function is a relation that is simple and entire .
Indeed , one can show that fun f is simple and entire for every f .
Injectivity and surjectivity are similar notions defined for converse of R :
injective : ∀ { A B} → ( A ↝ B ) →
Set injective R = ∀ {a₁ a₂ b} → R a₁ b → R a₂ b → a₁ ≡ a₂ surjective : ∀ { A B} → ( A ↝ B ) →
Set surjective R = ∀ b → ∃ ( λ a → R a b )
The ( constructive variant of the ) axiom of choice states that an entire relation A ↝ B can be refined to a function A → B :
ac : ∀ { A B} → ( R : A ↝ B ) → ( ∀ a → ∃ ( λ b → R a b ) ) → ∃ { A → B} ( λ f → ∀ a → R a ( f a ) ) ac R R-entire = ( ( λ a → proj₁ ( R- entire a ) ) , λ a → proj₂ ( R- entire a ) )
See the axiom of choice homepage , or the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for more information on this axiom .
Inverting Injective and Surjective Functions
Now , let us restate Hashimoto san ’s challenge :
Let fun f : A → B be injective .
Prove that f has a left inverse .
That is , some f⁻¹ such that f⁻¹ ( f a ) = a forall a .
It turned out that he forgot a condition : f is also surjective .
If f is also ( provably ) surjective , one can pick some g ⊆ f˘ using the axiom of choice ( since f is surjective if and only if f˘ is total ) and further prove that g ∘ f = id using injectivity :
inv-sur : ∀ { A
B} → ( f : A → B ) → injective ( fun f ) → surjective ( fun f ) → ∃ { B → A} ( λ f⁻¹ → ( ∀ a → f⁻¹ ( f a ) ≡ a ) ) inv-sur f f-inj f- sur with ac ( ( fun f ) ˘ ) f-sur ... | ( g , fgb≡b ) = ( g , λ a → f-inj {g ( f a ) } {a} {f a} ( fgb≡b ( f a ) ) refl )
Like the proof of the constructive axiom of choice , the proof above does not really do much .
The proof of surjectivity of f has already provided , for every b : B , an a : A such that f a ≡ b .
So we simply let f⁻¹ return that a .
Can we lift the restriction that f must be surjective ?
That is , can this be proved ?
inv : ∀ { A
B} → ( f : A → B ) → injective ( fun f ) → ∃ { B → A} ( λ f⁻¹ → ( ∀ a → f⁻¹ ( f a ) ≡ a ) )
To make the scenario clear : we have a ( total ) function f : A → B that is injective but not necessarily surjective .
The set B could be “ larger ” than A in the sense that there could be some elements b : B for which no f a equals b — that is , B may not be “ fully covered . ”
Can we construct f⁻¹ : B → A such that f⁻¹ ( f a ) ≡ a for all a : A ?
At the first glance it did not look like something terribly difficult to do .
Given b , if it equals some f a , let f⁻¹ simply return that a .
Otherwise f⁻¹ could just map b to any element in A , since this b is not used in any invocation of f⁻¹ ( f a ) anyway .
It should be possible as long as A is not empty , right ?
I tried to construct this f⁻¹ but could not help noticing something funny going on .
It turns out that had this function existed , we could , again , prove the law of excluded middle .
That is , for any predicate P : B → Set and any b : B , there would be a decision procedure telling us whether P b is true or not .
Provided that we assume proof irrelevance , that is .
Excluded Middle , Again
Here we go .
Let B be some type having decidable equality .
That is , there exists some eqB :
eqB : ( b₁ b₂ : B ) → ( b₁ ≡ b₂ ) ⊎ ( ¬ ( b₁ ≡ b₂ ) )
where _⊎_ is disjoint sum .
Now take some predicate P : B → Set .
Let A be defined by :
A : ( B → Set ) → Set A P = Σ B ( λ b → P b )
That is , A P is the subset of B for which P holds .
Each element of A P is a pair ( b , Pb ) where Pb is a proof of P b .
Finally , take
f : ∀ { P} → A P → B f = proj ₁
Thus f ( b , Pb ) = b .
The function f is injective if we assume proof irrelevance .
That is , if f ( b , Pb ) = b and f ( b ' , Pb ' ) = b , we must have b = b' and ( due to proof irrelevance ) Pb = Pb ' , and therefore ( b , Pb ) = ( b ' , Pb ' ) .
Indeed , if we postulate proof irrelevance :
postulate irr : ( P : B → Set ) → ∀ {b} → ( p₁ : P b ) → ( p₂ : P b ) → p₁ ≡ p₂
We can construct a proof that f is injective :
f-inj : ∀
{ P} → injective ( fun ( f { P} ) ) f-inj { P} {(.b , Pb₁ ) } {(.b , Pb₂ ) } {b} refl refl = cong ( λ p → ( b , p ) ) ( irr P Pb₁ Pb₂ )
Assume that we have proved inv .
We can now apply inv and obtain some f⁻¹ , the left inverse of f .
However , with this particular choice of A , f , and f⁻¹ , we can construct a deciding procedure for P .
That is , for any P and b , we can determine P b holds or not :
em : { P : B → Set} → ∀ b → P b ⊎ ¬ ( P b )
This is how em works .
Given some b , let ’s apply f⁻¹ to b .
The result is a pair ( b ' , Pb ' ) .
Let ’s compare b and b' using eqB :
em { P} b with inv f ( f-inj { P} ) ... | ( f⁻¹ , f⁻¹fa≡a ) with inspect ( f⁻¹ b ) ... | ( b ' , Pb ' ) with -≡ _ with eqB b b '
If b ≡ b ' , Pb ' is a proof of P b' and also a proof of P b .
Let us just return it ( after some type casting ) :
em { P} b | ( f⁻¹ , f⁻¹fa≡a ) | ( b ' , Pb ' ) with -≡ _ | inj₁ b≡b ' = inj₁ ( subst P ( sym b≡b ' ) Pb ' )
Consider the case that b does not equal b' .
We want to show that P b is not true .
That is , a proof of P b leads to contradiction .
Assume we have a proof Pb of P b .
Since f ( b , P b ) ≡ b , we have f⁻¹ b ≡ ( b , Pb ) :
em { P} b | ( f⁻¹ , f⁻¹fa≡a ) | ( b ' , Pb ' ) with -≡ b' Pb ' ≡f⁻¹b | inj₂ ¬b≡b ' = inj₂ (λ
Pb → let f⁻¹b≡bPb : f⁻¹ b ≡ ( b , Pb ) f⁻¹b≡bPb = f⁻¹fa≡a ( b , Pb )
The assumption says that f⁻¹ b = ( b ' , Pb ' ) .
By transitivity we have ( b , Pb ) ≡ ( b ' , Pb ' ) .
b Pb≡b ' Pb ' : ( b , Pb ) ≡ ( b ' , Pb ' ) b Pb≡b ' Pb ' = sym ( trans b' Pb'≡f⁻¹b f⁻¹b≡bPb )
But if we take the first component of both sides , we get b ≡ b' .
That contradicts our assumption that b does not equal b' :
b≡b ' : b ≡ b ' b≡b ' = cong proj₁ b Pb≡b ' Pb ' in ¬ b≡b ' b≡b ' )
which completes the proof .
In retrospect , f⁻¹ cannot exist because for it to work , it has to magically know whether b is in the range of f , that is , whether P b is true or not .
Nakano ’s Challenge
When I talked about this to Keisuke Nakano he posed me another related challenge .
Set - theoretically , we understand that if there exists an injective function f : A → B and another injective function g : B → A , the sets A and B are of the same cardinality and there ought to be a bijection A → B .
Can we construct this bijection ?
That is , can we prove this theorem ?
nakano : { A B : Set} → ( f : A → B ) → injective ( fun f ) → ( g : B → A ) → injective ( fun g ) → ∃ { A → B} ( λ h → injective ( fun h ) × surjective ( fun h ) )
I do not yet have a solution .
Any one wanna give it a try ?

A justice from Massachusetts 's highest court has ordered police to return a laptop and other gear seized from a Boston student 's dorm room after rejecting prosecutors ' arguments that hoax emails he was suspected of sending might be illegal under a computer crime statute .
The decision , issued Thursday by Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court Margot Botsford , also ordered police to immediately cease any ongoing search of the seized property .
Police confiscated 23 items , including three laptops , two iPods , two cellular phones , a digital camera , and a variety of data - storage devices , during a March 30 raid on the dorm room of Boston College ( BC ) student Riccardo Calixte .
" No one should be subjected to a search like this based on such flimsy theories and evidence , " said Matt Zimmerman , a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which helped represent the computer science student .
As a result of the seizure , Calixte was forced to complete much of the final month of the semester without a computer , phone or network access , the EFF said .
Calixte came under suspicion following a " domestic dispute " when a roommate told a police detective he had observed Calixte commit two computer crimes .
When police requested a warrant to search the dorm room , much of the factual basis provided that a crime had been committed were two emails sent in early March that falsely claimed the roommate was participating on a gay dating website .
At least one them was suspected to have been sent by Calixte .
In arguing the search warrant was properly issued , prosecutors argued the hoax emails might violate a Massachusetts statute barring the " unauthorized access " to a computer .
Justice Botsford rejected that theory .
" The commonwealth 's claim that such an email might be unlawful because it violates a hypothetical internet use policy maintained by BC both goes well beyond the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the affidavit , and would dramatically expand the appropriate scope of " the statute , she wrote .
She went on to find there was no probable cause to support that Calixte illegally downloaded more than 200 movies and music files and accessed the BC grading system used by professors to change grades .
A PDF of the decision is here . ®
WASHINGTON --
The Labor Department suspended for nine months a last - minute Bush administration rule that made it easier for farm employers to hire non-American temporary workers .
The Bush administration regulations , which took effect Jan. 17 , changed the way the minimum wage for farm workers was calculated and eased oversight of efforts to recruit U.S. workers first .

The following story contains spoilers regarding the show " House . "
If you 'd rather not know what happens , stop reading now .
Kal Penn , left , with Peter Jacobson on " House , " is joining the Obama White House .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
When Dr. Lawrence Kutner killed himself on the latest episode of " House : MD , " it was the beginning of a new career for actor Kal Penn .
The demise of Penn 's character cleared the way for the actor to move on to another " House , " the White House .
Penn , 31 , will be an associate director for the Obama administration 's Office of Public Liaison .
" It seemed like something I would enjoy doing , " Penn said .
" I figured it was something to do . "
He 's not retiring from acting , just pursuing a longtime desire for public service that was rekindled when he campaigned for Barack Obama 's election , Penn said .
Penn played a teen terrorist on Fox 's " 24 " before joining the network 's " House " two years ago .
He 's also known as Kumar Patel in the " Harold & Kumar " movie series .
The White House job likely ends his Kumar roles , he said .
In fact , he will not consider any acting jobs until he leaves the Obama administration , he said .
Penn will take a big pay cut to work for the government , but he has committed to at least one or two years in the job , he said .
His focus will be as a liaison for the arts community and the Asian - American community , he said .
He filled a similar role in the Obama presidential campaign , he said .

The reason behind ' House ' storyline
" We want to make sure that everyone 's concerns are heard and they are familiar with the president 's plans and proposals , " he said .
Penn said he spoke briefly with Obama after the election about " trying to find the right fit " for him in the administration .
He said he has bittersweet emotions as he leaves Hollywood to search for an apartment in Washington next week .
The writers ' decision to have Dr. Kutner commit suicide ensures
Penn will not return to the show , although he said he leaves on good terms .
He felt " more than a little bit of shock and loss " to learn that his character would die in his final episode .
Even though he spoke no lines in the episode -- and only his legs are seen when his body is found -- he was on the set for the filming , he said .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - The U.S. space shuttle Atlantis apparently was hit by a piece of debris that nicked part of its heat shield but the damage appeared very minor , NASA said on Tuesday .
Atlantis and its seven - member crew blasted off from Florida on Monday on an 11 - day mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope .
It will be the U.S. space agency ’s last chance to tinker with the telescope -- which has vastly expanded scientists ’ knowledge of the universe -- before NASA ends the shuttle program in 2010 .
NASA told the Atlantis crew additional inspections might be needed of the area where the ship ’s right wing joins the fuselage around where the debris hit .
But agency officials said later that a detailed inspection was unlikely .
Early analysis of images relayed by the crew revealed a scratch about 21 inches long across four heat - resistant ceramic tiles .
“ It looks like something just kind of chattered its way down along that edge , ” deputy shuttle program manager LeRoy Cain said at a briefing , showing a picture of unidentified debris that hit the ship 104 seconds after liftoff .
“ This is not something we ’re very concerned about . ”
SHALLOW SCRATCH
NASA was trying to establish exactly what had caused the scratch , but it is “ relatively shallow ” and is not in a critical area that would endanger the ship during the extreme heat of reentry , Cain said .
The liftoff also damaged about 25 square feet ( 2.3 square meters ) of the shuttle ’s launch pad flame trench , NASA said .
In 2003 space shuttle , Columbia , disintegrated as it was returning to Florida , killing its seven crew members because of heat shield damage from a piece of foam insulation that fell off the fuel tank during launch .
NASA redesigned the tanks so they would shed less foam and implemented in - orbit inspections .
Technicians were trying to retrieve pictures from a digital camera in the shuttle ’s belly that should have photographed the external fuel tank after it was jettisoned .
The Atlantis astronauts spent Tuesday panning a sensor - studded boom over the ship ’s wings and nose cone , a routine task on all shuttle missions since the Columbia accident .
Slideshow ( 15 images )
After that , NASA also drew up plans to shelter shuttle astronauts aboard the International Space Station in case their ship was too damaged to fly through the atmosphere for landing .
Since the Atlantis is heading to the Hubble Telescope and will be too far away to reach the space station , NASA has a second shuttle on the launch pad ready to mount a rescue if needed .
Atlantis is due to reach the Hubble Telescope on Wednesday .
While the shuttle astronauts scoured their ship for damage , teams on the ground inspected the launch pad .
Slideshow ( 15 images )
Damage was discovered in an area known as the flame trench , which lies beneath the shuttle ’s mobile launcher platform .
The affected area deflects flames from the solid rocket boosters .
The launch pad is next scheduled to be used for a June 13 mission to the International Space Station .
“ Right now there ’s no indication that this would delay launch , ” said Kennedy Space Center spokeswoman Candrea Thomas .
The launch pad damage does not affect NASA ’s contingency provisions for a standby rescue mission for the Atlantis crew , which would be launched from different pad .
The Atlantis astronauts plan five days of spacewalks to install two new cameras in Hubble , replace positioning gyroscopes and batteries and repair two broken science instruments .
It is NASA ’s fifth and final servicing mission to the observatory , which has been operational since 1990 .
Hubble is one of the most productive and ground - breaking science instruments of modern day astronomy .
With the upgrades , NASA hopes to keep the Hubble Telescope running until at least 2014 .
Queensland Health says the first person in Australia who tested positive for swine flu is free to return home to Sydney .
The 28 - year - old woman yesterday received a " weak positive " result after flying into Brisbane from Los Angeles on Thursday .
She had flu - like symptoms in the United States about 10 days before flying to Australia .
On arrival she went to her parents ' home in Brisbane , but is now free to go anywhere .
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the woman had fully recovered by the time she returned to Australia .
" We have a person who had contracted the disease overseas and has fully recovered by the time they returned to Australia , " she said .
Meanwhile Queensland
Health says it has left phone messages for two Queenslanders who were on a flight with the woman confirmed to have swine flu .
The Queenslanders are part of a group of 19 passengers on the flight that are still being traced .
The 10 other Queenslanders have been contacted .
The other seven people are being contacted by their state health authorities .
Spa 2009 was an experience grenade , I am somewhat recovered from the blast I had there , but not quite , so here are some impressions and photos .
Haskell
This years ’ conference had many sessions on a hitherto rather obscure programming language : Haskell .
I knew the guys from the Paris CodingDojo ( at the very least EmmanuelGaillot , ChristopheThibaut and ArnaudBailly ) have been jamming on Haskell for a while , I was surprised to learn Ivan Moore and Mike Hill , this years ’ programme chairs also have taken an interest in it .
I am not exactly sure why .
Maybe it is because Haskell is the ultimate MindFuck where it comes to programming languages that you could use in theory ( and sometimes in practice ) to do interesting stuff .
Maybe it is because , if you do not work in really , really small steps , you are going to shoot yourself in the foot very quickly , so Haskell , TDD and a dojo ( where in the randori form you have only 5 minutes at the keyboard before you have to rotate out ) seem like a natural fit .
Ivan told me they thought it would be interestingly different to let Simon Peyton - Jones , one of the stewards of Haskell , do a keynote .
SPA has a tradition of keynotes that are inspiring and different from what you would expect – Kent Beck did early presentations on eXtreme Programming at this conference ( then named OT ) 10 years ago .
The keynote was fun and interesting , explaining the kind of problems Haskell intends to solve , with some examples .
You could say haskell is kind of a spreadsheet on steroids , although it lacks the graphics .
The presentation was laced with code on slides , explaining important features in Haskell .
About halfway through , unique for a keynote , Simon did some live coding , showing how the haskell program quicktest can be used to test new features .
Quicktest exercises code with random testdata for cases specified in haskell , and when a test fails reasons backwards to find the simplest possible failure .
Apparently Arnaud Bailly and Christophe Thibaut used quicktest in their workshop on wednesday to test a java program , I would have loved to see it , but had to be at our Consulting Without Secrets workshop , which was good fun in itself and very useful for running our businesses ; you can read through the outputs on the conference wiki .
Back to Haskell .
Sunday saw the RealWorldHaskell tutorial hosted by Peter Marks , Nicholas Simons and Ben Moseley .
Christophe
Thibaut paired with me , so we could work test - first .
Unit testing was not part of the tutorial , but Christophe already knew how to do it .
This helped us to getting reasonably far with the exercises .
If you do not work in small steps , I find the error messages sometimes difficult to understand .
Several Bird of a Feather sessions were scheduled to do more Haskell in the form of coding dojos .
There was also a discussion BoF on why Haskell ?
which was packed – more people attended that than the hands - on sessions , which I found a bit puzzling .
The dojos consisted of a Kata performed by Christophe and Arnaud , and a Randori hosted by Rob Westgeest .
That meant I got to practice a little Haskell with switched - on colleagues every day .
Pair programming and learning helped a lot .
Therefore , next Tuesday , April 28th , Mike Hill and I will be co-hosting an amateur Haskell coders ’ dojo at the eXtreme Tuesday Club ( in London of course ) .
Beatboxing
The SPA conference always has interesting ‘ diversions ’ in the evenings .
Before the whiskey tasting there was a beatboxing tutorial , hosted by UK beatboxing championship Mc Zani .
That was wicked .
Here you can see him in action for a ‘ slightly ’ larger audience .
Mc Zani knows his stuff and his facilitation style resulted in a relaxed workshop with surprising performances by some of the participants .
Definetely worth it to attend one of his workshops if you get the chance .
Some of the remarks Mc Zani made about beatboxing made me think of programming , and the agile movement .
Beatboxing is more than a party trick , but after it suddenly became popular again , the media are overflowing with mediocre beatboxers – people who see it as a party trick and are not willing to put in the effort required for greatness .
Great beatboxers are still out there of course , but you have to go look for them .
Which brings us to the next topic :
Anarchy Agility in the UK
The other diversion was a Panel Discussion about 10 years of agility in the UK and bar night , with drinks sponsored by the eXtreme Tuesday Club .
David Harvey hosted a panel discussion between early eXtreme Programmers Paul Dyson , Tim Mackinnon , Rachael Davies and Ivan Moore .
Paul Dyson wrote about his optimism already :
Perhaps the Agile community has become a bit too focussed on certification rather than learning , on easy rather than effective methods , and on being recognised as ‘ being Agile ’ rather than achieving agility .
But I believe that the world is changing in a way that will force the Agile community to adapt or die and I ’m optimistic that we will achieve the former .
Paul was was a bit surprised about the agreement on failing agile projects in the room – since it was filled with agile coaches , developers etc. who have a ‘ vested interest ’ in agile .
I have a vested interest ( I am not retired by a long shot , coaching and training agile teams , and being test - infected I have to find places of work where I can at least write tests ( and preferably talk to the customers as well ) .
The agreement does not surprise me .
I still encounter shops ( or rather , shops encounter me ) that want to kick ass , but as ‘ agile ’ becomes mainstream we find more and more shops that are content to go throug the motions , or believe that by following some book ‘ to the letter ’ they will be somewhat more successful .
I guess the room was filled with people who got addicted to high performance teams through the early days of eXtreme Programming .
Stepping back from there into environments that lack the desire for excellence is hard .
Another thing that struck me from the panel discussion , was a remark by Tim or Paul about the early days of XTC .
If something new came along , you would try it out just for fun and see if it would work for you .
These days there seems to be more of a ‘ not invented here ’ syndrome hanging around , even in agile circles .
Paul ’s optimism stems from the trend of mash - ups – applications that are made from other applications that already exist .
Turn - around time of mash - ups can be a lot faster than ‘ traditional ’ applications , which will force the agile community to adapt or die ( or perhaps ‘ adapt or dye ’ ) .
In that context the postmodern programming conference organized by Ivan Moore and others a few years ago was also mentioned .
Lasse Koskela and yours truly already decided to adapt ( embrace and extend ) – we will be hosting a Scrapheap Challenge , which is a shorter version of the exercises of the postmodern programming conference , during XP2009 .
We see the internet as a giant Scrapheap , and Challenge the participants to complete a mash - up instead of an application , from Scap instead of Scratch , in less than no -time .
In the meantime , I hope the photos convey a bit of the buzz that was SPA2009 …

Project Plan
A roll up project plan for projects participating in the Galileo Simultaneous Release is found here : http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=galileo
Requirements For Participation
Projects that are part of Galileo agree to abide by the following requirements .
Note : the EMO will remove projects that do not meet the required constraints .
For a report of overall Galileo status , see this report .
Note : this report is bugzilla intensive , so please use sparingly .
Must Do
Should Do
These milestone and release candidate dates are based on the dependencies of the projects ( we call these the +0 , +1 , and +2 dependencies ) .
Obviously , if a +0 date slips , then it will cause the +1 and + 2 dates to slip ; similarly for a + 1 slip causing + 2 slips .
Note that the +0 , +1 , +2 , and +3 dates are roughly equivalent to stable nightly builds in a traditional Eclipse project - each of these partial milestone builds will incorporate more and more of the associated project milestones .
The " Release " date is the official M / RC date .
Note : in the following table , RC5 on the ' Galileo ' line does not mean this final build is a release ' candidate ' ... it is still to be the ' final build ' for this Release ... but ' RC5 ' is the suggested " target " to have some consistent terminology in Bugzilla , and similar things , to be able to mark things that are different in the final release build than in the RC4 build .
[ The full word , " Galileo " does n't make a very good bugzilla milestone target , since it 's a little too inclusive , and " R " ( for " Release " ) is too short .
TODO : next year consider " GA " for this final target ? ]
Hopefully there will not by ANY differences between RC4 , and RC5 ... but , some projects may find they have to make doc additions , readme files , etc. , so ... this just provides a way that such changes can be consistently marked , tracked , etc. , to better keep everyone informed about what might be different between RC4 and the RC5 ( the final released code ) .
[ Note : it 's probably obvious , but this does not mean " RC5 " should be part of the final zip file names or anything .
those can still be what ever " final " name they would always have . ]
The calendar is available in the following formats : ICal , ATOM News Feed , HTML
Communication
Cross -Project Milestone & RC Status Reporting
As with Ganymede , reporting on status will be done using a wiki table .
We have decided that instead of affirmative signoffs , projects should post exceptions to the cross - project dev mailing list .
Conference Calls
The Planning Council is the body responsible for coordinating the Galileo release train .
Thus , its conference calls are the Galileo planning and coordination calls .
Mailing Lists and Newsgroups
Eclipse projects have three communication channels : a mailing list for developers , a newsgroup for users , and Bugzilla .
Galileo , although not a " project " per se , will use the same structure :
cross-projects - issues - dev - mailing list for developers and releng ( see archives )
eclipse.simultaneous -release - newsgroup for users ( see archives )
The old eclipse.org - planning - council mailing list will be used for non-Galileo Planning Council items .

Galileo Builds and P2 repository
A number of utilities have been written to automate the assembly of Callisto ' 06 , Europa ' 07 , Ganymede '08 and now Galileo '09 builds .
These are available in their own CVS respository .
You can find more information about how this is organized and individual project responsibilities for the build on this Galileo Build page ( with old information on the Ganymede Build and Europa Build pages ) .
And with Galileo we are using the Buckminster Galileo Builder .
The Contributing to Galileo Build page is where you go to learn how to add your project to the Galileo build .
p2 Repository
To obtain the latest published bits from Galileo , use this URL :
It contains the latest milestone , release candidate , eventually the release itself , and then eventually service releases .
To obtain the latest working version , as we build up to a milestone or release , you can test the site at
Coordinated Service Releases
SR1
GA : 9/25/09 ( last Friday of September )
In the SR1 rampdown , as shown in the following table , there will be 4 RCs , each spanning one week , with projects staging themselves into the build just one day apart .
Projects may elect not to participate in a particular RC , but have an obligation to fix any build problems that is related to their code or p2 repository .
RC1 will be in the middle of August , several weeks earlier than previous years , just to make sure we can still build , etc. Subsequent RCs dates are similar to previous years , except a " quiet " final week is also planned .
( It is normally pretty quiet anyway ... this just formalizes it ) .
The Final week before GA will not have any further builds or contributions , but instead be reserved for final adopter testing and preparation and only emergency fixes for very serious regressions will be considered .
The ' promote ' day ( 9/24 ) will be the day projects put final zips in their final spot ( without displaying them ) so they can propagate through the mirroring system .
Similar for the p2 repository -- it will be replaced on 9/24 with the new content so it can start mirroring .
Note : there is no plan to retain multiple versions in the common discovery repository ( unless someone volunteers to do what 's required to make that happen ) .
At noon on 9/25 projects can make their final maintenance releases visible .

Abstract
The aim of this note is to present an alternative definition of the zipWith family in the Haskell Library Report [ 5 ] .
Because of the difficulties in defining a well - typed function with a variable number of arguments , [ 5 ] presents a family of zipWith functions .
It provides zip functions zipWith 2 ; zipWith 3 ; : : : ; zipWith 7 .
For each n , zipWith n zips n lists with a n- ary function .
Defining a single zipWith function with a variable number of arguments seems to require dependent types .
We show , however , how to define such a function in Haskell by means of a binary operator for grouping its arguments .
For comparison , we also give definitions of zipWith in languages with dependent types .
1 zipWith in the Haskell library The Haskell library [ 5 ] supplies the programmer with a family of functions zipWith 2 , zipWith 3 , . . . , zipWith 7 indexed by the number of lists to which it applies .
For instance , zipWith 4 is defined as follows .
zipWith4 :: ( a-?b-?c-?d-?e ) -? [ a ] -?[ b ]-? [ c ] -?[ d ] ...
Still Facing Depression and Hyperinflation
It ’s the Ultimate Fighting Event – Worldwide Economic Mud Wrestling !
See it now !
First , the Honey Hun…German Chancellor Angela Merkel … took on a whole pack of central bankers and economists , charging that they were going to make the situation worse – by spending money they did n’t have …and causing inflation .
Then , historian Niall Ferguson – Professor Punchy – took a jab at the meddlers in the pages of the Financial Times .
His point was simple enough ; that the feds were spending trillions of dollars without really knowing what they were doing .
If they borrow money to stimulate the economy they are just taking money out of the private economy and diverting it to public spending .
There ’s no gain in that , he said .
Watch out Niall …!
The Nobel Knucklehead – economist Paul Krugman – hit back .
We ’ll return to this grapplefest .
But first , let ’s take a look at what is happening outside the arena …
Nothing !
Yesterday , for the third day in a row … not much happened in the markets .
The Dow fell 24 points – hardly worth mentioning .
Gold held steady at $ 955 .
Oil rose a dollar – to $ 71 .
And the dollar itself remained about where it was – at $ 1.39 per euro .
It is as if everyone were waiting to see what happens next .
Let ’s see …
We ’ve seen the biggest stock crash in history …
… the biggest property crash in history …
… the biggest deficits in history ( four times the previous record ! ) …
… the biggest bailouts in history ( we ca n’t even count that high ) …
… the biggest bankruptcies in history …
… the auto industry and the finance industry have been largely nationalized …
… the president of the United States of America is now making financial decisions for formerly private industries …
What ’s left to see ?
Oh yes …the depression … and hyperinflation .
“ Get ready for inflation and higher interest rates , ” warns Art Laffer in the Wall Street Journal .
Remember him ?
Creator of the ‘ Laffer Curve . ’
But do n’t worry about inflation , adds Harvard professor Gregory Mankiw , also in the Wall Street Journal : Inflation is just what we need .
“ In the current environment , the goal could be to produce enough inflation to ensure that the real interest rate is sufficiently negative … ” to force people to get rid of their money as fast as possible .
Over in the bond market , investors are finding out what a little bit of inflation – or even hints of inflation – can do .
People bought US Treasuries during the panic of ’08 for safety purposes .
Now , they ’re getting what we predicted .
Alas , yes , they are getting what they deserve , not what they expected .
Our friend Chuck Butler points out that prices of 10 - year Treasuries have come down from $ 110 as recently as 5 months ago to just $ 94 this week .
How ’s that for safety – a 15 % loss !
What they were fleeing from was the uncertainty and risk of the big wide world of investing .
When Lehman Brothers went broke foreign investors took the first available plane out of India , for example .
But now , our friend Ajit Dayal reports that they ’re coming back .
We ’re working with him now to develop an international report on investments in the BRIC countries , with ace editors on the ground in each .
As soon as the report is ready we ’ll give you first crack at reading it here .
Because right now things are looking up on the sub -continent :
“ What a month !
“ The 36 % surge in client portfolios after the election results in India have brought the value of the client holdings back to where they were before the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008 .
“ We see this as a base for a possible assault on a new peak by June 2010 .
“ That is the good news .
“ The bad news is that many of the lessons learned in the implosion of capital markets in the year 2008 may be forgotten .
Memories are short – in fact they may not exist . ”
Memories ?
Here at The Daily Reckoning we ’ve got all the memories you could want .
We may not be able to remember what we did with our car keys , but we remember that fateful day – August 15 , 1971 – when Richard Nixon ‘ closed the gold window . ’
It ’s been downhill ever since …
In his blog , Krugman accused Ferguson of “ living in a dark age of macro- economics , in which hard - won knowledge has simply been forgotten . ”
The “ hard - won knowledge ” he referred to was Keynes ’ “ proof ” that extra government spending was indeed a plus to the economy – as long as there was not full employment .
Once full employment was achieved , things changed , he said .
Then , government borrowing just “ crowded out ” private borrowing .
We do n’t expect Daily Reckoning readers to be deeply interested in these squabbles ; you ’ve got better things to do .
We just bring it up to make a point .
The world ’s governments – led by the United States of America – are spending trillions to head off what they believe could be a terrible depression .
Yet the theory on which they hang their reasoning is such a thin string , some of the world ’s leading thinkers can’t seem to hold onto it .
Merkel thinks the theory is wrong ; Ferguson thinks it ’s wrong .
Heck , we even think it ’s wrong .
Not that that proves anything .
We could be wrong .
But we ’re not spending trillions of dollars based on an idea that is the subject of hot dispute .
It ’s a dangerous plan …
“ Keynsian revolution was not a triumph of good science , but of good judgment , ” says the FT ’s headline from yesterday .
Ha ha… that ’s a good one .
They ’re right , of course .
There was no science in Keynes ’ oeuvre .
It was all guesswork .
But good judgment ?
Not much of that either .
As for Keynes ’ “ proof , ” it is defective .
He argues only that when the feds borrow and spend in a recession they ca n’t “ crowd out ” private borrowing without also increasing economic activity – which he takes as a gain .
Which reminds us how simpleminded economists can be .
Imagine a town where people borrowed and spent too much .
Faced with unemployment and a slump , the mayor borrows money to build a new town hall – thus putting “ idle ” resources back to work .
He does n’t “ crowd out ” private activity , because private citizens are hunkered down , trying to pay off their debts .
They save .
They lend to the mayor .
Private borrowers have no better use for the money .
That is the theory of it .
On the surface , it appears that the mayor ’s stimulus plan is a big success .
Pretty soon , people are working again .
Money is changing hands .
The new city hall is going up .
But what has really happened ?
The citizens will have a new town hall .
But it ’s a building they had n’t particularly wanted when the good times were still rolling .
And now they have their share of the debt the mayor incurred to build it .
Yes , it may look as though the town is more prosperous – with people employed on the new town hall , collecting paychecks and spending money .
But the prosperity is phony .
Citizens got not just one thing they did n’t want , but two – a new town hall and more debt .
And somehow , sometime in the future … other spending plans will have to be shelved so that the town hall can be paid for !
That ’s what Angela Merkel was saying in her attack on the central banks .
When all is said and done , 10 years from now we ’ll be back to where we are now .
This morning , we got a call from a reporter .
“ How long do you think this rally will continue , ” she asked .
“ Why do you think it wo n’t last ? ”
“ As to the first question , we have only an intuition … based on very few historical precedents .
When you get a crash as big as we had until March … you can expect a rebound for 3 - 6 months after .
The current rebound is now almost exactly 3 months old .
By our guess it could run 3 months more … which takes it to September .
But it ’s very dangerous .
If you ’re playing this rally , be sure to use tight trailing stops … the next leg down could be worse than the first .
Remember , after the Crash of October ’ 29 the market rallied until the following May .
Then , it went down .
And it did n’t bottom until 1932 .
“ As to the second question … why ca n’t the rally become a real boom ? … the answer is very simple .
Debt is either expanding .
Or it is contracting .
When it gets to an extraordinary high … it tends to go down .
Because it ca n’t go up any more .
That ’s where we are now .
Since consumer debt can’t increase – and since consumer incomes are definitely not increasing … especially not in Britain and America – there is no way that a consumer economy can expand .
Since it ca n’t expand , it must contract .
You ca n’t have a boom in a consumer economy when consumer credit , consumer incomes , and consumer spending are all going down .
Forget it . ”
Until tomorrow

The Daily Reckoning
Today ’s New York Times has an article on Minnesota ’s one Senator : Amy Klobuchar .
For the past six months , she ’s been doing the work of two .
With the economic crisis , it ’s not easy carrying the whole load , although Klobuchar and her staff have risen to the occasion :
In a way , the time for a state to have a lone senator could not be worse , political experts said .
Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale , a former senator from Minnesota , said the nation ’s economic woes and the growing needs of constituents increased the already overwhelming demands facing a senator .
“ Doing that all by yourself ? ” Mr. Mondale said .
“ It ’s a big burden , really daunting . ” A political scientist at the University of Minnesota , Lawrence R. Jacobs , said that given the deluge of requests for help from those losing jobs , homes , everything , Ms. Klobuchar was “ a little like the Dutch boy trying to plug the dike . ”
The situation is clearly hurting the people of Minnesota .
But , that should n’t be the case .
Norm Coleman lost .
Norm ’s own lawsuit to get more votes counted backfired on him .
After the additional votes were counted , he ’s down by an even wider margin :
The ballots counted Tuesday were ones that the three judges had concluded were wrongly rejected .
State Elections Director Gary Poser went through them one by one in court , calling 198 votes for DFLer Franken , 111 for Republican Coleman and 42 for the Independence Party ’s Dean Barkley or others .
The tally increased Franken ’s narrow lead from 225 votes to 312 , out of 2.9 million votes cast in the November election .
In this race , a lead of 312 votes is a landslide .
It ’s time long past time for Norm to give it up .
But , he wo n’t because Norm does n’t care about Minnesotans .
Coleman ’s loyalties lie with the leaders of the Republican Senate back in D.C. :
Texas Sen. John Cornyn , who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee , said in a statement that the court failed to address “ the main issue , ” that the judges had disenfranchised more than 4,000 Minnesotans by failing to count their ballots .
“ That ’s why it ’s so critical for this process to move forward before the Minnesota Supreme Court and why Senate Republicans fully support Senator Coleman ’s efforts , ” he said .
That ’s just BS .
The “ main issue ” is that Coleman can’t win , but the Republicans really , really do n’t want the Democrats to have their 59th vote in the Senate .
The Republican Senators are disenfranchising the people of Minnesota .
Franken ’s lawyer summed up the situation :
“ The problem former Senator Coleman has is he lost fair and square , ” Elias said .
“ No amount of lawyering or sophisticated legal arguments is going to change that . ”
But GOP money is going to keep dragging this out .
That has to end .
And , the Senate Democrats need to get much more aggressive about it .
The election of Barack Obama has not changed the state of uncertainty insofar as the Iranian crisis is concerned .
Many analysts expressed optimism after the negotiation offer of March 21 .
But a pessimist might take the view that the failure of this initial proposal for dialogue with Tehran could have a backlash effect : being disappointed that the Iranians made no real concessions , Barack Obama and his team would choose at the end the war option — or at least authorize and support logistically Israeli air strikes .
Western Europe ’s lack of strategy in the Iranian affair can be seen in the fact that the EU will play only a second - rank role in the coming months .
Germany never really wanted to exert an influence equivalent to its economic weight in the region , although the Iranians originally felt hopeful about Germany ’s moderating influence on the United States .
But today I would like to have a look at what a new French approach to the conflict could be .
Just at the end of his second presidential term , Jacques Chirac committed an entirely voluntary blunder in front of American journalists .
It would not be a drama , he said , if Iran became a nuclear power .
It was typically Chirac : he had never dared — with the exception of 2002 - 2003 — continue the politics of General de Gaulle ; but just before leaving power he was ready to tell the world what he really thought : that the nuclear bomb is a rationalizing factor in international relations .
France is a nuclear power ; this is an essential asset in today ’s multipolar world .
And France became a nuclear power for precisely the same reasons why the Iranian government wants their country to possess the nuclear bomb : in a hostile environment as was the case for Europe in the 1960s , France wanted to be independent and to avoid being a hostage in the hands of one of the superpowers ; the Iranians are today trying to protect themselves against the United States surrounding them with troops but also against Israel .
And they want to assert their influence among Muslims ( against the Arab world ) .
Like France in the 1960s Iran wants to play a role corresponding to its real weight .
Both countries possess an old diplomatic tradition and they share a mixture of fascination and repulsion towards the United States .
Iran , like France , always had difficult relations to Russia but sees Moscow as a key to ending the conflicts in the region .
The most important aspect that should be stressed would be Iran ’s nuclear strategy — if the country managed to go nuclear : it would consist in possessing only a small number of nuclear bombs , what would be necessary to deter possible aggressors who would see that the destruction that would be inflicted to them would be equivalent to the destruction they would try to inflict to Iran .
This is what French military planners call " dissuasion du faible au fort " ( the weaker is deterring the stronger ) .
This view has always been shared by the Chinese too .
China never ruined itself , as the Soviets did — and the United States as we see today — by piling up stocks of nuclear arms to assure their country ’s defense .
Iran will not need 200 bombs , as the Israelis have .
A few bombs are enough to deter Israel from destroying Iran — and to rationalize the relations between the two countries .
There we have come to the most essential point , when trying to identify which role France could play in the Middle East .
France has the authority — if its government is courageous enough — to tell the Israelis that they have developed a totally absurd strategy by staying an unavowed nuclear power .
France should bring Israel to speaking openly of its own nuclear deterrence .
Real nuclear deterrence means that everybody knows that a country has gone nuclear but remains uncertain as far as the possible use of this nuclear power is concerned .
Of course every informed person knows in 2009 that Israel is unofficially a nuclear power .
And this is one of the reasons why the Iranians would like to go nuclear , too .
But it would make a big difference if the Israelis told the Iranians and the world : " OK we have the bomb ; and we can understand that you want to go nuclear .
Let us negotiate : we will reduce our nuclear capacity if you recognize our state and give up the military side of your nuclear project .
We may cut the whole of our nuclear stock if you help reach a general peace agreement in the region — which means convincing all our neighbors to recognize our existence as legitimate and to renounce going nuclear themselves . "
Iranians may not get convinced at first — this is the most probable scenario ; but by telling the world community publicly that they have gone nuclear , the Israelis would be led to rationalizing their foreign policy , to overcoming their fears .
Iran would be obliged to play an open game : it would become much more difficult for Tehran to remain silent about the country ’s real intentions .
If Israel told the Iranians : " Do not think you can destroy us ; you would be destroyed , too .
And since you cannot attack us , we see no reason to attack you , " it would mean that the only remaining reason to go nuclear would be Tehran ’s fears about Pakistan and the United States ’ presence in the region .
Israel would reach a lot by first acknowledging publicly it has gone nuclear — which would mean telling the world " we are indestructible .
Do n’t try " — and secondly negotiating with its neighbors a reduction of its nuclear arms stock to a minimum .
When De Gaulle ’s France went nuclear , the former French president told his advisers that as a nuclear power France would be entitled to pleading for disarmament .
Because it possessed nuclear deterrence France would be taken seriously while proposing to denuclearize itself if the others did the same .
The outlook we are defending here may sound totally utopic .
But it is a rational utopia , possibly leading to peace in the Middle East .
Speaking openly about one ’s own deterrence capacity would be much more efficient from the Israeli point of view than launching air strikes against Iran .
It is vital to understand that trying to prevent Iran to develop nuclear arms is doomed to fail .
As long as the United States have soldiers in the region and with Pakistan as an instable nuclear power in the vicinity , Iran can legitimately argue that its security is guaranteed by going nuclear .
An Israeli air strike would not prevent Iran from developing nuclear capacities in the long term .
It would above all radicalize the conflicts in the Middle East .
It would only convince the Iranians further that they need to go nuclear .
France could really play an important role in the region if it wanted to .
Speaking as a nuclear power , Paris could elaborate a diplomatic language that can be understood and supported not only by China but also by Russia .
After the collapse of communism , Russia had to renounce its absurd stockpiling of weapons .
Russian security rests much more on its being a nuclear power today than was the case in the 1980s when the USSR had a huge conventional army .
Russia is now able , with France and China , to contribute to the necessary rationalization of international affairs after the end of American supremacy .
We have to get rid of the logic of " preemptive war . "
A courageous France , remaining truthful to its own strategic tradition , would have much more influence than its current leaders think .

Broder : Obama passes 1st test of presidency with ease Commentary
WASHINGTON —
As we approach the 100 - day mark for the Obama administration , you will hear and see a wide variety of grades for the new president ’s performance .
Remember this .
What has happened so far is no more than the overture to the first act of this opera .
The big stuff is still to come .
The soprano has not opened her mouth for her signature aria .
That will be health care reform .
The devilish baritone is still offstage .
Wait for the first international crisis .
Barack Obama has launched a lot of schemes , but has fulfilled few of them .
What he has shown — and it is an important accomplishment in itself — is a mastery of the art of managing the presidency .
It is important because it is the first and most basic test of his ultimate ability to be a successful president .
And it is surprising , because there was no reason to assume that he had the skills to direct such a large enterprise .
Never before in his 47 years had the lawyer - writer - politician had to recruit , assign and motivate a professional staff of this size and skill and organize it to meet his needs and carry out his purposes .
His staffs in the Illinois Legislature and the U.S. Senate were minuscule .
The campaign itself was by far his largest organizational challenge , and he passed with flying colors .
But the presidency poses far tougher tests than amassing 270 electoral votes .
Obama had a few stumbles in assembling his Cabinet and , as a result , lost the services of one potential major asset , Tom Daschle , his original choice to manage his health care initiative .
Many of the Cabinet members are still learning their jobs , but the White House staff has supported what so far has been a bravura performance on Obama ’s part .
Particularly striking has been the staff ’s ability to move at a rapid pace to tackle inherited challenges and launch ambitious initiatives without creating a sense of confusion about the essential priorities of the new president .
Hardly a day has gone by in the first three months that Americans have not seen and heard Obama on their TV screens in a variety of roles — chiefly as economic salvage director for seriously shattered housing , credit and employment systems .
But also as commander in chief of armed forces fighting two wars , diplomatic traveler engaged with other world leaders , and agenda - setter for Congress — to say nothing of first father , first fan , first consort of Michelle and first master of Bo .
Making these daily kaleidoscopes look coherent — and not confusing — requires enormous discipline .
And nowhere more than in the management of the White House schedule .
The task and the tools were sketched for me last week by chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , who had a close - up look at the near - fatal costs of losing control as a White House staff member in the chaotic first two years of the Clinton administration .
As Bradley Patterson , the pre-eminent scholar of White House staff work , remarked last week , Clinton ’s schedule was “ set and reset and reset again , ” in impromptu meetings that often ended without a decision .
That led to his major initiatives — health care , NAFTA , the budget , “ reinventing government ” — literally bumping each other out of the way .
Obama inherited a much improved scheduling system from the first MBA president , George Bush , with an electronic calendar , stretching from the next day to the next month to the next year , available to senior staffers .
Obama has continued Bush ’s pattern of weekly Saturday scheduling sessions , run by Emanuel , Alyssa Mastromonaco , the director of scheduling and advance , and Danielle Crutchfield , the president ’s own scheduler , and attended by other senior staffers .
A daily early - morning scheduling huddle allows for fine - tuning and updating .
The challenge will become greater as Obama ’s initiatives move to Capitol Hill , where a single senator can throw up a roadblock , and when the inevitable foreign crisis explodes .
But the overture has gone well , and so far , the cast seems to know its parts .
Broder , a Pulitzer Prize - winning political reporter , writes from Washington , D.C. ( davidbroder@washpost.com )
E & J Gallo , the enormous , privately held wine company , is well - known ( notorious ? ) for protecting their brand .
Ernest and Julio sued their own brother Joseph in 1986 to prevent him from marketing his cheese as “ Joseph Gallo . ”
They also sued unrelated East Bay company , Gallo Salume Inc. , to limit the number of their meat products that could carry the name .
A couple of weeks ago , E & J Gallo cranked the lawsuit - o - meter up a notch :
They sued a Seattle gourmet food store for selling a Spanish pasta called Gallo .
On the forums of the Seattle Times , Steve Winston , the owner of The Spanish Table in Pike Place Market , comments that Pastas Gallo dates from 1874 while E & J Gallo dates from 1933 .
In Ernest Gallo ’s obituary , the Times of London further summarized Gallo ’s legal actions :
In 1990 the company successfully sued the Gallo Nero wine consortium of Chianti who had used the word â€œgalloâ€ ( cockerel ) on their bottles .
Ten years later the brothers took the Chianti wine - makers to court again over their domaine name .
In the meantime they put pressure on a small domaine called Santa Marcellina in Chianti because they had a â€ œMarcellinaâ€ trade - mark among the many they had patented .
In 1994 they attacked a Mexican company called Pasatiempos Gallo .
In 2002 it was the turn of a lady potter in Texas , who used the word â€œgalloâ€ because she made ceramic representations of roosters .
Gallo himself made no excuses for his behaviour , saying : â€ œWe donâ€™t want most of the business .
We want it all.â€ 
While it ’s no doubt important for mark holders to protect their marks , there ’s no point in being a cockerel about it .
The situation smacks of Monster Cable ’s overreaching and suing a mini - golf company and engendering consumer ill will .
Perhaps we should take a page from Gizmodo ’s book and come up with a list of items that Gallo legal eagles might want to put in their sight :
Pico de gallo salsa
The Year of the Rooster

Rossignol skis
Coq au vin

Worldwide PC shipments are expected to plunge this year to 257 million units , a drop of 11.9 percent - the biggest ever in the industry , according to a new report .
Mobile phone sales are also declining .
" This is going to be a tough time for the industry , " said George Shiffler , a research director at Gartner in San Jose , which released the report Monday .
" It 's grit your teeth and gut your way out . "
Both emerging and mature markets are affected , which is especially bad news for Silicon Valley because emerging markets have been a growth engine for technology companies , even as their sales slowed in the United States and the rest of the developed world .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Shipments of mobile PCs are expected to grow 9 percent this year to 155.6 million units , Gartner said , but that 's not enough to offset an expected decline in shipments of desktop PCs of 31.9 percent , caused because more people are hanging on to the computers they already have .
Gartner expects developed markets to decline by 13 percent this year , compared with a 7.9 percent decline in 2001 after the dot - com bubble burst .
Emerging markets are expected to decline by 10.4 percent , compared with an 11.1 percent growth in 2002 .
Mobile phone sales also declined in the fourth quarter , although they rose in 2008 overall , according to a report Gartner was to release today .
PCs and mobile phones in turn have the biggest impact on global sales of semiconductors , which declined in January by 28.6 percent year over year and 11.9 percent since December , the Semiconductor Industry Association said .
This year 's expected drop in PC sales is a combination of the recession and a quick reaction by companies in various parts of the PC supply chain , which have improved their technology for forecasting demand , Shiffler said .
Whether they have cut inventory too much remains to be seen .
Still , the effects of Gartner 's report are rippling throughout the technology industry .
Shares of Applied Materials , Intel , AMD , Hewlett - Packard , Microsoft and Dell all dropped on Monday , and a spokesman for Intel said the company expects more months of decline .
Intel has announced it will lay off 5,000 to 6,000 employees as part of the closure of several older factories in the United States and abroad , and the upgrading of four U.S. factories , on which the company proposes to spend $ 7 billion .
Also on Monday , Intel announced specialized processors for car entertainment systems , media phones , and industrial automation and control systems .
" We know it 's challenging times , and we are continuing to try to control the business and also try the best we can to invest so we can come out stronger than when we went in , " said Chuck Mulloy , an Intel spokesman .
Intel is better positioned than most companies to invest in the future because of its size , Shiffler said .
" My question is , what happens to the others ?
Do they have resources , or access to credit ? "
He expects the economy to improve in 2010 and 2011 , he said , but it has to stop falling first .
In 2013 the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to three American professors : Eugene Fama and Lars Hansen of Chicago University and Robert Shiller of Yale .
They were jointly recognised for “ laying the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices ” , according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which selects the winners .
With the global stock market turmoil of the last decade , it appears confusing that asset prices can be understood .
In 2012 the prize was awarded for a series of “ systematic laboratory experiments ” , amounting to “ an outstanding example of economic engineering ” and the 2011 prize recognised deeply obscure research into “ macroeconomic stability ” at a time when the global economy was on a knife - edge .
None of these reasons sound like economics .
This leads to the question as to whether economics is a science
Economic Sciences
Economics requires the analysis of economic , commercial and financial life that requires a solid grounding in theory and numeracy , but also requires knowledge of politics , history , sociology and the study of human behaviour .
In the sciences of physics , chemistry and medicine , Nobel recipients have been rewarded for work that claim to have established “ certainties ” , made “ findings ” and discovered “ relationships ” .
None of which are possible in economics where markets are volatile , trade wars simmer and the demographics impact results .
Economic data is a guide to policy which means economic phenomena are less solid in outcome since economics is judged by what it can produce , making it more like engineering than physics .
Practical and theoretical
Economists must engage with the pressing issues of our day in a practical , rather than just a theoretical manner .
Fama ’s “ efficient market hypothesis ” , is seen as the fundamental principle of what economists call “ finance theory ” stating that share values are extremely difficult to predict in the short - run , given that all new information is quickly incorporated into prices .
It makes sense that share prices reflect all available information , but they also reflect rumours , supposition , herd - instinct , prejudice , arrogance , pessimism and many other immeasurable qualitative factors , including occasional madness , which Fama largely ignores .
The problem is that once the focus is on economic policy , politics and political posturing gets the public attention rather than the theory .
Fama , together with Hansen ’s finance theories may be popular because they say what the financial services industry wants it to say .
If financial asset prices are entirely rational , then it ’s impossible to beat the market .
Better , then , for ordinary investors who want to own shares to put their money in unit trusts and tracker funds , paying charges to the industry for doing so .
Fama ’s “ leave it to the professionals ” message has been used over many years to create an intellectual climate that discourages the kind of small - scale and activist investment that engenders accountability and promotes good corporate governance .
The 2013 Nobel prize winner for economics , Robert Shiller is a critic of the finance theory proposed by Fama and Hansen .
Shiller is an economist who does his research and then has the courage to say the unpleasant truth .
The ingenious Case - Shiller house price index he helped to develop predicted the last US housing collapse for example .
Shiller has stated that “ Critics of economic sciences sometimes refer to the development of a ‘ pseudoscience ’ of economics , arguing that it uses the trappings of science , like dense mathematics , but only for show .
Vulnerable models
Economics is more vulnerable than the physical sciences to models whose validity will never be clear , because the necessity for approximation is much stronger than in the physical sciences , especially given that the models describe people rather than magnetic resonances or fundamental particles .
People can just change their minds and behave completely differently .
They even have neuroses and identity problems , complex phenomena that the field of behavioural economics is finding relevant to understanding economic outcomes .
Yet economics has an important quantitative side that cannot be ignored .
The challenge has been to combine its mathematical insights with the kinds of adjustments that are needed to make its models fit the economy ’s complex human element .
The research findings of the 2013 winners do n’t agree with each other , which is the opposite of what “ science ” is , yet economics is a science because it can be approached scientifically , and its theories tested .
In contrast , many economists are not scientists because they are too politically polarized to view their findings objectively .
Stronger science
The advance of behavioural economics is not fundamentally in conflict with mathematical economics , though it may be in conflict with some currently fashionable mathematical economic models .
While economics presents its own methodological problems , the basic challenges facing researchers are not fundamentally different from those faced by researchers in other fields .
As economics develops , it will broaden its collection of methods and sources of evidence , the science will become stronger , and charlatans will be exposed .

Stop what you ’re doing and make your project a github page .
For the love of god , your project has no documentation .
RDoc is cool , READMEs are decent , but descriptive websites with examples ?
Oh , they RULE .
At first , I was skeptical .
Pages looked cool , but it seemed like a lot of effort to create a page especially one for each project .
Then two things happened :
Tom yelled at me / us I discovered the power of jekyll
The main problem that jekyll solves for github pages is the ability to have a general ‘ layout ’ that eliminates the HTML copy and paste you would have to do if you were managing pages for more then one project .
Having a unified layout also allows you ’re project pages to have a unified brand and feel – something I believe is important .
There other things that are truly great about using jekyll .
Easy code highlighting .
Highlighting a block of code is as easy as :
{ % highlight ruby %} def awesome " for real .
I know . " end { % endhighlight %}
Then all you have to do is grab a syntax stylesheet .
You can grab mine here
Ability to write pages in textile or markdown .
I ’ve been doing all my blogging in textile for a long time now , and being able to write an easy to read page that I can easily find and edit text in makes it more likely that I ’ll continue to update the pages with new releases .
Ability to pass variables from individual pages into your layout to make your layout even more reusable .
This is underused , but because jekyll interprets the layout file after its read the variables from the top of your document it means you can stick variables in your YAML head that the layout can use .
For example :
In my github project pages , the YAML head looks something like :
--- layout : quirkey_code title : sinatra - gen github_name : sinatra - gen current_version : 0.3.0 nav : - name :
What link : " # what " - name :
Why link : " #why " - name : Usage link : " #usage " - name : Options link : " #options " - name : Dependencies link : " # dependencies " ---
Beyond passing the page title , I ’m also passing a ton of other variables .
The github_name is used to link to the downloads of the project on github – a reusable piece of code that exists at the foot of every page .
In the layout it looks like :
< h3 id = " installing " > Installing </ h3 > < div class = " highlight " > < pre > sudo gem install {{ page.github_name }} </ pre > </ div > < p >
Or directly from github : </ p > < div class = " highlight " > < pre > sudo gem install quirkey - {{ page.github_name }} -s http://gems.github.com </ pre > </ div > < p >
Github in thier infinite awesomeness also lets you download the source in multiple formats .
</ p > < div class = " download " > < a href = " http://github.com/quirkey/{{ page.github_name }}/zipball / master " > < img border = " 0 " width = " 90 " src = " http://github.com/images/modules/download/zip.png " /> </ a > < a href = " http://github.com/quirkey/{{ page.github_name }}/tarball / master " > < img border = " 0 " width = " 90 " src = " http://github.com/images/modules/download/tar.png " /> </ a > </ div >
current_version and nav work the same way .
nav uses a little more liquid magic to get the job done :
{ % if page.nav %} < ul id = " pagenav " > { % for nav in page.nav %} < li > < a href = " {{ nav [ ' link ' ] }} " > {{ nav [ ' name ' ] }} </ a > </ li > { % endfor %} < li > < a href = " #installing " > Installing </ a > </ li > < li > < a href = " #requests " > Bugs / Feature < br />

This way I can have a super flexible nav menu , changing what I need and what I do n’t in the page instead of in the layout .
You can see the full code for the sinatra - gen page or the full quirkey_code layout .
Submodules for the ultimate stoke factor .
After building a couple of these project pages , I thought “ Hey !
I can just put my layout in its own repo and when I start a new project page , I can just submodule it ! ” .
Great idea , unfortunately at the time , github did n’t support it .
However , after nagging PJ a bit now they do !
My workflow , is I ’ve set up a jekyll_layouts repository and when I first create my gh- pages branch ( described in detail here ) , I just run :
git submodule add git://github.com/quirkey/jekyll_layouts.git
_layouts
Then , the next time I push , github graciously pulls my submodule before building my page with jekyll .
Sweet .
Some things to note :
You have to have a public repository for the layouts and you have to submodule with a globally accessible URL ( as in the ‘ public ’ clone url instead of ‘ your ’ clone URL ) .
( as in the ‘ public ’ clone url instead of ‘ your ’ clone ) .
When you switch back to your master branch , the _layouts directory wont disappear automatically .
You can add it to your .gitignore OR just delete it and it will reappear when you switch back to gh - pages .
Using the power of git , there is also a way to continue editing your submodule ’d layouts while in a pages branch .
The trick is that while you use the public clone URL for the ‘ origin ’ server of the submodule , you can add your private URL as another remote for the cloned repository .
For example :
If I ’m in my sinatra - gen repository at the gh- pages branch , I can cd into the _layouts submodule :
[ 10:47 AM : sinatra - gen ( gh - pages ) ] $ cd _layouts [ 11:23 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $
If I inspect the branches I see :
[ 11:23 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $ git branch - a * master origin / HEAD origin / master
From here I can add another remote , which is actually the same repository – just the private clone URL .
[ 11:24 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $ git remote add upstream git@github.com :quirkey/jekyll_layouts.git [ 11:26 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $ git fetch upstream From git@github.com : quirkey / jekyll_layouts * [ new branch ] master -> upstream / master [ 11:26 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $ git branch - a * master origin / HEAD origin / master upstream / master
Now
If I make a change in the _layouts directory , its as easy as :
[ 11:28 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $ git commit - am " Moved around title " Created commit 5726d5e : Moved around title 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-) [ 11:28 AM:_layouts ( master ) ] $ git push upstream master Counting objects : 5 , done .
Compressing objects : 100 % ( 2/2 ) , done .
Writing objects : 100 % ( 3/3 ) , 314 bytes , done .
Total 3 ( delta 1 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) To git@github.com :quirkey/jekyll_layouts.git 5013157..5726d5e master -> master

Chevy Chase , MD -- Researchers in China may have found a method for male contraception that is effective , reversible and without serious short - term adverse effects according to a new study accepted for publication in The Endocrine Society 's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism ( JCEM ) .
" For couples who can not , or prefer not to use only female - oriented contraception , options have been limited to vasectomy , condom and withdrawal , " said Dr. Yi-Qun Gu , MD , of the National Research Institute for Family Planning in Beijing , China .
" Our study shows a male hormonal contraceptive regimen may be a potential , novel and workable alternative . "
Dr. Gu said this study is the largest multi-center , male hormonal contraceptive efficacy clinical trial of an androgen preparation in the world .
Participants included 1,045 healthy fertile Chinese men aged 20 - 45 years .
Each participant had fathered at least one child within the two years before the study and had a normal medical history .
Their female partners were between 18 and 38 years of age and had normal reproductive function .
Males were injected monthly with 500 mg of a formulation of testosterone undecanoate ( TU ) in tea seed oil for thirty months .
Results showed a cumulative contraceptive failure ( pregnancy ) rate of 1.1 per 100 men in the 24 - month efficacy phase .
No serious adverse events were reported and reproductive function returned to the normal fertile reference range in all but two participants .
" Despite the present encouraging results , the long - term safety of this hormonal male contraceptive regimen requires more extensive testing with a focus on cardiovascular , prostate and behavioral safety , " said Dr. Gu .

Tracy Ehrenberg , general manager of Pisces Sportfishing in Cabo San Lucas says the mysterious - looking fish caught off the Mexican coast May 19 aboard Minerva IV looks like " a seal , crossed with a baby marlin , that swallowed a chicken ... it has feet ! "
Scientists who have inspected photos have identified the specimen as a ratfish , or a chimaera .
However , there are different types of chimaeras and it's not clear which type this is or whether it might be a type new to science .
Scientists at Moss Landing Marine Labs in Monterey believe , based on the accompanying photograph , that it 's a black chimaera .
The bizarre - looking creature , which does have what looks like feet and little toes , is stored in a freezer at Pisces but soon will be under study in La Paz .
" None of the local fisherman had any idea of what it was , not even those that have spent their whole lives on the sea , " Ehrenberg says .
Ratfish are deep - water denizens that bottom - feed on small invertebrates .
But the fish at Pisces was plucked from the surface 11 miles south of Cabo San Lucas after it had been spotted unsuccessfully trying to dive .
It perished in the bait receiver on the trip to port .

After all , there 's a few arbitrary sci- fi rules that seem to turn up in all of these movies and , quite frankly , it 's time to move on .
With the rebirth of the Star Trek franchise , sci - fi is a cash cow again .
And while studios all over Hollywood are busy building model space ships and robots , we 'd like them to pause for a moment and , you know , give the scripts a look .
6 The Ship is an OSHA Nightmare
Two starships meet for battle and open fire .
A photon plasma space torpedo slams into the hull .
Inside , on the bridge , we watch as the whole room shakes , throwing the cast around like rag dolls .
A second impact causes sparks to fly from the control panels , possibly even killing an extra .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The battered crew can only wonder why , on a ship that has technology in place to keep them from getting splattered against the rear wall when it jumps to light speed ( or stops suddenly ) , every impact shakes their world like a kid rattling a Christmas present .
Why They Need To Stop :
We know why they do it .
It 's a way to add an element of danger for the main characters .
That tends to get diluted if they 're sitting comfortably on the bridge while the battle goes on in their view screen .
But no matter how far into the future you set your film , if the cable guy can keep our TV from exploding when lightning strikes the house , why does this futuristic spaceship have a panel blow every time anything remotely interesting happens on the ship ?
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
And more to the point , why is the crew in an exposed spot at all ?
Sure , there are those ships ( like most in Star Wars ) that have windows , but , why do they need them ?
That 's what view screens are for .
Nobody is trying to navigate that bastard by squinting at the next planet through a dirty windshield .
Look at the protruding command towers on the Star Wars Star Destroyers -- at least once we see a fighter smash into their window , causing the whole damned ship to crash .
And if the bridge does n't have windows ( as it does n't in Star Trek ) , then why in the hell does it need to be in some exposed spot where any random object can destroy it ?
Why not bury it in the middle of the ship , with layers of metal between the guys at the wheel and all of the exploding warp phaser missiles outside ?

Do n't tell us we 're over - thinking this , damnit !
That 's what sci- fi is for , to make us feel smarter than people watching other movies .
Courgette landed in the Chromium tree a while ago but there 's been no announcement , so here 's my basic understanding .
Chrome likes to rapidly push out small updates .
The obvious way — in fact the Debian way * — is to force a redownload of the whole multi-megabyte package .
Better is to send down diffs .
For random binary blobs , the state of the art is xdelta .
( Random fun fact : Josh , the xdelta author , is coincidentally one the original authors of GTK + and a longtime Googler . )
Even better is to send down diffs that are smart about what you 're diffing : bsdiff " tak[es ] advantage of how executable files change " .
This is what Chrome currently uses for updates , but they 're still a bit on the chubby side .
Why ?
It turns out that when you make a minor patch ( say an extra NULL - check somewhere ) that ends up shifting all following code .
Any addresses ( jumps ) contained in the resulting binary will have their values slightly changed , which means you have lots of integers to adjust throughout your diff .
Imagine software ( not us yet , surely ) that has hundreds of millions of users ; pushing out a 500k update to 100 m users is 50 terabytes of transfer .
mbsdiff.cc , the core of the bsdiff implementation in the Chrome tree , is a succinct 382 lines of code .
Can you do better if you 're willing to work harder ?
Enter courgette .
From a comment :
//
The main idea in Courgette is to do patching * under a // tranformation * .
The input is transformed into a new representation , // patching occurs in the new representation , and then the transform is // reversed to get the patched data .
Conceptually , given an executable , you disassemble the executable into a simplified stream of instruction - like bits that use labels instead of addresses .
Then you can compute a patch between these abstracted programs , which does n't need to mention most of the labels that do n't change .
With a source binary and a patch , you construct the target binary by disassembling the source , patching the abstract representation , then reassembling into the destination .
I believe the disassembling / assembling process is n't intended to be perfect .
x86 and compilers are complicated so the patch - generated output is n't quite identical to the target executable .
So you also include a bsdiff'd patch alongside to fix up the final details .
Courgette incorporates this idea of multi-pass patching into its design .
It only supports Windows x86 for now , but other formats are surely not hard to implement .
It seems to me that the basic idea ought to work for other file formats as well — I imagine , for example , making a delta format that knew about . po files or knew to unzip embedded . jar files and recursively delta their contents .
But now you know about as much about this I do ; go read the source for more .
* More discussion of the various package deltaing available on Debian and Redhat for another post sometime .
I am mostly sad about the lack of it , so please mail me good news before I embarrass myself about something I do n't know about .
Government sets up crude strawman by claiming London Telegraph is lying , when they were merely quoting the military ’s own appointed investigator into the torture scandal , whose report confirmed that rape of women and children took place
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , May 28 , 2009
The White House and the Pentagon have ridiculously denied the facts of their own internal military investigation by claiming that photos taken at Abu Ghraib and other detention facilities do not show prison guards raping women and children , in a continuation of the Obama administration ’s zealous mission to protect the perpetrators of the Bush torture program who broke national and international law .
As we reported earlier today , in an interview with the London Telegraph , Major General Antonio Taguba , the former army officer who conducted an inquiry into the Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq , confirmed the details of his original army report , that the unreleased photos showed rape and sexual abuse of women and minors .
“ At least one picture shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee , ” reports the Telegraph , adding , “ Further photographs are said to depict sexual assaults on prisoners with objects including a truncheon , wire and a phosphorescent tube . ”
Taguba also verified the credibility of eyewitness statements from other detainees that described an American - Egyptian male translator in uniform raping teenage boys .
“ These pictures show torture , abuse , rape and every indecency , ” Taguba told the Telegraph .
Taguba was only reiterating the results of a 2004 military investigation into the torture scandal , which he was appointed to undertake by CENTCOM , and yet the Pentagon and the White House have today laughably attempted to deny the facts of their own internal investigation .
The government is trying to pull off a crude bait and switch ploy in claiming that certain photos they considered for release but decided to keep private do not show the rape of women and children .
The facts of Taguba ’s military report detail that rapes did occur and they were photographed by other prison guards .
By claiming that a certain restricted selection of photos do not show rape , the government is trying to enforce the notion that no rapes occurred whatsoever .
They are also setting up a strawman argument by blaming British newspapers and in particular the London Telegraph for falsely reporting that the photos show rape , without mentioning the fact that the newspapers are merely reporting what the military ’s own investigator , U.S. Army Major General Antonio Taguba , told them was in the official military report into the torture scandal .
It ’s a crude con game that a 5 - year - old could pull apart .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Daily Telegraph newspaper had shown “ an inability to get the facts right , ” reports Reuters .
How can they get the facts wrong when they are merely relaying what CENTCOM ’s own appointed investigator told them ?
“ That news organization has completely mischaracterized the images , ” Whitman told reporters .
“ None of the photos in question depict the images that are described in that article . ”
Again , in framing the issue in this context , the Pentagon is attempting to absolve itself and discredit the fact that U.S. prison guards did rape women and minors , a subject that is only now getting wide coverage , much to the chagrin of the criminally complicit Obama administration , despite it being explained in black and white in Taguba ’s military report over five years ago .
Taguba merely confirmed to the Telegraph what was in his original report , eyewitness statements from other detainees that described an American - Egyptian male translator in uniform raping teenage boys , while others took pictures .
Among the graphic statements , which were later released under US freedom of information laws , is that of Kasim Mehaddi Hilas in which he says : “ I saw [ name of a translator ] ******* a kid , his age would be about 15 to 18 years .
The kid was hurting very bad and they covered all the doors with sheets .
Then when I heard screaming I climbed the door because on top it was n’t covered and I saw [ name ] who was wearing the military uniform , putting his **** in the little kid ’s ***…. and the female soldier was taking pictures . ”
Further details were also made public by New Yorker investigative journalist Seymour Hersh , who in July 2004 told an ACLU conference ,
“ Some of the worst things that happened you do n’t know about , okay ? ” said Hersh .
“ Videos , there are women there .
Some of you may have read that they were passing letters out , communications out to their men .
This is at Abu Ghraib …
The women were passing messages out saying ‘ Please come and kill me , because of what ’s happened ’ and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys , children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
And the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror .
It ’s going to come out . ”
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs similarly chastised the Telegraph for quoting the military ’s own investigator , stating that the “ article is wrong and mischaracterizes the photos that are in question . ”
Asked if he had actually seen the photos , Gibbs replied , “ I have not seen the photos , ” proving that his phony righteousness was not based on reality but what he had been told to say by his bosses .
In perpetrating this charade , the Obama White House is merely advancing its mission to protect Bush officials and CIA agents from prosecution for torture and sexual abuse .
As we have discovered , this is because top Democrats like Nancy Pelosi are complicit in the illegal torture program because they gave their approval for it to be instituted in the first place .

It ’s tough being a conservative politician right now .
You ca n’t really run on the conservative record of fiscal restraint , and ( formerly hot - button ) social issues only work with a shrinking number of Americans .
So what ’s the safe thing to run on ?
One possibility that we are seeing more of is to be against anything that the “ liberals ” are for .
Even if being against it does n’t make sense , and even if you used to be for it .
For example , last year Ezra Klein wondered about the GOP ’s sudden and baffling affection for “ Drill Baby Drill “ .
The McCain campaign pushed the “ Drill Baby Drill ” rhetoric , even though he had previously been opposed to offshore drilling , and despite the fact that it would n’t actually solve our energy problems .
Why ?
Klein notes that “ Drilling may not work to solve our oil prices or bring down costs , but liberals really hate drilling , and that ’s enough . ”
Atrios noticed the same thing :
It ’s long been the case that what really gets the Republican base excited is anything that pisses off liberals .
There are genuine policy differences , of course , but to get an audience of Republicans on their feet and cheering you need to mention something , no matter how pointless , which pisses off liberals .
It ’s the glue that keeps them together .
Over at Redstate , conservative bloggers were encouraging readers to protest the recent “ Earth Hour ” by using lots of extra energy , who responded with assorted descriptions of switching on the TV but not watching it , excessive baking , and turning on every light switch in the house :
I turned our closet lights on too .
My husband laughed at me and said no one would see them .
I said I did n’t care , I felt good because I KNEW they were on .
What in the world would possess people to spend their own money wasting energy ?
Because it pisses off liberals !
LMAO about the fact that I cancelled out about 3 Greenies sitting in the dark !
August Pollak points out that this explains a lot .
It is why “ Joe the Plumber ” exists .
He actually hurt the Republican party , but they loved him anyway because he pissed off liberals .
Same thing for Ann Coulter , who makes millions of dollars simply because she pisses off liberals .
They could n’t care less that she ’s a complete whack job .
Indeed , one of the biggest selling points of Hummers is that owning one will piss off liberals .
Is n’t that worth all the extra money ?

Yesterday , both Apple and Microsoft issued whopper security patches .
The way they were handled shows that Apple has a lot to learn from Microsoft about security .
Here are the four most important ones .
Patch it faster
As this latest patch shows , Apple is very slow at fixing security problems with Mac OS X .
Two of the security problems were big ones , uncovered in March at the " Pwn2Own " annual hacking contest sponsored by 3Com 's TippingPoint .
Waiting two months to fix the problems is simply too long .
On March 27 , Mozilla fixed the security problem found with Firefox .
And it turns out that the version of Internet Explorer 8 hacked at the conference was n't final , and the final version of IE 8 was n't vulnerable .
The Apple patch fixed a total of 67 bugs .
The Microsoft one fixed only 14 .
The reason ?
Microsoft issues these patches regularly , so they 're out the door as quickly as possible .
Apple waits far longer , and issues them in a bigger batch .
According to Computerworld , many of the patches were related to Open Source applications or components integrated with Mac OS X , such as Apache Web server and the WebKit browser rendering engine .
Andrew Storms , director of security operations at nCircle Network Security , said that he had seen patches for those security holes issued for Linux nearly half a year ago in December .
Yet Apple waited until May to fix them .
Storms also said that Apple should follow the way that Microsoft issues patches more frequently .
Here 's what he told Computerworld about Apple waiting longer than Microsoft to issue patches :
" Microsoft , which historically has had the view of producing the less - secure operating system , puts out one bulletin today , with 14 vulnerabilities .
And Apple comes out with [ an update with ] 67 bugs ,
It 's a ' I coulda had a V8 ' moment , where you slap your forehead .
It 's like history changed in front of my eyes . "
Be transparent
Microsoft assigns a threat ranking to security bugs .
So does Oracle .
Apple does n't .
One of the most important tools in the fight for computer safety is knowledge .
As long as Apple refuses to embrace that , it wo n't be helping as much as it should to keep its users safe .
It should follow the lead of Microsoft and other companies , and start ranking security bugs .
Offer enterprise security tools
Computerworld notes that Storms complained about " the lack of business - grade management tools and the paucity of information that Apple provides about the bugs and the ensuing patches . "
He told the newspaper that because of that :
" Macs really still are n't an enterprise tool , even though Apple 's marketing likes to say that they are , and that they 're used in enterprises . "
Take security seriously
For a long time , there 's been a myth that Macs are invulnerable to hacks , Trojans , and other dangers .
That 's certainly not the case .
Recently , for example , a Trojan was found to infect Macs and created a botnet .
In addition , several security researchers have said that Macs are less secure than Windows or Linux .
Apple likes to use the myth of Mac invulnerability as a selling point , which is why it does n't take security as seriously as it should .
It 's time for Apple to follow the lead of Microsoft , and finally focus more seriously on security .
This story , " Microsoft Could Teach Apple a Lesson about Security " was originally published by Computerworld .

There 's nothing like a good legal dispute to force the world 's most reclusive author to come out of the shadows .
J.D. Salinger filed a lawsuit yesterday in New York District Court over an author 's planned sequel to " The Catcher in the Rye . "
Salinger says the book , titled " 60 Years Later : Coming Through the Rye , " authored by pseudonymous J.D. California , is " a rip - off pure and simple , " and violates the copyright on the original book and the character of Holden Caulfield .
Salinger wants publication enjoined and all copies destroyed .
What are Salinger 's chances of winning this case ?
Copyright protection on fictional characters can be extremely complex .
The first thing that any court will look at is the originality of the claimed character .
Is Holden Caulfield original enough to merit copyright protection ?
Next , a court might review how the new Caulfield differs from the original and whether the character 's presence in the new book is protected fair use , such as parody .
In the lawsuit , Salinger claims that no parody is involved and there 's really no difference in the characterization .
The complaint quotes J.D. California 's description of his book : " Just like the first novel , he leaves , but this time he's not at a prep school , he 's at a retirement home in upstate New York ...
It 's pretty much like the first book in that he roams around the city , inside himself and his past . "
Character stealing and unauthorized sequels are not unprecedented .
For example , check out this 2001 opinion by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals over the character of James Bond — the violent and alcoholic Bond of the Ian Fleming books versus the Bond that most people are familiar with in the movies .
The plaintiff was one of the collaborators on the screenplay to " Thunderball " and claimed he transformed the title character and had a stake .
( The Ninth Circuit ruled that he had waited too long to claim his piece of the pie . )
The Salinger case could be interesting .
Maybe the greatest mystery of all will be whether the author himself shows up to any of the proceedings .
Perhaps he 'll only give a deposition , like he did in a 1987 lawsuit against Random House that successfully blocked publication of a biography that contained some of his letters .
We envy Marcia Paul of Davis Wright & Tremaine who represents Salinger and will presumably get to ask him a lot of interesting questions about " The Catcher in the Rye . "
According to some sources at Loot , Sony is poised to release a Machinima Utility for PlayStation Home .
The reports say this could be realized within a couple of weeks .
The developer of the project wanted to combine the best aspects of home : social activity and interactive experiences .
Perhaps this will be a bit of a pre-E3 surprise , but until then we will have to file this under rumor .
The video below pretty much confirms this !
Instead of making a traditional game , or even an ARG ( which is the way a lot of Home development was going ) , we wanted to make something that would really encourage the player to get together with their friends and have some fun .
Being spawned from a movie company , it is pretty easy to see how we were inspired to make a movie stage / set .
It ’s really cool to walk through the lot every day and peek inside the huge stages , so we figured that other people would be psyched to have their own stage and even make some movies , too .
After that , we went crazy putting all sorts of lighting and camera controls , green screens , backdrops , etc in the limited amount of time we had .

March 16 , 2009 Butternut Squash and Mascarpone Ravioli with Hazelnut Brown Butter by Jennifer Pallian BSc , RD
0 0 vote Article Rating
Mother nature is having a no-holds - barred temper tantrum outside my apartment .
The rain is pelting down so hard that the windows are trembling in their frames .
And the wind is thrashing so violently that it sounds like there ’s a tornado brewing in our chimney .
Hence the need for a dinner that doubles as a warm hug .
Enter brown butter drizzled over homemade squash ravioli .
Butternut squash is one of my favorite vegetables .
Mashed , I love its thick , starchy texture – it is sweet , subtle , creamy and comforting .
I equally love it cubed and roasted , then tossed with goat cheese in a pasta .
Or pureed with a touch of cream to make a simple and delicious soup .
Not to mention its starring role in baked goods like muffins .
Also , a butternut squash packs a lot more flesh than other squash varieties due to its shape .
It has only a small cavity with seeds in the knob at the base , and the entire length is solid and edible .
In need of a comfort food to take the chill out of the howling wind , I opted for roasting a squash as a filling for chewy , homemade pasta .
I started by baking the butternut squash in the oven till it softened and caramelized – always a surefire way to warm your belly and your heart .
I mashed the soft squash with some fresh sage and mascarpone to make creamy filling for some homemade ravioli .
I rolled out some long sheets of fresh pasta , and studded it with teaspoonfuls of the squash mixture .
A little bit of folding , snipping , and a crimp here and there , and ta da !
The brown - sugary sweetness of the squash pairs beautifully with a simple brown butter sauce , with some chopped , toasted hazelnuts adding crunch .
Some freshly shaved , nutty Parmigiano - Reggiano finished it perfectly .
Let the storm rage on , just gimme a warm brown - butter hug with some toothsome fresh pasta and creamy squash .
Butternut Squash and Mascarpone Ravioli with Hazelnut Brown Butter Print Recipe Pin Recipe Author : Jennifer Pallian BSc , RD Ingredients For Fresh Pasta 2 1/4 cups unbleached all - purpose flour
plus more as needed
3 eggs lightly beaten
Flour for dusting For Butternut Squash and Mascarpone Ravioli with Hazelnut Brown Butter 1 2 - lb butternut squash
2 tbsp olive oil divided
1 small onion diced
1 1/2 tbsp fresh sage leaves minced
4 oz mascarpone
salt and pepper to taste
4 tbsp butter
2 tbsp chicken stock
1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
Parmigiano - Reggiano optional Instructions For Fresh Pasta
Place the 2 1/4 cups flour in a mound on a work surface .
Make a well in the center large enough to hold the beaten eggs and pour the eggs into the well .
Using a fork , begin gradually incorporating some of the flour from the sides , taking care not to break the flour wall .
When the eggs are no longer runny , you can stop worrying about the wall .
Continue working in more flour until the dough is no longer wet .
Begin kneading the dough by hand , adding as much additional all - purpose flour as needed until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky , 3 to 5 minutes .
Dust baking sheets with flour .
Divide the dough in half .
Keep one half on the work surface , covered with a kitchen towel to prevent it from drying .
Set up your pasta machine alongside another work surface .
Lightly flour the work surface with some of the reserved sieved flour .
Using a rolling pin , flatten the other dough half into a rectangle thin enough to go through the rollers at the widest setting .
Pass the dough through the rollers once , then lay the resulting ribbon down on the work surface and flour it lightly .
Fold into thirds lengthwise to make a rectangle and flour both sides lightly .
Flatten the dough with the rolling pin until it is thin enough to go through the rollers again .
With one of the two open edges going first , pass the dough through the rollers nine more times at the widest setting ; after each time , flour , fold and flatten the dough as described .
After 10 trips through the wide rollers , the dough should be completely smooth and supple .
Now you are ready to thin the dough .
Starting at the second - to - widest setting , pass the dough through the rollers repeatedly , setting the rollers one notch narrower each time .
When the pasta ribbon gets unwieldy , cut it in half and continue rolling one part at a time until the dough reaches the desired thinness .
Arrange the finished pasta sheets on the prepared baking sheets and cover with kitchen towels to prevent drying .
Repeat the entire process with the second half of dough .
For Butternut Squash and Mascarpone Ravioli with Hazelnut Brown Butter Preheat oven to 400 degrees .
Cut squash in half , remove seeds , and drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil .
Place flesh side down on baking sheet , and bake until very soft , about 40 minutes .
In a dry pan over medium heat , lightly toast chopped hazelnuts .
Set aside .
In the same pan , add remaining tablespoon of olive oil , and cook onion with sage until soft and golden .
Scoop flesh from cooked squash , and add to onion mixture and mash together .
Allow to cool slightly , then add mascarpone and combine .
Season with salt and pepper to taste .
Drop teaspoonfuls of squash mixture about an inch apart the length of a sheet of pasta .
Fold pasta over filling , and use dampened fingers to seal the entire length .
Press pasta down around all sides of filling to seal .
Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the pasta into squares of equal size , each with a dollop of filling in the center .
Fold the cut edges under , around all four sides of ravioli .
Use a fork to crimp and seal .
Repeat with remaining pasta sheet .
Drop ravioli into a pot of gently boiling water and cook until they are tender , and rise to the surface ( about 7 minutes ) .
Heat butter and hazelnuts in a pan over medium heat until butter browns .
Add broth , and remove from heat .
Drizzle brown butter sauce over ravioli on plate , and top with * shaved Parmigiano - Reggiano , if desired .
* A vegetable peeler works great to make shavings and curls .

Advertisement Nearly 70 people have been killed by a bomb blast in the eastern Sadr City area of Baghdad , Iraqi officials say .
Police said the device went off in a market place in the predominantly Shia area of the Iraqi capital .
More than 130 people were also reported to have been injured in the blast , one of the worst in Iraq this year .
It comes less than a week before US soldiers pull out of all Iraqi cities , a move the US said would not be affected by a recent surge in violence .
' Horrific '
An interior ministry official told the AFP news agency the blast struck the market place at about 1930 ( 1630 GMT ) .
I saw cars flying in the air because of the force of the explosion
Najim Ali , eyewitness
The official said the bomb was hidden underneath a motorised cart carrying vegetables for sale .
" I heard a boom and saw a ball of fire , " said Najim Ali , a 30 - year - old father who was injured in the blast .
" I saw cars flying in the air because of the force of the explosion , " he was quoted as saying by AFP .
Raad Latif , a local shop owner , said the scene after the blast was " horrific " .
He said people ran to help the injured after hearing the explosion but were initially kept back as security forces tried to get emergency vehicles to the scene .
" After a while they came to their senses and allowed us to help as much as we could .
The scene was horrific , " he told Reuters .
Another witness told the Associated Press news agency he heard a sound like " unbelievable thunder " and was knocked to the ground by " a hurricane " .
Market stalls were set on fire and an official told AP that people standing 600 m away were hit by shrapnel .
' Confident ' Under an agreement with the Iraqi authorities , most of the 133,000 US troops in Iraq are due to leave the country 's cities and towns and withdraw to military bases by 30 June .
Combat operations across Iraq are due to end by September 2010 and all US troops will be out of the country by the end of 2011 .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the top US commander in the country , Gen Ray Odierno , had told President Barack Obama that he felt " confident in moving forward " with the withdrawal .
" Gen Odierno has mentioned that we have seen violence greatly decrease even in the past many months from what it was , " he said .
Mr Gibbs said Mr Obama had no plans to change the withdrawal arrangements .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says the location of the latest blast was significant , as Sadr City has been struck often and provocatively in the past .
The attacks have been attributed to Sunni militants ' attempts to provoke sectarian tensions .
US troops are due to withdraw from Iraqi cities by the end of June But this tactic has failed since the Shia Mehdi militia , which used to retaliate , was disbanded last year , says our correspondent , and the attacks now only succeed in killing civilians .
The attacks are the latest in a violent week in Iraq .
On Monday , at least 29 people were killed in attacks in Baghdad and elsewhere .
Three people , including a four - year - old child , were killed in the Shaab district of north Baghdad , while a car bomb killed five people in the capital 's central Karrada district .
In the largest attack of the year , more than 70 people died in a truck bombing in Kirkuk on Saturday .
But Iraq 's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has said the violence will not delay the withdrawal which , he said , would ultimately be a triumph for the country .
He urged Iraqis : " Do n't lose heart if a breach of security occurs here or there . "

Another remote hacker threat has arisen , and this time it affects popular streaming media tool DirectX .
Microsoft announced yesterday that it is currently working on a fix for the security exploit , which could allow someone to take total control of a system by using malicious QuickTime video files .
DirectX Exploit : Affected Users
The exploit involves Microsoft 's audio / video sourcing / rendering software DirectShow and the way it handles the QuickTime format files it supports .
Users of Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 , Windows Server 2003 , and Windows XP are those most affected and will want to keep on the lookout for Microsoft 's patch when it becomes available .
Those running Windows Vista or Microsoft 's Windows Server 2008 are lucky ; the company has announced that these two systems are not vulnerable to attack .
( Source : crn.com )
How Does The Attack Work ?
Like many Internet schemes , the attack hinges on convincing a user to visit a malicious web site hosting the exploit .
If the exploit is used successfully , a hacker could gain user rights at the same level as a system 's rightful owner .
In a statement by its security advisory , Microsoft admitted that it was " aware of limited , active attacks that use this exploit code . "
" If a user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system .
An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data , or create new accounts with full user rights . "

Workaround Available
Although Microsoft is still working on a more complete solution to the issue , it has released details for a workaround , which you can see by visiting the MS Knowledge base site :

Rescuers in Warren County removed the last of four hikers injured tonight when lightning struck nearby during a severe thunderstorm in Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area .
Three had been removed from the Appalachian Trail in Worthington State Forest by 7:30 p.m. ; a fourth hiker with a head wound also was taken off the mountain , said Deb Nordeen , a public information officer with the National Park Service .
Rescuers reached the group at 6:15 p.m. , about an hour after the National Park Service 's emergency communications center received a report of the lightning strike .
The four injured were among a larger group of nine people from the Lansdale , Pa. , area who had been hiking the trail , Nordeen said .
Nordeen said she was uncertain of the extent of the injuries or the ages of those involved .
Two men and two women were hurt .
They were about a mile south of Sunfish Pond in Hardwick Township , which is about two to three miles from the Pennsylvania line .
All were conscious when rescuers reached the group , Nordeen said .
Initially , two of the hikers were unable to speak but became mobile and communicative by the time they left the mountain , she said
Rescuers used a Gator -- an ATV with a utility bed -- to remove three of the victims ; the fourth was carried out with a Stokes basket , Nordeen said .
All were taken to Pocono Medical Center .
A nursing supervisor tonight said she could n't release any patient information .
The lightning strike came during a severe storm that hammered parts of Northampton , Monroe and Warren counties for the second straight day .
The storm brought down tree limbs and wires across much of the region .
It 's hard to believe that this video is real , but apparently it is .
What you are seeing is the official , MPAA sanctioned method for teachers to make copies of DVDs for educational purposes .
Are you ready ?
To make a copy you play the DVD and aim a camera at the TV screen .
I told you it was hard to swallow .
So desperate is the movie industry 's crazy uncle to stop anyone breaking DVD copy protection that it actually made the above presentation at the Library of Congress , where a hearing is held every three years to decide whether or not any exemptions should be made to the DMCA laws .
Needless to say , it 's already too late ( cough , Handbrake , cough ) , and this is clearly just an attempt to protect the DMCA in its current form rather than to actually stop teachers from copying movies .
What we find particularly ironic , though , is that this is the exact same method that the MPAA wants to stop in cinemas , where evil teenagers use their cellphones to record movies off the screen .

Where the Law Stands on E - Waste

On the outskirts of Ghana 's biggest city sits a smoldering wasteland , a slum carved into the banks of the Korle Lagoon , one of the most polluted bodies of water on earth .
The locals call it Sodom and Gomorrah .
Correspondent Peter Klein and a group of graduate journalism students from the University of British Columbia have come here as part of a global investigation -- to track a shadowy industry that 's causing big problems here and around the world .
Their guide is a 13 - year - old boy named Alex .
He shows them his home , a small room in a mass of shanty dwellings , and offers to take them across a dead river to a notorious area called Agbogbloshie .
Agbogbloshie has become one of the world 's digital dumping grounds , where the West 's electronic waste , or e-waste , piles up -- hundreds of millions of tons of it each year .
The team meets with Mike Anane , a local journalist who has been writing about the boys at this e-waste dump .
“ Life is really difficult ; they eat here , surrounded by e-waste , ” Anane tells them .
“ They basically are here to earn a living .
But you can imagine the health implications . ”
Some of the boys burn old foam on top of computers to melt away the plastic , leaving behind scraps of copper and iron they can collect to sell .
The younger boys use magnets from old speakers to gather up the smaller pieces left behind at the burn site .
Anane says he used to play soccer here as a kid , when it was pristine wetland .
Since then , he 's become one of the country 's leading environmental journalists .
“ I 'm trying to get some ownership labels , ” Anane tells reporters .
“ I 'm collecting them because you need them as evidence .
You need to tell the world where these things are coming from .
You have to prove it .
Now , just look , ” he says , pointing to an old computer with the label : “ School District of Philadelphia . ”
When containers of old computers first began arriving in West Africa a few years ago , Ghanaians welcomed what they thought were donations to help bridge the digital divide .
But soon exporters learned to exploit the loopholes by labeling junk computers " donations , " leaving men like Godson to sort it out .
Godson , one of the e-waste dealers who have set up shop close to the port , shows the contents of the container he has bought .
“ Some are from Germany and the U.K. , and also from America , ” he says , when asked where the equipment has come from .
He sorts through them looking for working electronics that can be sold .
He says that maybe 50 percent of the shipment is junk and the rest he will be able to salvage in some way .
After it ’s sorted , a lot of the contents of the container will still be dumped at the burn site outside of town .
Hard drives that can be salvaged are displayed at open - air markets .
Off camera , Ghanaians admit that organized criminals sometimes comb through these drives for personal information to use in scams .
As part of the investigation , one of the students buys a number of hard drives to see what is on them , secretly filming the transaction to avoid the seller 's suspicions .
The drives are purchased for the equivalent of US $ 35 .
The students take the hard drives to Regent University in the Ghanaian capital and ask computer scientist Enoch Kwesi Messiah to help read what is on them .
Within minutes , he is scrolling through intimate details of people 's lives , files left behind by the hard drives ' original owners .
There is private financial data , too : credit card numbers , account information , records of online transactions the original owners may not have realized were even there .
“ I can get your bank numbers and I retrieve all your money from your accounts , ” Messiah says .
“ If ever somebody gets your hard drive , he can get every information about you from the drive , no matter where it is hidden . ”
That 's particularly a problem in a place like Ghana , which is listed by the U.S. State Department as one of the top sources of cyber crime in the world .
And it 's not just individuals who are exposed .
One of the drives the team has purchased contains a $ 22 million government contract .
It turns out the drive came from Northrop Grumman , one of America 's largest military contractors .
And it contains details about sensitive , multi-million dollar U.S. government contracts .
They also find contracts with the defense intelligence agency , NASA , even Homeland Security .
When the drives ’ data are shown to James Durie , who works on data security for the FBI , he 's particularly concerned about the potential breach at the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) .
“ The government contracting process is supposed to be confidential .
If I know how you 're hiring the people for security related job , TSA air marshals , then I can prepare a person to fit that model and get my guy in , ” Durie says .
“ Once I have my guy in , you have no security . ” Northrop Grumman refused to speak to FRONTLINE / World on camera .
But they did issue a statement saying the potential security threat was disconcerting , and they pledged to investigate .
Right now there are no tough U.S. laws regulating the disposal of e-waste , leaving companies and consumers to sort out the claims of recyclers on their own .
Following the recycling process as a consumer would , students drop off some e-waste at a facility on America ’s West Coast .
They are wearing a hidden camera and are assured that what they are bringing in will be disposed of safely and locally .
One worker at the facility tells them : “ What they literally do is dump it into a blast furnace and it burns it all up ; and all they get out of it is a bunch of ash and some of the precious metal .
Everything else gets consumed , burnt .
And that 's an actual fact . ”
The team notes the container numbers leaving the facility and , using public records , traces where they 're sent .
A few weeks later , their reporting takes them to the port of Hong Kong .
Just a few miles from Hong Kong ’s port , hidden behind eight - foot - high corrugated walls , are mountains of computer monitors , printer cartridges from Georgia , relics of old video arcades …
In China , e-waste has become big business .
The southern Chinese city of Guiyu has been completely built around the e-waste trade .
Miles and miles of nothing but old electronics .
Jim Puckett is an environmental activist credited with discovering this harmful e-waste route to China .
He has accompanied the team to Guiyu , a place he first visited eight years ago , and calls it the dirty little secret of the hi-tech industry .
Video Puckett shot in 2001 was the first anyone had documented showing Western computers being dumped in Guiyu .
He found tens of thousands of people working here in the toxic trade .
On this return visit , Puckett says things have gotten worse .
“ I was there first in 2001 and it was shocking enough then .
It had gone from very bad to really horrific .
And what is happening there is rather apocalyptic . ”
One of the most disturbing things Puckett points out is happening behind closed doors .
Women literally cooking circuit boards to salvage the computer chips , which have trace amounts of gold .
“ All these old mother boards and other types of circuit boards are being cooked day in and day out , mostly by women , sitting there , breathing the lead tin solders .
It ’s just quite devastating , ” Puckett says .
To find out who is making money off this hazardous work , the team travels to downtown Hong Kong , home to hundreds of companies that import e-waste into China .
No one here will speak to the reporters on camera , so they film surreptitiously .
Puckett and one of our reporters arrange to meet an e-waste broker willing to explain the e-waste trade from the inside .
The man explains how hundreds of thousands of tons of American e-waste makes its way into China , despite laws intended to stop it .
“ If we were to send you our material , would our recyclers get in trouble with the Chinese government if they find their material coming into mainland ? ”
Puckett asks the broker .
“ I can only say that if they get caught it has nothing to do with you .
Because I buy from you , and then I sell to him .
He is buying from me ; he 's not buying from you , ” the man explains .
He says that since Hong Kong ships millions of containers to the U.S. and most return empty , it 's cheap to load them with e-waste , and too expensive to dispose of the waste safely -- no matter what recyclers claim .
When the reporters ask what sort of due environmental due diligence there is , the man responds : “ I can only say one thing , if you want to do it environmentally , you have to pay .
They have to invest in machinery , labor , everything .
It is n’t worth it to pay so much money . ”
On the last trip of the assignment , the team heads to India .
No longer just a dumping ground , India is now generating its own e-waste at an alarming rate , thanks to a growing middle class with a taste for high tech .
“ Last year , we sold more than seven million PCs in India , ” says Indian businessman Rohan Gupta .
“ We generated 330,000 tons of electronic waste within India .
So all these are going to comeback to the waste stream sooner or later .
It ’s a growing industry . ”
Gupta is giving a tour of his state - of - the - art facility outside Bangalore .
He is betting on a new Indian law that could force its high tech industry to recycle responsibly and maybe one day put the digital dumps out of business .
At another recycling plant in Bangalore , they are literally trying to spin the waste into gold , refining the scrap in a safe environment and fashioning it into watches and jewelry they market as eco friendly .
Plants like this could become part of a global network of certified e-waste recyclers that Puckett 's group is trying to get off the ground .
But even Puckett realizes it 's an uphill struggle .
“ Even if you have a state - of - the - art facility in a country like India , the free market there will send it to the lowest common denominator , to the worst facilities where people are sitting on the streets just picking through it by hand , ” he says .
“ It ’s a myth to think that you can just solve the problem immediately with technology alone . ”

I 'm 17 years old and in the 11th grade i have a project on E - waste .
This video is a really hard thing to watch there are innocent
people who are dying and getting hurt because of our reactions , and what we are doing to their homes , and lands .
They must not realize how much damage
this is doing just not to their countries but on what it is doing to our ENVIRONMENT .
The U.S is not just killing them it is killing our PLANET , killing the animals our TREES and how we breathe .
People here in the U.S just need to relize they have to RECYCLE and help ourselves .
I do not want to DIE
just because our REACTIONS and how we treat people .
I 'm not going against our country I 'm going aggainst the E - waste dumping .
I feel so sorry for the people who are doing the work and trying to make a living with their family 's feeding there young children .
I feel sorry , instead of doing what we are doing I just want to see a change in things and a change to our ENVIRONMENT .
I wish I would have a chance in life to go and visit these places and ask those people on what they think .
They should have nice homes , hospitals , cars , clothing , and they should n't have polluted WATERS , and RIVERS .
They should just have as much as we do , they desserve as much as we do .
They help with our E - waste when we and our companies should be the ones handling our own issues .
Well I am finished on what I got to say I just hope that some day we would
change how we are treating the EARTH , our HOME were we all are ONE big happy FAMILY .. =)
Thanks for the opportunity for myself to speak out ad tell others on how I
truly feel about the whole situation .

Overall I liked the article ; however , here we go again .
The United States always seems to get the blame for the world 's problems .
I 'll believe it when I see it that Europe and Japan are handling the e-waste problem responsibly .
Just because laws are enacted does not mean they 're enforced .
And for those under developed countries :
Their governments strive to keep the masses poor and ignorant while lining their own pockets .
I 'll bet someone in those government gets a big kickback from those who are importing .
There 's obviously money to be made in the recycling business , especially when it 's corrupt .
Clean up the corruption first instead of imposing extra taxes and fees on consumers .
And allow honest recyclers the chance to carry out what needs to be done without severe and costly government intervention .

Watched your video on e-waste .
I always wondered what happens to all those old computers so now I know will tell everyone I know all
about this problem .
I 'm sure most people do n't know this problem exist , thanks for educating me .
Stockton , CA
This is crazy I never knew that this could happen to people .
It changes my opinion about even having a computer anymore .
The stuff they are doing with only a hard drive is disturbing .
Can they even do this ?
Did
they ask permission to get into those ?

Very informative documentary !
So we are the sacrifice for someone 's greed since the consequences will destroy the environment for the next generation of human beings .
I do not know of any law induced by government ( India ) to reduce the pollution without media and public groups immense pressure .
The governments should be doing this as part of their duty since Tax is paid by the citizens to safeguard them against such problems and it affects the majority of people .
In the name of development we can not afford to give cancer to every people in the country and then develop the medical and insurance industries ?
We are talking about E - waste , what about poly bags ?
It is used everywhere in India .

We think more people need to be made aware of what is happening in these developing nations .
As a class , we could n't believe this black market existed in the world .
The more people that learn of what is happening with the digital waste in developed countries , the more likely change can occur .
Countries like the United States , Great Britain , and Germany need to enact legislation , putting regulations in place to ensure our computer waste is disposed of more responsibly .

One thing we can do is incorporate e-waste into international hazardous waste law .
And the U.S. can ratify the Basel Convention , since we are currently hanging out with Haiti and Afghanistan as the only three Basel Convention signatories who never ratified it .
Consumers can keep demanding better producer responsibility for electronics disposal .
The EU 's electronics take - back programs are not without problems , but they definitely represent a step in the right direction .

Electronic waste the greater un - tapped energy source .
Most people do not realize for years that plastic the un-seen force , can be better recycled ( Melted ) into small fibers to make better cheaper insulation and fibers fused with other chemicals in process can have many benefits from Recycle .
All that small plastic foating in our oceans is a wasted Gold mine in New Plastic fibers Technologies .

Very sensationalist and uninformed .
You were saying women were breathing lead fumes from solder .
When did they start using lead free
solder on everything ?
It has been a while .
The files you found were probably old and garbage , not to say more modern stuff does n't show up :
What exactly can you do with CC and bank info .
from 2001 ?
The defense dept .
files were also probably very uninformative .
Nobody , even the FBI guy were seriously worried .
He had to come up with a hypothetical situation where the files COULD be a security breach .
The bigger problem
is you could see how much of your tax money they wasted .
None of you know ANYTHING about electronics / computers .
The ghanna computer
" scientist " did n't know you can securely erase things or just NOT put personal info .
on your computer ?
Storing your credit card info is MEGA stupid .
And like OH MY GOD !!!!
you can plug an HDD into a working computer and READ
THE DATA !
Somebody call the president !
Just deleting the files does n't really delete them !
Also , none of these places have a bulk eraser ?
Especially school districts
and Northrop Grumman ?

This program confirmed many of my suspicions regarding the often corrupted facade we like to call " recycling . "
But moreover I feel that I must respond to an earlier posting that I believe aims at the heart of this and probably every other stain on this planet as a result of the spread of western cultural influence .
This person simply posted , " God help our
children how they can live in this polluted world ??? ? "
The truth is like the program points out , they do n't have a choice .
If they did these poor people would certainly be elsewhere .
Moreover it sickens me to the core when I
read or hear from someone who seems to think that something is going to come down to earth or simply appear and through some invention or divine intervention we can all just keep living our comfortable lives however we want .
The troubling thing is that this could not be further from reality and I can tell just reading most of these folks reactions that they simply do n't get it .
I think that seeing it on an individual basis I am reminded of how self - absorbed we are as a so - called culture and society .
This makes me even
more sick knowing that after watching little kids in Ghana breathing in their old computer parts so they could stream Fox News and porno twice as fast , the most dis-concerning portion of the program was a less than half a minute section on how to destroy your hard - drive .
I guess to most folks that is what this video was about .
Never mind the title , or any other part of this important gruesome spotlight on the true values of western culture .
After
all , tomorrow we can all wake up and destroy our computers properly in time to get in line at Wal - Mart to buy an even better one .
We can even say that it's to celebrate Thanksgiving , yeah ... that sounds good !

I have heard that it is pointless to " recycle " unless you buy recycled .
I wonder if there is any recycled content in an I - Pod or a
Mac ?
From this report it is clear that unless you as a consumer create a market for recycled content goods , then there is n't going to be any economic
benefit down the line for anyone to safely recycle your old crap and it's
going to end up in the lungs and tissues and rivers of the people in this documentary .
I want to know what the people at HP , Dell , Motorola , Apple , IBM , Nokia , Toshiba , Sony , Panasonic , and all of their cohort are doing about this .
They are reaping the profits why can't they share in fixing the toxic legacy .
Most of toxins involved here ( metals , retardants , dioxins from
burning are persistant and bioaccumulative , meaning they do n't break down in the environment and end up in the food chain ) .
And , oh yeah , there 's global atmospheric impacts from the burning and incineration .
So you are also getting to drink and breathe a little bit of your old computer , too .
What about reuse ?
Reuse is about 100 times better than even the best recycling .
Pause before your next cell phone , computer , printer purchase and ask how
you have avoided being part of the problem .

So what do we do with computer manufacturers that claim their PC's are enviromentally friendly since they are constructed from aluminum and use acid free glass ?
I can assume they end up in the same e-waste locations shown on the video ?
If so , then the first generation of these manufacturing techniques are putting a bigger strain on the environment .
How do environmental societies and groups answer to that when we here in the US are prohibited from disposing of electronic waste .
Its too expensive startup e-waste business here , let alone the legislation necessary to foster jobs and infrastructure .
I just want to know that the next time some egg head wants to convince me their computer is better for the environment when it all seems to end up in
the same place .

I would / will pay a fee to have my electronics recycled in a sustainable way .
Why is n't it mandatory ?
I always donate my gear with a note taped to it stating whether it is working or not .
I include a cd with the appropriate drivers and I always overwrite the data on my hard drive .
It never ceases to disappoint me humanity 's inability to prioritize the long term over the short term .
When in the long term it is always the short term that costs more .

Its funny that a lot of people are surprise that it has been happening , when in fact back in the mainframe days before PC was though=
t of , these huge computers were being bought by the Taiwan agents living in the U.S. with their families and shipped over in containers back in the 70's .
They would be shipped both to Taiwan and China for recycling .
That 's where all the electronics and computers from the FAA went which turned one of own recyclers into a millionaire over night .
Even GSA property disposal was aware of what was happening .
The workers overseas would be paid anywhere from a couple dollars to eight dollars a day to tear apart the electronics for their boss .
A lot of the precious metal and circuits were put into new products and sent back to us .

This is an outrage that we have alowed such a breach of security to our nation I can just see an evil doer getting there hands on information that will kill as much as the pollution is going to kill life around the dumping grounds .

The biggest thing here is education - now I know , now I want to take action .
This was a very informative documentary and I appreciate Frontline for presenting such in - depth coverage .

I used to believe in the free market theory , although now I believe Noam Chomsky is right -- the free market is a myth .
Corporate lobbying and big money always turn the table in their favor , but we are only told we have a free market .
That said , I would have to drive an hour , and pay $ 35 from where I live to recycle an old computer .
That 's too big of a pain .
The free market is not doing a good enough job at making it so people can recycle electronics .
Each county or city should have a drop off facility to help people handle this problem .
Part of the problem may be we used to have a steel mill here , but it was closed down when tariffs were lifted on steel imports .
Hence , we have problems recycling our own metals .

What never ceases to amaze me is that people responsible for poisoning human beings in the name of maximizing profit are allowed to operate according to the law .

I share other viewers ' amazement at the carelessness implied throughout this stream of waste .
The " leaking " of data on old hard drives , the mishandling of toxic plastics , and the lack of governance all reflect a limited view of the world and our impacts upon it .
As noted by " anonymous " above , there is a tremendous power of inertia in situations that profit from our ignorance .
Clearly we need to address systemic issues of profit and poverty .
While this certainly should include educating would - be workers of the risks they face , we need to go further upstream , to the people and institutions who create these terrible risks for unprotected citizens of Ghana , China , and other nations .
Increasing regulations and improving oversight along the path of waste and recycling -- from pick - up to distribution to dumping -- is important .
Equally important is the concept of Producer Responsibility .
If electronics
were made to last longer , to be repairable , and to be recovered by the manufacturer when they wear out or are outdated , then there would be no inducement to ship e-waste overseas .
Designing for repair and for re-use is an old - fashioned notion , but will help solve a 21st century problem .
The main idea of Producer Responsibility is simple : " If you are smart enough to make it , you are smart enough to take it back . "
This sounds like what Laura 's group , Texas Campaign for the Environment , is advocating .
The State of California , too , is inching towards an " Extended Producer Responsibility " framework , but legislators need to hear many citizens ' voices to overcome the objections of industry .
California already requires " proper " disposal of e-waste , meaning that it cannot go to landfill .
But the costs for municipalities to recover all discarded electronics responsibly would exceed their current waste and recycling budgets .
As a result , taxpayers are shouldered with hidden after - costs of " inexpensive " electronics long after their purchase and disposal have been forgotten .
Producer
Take - back laws will put the responsibility back where it belongs : in the hands of the makers .
I work with Green Sangha in the SF Bay Area , where we are advocating a complete rethinking of plastics .
Zero Waste , Green Chemistry , and Extended Producer Responsibility are the kinds of thoughts we need to cultivate if we want to save our neighbors around the world from the pollution so vividly depicted in this excellent program on Frontline .

Below is a link you can use to contact your representatives in our U.S. Government .
( I e-mailed the President and then my elected offical here in Virginia )
Since the issue involves the economy , environment and homeland security , it seems that there is the potential for the issue to become legislation and thus become new public policy .
The question now involves the How .

This was an excellent piece for those who do not follow the law or , more importantly , the morally right way to dispose of e-waste .
You should do a show about the right way and the companies that at a high financial cost do recycle e-waste the right way .
This program did not bring that out at all .
Shanghai , China
It 's really one shocking video , not only for the risk of personal information leakage from the old hard drives , but also for the e-waste we generate everyday .
Even in the rural country side in China , now more and more families have e-waste , e.g. old mobile phones , old TV sets and even old computers .
They do n't know how to deal with the waste safely .
How to recycle this waste will be another big challenge for the government and the whole society .

Rich is not a term I would apply to myself , but when I see that the 3 monitors , 27 ink cartriges , 1 desk top computer and the 7 broken modems and graphics cards I sent to e-recycling could possibly end up ruining the personal health and homes of many in developing countries , I am ashamed .
We are still behaving like the rich profiting off the backs of the poor .
It is time to hold American industry accountable , by making them SHOW and CERTIFY recycling .
I applaude those who are doing the right thing ... for those others ... you are killing yourselves and your children along with the rest of us .

This video was very true however in my line of work the best way to solve this problem is to salvage and refurbish the equipment so that the third world countries can have affordable technology .
Equipment that cannot be salvaged should be smeltered correctly ; however this is very costly in the USA due to labor and environmental laws .
Get the EPA out of the way and let the free market develop the technology to do this responsibly .

Our lifestyles , businesses , industries , and way of thinking are using up and disposing of the waste at such an alarming rate that one must ask themselves , where does this end ?
If things are accelerating this fast now and we have barely made an attempt at evaluating changing our impact , then how will things play out 20 years from now ???
We are truly running to the edge of a cliff , blind folded .

So many of the topics that Frontline addresses through its shows are truly eye - opening .
Its astounding that so many of us have no idea what is happening outside of our US walls .
I think that by watching and at least being aware of these issues , such as the electronic waste that is occuring in our world , people will at least be more aware of the problems our world faces rather than be completely unaware .
So to all who watch Frontline and pay attention to these issues , do n't stop .

I just recently heard someone state that one of the biggest problems with the free market is that it does n't factor in peripheral costs ( social , environmental , systemic ) ... enterprises generally only factor in costs to themselves .
This seems like an example of an immense " cost " that was never fully considered .
Rome , Italy
I find it somewhat troubling that the main concern of the people posting comments here is more about their own personal data than the impact the industrial world is having on the rest of the world .
I fear that this is symptomatic of a greater problem of unaccountability of the developed world , which allows this sort of thing to happen .
There should be a greater awareness about the imact of all our waste on the rest of the world ... but thank you Frontline , this was very informative and I have spread the word .

The driving factor behind this is the ratio of labor value to equipment value .
Consumers in the northen hemisphere take no responsibility in recycling their own waste , because any value they would gain is tiny in comparison to their hourly wage and the time needed to make the effort .
In contrast , hourly wage is so low in 3rd world countries that recycling becomes an attractive business .
Sad as it is , the e-waste situation is not the problem , it is a symptom .
Poverty is the real problem , and the illusion of unlimited resources people hold in the ( so called ) developed world .
As long as human lives are cheap , and ignorant labor is plentiful , there will always be exploitation .
Educating the would - be e-waste work force so they can make an infomred decision on whether or not to endanger their lives ( or their children 's ) to make an income will be more effective than trying to force the hand of those who profit from their ignorance .
Law enforcement can always be circumvented with enough money -- a dwindling of profitability cannot .

There is a solution .
All e-scrap movment needs to be documented on a regulated manifest system just like hazardous waste is .
When was the last time you saw a video about illegal or harmful hazardous waste dumping ?
It stopped because when illegally dumped material is discovered there 's a way to track where it came from .
People wound up with big fines and in jail .
The time is long overdue for this kind of accountability and responsibility to come to the world of e-waste and put an end to these horrors .

I am currently a community organizer with Texas Campaign for the Environment and our mission for the past 6 years has been to gain corporate responsibility for e-waste .
In 2007 , we got legislation passed requiring computer manufacturers to have free and responsible recycling for their old products .
We also got similar legislation passed for TV manufacturers , HOWEVER the wonderful governor vetoed our bill ( HB 821 ) .
We are now working on the federal level to make sure that existing laws concerning toxic e-waste export are enforced , and that it is ended once and for all .
Being the fastest growing waste stream in the world , the potential for creating green jobs here in the US to recycle these products -- under the correct safety and health conditions -- is enormous .
Please check us out , and join in on the fight to end dumping of e-waste on developing nations and in our landfills here at home by writing letters and becoming a member !

I think the Mindset Foundation should share at least a Pulitzer with Peter & the UBC students for their courageous work on this global e-dumping expose .
In my opinion , these dumpers are committing true " crimes against humanity . "

There are tools available on the Internet to properly wipe the data from a hard drive before it is disposed of .
Darik 's Boot and Nuke is a good example .
Furthermore , if full disk encryption is used ( TrueCrypt or Pretty Good Privacy ) then the data on the drive was never written in such a way that it can be read without the decryption keys .
Thus , even if the disk is taken out of the original computer and put into a new one it cannot be read without the decryption keys which are nearly impossible to recover by analysis of the encrypted drive .
Finally , if the user is not sophisticated enough to employ any of these means then there is always the old standby , as demonstrated on your program , a large hammer .
However , I must say that I was surprised at how sloppy a major defense contractor like Northrup Grumman was with data destruction .
They of all people should know about proper data destruction methods .
They should have a degaussing station to pass hard drives through on their way to the industrial strength waste shredder or the smelter .
Really quite inexcusable for professionals like them to be so utterly careless and sloppy .

This is a critical mess .
I would hope that at some point the government takes a serious look into this situation as well as companies being more responsible .
There should be in place more security measures , such as transparency and overseeing of materials that are considered e-waste .

This is a " must see " or " must read " for everyone that has a computer , both individual - and business - owned .
I am amazed at the number of people that just toss their computers out thinking they 've erased all of their personal / confidential data , only to learn later that their identity has been compromised and have no idea why !
And to see where these computers go and the risk that the people take in stripping these units down is unbelievable .
We should at least be thankful that our laws are such that we would n't be put at risk like these other countries their people from all the toxicity involved in the way they rip the equipment apart to resell it .
Thanks PBS for airing this story .
I really hope that a very large audience is able to experience this very enlightening story .

This week 's Stories from a Small Planet was excellent .
I found the info on electronic dumping powerful ; I liked seeing what is being done in India to help recycle ; and the story about the special wheelchairs was edifying .

and in all newspapers of the world .
It is appalling the amount of e-waste there is .

Mr. Gray and the other Bush advisers knew that the power companies  and their allies in Congress  would vigorously oppose a tax on sulfur emissions or stringent new regulations to control them .
But the environmental costs of the problem were too big to ignore .
One of Mr. Bush ’s outside advisers , Daniel J. Dudek , an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund , recalled that after years of unsuccessfully trying to sell the idea of setting a national limit on such emissions and letting companies trade permits or allowances to pollute , he finally came up with an analogy that broke the ice .
“ I told Boyden : ‘ Imagine you just fired up the government printing presses and dumped an endless stream of money into the system .
You ’d have no way of controlling the money supply , ’ ” Mr. Dudek said .
“ He understood totally and intuitively the importance of maintaining the cap , the key ingredient in our acid rain policy . ”
A month later , the Bush White House sent Congress a cap - and - trade plan for sulfur dioxide emissions that 18 months later became the linchpin of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act , considered by many to be the most successful domestic environmental legislation ever enacted .
But the proposal came under ferocious political assault during those months .
The final bill reflected a series of compromises needed to keep the coalition supporting it together .
But the sulfur dioxide cap , a roughly 50 percent reduction in emissions over the next decade , held .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that compliance with the program is close to 100 percent .
“ Our proposal was at first ridiculed by environmentalists as little more than a license to pollute , ” said Representative Jim Cooper , a moderate Democrat from Tennessee and an early supporter of tradable permits .
“ But today , few dispute it is one of the government ’s most successful regulatory programs ever . ”
Representative Henry A. Waxman , a California Democrat and chairman of the energy committee , and his allies are marshaling many of the same arguments for the cap - and - trade approach as they used two decades ago for acid rain .
A cap - and - trade program brings support from industries that prefer it to a top - down federal regulatory scheme , they say .
From its building to its destruction lies a time span of merely 56 years .
Yet the colossus earned a place in the famous list of Wonders .
" But even lying on the ground , it is a marvel " , said Pliny the Elder .
The Colossus of Rhodes was not only a gigantic statue .
It was rather a symbol of unity of the people who inhabited that beautiful Mediterranean island -- Rhodes .
Location
At the entrance of the harbor of the Mediterranean island of Rhodes in Greece .
History
Throughout most of its history , ancient Greece was comprised of city - states which had limited power beyond their boundary .
On the small island of Rhodes were three of these : Ialysos , Kamiros , and Lindos .
In 408 BC , the cities united to form one territory , with a unified capital , Rhodes .
The city thrived commercially and had strong economic ties with their main ally , Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt .
In 305 BC , the Antigonids of Macedonia who were also rivals of the Ptolemies , besieged Rhodes in an attempt to break the Rhodo - Egyptian alliance .
They could never penetrate the city .
When a peace agreement was reached in 304 BC , the Antagonids lifted the siege , leaving a wealth of military equipment behind .
To celebrate their unity , the Rhodians sold the equipment and used the money to erect an enormous statue of their sun god , Helios .
The construction of the Colossus took 12 years and was finished in 282 BC .
For years , the statue stood at the harbor entrance , until a strong earthquake hit Rhodes about 226 BC .
The city was badly damaged , and the Colossus was broken at its weakest point -- the knee .
The Rhodians received an immediate offer from Ptolemy III Eurgetes of Egypt to cover all restoration costs for the toppled monument .
However , an oracle was consulted and forbade the re-erection .
Ptolemy 's offer was declined .
For almost a millennium , the statue laid broken in ruins .
In AD 654 , the Arabs invaded Rhodes .
They disassembled the remains of the broken Colossus and sold them to a Jew from Syria .
It is said that the fragments had to be transported to Syria on the backs of 900 camels .
Description
Let us first clear a misconception about the appearance of the Colossus .
It has long been believed that the Colossus stood in front of the Mandraki harbor , one of many in the city of Rhodes , straddling its entrance .
Given the height of the statue and the width of the harbor mouth , this picture is rather impossible than improbable .
Moreover , the fallen Colossus would have blocked the harbor entrance .
Recent studies suggest that it was erected either on the eastern promontory of the Mandraki harbor , or even further inland .
Anyway , it did never straddle the harbor entrance .
The project was commissioned by the Rhodian sculptor Chares of Lindos .
To build the statue , his workers cast the outer bronze skin parts .
The base was made of white marble , and the feet and ankle of the statue were first fixed .
The structure was gradually erected as the bronze form was fortified with an iron and stone framework .
To reach the higher parts , an earth ramp was built around the statue and was later removed .
When the colossus was finished , it stood about 33 m ( 110 ft ) high .
And when it fell , " few people can make their arms meet round the thumb " , wrote Pliny .
source
Although we do not know the true shape and appearance of the Colossus , modern reconstructions with the statue standing upright are more accurate than older drawings .
Although it disappeared from existence , the ancient World Wonder inspired modern artists such as French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi best known by his famous work : The Statue of Liberty .
Erdoğan v the media
In a country where journalists ’ blood has been spilt , Turkey ’s prime minister animus towards the media risks creating tragedies .
A Turkish leader ’s visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos would normally not be a headline - grabbing affair .
But when Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stormed out of a discussion on Gaza , leaving a stunned Israeli president and other panellists in the dust , there was a blitz of international coverage and flattering media attention at home .
The political theatre , and the hero ’s welcome Erdoğan received back in Istanbul , may in part reflect the growing unease amongst Turkey ’s Muslim population about the country ’s good relations with Israel after its most recent offensive in Gaza .
But it also showed a side of the charismatic leader that many Turkish journalists have come to know – a politician who is prone to using the public arena to vent his anger .
He blasted the international news organisations for a pro-Israel bias in their reporting on recent events in Gaza , and for months he has used his political pulpit to target journalists at home .
If these were the casual remarks of a politician unhappy with the news coverage he receives , they would be unremarkable .
But in Erdoğan ’s case , there has been a rising tempo of verbal attacks , and he has urged his supporters to boycott media that are deemed too critical .
If you cannot silence the press , at least hit them where it hurts , the rationale appears to be .
He has also not refrained from criticising outsiders .
Just days before US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s scheduled visit this week , Erdoğan denounced a new State Department report on human rights that raised concerns about numerous legal barriers to free expression in Turkey , including those that criminalise insults to the state .
The US State Department , like many press freedom and human - rights groups , question why Article 301 – the notorious ‘ Turkishness ’ law that has been used to charge journalists , writers and intellectuals – remains on the books .
It was watered down last year but remains a weapon against free expression .
( One prominent Turkish - Armenian journalist convicted under this law , Hrant Dink , was murdered in 2007 by self - described ultranationalists , who are currently on trial . )
Erdoğan has also publicly denounced the International Press Institute , which is directed by the author of this article , for imploring him to stop threatening media about their reporting .
The risks of a national leader attempting to incite public antipathy to the press became apparent in January , one day after the incident in Davos .
The prime minister used something as benign as a ribbon - cutting ceremony for a new Istanbul underground station as a platform to blast reporters .
A brief confrontation broke out during his speech , and as news photographers homed in to get footage , the crowd turned on journalists , attacking them in front of the prime minister who , according to eyewitness accounts , did little to intervene .
Despite this incident , the prime minister ’s criticism of journalists has continued on the campaign trail as he canvasses the country in advance of the 29 March municipal elections .
The crowd turned on journalists , attacking them in front of the prime minister who did little to intervene .
Erdoğan ’s anti-media campaign seems to stem from reports that have linked him to a Turkish charity , Deniz Feneri , whose managers were tried in Germany last year on charges of defrauding donors of € 16 million .
The prime minister has denied any connection to the charity , and German prosecutors have also said there was nothing linking the defendants to Erdoğan .
But he has lashed out at the country ’s largest media company , the Dogan Media Group , demanding that its editors reveal their motives for reporting on the charity scandal .
On several occasions , the prime minister has urged his supporters to stop buying papers that , as he told one rally , “ stand by others , rather than stand by the prime minister of the Turkish Republic ” .
There were also other troubling actions .
In December , the prime minister ’s office refused to renew press credentials for several long - time political reporters .
Then in February , Turkey ’s finance ministry fined Dogan an unprecedented €380 million ( 826 million Turkish lira ) for tax evasion related to sales of foreign assets .
While the Turkish authorities insist that the fine had nothing to do with Erdoğan ’s criticism of Dogan ’s news coverage , the timing – after months of criticism from the prime minister – only raises the spectre of a politically motivated campaign to bring the media company to its knees .
The prime minister ’s outbursts against the press are odd for a man who himself was once unjustly banned from political office because of his religious views .
They also defy the laudable reforms he has shepherded through parliament since he came to power in 2002 , and his push to put Turkish law in sync with the European Union .
Erdoğan ’s campaign against the media sends a message that they are fair game for bullying and boycotts .
But it also carries grave risks for journalists .
Questioning the media ’s loyalty is dangerous in a country where some individuals have already used perceived affronts to ‘ Turkishness ’ as an excuse to commit violence and , in Dink ’s case , murder .
The prime minister needs to step back .
If he does not , this is one piece of political theatre that risks moving from drama to tragedy .
David Dadge is director of the International Press Institute , a Vienna - based press - freedom organisation .
A recent research paper by Heather L. LaMarre , Kristen D. Landreville , and Michael A. Bream of the Ohio State University finds that political ideology has a significant impact on how viewers perceive the content of The Colbert Report .
In ' The Irony of Satire : Political Ideology and the Motivation to See What You Want to See in the Colbert Report ' , published in The International Journal of Press / Politics , the authors are able to demonstrate in their survey sample that self - identified political conservatives are more likely to believe that :
Colbert uses humour but truly means what he says about liberals
Colbert really is a conservative
Colbert is a Republican
Colbert really dislikes liberals and only pretends to be joking
At the same time , they found that both self - identified liberals and conservatives ' find Colbert equally funny suggesting that both sides see the humor yet differ in their perceptions of what or who is being parodied and / or satirized in the late - night comedy show ' ( LaMarre et al , 2009 : 225 ) .
For me , what these findings suggest -- in part -- is that the politicized content of popular culture is often interpreted in ways that challenge the probable intentions of cultural producers .
Thus , it 's not just getting your message across that is important ; you also may need to be managing how that message is received .
At the same time , as The Colbert Report demonstrates , great commercial success can be garnered by adopting modes of presentation -- like deadpan satire -- that allow several sub-audiences to believe that they are in on the real joke .
Then again , it could just be that conservatives -- in the , uhmm sample -- lack the cognitive capacities to process complex messages ...

In the Star Wars Mythos , some piece of vital information is leaked , with the remark , " Guard it carefully , many Bothans died trying to obtain it ... "
This is all we know of the Bothans .
Otherwise , zip , zero .
The idea is Rikki , do n't lose that number , we do n't want to have to go through this again .
In fan fiction , the Bothans are a race of master spies , who will go through whatever it takes ...etc .
Calm down .
Let 's talk about the idea of a ' planet ' of spies .
Earth is a planet .
It contains many , many languages , ethnic groups , and people who deal with who they are in the face of an industrial culture that may or may not be the optimal one .
Each individual can choose to go with or oppose the flow .
And yet , we are supposed to imagine a " Bothan " in the same way we used to imagine a " Chinaman " or a " nigger " , that is , totally predictable .
Of course , he was trained in thievery as a child , and how to make codes unbreakable to most non-Bothians as an adolescent .
He never went through a period of doubt over his ancestral role , that simply doing one 's job would n't be better .
No !
He 's a Bothan !
A lot of what this comes from is the sort of dog- anthropology colonialists put forth in the Fifteenth through the early Twentieth centuries - upon finding a tribe , or island full of people who seemed to have but one focus to their lives , they dutifully wrote it down -- they have sex , they fight , they XXX , ooh , how primitive !
By the time of pulp fiction , and the serial movies upon which Star Wars was based , this was so reflexive as to be unremarkable .
Unfortunately , what feels comfortably ordinary to one generation , rankles the next ...
Hackers , possibly from Asia , have stolen about a decade ’s worth of personal information on current and former UC - Berkeley students , the university announced Friday .
The breaches involved records dating to 1999 at the school ’s health center that included Social Security numbers , health insurance information , immunization history and the names of treating physicians .
No other treatment - related records were stolen , the university said , although self - reported medical histories of students who studied abroad were hacked .
The school on Friday sent e-mails and letters to 160,000 people , including about 3,400 Mills College students who used or were eligible for University of California - Berkeley medical services .
About 97,000 people are most at risk because their names and Social Security numbers could be connected by the hackers , said Steve Lustig , the university ’s associate vice chancellor for health and human services .
“ What ’s been taken is bits of data that the thief might put together into an identity , ” he said .
The university traced the hackers back to Asia , possibly China , but the exact origin could not be pinpointed .
UC and FBI investigators are probing the breaches , which apparently occurred over several months .
An FBI spokesman said the agency was informed of the hacking immediately , but declined to provide more information .
The thefts were discovered about a month ago , but system administrators did not realize the breadth of the attack until April 21 .
The hackers disguised their work as routine operations and then left taunting messages for UC - Berkeley employees , said Shelton Waggener , the university ’s associate vice chancellor for information technology .
The thieves accessed the information through the university Web site , he said .
“ You should think of it as a public building , ” Waggener said .
“ They got into the building properly , but then they broke into secure areas . ”
Administrators at Mills College , which contracts with UC - Berkeley for health services , declined to comment .
Friday ’s announcement shocked and dismayed students .
“ We ’re all young people and we do n’t have a lot of credit established , ” said UC - Berkeley law student Justin Kidd .
“ That ’s really frightening to someone in my situation . ”
Kidd also said he was angry that the university would not pay for ongoing credit monitoring .
The school recommended that affected students and alumni sign up for free monitoring , which expires every 90 days .
“ I ’ve got to do that every 90 days until God knows when , ” Kidd said .
Thieves worldwide have set up black markets to sell stolen data , said John Mitchell , a Stanford University computer - science professor .
Asia , Eastern Europe and Nigeria have particularly active hackers , he said .
But the taunting messages left by the hackers who targeted Berkeley may indicate they are amateurs , Mitchell said .
“ If your intent is to steal information and sell it on the black market , you ’re probably not going to call attention to yourself like that , ” he said .
“ It could be that these are kids . ”
LSA authentication packages are a part of the core security ecosystem in Windows NT .
LSA APs are provided with credentials by logon applications , such as Winlogon , authenticate these credentials and provide the logon application with a logon session handle if authentication was successful .
Two authentication packages provided with Windows are of special interest .
MSV1_0 authenticates user credentials against the local SAM database or against a domain controller through the legacy logon protocols .
Kerberos.dll uses the Kerberos protocol with modern domain controllers ( or third party KDCs , etc. ) for establishing logon sessions .
Applications that want to provide value - added logon functionality wish to become involved in the logon process .
Winlogon provides the GINA facility before Windows Vista and the new Credential Providers in Windows Vista and later to allow involvement in the end - user logon experience .
While customizing the logon process is done at the logon application side with GINAs or CPs , sometimes customization is required at the authentication side , in the Local Security Authority subsystem .
For instance , a fingerprint reader may customize the logon UI to allow fingerprint scanning as a means of authentication .
The customized logon application will call LsaLogonUser with the fingerprint scanner ’s custom LSA authentication package as the desired authenticator .
The fingerprint LSA AP will scan a fingerprint database it maintains to perform the authentication process .
That would be an independent LSA authenticaion package .
There are other scenarios in which the regular MSV1_0 / Kerberos based logon authentication process is desired , but special pre or post - processing is required .
In Windows XP , the problematic GINA architecture makes replacing the GINA cumbersome , as multiple third - party applications may attempt to install conflicting GINA replacements .
Indeed , Microsoft documentation has been modified retroactively to recommend GINA hooks and stubs in lieu of outright replacement of the MSGINA implementation previously suggested .
With the ability to instrument the logon application at the GINA side limited and version dependent ( a totally different approach is required for Vista ’s CPs ) , the alternative of instrumentation at the LSA side warrants exploration .
We can implement an LSA proxy authentication package .
Such a package would appear to the LSA server as an ordinary package , but would be implemented by delegating to original APs like MSV1_0 and Kerberos , providing it with monitoring and instrumentation capabilities .
LSA authentication packages are loaded by LSASS at system startup by enumerating them from the registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages .
Both LSA authentication packages ( APs ) and security providers ( SSPs ) are registered at that location .
For the purposes of this post , we ’ll ignore pure SSPs and focus only on APs .
We will register our proxy authentication package instead of MSV1_0 ( and possibly Kerberos ) at this location , and leave loading of the original APs to our proxy AP implementation .
Let us examine the system ’s core APs , MSV1_0 and Kerberos :

Both DLLs export the SpInitialize function used for SSP initialization and for AP initialization export SpLsaModeInitialize and SpUserModeInitialize , called in LSASS context and in logon application context by secur32.dll , respectively .
As can be seen in MSV1 _0 ’s export table , it provides a subauthentication package facility for those interested in becoming involved in the logon process .
Clearly , this is the facility Microsoft intended third - parties to use , rather than creating proxy authentication packages .
Unfortunately , subauthentication packages only provide a subset of authentication package functionality , primarily failing to provide access to the interactive logon ( as opposed to the network logon ) process .
You should carefully consider your requirements .
If they can be met with a subauthentication package , it is best to opt for that approach as it is far more likely to remain intact in Windows 7 and beyond .
That said , the proxy authentication package model is given some legitimacy by this diagram , illustrating delegation to MSV1_0 by a hypothetical third - party custom authentication package .
It is interesting to note that MSV1_0 chooses to export the various LSA AP functions , such as LsaApLogonUserEx2 , etc. , via its DLL export table , while Kerberos opts not to export them , though quick examination of Kerberos.dll ’s public symbols clearly illustrates the presence of the AP functions .
So how does the LSA server know how to find and call the various AP functions ?
They are provided in a function dispatch table filled by the AP at initialization time , when SpLsaModeInitialize or SpUserModeInitialize are invoked ( depending on the context of the AP ’s use ) .
Keeping in mind that MSV1_0 was around before Kerberos was added to Windows NT in the Windows 2000 release and therefore may have remaining legacy cruft , reviewing the disassembly of the LSA server DLL , LSASRV , reveals that LSA first calls the Initialize functions to let the AP fill the function dispatch table , but then promptly examines the AP ’s export table with GetProcAddress in the aptly named lsasrv !
BindOldPackage function .
This function appears to be invoked for the AP even when the function dispatch table has been filled .
However , empirical evidence appears to suggest that the function dispatch table takes precedence over the contents of the export table .
Indeed , Kerberos opts to do away with the export table entirely .
It appears that the export - based model was replaced with the dispatch table based model at some point during the lifetime of Windows NT .
The export model has an obvious disadvantage of allowing a single DLL to implement only a single authentication package , a restriction will come back to later .
The dispatch table model , on the other hand , allows the initialization function to return multiple dispatch tables , for multiple authentication packages , from a single DLL .
This may yet prove useful for a proxy package .
In order to explore the feasibility of creating a proxy LSA authentication package , I wrote a test DLL , dubbed “ LsaPrxAp ” .
This DLL provides the SpInitialize , SpLsaModeInitialize and SpUserModeInitialize exports .
When invoked , it loads msv1_0 if it is not yet loaded .
The DLL ’s Initialize functions call the original msv1_0 ’s Initialize functions and then hook the authentication package by replacing function pointers with pointers to implementations of the LSA AP functions residing in LSAPrxAp .
The original function pointers are saved in a global data structure so that LSAPrxAp ’s stubs can invoke them while having value - added processing during the logon sequence .
Since the name of the authentication package is the one provided in the SpLsaModeInitialize function by the AP , rather than the DLL ’s name , it is easy to proxy the MSV1_0 module and become involved in the logon process .
I did not bother with supporting Kerberos in my test , but hypothetically the proxy AP can call the Initialize functions for both MSV1_0 and Kerberos and return two dispatch tables as the parameter model for it allows .
Proxying a known authentication package of a known revision is one thing , but a more generic approach warrants special consideration .
In both XP and Vista , the APs provide the latest LsaApLogonUserEx2 function .
However , it is preceeded by LsaApLogonUserEx and LsaApLogonUser .
The documentation for AP developers seems to indicate it is still legitimate to only support one of the older variants .
Therefore , the proxy should take note that NULL function pointers in the dispatch table provided by the original APs are possible and should react accordingly .
As I investigated the behavior of the LSA server with respect to the export - based model for locating LSA AP functions vs. the function dispatch table model , I considered the problem of implementing a generic proxy if the dispatch table model was not preferred over the export table .
The proxy AP would have to load the original AP and only have an LsaApLogonUserEx2 function if the original AP has .
If the original AP has no LsaApLogonUser function exported , neither should the proxy AP .
This presents special complication since compiling a different proxy AP for every possible set of exports is not feasible .
I reiterate that the problem is theoretical since the function dispatch table model has no such fallacy .
In order to deal with this issue , I devised an approach where the proxy AP would initially export all possible LSA AP functions .
At runtime , as the actual exports of the original AP is detected , functions that are missing from the original AP can be unexported from the proxy AP .
I discuss the technique of unexporting functions through name obfuscation in the previous post .
Successfully compiling an LSA AP DLL required numerous acts of header juggling .
For reference purposes , I provide the sequence I used :
#include < ntstatus.h > # define WIN32_NO_STATUS
#include < Windows.h > # include < NTSecAPI.h > # define SECURITY_WIN32 #include < SSPI.h >
#ifndef NT_SUCCESS
#define NT_SUCCESS ( Status ) ( ( NTSTATUS ) ( Status ) >=
0 ) #endif // LsaApCallPackageUntrusted is partially missing from NTSecPkg.h typedef NTSTATUS ( NTAPI LSA_AP_CALL_PACKAGE_UNTRUSTED ) ( __in PLSA_CLIENT_REQUEST
ClientRequest , __in PVOID ProtocolSubmitBuffer , __in PVOID ClientBufferBase , __in ULONG SubmitBufferLength , __out PVOID * ProtocolReturnBuffer , __out PULONG ReturnBufferLength , __out PNTSTATUS ProtocolStatus ) ;
The WIN32_NO_STATUS definition is required to prevent Windows.h from defining the NTSTATUS values .
Letting ntstatus.h define them is required because Windows.h only defines a subset of the required values .
SSPI.h requires choosing between Win32 , Kernel - mode and Macintosh Classic ( heh… ) usage , resulting in the SECURITY_WIN32 preprocessor definition .
The NTSecPkg.h header included with the Windows SDK I ’m using makes the embarrassing error of missing the prototype for LsaApCallPackageUntrusted , while curiously attempting to provide the function pointer type for it .
It is wise to avoid loading the original AP DLLs during DllMain , due to potential loader lock issues .
The first functions invoked after an AP DLL has been mapped to a process are those that fill the function dispatch table ; SpInitialize for the SSP case , SpLsaModeInitialize for the LSASS - side AP case and SpUserModeInitialize for the secur32.dll logon application ( Winlogon ) side case .
All three functions ought to load the original AP if required and perform any required hooking of the dispatch tables , pointing to your own proxy functions .
The initialization functions should also extract the function pointers for the original AP implementations and preserve them in global data .
This can later be used to forward calls to the original implementation .
Consider the implementation of LsaApCallPackage in my LsaPrxAp test DLL :
NTSTATUS NTAPI LsaApCallPackage ( __in PLSA_CLIENT_REQUEST
ClientRequest , __in PVOID ProtocolSubmitBuffer , __in PVOID ClientBufferBase , __in ULONG SubmitBufferLength , __out PVOID * ProtocolReturnBuffer , __out PULONG ReturnBufferLength , __out PNTSTATUS ProtocolStatus ) { OutputDebugString ( TEXT ( " lsaaprxap LsaApCallPackage
" ) ) ; return g_LsaPrxApFunctionTable.pLsaApCallPackage(
ClientRequest , ProtocolSubmitBuffer , ClientBufferBase , SubmitBufferLength , ProtocolReturnBuffer , ReturnBufferLength , ProtocolStatus ) ; }
Obviously a real - world proxy AP would perform required processing before or after forwarding to the original function pointer preserved in global data , as well .
Hopefully this primer on implementing an LSA proxy AP will prove to be a welcome addition to Microsoft ’s sparse documentation on LSA authentication packages .
Welcome to the Gruit Ale Revival
I n a not so distant past , beer was brewed with an extended and varied array of botanical ingredients .
Herbs , roots and spices where used by our European ancestors in order to give their beers distinct tastes , flavours and properties .
These botanicals where sometimes referred to as Gruit , hence Gruit Ale .
Today however , beer is almost exclusively brewed with only one , single herb addition : Hops .
Hops , of course are wonderful for brewing .
They have the combined qualities that few other plants have , being at the same time bitter , aromatic and antiseptic , all qualities greatly valued in a good beer .
Would this explain why Hops have supplanted all other herbal alternatives ?
What ’s interesting about beer history is when you ask Why Hops ?
the answer is : because of Gruit .
Most beer historians seem satisfied with the general idea that at one point in history , brewers finally discovered once in for all that Hops was the perfect , unchallengeable beer herb .
And all the others herbs and spices that went into Gruit simply faded into oblivion , unable to compete with the multifunctional and delicious Hops .
Simple and partly true , this explanation unfortunately does n’t answer the full question , and fortunately for us , answering the full question opens a whole new world of creative brewing possibilities .
And that is what this site is all about .
This web site is dedicated to Gruit Ale , to what it was in a historical sense , and to what it is ( and can become ) today in modern craft brewing .
On a historical level , Stephen Harrod Buhner wrote an excellent piece on the religious and mercantile backgrounds in which Gruit flourished for more than 700 years , and was then fought and prohibited in many regions of Europe .
Dave Bonta also wrote a great article which gives a whole new perspective on Gruit , Hops , and brewing in general .
On a pratical level , you ’ll find herein a growing repertoire of brewing botanicals , as well as Gruit Ale and Unhopped Beer recipes .
I ’m the first to admit the site is incomplete but rest assured , more content will be added in the weeks and months to come .
I hope above all that gruitale.com helps anyone interested in beer and beer history to explore the renewed , rich and delicious possibilities of Gruit Ale .
Welcome to the Gruit Ale Revival .
A California elementary school sixth grader has been banned from giving a presentation on Harvey Milk in class as it violates the school ’s sex education policy .
Natalie Jones , a student at Mt. Woodson Elementary School in Romana , California , based her presentation on an independent research project she wrote about the gay civil rights leader .
After reviewing the incident , the ACLU determined that it is a free speech issue , particularly since the school referenced its sex education policy in its decision , and is now pursuing the case .
From the ACLU press release :
“ The principal and superintendent grossly misinterpreted school policy .
They illegally censored student speech protected by the First Amendment and the California Education Code , ” said David Blair - Loy , Legal Director of the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties .
“ Writing or talking about a gay historical figure who advocated for equal rights for LGBT Californians is in no way the same thing as talking about sex , and school officials should not pretend otherwise . ”
The student ’s mother Bonnie Jones :
“ This whole thing is unbelievable – first my daughter got called into the principal ’s office as if she were in some kind of trouble , and then they treated her presentation like it was something icky .
Harvey Milk was an elected official in this state and an important person in history .
To say my daughter ’s presentation is ‘ sex education ’ because Harvey Milk happened to be gay is completely wrong . ”
Below is the part of the school ’s sex education policy which is in question :
“ ( P ) arents / guardians shall be notified in writing about any instruction in which human reproductive organs and their functions , processes , or sexually transmitted diseases are described , illustrated , or discussed .
In addition , before any instruction on family life , human sexuality , AIDS or sexually transmitted diseases is given , the parent / guardian shall be provided with written notice explaining that the instruction will be given … ”
The ACLU is seeking an apology for Natalie , an opportunity for her to give the presentation in front of her class , and a clarification of parental notification issues with regards to the sex education policy .

You Do n’t Trust Creationists With Your Science Education … Here ’s Why You Should n’t Trust Their Lawyers , Either
Okay , some quick background on the issue , taken from NCSE Reports , Mar - Apr 2008 .
In 2007 , the Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) — that ’s the headquarters for pure , unadulterated , Henry Morris crazy — moved its headquarters to Dallas , Texas , and requested that the Texas Higher Education Coordination Board ( THECB ) permit ICR to offer a master ’s degree in science education .
This request was for a “ state Certificate of Authority , ” which is somewhat different than “ accreditation ” ( as this story was sometimes reported ) .
Fortunately for sanity , on April 24 , 2008 , the THECB unanimously voted to deny ICR ’s request .
And that should have been the end of it .
Oh no .
Late last week , ICR sued the THECB ( and , bizarrely , their officers in their individual capacities ) in federal court for an injunction requiring THECB to issue the Certificate of Authority and permit ICR to issue Master of Science degrees in science education .
The full complaint can be found online , here .
I am a practicing attorney who specializes in civil litigation ( like this ) and I have a J.D. from Harvard Law School .
I am not admitted in Texas — although I have litigated several matters in that state .
So I think I am particularly qualified to weigh in on this lawsuit .
Obligatory disclaimer : nothing in this blog post constitutes legal advice or an attorney - client relationship ; the opinions I express herein are my own and no one else ’s .
Now , on to the show :
This lawsuit is gloriously insane .
From top to bottom , this is exactly the kind of lawsuit you would expect from the kind of minds who think the world is 6,000 years old .
I can only highlight just some of the glaring defects in this bizarre lawsuit .
A . The Complaint appears to have been authored by someone with no serious experience in litigating federal cases .
Although the signature block is cut off in the complaint , the ICR ’s lawyers are clearly identified in this document .
Apparently , the briefs were written by the ICR ’s own James J.S. Johnson , whom FindLaw describes as a “ family lawyer . ”
Mr. Johnson is not listed in Martindale - Hubbell ( which is where you should go to read peer reviews on anyone you ’re thinking of hiring as a lawyer ) , but he does write some crazy , crazy stuff for ICR ’s website .
( ICR ’s local counsel in Texas seems to be the firm of Adams , Lynch & Loftin , P.C. , but they do not appear to be actively involved in the litigation so far . )
I should add that “ family law ” generally means as “ divorce law , ” and in general , I would not trust a divorce lawyer to bring a sec .
1983 compliant in federal court , any more than I would feel qualified to represent someone in divorce proceedings .
There are very few hard - and - fast specialties in the law ( with the exception of people like bankruptcy lawyers , who have their own bar and own courts ) — so this is n’t unethical or illegal , but it is very , very weird .
If you called me up and asked me to incorporate your business in Delaware or represent you at a custody hearing , I would very politely refer you to one of my colleagues who actually does that sort of work for a living .
It ’s not like we have a shortage of lawyers in this country or anything . 🙂
With that in mind , the first thing that strikes me about the complaint is the bizarre , blog - like use of bold , italics , underline , large and small caps , different fonts and different font sizes — all in the first two pages .
No sensible litigator would file something that looks like this in federal court .
B. Relatedly , the Complaint makes arguments in sections that do not call for argument .
The weirdness continues .
The first few paragraphs of any complaint are generally “ form ” ( almost boilerplate ) paragraphs .
For example : usually , paragraph number 1 will summarize the complaint , and the next few paragraphs will identify the parties and state the basis for jurisdiction in federal court and venue in the court selected .
While these things can give rise to litigated issues ( i.e. , is it permissible for a plaintiff to sue a defendant in a state where she does not reside ? ) , the initial complaint itself is not a legal argument .
The complaint is where the plaintiff gets to set forth his view of how the world is and what sorts of injuries he has suffered at the hands of the defendants .
You do n’t have to argue in your complaint ; you can just assert stuff and prove it later .
So it ’s very strange to see footnotes beginning to appear in these initial paragraphs that make legal arguments — such as footnote 2 that preemptively argues that it is permissible for ICR ’s Graduate School to appear as a plaintiff ; footnotes 3 and 4 citing legal authority for ICR ’s right to seek injunctive relief ; footnote 6 presenting arguments for venue , and so forth .
I have literally never seen anyone write a complaint this way .
( What one would typically do — what I would do , for example — is to plead that venue is proper in the complaint and save the argument in the event that the defendant challenges venue . )
The only explanation I can begin to offer for this is that Mr. Johnson has tried to file these sorts of lawsuits before , had them dismissed on motions to dismiss , and believes that by “ pre-empting ” argumentation he can avoid such a dismissal in the future .
Such a thought process is , to put it charitably , misguided .
C. The central claim in the lawsuit — that the THECB has violated the First Amendment — is absurd .
Next , we get to the gravamen of ICR ’s lawsuit :
25 . Due to adverse actions of the THECB , … ICRGS is faced with a legal dilemma , with both choices requiring ICRGS to experience unjustly discriminatory consequences : ( a ) ICRGS could actively stand on its First Amendment rights and continue to offer its academic programs to Texas residents , and then be ( unjustly ) prosecuted for offering what the THECB and defendants ( acting under color of state law ) unjustly characterize as a “ fraudulent or substandard ” degree program , via legal process that potential [ sp ] implicates Texas Deceptive Trade Practices — Consumer Protection
Act jeopardies [ sp ] ( including prosecution - of - crime jeopardies [ sp ] ; or ( b ) alternatively , ICRGS could passively surrender its First Amendment rights and permanently discontinue offer [ sp ] its academic programs to Texas residents , in order to avoid being ( unjustly ) prosecuted for offering what the THECB and defendans ( acting under color of state law ) characterize as a “ fraudulent or substandard ” degree program , via legal proceedings that potentially implicate Texas Deceptive Trade Practices — Consumer Protection
Act jeopardies [ sp ] .
26 .
In particular , ICRGS has been told , by representatives of THECB ( i.e. , by the Commissioner , individually and / or via his representatives , under color of state law ) , that its Texas - based publication , ACTS & FACTS , may not institutionally advertise ICRGS ’s “ Master of Science in Science Education ” program unto Texas residents , if the advertisement indicates any willingness ( on ICRGS ’s part ) to admit Texas residents into its M.S. program , even though ICRGS ’s M.S. program has been ( and continues to be ) offered under California state law via an online ( interstate telecommunications - based ) format .
[ All formatting — including the bold , underline , italics , all capitals , and random use of parenthesis — unchanged from the original .
No , seriously . ]
There are no words to describe the vacuity of this argument .
It is so preposterously stupid that I cannot imagine any second - year law student who has paid the slightest bit of attention in his Con Law class at a seventh - rate law school would make it .
There are , in fact , lots of ways that the government can violate your First Amendment rights .
They can shut down your newspaper ( “ prior restraint ” ) ; they can force you to say one set of things but not another ( “ viewpoint discrimination ” ) ; they can force you to swear allegiance to Allah every morning before homeroom ( that one violates the “ Establishment Clause ” ) ; they can prevent you from holding your Nazi rally in a community of Holocaust survivors ; and so on .
It ’s a big list .
But one of the things that almost never violates the First Amendment is when the government decides to restrict advertising .
In fact , for a state ’s regulation of advertising to violate the First Amendment , it has to be something on the order of the statute at issue in 44 Liquormart , Inc. , et al. v. Rhode Island , et al. , 517 U.S. 484 ( 1996 ) .
In that case , Rhode Island had a complete ban on any advertisement in the state that mentioned the ( correct ) price of alcohol for sale in the state , on the theory that advertising lower prices would stimulate more consumption of alcohol , and the state has a ‘ compelling interest ’ in encouraging its citizens to drink less .
That , the Supreme Court held , went too far .
But 44 Liquormart makes clear that the First Amendment protects only “ truthful and nonmisleading ” advertising , making commercial speech a far less protected area than core free speech .
( Imagine if the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protected only “ truthful and nonmisleading ” political ads , for example ! )
So let ’s apply this standard to the THECB .
Unlike Rhode Island , the THECB did not prohibit all advertising by ICR ; the only thing they prohibited was ICR advertising that they offer a Masters ’ Degree in Science Education .
Under Texas law , the ICR is not authorized to offer a Masters ’ Degree in Science Education .
Thus , if ICR were to advertise that it does in fact offer such a degree , that advertising would plainly be non-truthful and highly misleading .
Here ’s the kicker : the ICR nowhere alleges that its advertising is truthful and nonmisleading !
ICR does n’t even claim , on face , to have a First Amendment right worth protecting .
( And , of course , they do n’t have one in actual fact , either . )
D. The Complaint essentially concedes that the ICR has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies , and thus should be dismissed .
The strangeness continues .
The section dealing with exhaustion of administrative remedies is basically an “ own goal . ”
This will require a little more law school 101 , so bear with me .
When you have an “ administrative ” remedy , generally , the rule requires you to “ exhaust ” those remedies before suing someone in federal court .
What this means is that before you can sue a government agency , you have to follow the agency ’s internal policies and procedures to resolve your grievance in full .
If you go through the whole process and they have n’t fixed things , then — and only then — can you sue .
It ’s not difficult to see the reasons behind this policy ; as with decisions encouraging arbitration , mediation , and other forms of ADR ( alternative dispute resolution ) , we ’ve made a general social judgment that it ’s better to work things out outside the courts than run around suing people when you can be assured that a reasonably formal and fair process exists to redress your grievances out of court .
It ’s not perfect — sometimes very poor people are literally “ exhausted ” out of pursuing meritorious claims — but generally speaking , it works .
So it will not surprise you at all to learn that ICR has not exhausted its administrative remedies .
The section attempting to justify their failure to exhaust those remedies — paragraphs 29 through 35 — are nonsensical .
Essentially , despite admitting that their administrative appeal is pending , ICR claims that it is required to bring suit now because of statute of limitations grounds .
This is insane for at least two reasons .
First , the statute of limitations begins to run when your cause of action “ accrues . ”
( Statutes of limitations generally exist to prevent you from sitting on your rights for years and then surprising someone way down the line long after the injury occurred . )
If you are pursuing an administrative remedy , the law is clear that either a ) the cause of action has not yet accrued and / or b ) the statute of limitations is equitably tolled during the pendency of the administrative review process .
This is common sense : you do n’t preclude someone from bringing a claim if they ’ve acted consistently with that claim and followed the appropriate procedures .
Secondly , this statute of limitations argument makes no sense in that earlier in the same complaint , ICR alleges that the injury they are suffering is “ ongoing . ”
( It would have to be ; otherwise , you ca n’t get an injunction . )
If the harm is “ ongoing , ” then the statute of limitations — except in certain limited circumstances , like copyright law — has n’t begin to run .
So the bottom line is that the Complaint itself gives a judge a good reason to dismiss it ( for failure to exhaust ) .
Again — as with part ( B ) above , no sensible lawyer would argue these issues in their Complaint .
You would file the Complaint , let the other side move to dismiss , and then raise these points in opposition .
Here , ICR ’s lawyers have helpfully flagged another easy reason for the federal judge to dismiss their lawsuit outright .
E . The remedy sought in the Complaint is nonsensical .
ICR seeks an “ injunction ” in their Complaint .
As the name might suggest , an injunction generally prohibits someone from doing something .
If you are dumping trash on my lawn , for example , I might be able to get an injunction prohibiting you from dumping any more trash on my lawn .
Dumping the trash is the behavior I ’m seeking to “ enjoin ” you from doing .
But , by and large , I can not get an “ injunction ” requiring you , personally , to go pick up the trash .
( I can get damages that will pay for someone to clean up my lawn , and in some cases I can get a “ mandatory ” or “ permanent ” injunction to force you to comply with prior procedures . )
But for the most part , injunctions force you to not do things , not to affirmatively correct things .
You see where this is going .
ICR ’s requested injunction ( this is part A of “ Relief Requested , ” on page 63 of the Complaint ) is as follows :
Such injunctive relief should include provisions that require THECB ’s Commissioner , individually and in his individual capacity as the CEO of the THECB , to mitigate and undo the defendants ’ discriminatory actions by promptly approving and granting ICRGS a Certificate of Authority to grant Master of Science degrees in Science Education , with optional minors in Biology , Geology , Astro - geophysics , and General Science .
[ italics and bold italics in original ]
This is simply not an injunction .
It might be characterizable as a request for a writ of mandamus , but of course ICR has n’t pled it that way .
It ’s yet another sign that the person writing this complaint has no idea what they ’re doing .
I ’ve omitted ~ 100 “ factual ” paragraphs ( because this writeup is already nearing 2,500 words ) from the middle because I ’m critiquing this from a legal perspective .
But rest assured : those paragraphs are equally demented .
The bottom line is that there is literally no way this complaint survives a motion to dismiss .
ADDENDUM : The madness continues !
Part 2 of this story analyzes the recent press release put out by the ICR ’s lawyer , James J.S. Johnson , and considers some of the issues raised in the comments below .

Andrew Zahorsky and Anthony Nemcek 's commitment ceremony this October in Red Wing will include 300 guests at the landmark St. James Hotel .
Their legal marriage in Iowa early next month will be a humble courthouse affair , but it will carry far broader implications .
Zahorsky and Nemcek , both 27 , had been planning their commitment ceremony for months when the Iowa Supreme Court surprised the nation by unanimously upholding a lower - court decision that said confining marriage to heterosexuals violates the constitutional right to equal protection .
The April 3 decision opened the door for same - sex couples to marry in Iowa starting Monday .
More significantly , people on both sides of the issue believe it has shifted the landscape of the debate .
" Because it is a Midwestern heartland state , it 's a sign of the sea change that 's going to be happening , " Nemcek said of the Iowa ruling .
" It 's just the beginning .
" Maggie Gallagher , president of the National Organization for Marriage , the anti- same - sex marriage group that helped Proposition 8 triumph last fall in California , sees similar portents .
" It makes it very clear that if it can happen in Iowa , it can happen anywhere , " Gallagher said .
" And if we do n't want it to happen , we need to get organized . "
States from Maine to California look to be the next battlegrounds in a legal fight that is leapfrogging the country .
In Minnesota , the two sides are stalemated for now , but the debate promises to be part of each legislative session for years to come .
' A greater sense of urgency ' Advocates are hoping the momentum from Iowa will spill over into a number of marriage debates on the East Coast .
In the weeks following the Iowa ruling , New York Gov. David Paterson introduced a bill to legalize same - sex marriage .
In Vermont , the Legislature overruled Gov. Jim Douglas ' veto of a bill that recognizes same - sex marriage .
And the Washington , D.C. , City Council unanimously voted to recognize same - sex marriages performed elsewhere .
The Washington decision could have far - reaching consequences , since Congress must approve all laws passed in the District .
That congressional review could take place as soon as next month .
Maine and New Hampshire are also debating bills that would allow same - sex marriage .
With those states potentially joining Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa and Vermont in recognizing same - sex marriage , the National Organization for Marriage has responded with a $ 1.5 million ad campaign featuring its controversial commercial , titled " A Gathering Storm . "
The group 's donor base doubled from about 8,000 to 16,000 in the first three months of this year and a second TV ad is in the works , Gallagher said .
The Minnesota Family Council is aggressively reaching out to 100,000 people to help it combat bills that it thinks could help pave the way for same - sex marriage .
" What [ the Iowa ruling ] communicates to me is a greater sense of urgency here in Minnesota , " said Minnesota Family Council President Tom Prichard .
" People should n't assume that this can't happen here because we 're conservative .
I do n't know that we 're any more liberal than the people in Iowa .
We 're seeing the threat . "
Prichard 's group gathered Minnesota lawmakers , activists and religious leaders last month to introduce a state constitutional amendment that would limit marriage to a man and a woman .
It 's the fourth time this decade that same - sex marriage opponents have backed a similar amendment , and as happened in the past , the latest effort has stalled in the Legislature .
Twenty - one states , from Oregon to Kentucky , have passed constitutional amendments limiting marriage to a man and a woman .
Recent additions to that roster include Minnesota neighbors South Dakota and Wisconsin , which made the move in 2006 .
Constitutional amendments are a key strategy for many of the groups fighting gay marriage .
" The fact is the court does not have authority to write law , " said Bryan English , spokesman for the Iowa Family Policy Center , which supports a measure to amend the Iowa constitution .
Introduced before the state Supreme Court ruling , the bill has gained little traction so far in the Iowa Legislature .
In Minnesota , proponents of same - sex marriage have found themselves also stymied .
A bill introduced this session by Sen. John Marty , DFL - Roseville , that would recognize same - sex marriage has n't gotten off the ground .
And a victory through the courts , as in Iowa , is unlikely in Minnesota because of an unfavorable legal precedent set in the 1970s , said Amy Johnson , executive director of OutFront Minnesota .
Further , Gov. Tim Pawlenty would likely veto any bills recognizing same - sex marriage .
Johnson sees attaining same - sex marriage rights in Minnesota as a three - to five - year goal because of Pawlenty 's resistance .
But Iowa 's proximity will mean that many Minnesotans will get to see how the law affects life there .
" I do n't think most states in the Midwest will rush to pass marriage laws , " said Toni Broaddus , executive director of the Equality Federation , a national group .
" But more bills will be introduced , and people will talk .
That 's a positive thing to have that conversation . ''
Hundreds planning to marry
The only way the Iowa court ruling can be reversed is by amending the state constitution , a process that could take until 2012 at the earliest .
By that time , thousands of gay Iowans and out - of - state residents -- including many from Minnesota -- will have been legally married in the state .
Because Minnesota wo n't legally recognize those marriages , the decision to marry there carries complications .
Iowa does n't have a residency requirement for marriage licenses , but it does require a three - day waiting period for out - of - staters that can be waived only by a judge .
While hundreds of couples from Iowa have contacted One Iowa , the state 's largest gay advocacy group , about their intentions to marry , only a smattering are from nearby states , said spokesman Justin Uebelhor .
About 15 couples from Minneapolis ' All God 's Children Church plan to head to Iowa together during the second week of May to marry .
But others are holding out , not wanting to marry unless their union will be legally recognized by the state of Minnesota or the federal government .
The Iranian leader said his proposals would be revealed soon President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says Iran has prepared proposals aimed at resolving his country 's nuclear dispute with the West .
Speaking in southern Iran , Mr Ahmadinejad said that the package would ensure " peace and justice " for the world .
It would be offered to the West soon , he said , but gave no further details .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes , but has been accused of seeking nuclear weapons by critics .
Tehran has continued to enrich uranium despite lengthy negotiations in recent years with major powers and despite the imposition of sanctions by the UN Security Council .
Last month US President Barack Obama used a video message to offer " a new beginning " to Iran , triggering some conciliatory signs from Tehran , correspondents say .
Earlier this week it appeared to welcome an offer of talks from the US , Russia , China , France , UK and Germany on its nuclear programme .
' Respects rights '
Mr Ahmadinejad 's speech was carried live on television , as he visited Kerman in the south of Iran .
" We have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve Iran 's nuclear problem .
It will be offered to the West soon , " he said .
" This new package will ensure peace and justice for the world .
It respects rights of all nations , " he said .
The BBC's John Leyne in Tehran says this might sound like a peace initiative in Iran , responding to the recent overtures from Mr Obama , but it is unlikely to be seen that way in Western capitals .
It is more a case of Iran trying to take the diplomatic initiative in this long - running dispute .
Iran has already made it clear it is not prepared to compromise on its nuclear programme , or bow to Western demands .
So it looks as if Iran is likely to offer a repeat of proposals it put forward last year , our correspondent says .
At that time , Iran 's ideas were not taken seriously by Western negotiators , as all Iran seemed to be offering was endless talks , while it continued its nuclear programme unhindered .

Before starting his performance on Thursday night at the Midland Theater in Kansas City , Mo. , which was simulcast to more than 440 movie houses around the country , Glenn Beck walked over to the camera , waved and acknowledged the critic for The New York Times .
The poor guy was in a theater somewhere in New York , Mr. Beck said , “ all by himself . ”
Actually , at that moment I was one of eight people watching at theater No. 6 of the Clearview Chelsea Cinema , a total that would grow to 14 and hold there until almost the end of the show .
( More on that later . )
Not for the last time that night , Mr. Beck  the comedian , Fox News host and suddenly hot spokesman for American populist discontent  was hazy on the specifics but shrewdly aware of where his listeners were .
The small group was audibly pro-Beck , laughing at the same times as the capacity audience in Kansas City and occasionally saying something in menacing tones about the Federal Reserve or the progressive income tax .
Being the critic , I did n’t cheer or heckle , but I did yell at the screen once , something I do n’t think I ’d ever done in a movie theater .
It was 50 minutes in , when Mr. Beck announced that he was taking a 15 - minute break and coming back for the second half of the show .
“ You ’ve got to be kidding me ! ” was out of my mouth before I knew what was happening .
What comic  and this was billed as the Common Sense Comedy Tour  takes a 15 - minute break ?
( Or does a two - hour show ? )
Maybe one whose live audience  and I say this with the utmost respect for both sides of this equation  has an age range similar to what you ’d find at a Broadway play .
But also one whose performance is an odd and unwieldy combination of stand - up , revival meeting , motivational seminar and stump speech .
And that ’s before Mr. Beck emerges from the intermission in white Colonial wig and knee breeches for an hourlong lecture on American history and self - reliance .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve is considering creating a utility to replace the Wall Street banks that handle U.S. repo market transactions , the Financial Times reported on Monday , citing people familiar with the matter .
The proposal is partly motivated by concerns that the structure of the U.S. overnight repurchase market may have exacerbated the financial turmoil that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September .
Fed officials plan to meet next month with market participants to discuss reforms , the paper said .
The newspaper cited people familiar with the Fed ’s thinking as saying the central bank is looking into the creation of a mechanism to replace the clearing banks -- the biggest of which are JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon -- that serve as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders .
“ The Fed is raising questions about whether the system really protects the interests of all participants , ” said a person familiar with the Fed ’s thinking quoted by the FT .
Fed officials fear existing arrangements put the clearing banks in a difficult position in a crisis , the paper said .
As the value of the securities falls , clearing banks have an obligation to demand more collateral to avoid losses .
But in doing so , they could destabilize a rival .
“ The clearing banks fear the positions of the investment banks are so large that a default would be difficult for them to manage , ” the person familiar with the Fed ’s thinking said .
The Fed hopes to have a new repo system in place by October , when its credit facility for securities companies is to close , the paper said .

The ailing US carmaker General Motors saw its shares collapse to their lowest level since the Great Depression after six top executives dumped personal stock holdings , fuelling fear of imminent bankruptcy .
As GM and the Obama administration continued to plead with reluctant lenders to write off much of the company 's $ 27bn ( £ 18 bn ) in debt , the shares dived by 29 cents to close at $ 1.15 , valuing the largest of Detroit 's motor manufacturers at barely $ 700m .
At one point , GM 's shares fell as low as $ 1.09 , their lowest level since April 1933 .
The slump came after half a dozen senior managers cashed out equity for a knockdown total price of $ 315,000 .
The sellers include GM 's former head of product development Bob Lutz , a veteran Detroit figure who stepped aside to become a senior adviser to the company last month and who offloaded his entire holding of 81,360 shares for $ 130,989 .
Lutz 's successor , Thomas Stephens , liquidated stock as did North America president Troy Clarke , manufacturing chief Gary Cowger , head of European operations Carl - Peter Forster and GM 's chief information officer Ralph Szygenda .
A GM spokeswoman admitted that shareholders face " some pretty stark choices " .
If the company strikes a deal , GM will issue billions of new shares to banks , unions and the government to cancel debt , vastly diluting existing stock .
If it fails to win an agreement , shareholders will rank as unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy courts and could get nothing .
The US treasury has kept GM afloat with $ 15.4bn in emergency loans .
When asked about the stock sales , a White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said he would " resist the temptation to comment on individuals ' personal stockholdings , except to say that the president and auto task force want to ensure the continuation of General Motors that puts it on a path that does n't require continued government subsidies " .
For many of GM white - collar staff , the company 's troubles have meant the evaporation of a career 's worth of savings in company stock .
If the six executives had sold their shares in October 2007 , before the economic crisis began , they would have made $ 8.6 m between them .
Detroit 's public figures are rallying round the car industry .
The musician Eminem has announced that he will fly 200 out - of - work car workers from Michigan to Los Angeles for the taping of a live performance on Friday .
Detroit 's newly elected mayor , Dave Bing has sought to underline his status as a man of the people by refusing to move into an official riverside residence , Manoogian Mansion .
The luxury residence costs the down - at - heel city about $ 150,000 a year in maintenance .

Bunny Greenhouse Retaliated Against After Testifying To Congress
I wrote last week that I would be testifying before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform because I believe that all employees should be protected from retaliation for reporting waste , fraud , and abuse .
I did not expect that within hours of my testimony I would be subject to additional retaliation .
At 6:23 p.m. I was forwarded an email written by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Chief of Staff stating that from now on , all testimony before Congress must be pre-approved by the Army Corps and that all oral testimony must conform to the approved written testimony .
I am shocked by this blatant violation of the First Amendment .
I said nothing improper during my testimony , I simply told the truth .
I was testifying on my own time while I was on unpaid leave .
I appeared at the invitation of Congress , to explain what happened when I reported improprieties surrounding the awarding of contracts to Halliburton - KBR just prior to the invasion of Iraq .
The restriction imposed upon my right and the right of other federal employees to testify before Congress in our personal capacity free from restrain and censorship must stop NOW !
The newest attempt to silence me is the kind of retaliation that frightens government employees .
Federal employees have no protection when up against powerful special interests , who can intimidate and prevent federal employees from enforcing the law .
This is why Securities and Exchange Commission employees are afraid to police Wall Street .
This is why Food and Drug Administration employees are afraid to police powerful pharmaceutical companies .
This is why food safety inspectors are afraid to police powerful agri-business .
Its time to fight back when federal employees are forced to submit to censorship and are blocked from exercising their constitutional right to " petition Congress for redress of grievances . "
How can we fight ?
Every American should demand immediate passage of H.R. 1507 .
This law protects all federal workers who testify to Congress and gives us our day in court .
It is the only way to stop overt and subtle censorship of federal employees .
We need the government to work for us - not powerful special interests .
Congress and the American people deserve to know the truth !
Federal workers do their best to protect the health , safety , and welfare of all Americans and it is time that they are protected when federal employees are retaliated for doing their job .
Take Action now !
Send this new letter to Congress and President Obama .
And please pass it on to as many people as possible - your friends , family , co-workers , churches , unions , and civic groups need to know what 's going on and how they can help .
Call Rajesh De at the Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy ( 202-307-3024 ) and convince him that the administration needs to keep its campaign promises of supporting jury trials for all federal whistleblowers by backing H.R. 1507 .
Or Call your Congressperson , visit your Congressperson 's local office , and do whatever else you can to show Congress and the President that we will no longer tolerate censorship .
Please let us know what you are doing to help .
Thank you for you continued support .
Bunnatine H. Greenhouse
Former Procurement Executive
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
P.S. Please pass this letter on !
We need to demonstrate that the majority of Americans want whistleblower protection .
Ilam Halimi suffered weeks of torture before he was stabbed to death
The alleged leader of a French kidnap gang has gone on trial in Paris accused of torturing and killing a Jewish man - a crime that shocked France in 2006 .
Youssouf Fofana - who admits kidnapping 23 - year - old Ilan Halimi but denies killing him - shouted " God is great " in Arabic as he entered the courtroom .
Some 26 of his alleged associates are also on trial for lesser offences .
The trial , due to last until July , will be held behind closed doors because of the young age of two of the defendants .
The killing prompted thousands of people to take to the streets of Paris and protest against anti-Semitism .
Mr Halimi was kidnapped and brutally tortured for more than three weeks before he was found naked and tied to a tree near a railway track in the southern suburbs of Paris .
He had been stabbed and set alight and died on his way to hospital .
Mr Fofana , 28 , leader of a Paris gang known as The Barbarians , is accused of carrying out the attack and faces life imprisonment if found guilty .
He entered the court wearing a white tracksuit and looked at Mr Halimi 's relatives before shouting " Allahu akbar " .
When the judge asked the defendant for his identity , he replied " African barbarian armed revolt salafist " , referring to a strict Sunni Muslim movement .
He the told the court he was born on 13 February , 2006 , in Sainte - Genevieve - des - Bois - the date and place of Mr Halimi 's death .
Youssouf Fofana has pleaded not guilty to murder Mr Fofana is alleged to have ordered gang members to kidnap Jews and hold them until their families paid a ransom .
The victim , who worked in a mobile phone shop , was lured by a female gang member to an empty apartment in the Parisian suburbs where he was attacked and drugged .
The kidnappers tried unsuccessfully to extort a ransom of 450,000 euros ( $ 600,000 ; £ 405,000 ) from his family .
During his ordeal , his family was sent harrowing images and video recordings by his captors .
Jacques Chirac , who was president at the time , promised his parents a full investigation .
Mr Fofana , of Ivorian descent , fled to Ivory Coast after the murder and allegedly made death threats over the telephone Mr Halimi 's father and girlfriend .
He was extradited back to France in March 2006 .

Militants released this photograph of Edwin Dyer in February Downing Street says there is " strong reason to believe " that a British citizen has been killed by al - Qaeda militants in north - west Africa .
Edwin Dyer was kidnapped in Niger in January , but was being held in Mali .
The group had said it would kill Mr Dyer if the British government refused to release radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada from a UK prison .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned what he called an " appalling and barbaric act of terrorism " .
He later told the Commons : " I want those who use terror against this country , and against British citizens , to know beyond doubt that they will be hunted down and brought to justice .
" There will be no hiding place for them and no safe haven for terrorists who attack our country . "
Abu Qatada is awaiting extradition to Jordan , where he was convicted of terrorism offences in his absence and faces life in jail .
Condolences Mr Dyer , who spoke fluent German and had been working in Austria , was kidnapped in Niger on 22 January , close to the border with Mali .
He was captured along with a number of other European tourists , including two Swiss and one German .
The group had been visiting the Anderamboukane festival on nomad culture .
Hostage - taking and murder can never be justified whatever the cause
Foreign Secretary David Miliband
Hostages and limits on negotiations Profile : Al - Qaeda in North Africa
In a statement issued on Wednesday , Mr Brown said : " We have strong reason to believe that a British citizen , Edwin Dyer , has been murdered by an al - Qaeda cell in Mali .
" I utterly condemn this appalling and barbaric act of terrorism .
" My thoughts are with Edwin Dyer 's family .
I offer them the condolences of the whole country . "
Mr Brown said the killing reinforced Britain 's " commitment to confront terrorism " .
" It strengthens our determination never to concede to the demands of terrorists , nor to pay ransoms , " he added .
Tory leader David Cameron backed the prime minister 's stance .
He told MPs : " This must be a simply horrific time for his family and I 'm sure everyone in the country is thinking about them , " he said .
" In spite of all the difficulties , though , the prime minister is right ; we must never give into terrorists . "
Most of the other hostages have been released , but one Swiss man remains in captivity and the British government urged the kidnappers to release him " immediately and unconditionally " .
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said Mr Dyer was believed to have been kidnapped by local tribesmen and sold on to Algerian members of al - Qaeda in Mali .
British officials had been using intermediaries to try to secure Mr Dyer 's release , our correspondent said .
Other European countries are understood to have paid ransoms to secure their hostages ' release , but the British government has a blanket policy against such methods , he added .
No further details about Mr Dyer have been released by the Foreign Office .
No travel
The militants posted a statement on an Islamist website announcing the killing .
" The British captive was killed so that he , and with him the British state , may taste a tiny portion of what innocent Muslims taste every day at the hands of the Crusader and Jewish coalition to the east and to the west , " it said .
In a posting last month , the group said Abu Qatada must be released within 20 days or Mr Dyer would be killed .
The Foreign Office advises against all travel to parts of Mali and Niger .
Its website states that there is " a high threat of kidnapping " and a " high threat from terrorism " , especially in the border region .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said : " Hostage - taking and murder can never be justified whatever the cause .
" This tragic news is despite the strenuous efforts of the UK team in the UK and Mali , with valuable help from international partners . "
Abu Qatada is awaiting extradition to Jordan , where he faces life in jail The Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs said it condemned " this extreme violation of human dignity " .
" Our thoughts are with the grieving relatives in Great Britain and the relatives of the Swiss hostage who continue to hope with all their hearts for the speedy release and return of their loved one , " it said in a statement .
" No true religion and no world view dedicated to the well - being of all humans can condone the killing of innocent people . "
Abu Qatada was once described as " Osama bin Laden 's right - hand man in Europe " .
He was granted asylum in the UK in 1994 , but went on the run in 2001 on the eve of government moves to introduce new anti-terror laws allowing suspects to be detained without charge or trial .
In October 2002 , he was caught and taken to Belmarsh Prison , but was freed on bail in March 2005 , subject to a control order .
He was taken back into custody in August that year and held until June 2008 .
After another short period of freedom , he was detained again in December last year and remains in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire , pending extradition .
Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari , , secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain , said the " senseless murder " of Mr Dyer was " unforgivable " .
" There can be no possible justification for this appalling action , " he added .

Does your agent get a commission when you found the deal ?
A lot of the questions I get from fellow screenwriters are through Twitter .
If you do n’t already use Twitter you should seriously think about joining .
It ’s free and easy .
It ’s a very simple way to network with likeminded people and does n’t take a lot of time ( if you use it correctly ) .
I typically log in to my account once or twice per day and respond to tweets people have sent me and then I look around for other interesting people to follow and network with .
I usually spend less than 15 minutes per day doing this .
I have Tweetie the Twitter iPhone app so I can check Twitter whenever I have a spare moment so the time I spend on Twitter is often time that would be wasted anyway .
If you are on Twitter you can follow me at http://twitter.com/ashleymeyers
Here ’s a question I got via Twitter a couple of days ago :
“ If I find a production company willing to option my script and I have an agent , does the agent still take a commission for the find , or subsequent deal ? ”
As a rule , yes , your agent is going to take his 10 % commission on scripts that you sell even if he was n’t involved in the script submission .
Once you find a producer to option / purchase your script there ’s going to be some negotiations and legal wrangling that takes place that you should NOT do EVEN if you ’re an entertainment attorney .
This is where your agent should earn her money .
If she ’s a good agent she might be able to negotiate a fee that is more than 10 % higher than what you would have gotten yourself , so you ’re probably not going to lose any money by bringing your agent into the equation .
In addition when the wrangling starts you do n’t want to be the “ bad ” guy – that ’s what your agent is for .
Potentially you ’re going to have to work with the producer for many months so you want to keep your relationship with the producer on good terms .
Let your agent fight with the producer over contract issues while you concentrate on the creative decisions that need to be made .
There are a lot of complexities to a screenplay option agreement and you should probably not try and work them out yourself .
Your agent should be an expert in this area and there should be a lawyer who works for her firm to look over client ’s contracts .
This legal guidance is worth the 10 % .
Any real agency or manager is going to absorb these legal costs when negotiating your deal .
If you try and hire a good entertainment attorney she ’s going to charge you at least $ 300 / hour and probably more so you might end up losing more than 10 % of your deal in legal fees .
I suppose you could negotiate with your agent when you sign with them that you do n’t want to pay them commission on deals you find for yourself .
But if you ’re going to do that why have an agent at all ?
Many beginning writer ’s have a misconception that getting an agent is the end - all be -all and that your agent will be able to find work for you as soon as you sign with them .
That ’s not what ’s going to happen .
As a beginning writer you ’re still going to have to do a lot of the leg work in sending your scripts out until you get established .
If you have n’t already done so you might want to read my post
How do you get an agent for your screenplay ?
( And why you do n’t need one ! ) .

Las lágrimas escurren por su rostro hinchado .
En dos hospitales la dieron de alta .
Sin embargo , considera que no atendieron bien los golpes severos que recibió en cabeza y tórax , y un esguince en la pierna izquierda .
Aguarda en un sofá de su casa , pues el dolor le impide moverse .
La noche del sábado , Eva Pérez Tenorio y su esposo David Calderón Cárcamo , de 34 y 38 años de edad , regresaron del estadio
Azul y el hombre venía feliz , pues el Puebla venció al Cruz Azul .
Cenaron comida china y ensalada de pollo .
Abordaron entre las 21:10 y 21:20 horas el Tren Suburbano , en la estación Fortuna .
“ Notamos que venía tardando mucho ” , dice Eva , “ pero no avisaban nada ” .
Después de la estación San Rafael el tren se detuvo nuevamente .
La mujer preguntó a una guardia de seguridad si pasaba algo , pero ésta no contestó y siguió de largo .
“ Oímos el rechinar de llantas de otro férreo y después sentimos el impacto .
Toda la gente salió volando (...)
En mi caída me golpee la cabeza , la gente se me vino encima y perdí el conocimiento .
Después reaccioné , porque me dolía la pierna ” , indica .
En su domicilio de la calle Rancho el Palmar , del fraccionamiento San Blas 2 , en Cuautitlán - México , María del Rosario y las gemelas Karen y Karina , de 12 y ocho años de edad , aguardaron en vano la llegada de sus padres .
Eva fue trasladada al hospital 57 del IMSS , ubicado en La Quebrada , Cuautitlán Izcalli , en donde la dieron de alta minutos más tarde , pero “ mi cabeza sentía que explotaba y veía doble , borroso ” , por lo que avisó a su comadre , quien la llevó a Magdalena de las Salinas , en el Distrito Federal ; ahí estuvo hospitalizada hasta el mediodía del lunes , pero también la dieron de alta .
David ni siquiera fue revisado por especialistas .
Le dijeron “ o te atendemos a ti o a tu esposa ” .
Eva ahora está en su hogar , aunque “ todavía sigo con dolor de cabeza , la vista se me borra y mi cara no es ésta , mi cara está demasiado hinchada ” .
Hasta el momento la mujer no ha sido contactada por personal del Tren Suburbano , sólo un hombre que dijo ser de Gobernación la visitó en el hospital .
Para ayudar en los gastos familiares
Eva se alquilaba en labores domésticas y atendía una cooperativa escolar , por lo que se quedó sin esos recursos .
“ Yo , mal que bien , lo estoy contando , pero hay gente que sigue hospitalizada y grave .
Creo que no es justo que tanto la empresa del Tren Suburbano como ( el gobernador del Estado de México ) Enrique Peña Nieto estén haciendo esto y quieran tapar todo con un solo dedo ” , enfatiza y exige apoyo para las personas lesionadas en dicho accidente .

Now that marijuana can be legally used to ease patients ’ pain , dispensaries are opening in Spokane to provide it .
And regardless of whether such stores are what Washington voters and legislators envisioned when they allowed medical marijuana , it may only be a matter of time before the businesses are commonplace : Medical marijuana has been approved in more than a dozen states .
The dispensaries ’ legal status , however , remains hazy .
For Judy , a medical marijuana customer who asked that her last name be withheld , the drug has been a blessing .
She credits it for alleviating the pain from a severe brain trauma and other injuries sustained 12 years ago when a suicidal man rammed his pickup into her car .
The crash severed her leg below the hip .
“ I remain thankful to be alive , ” she said .
After years of buying marijuana illegally , Judy now has a doctor ’s note that says marijuana is a proper medication to ease her pain .
She buys her supply from a shop called Change .
It opened two months ago and is run by Christopher Stevens , Noah Zarate and Scott Shupe .
People smoke and buy marijuana at the Northwest Boulevard store , and police know about it .
The owners wrote a letter to Spokane police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick about their business ; her reply stated that her officers are committed to enforcing local , state and federal laws .
Stevens , a candidate for Spokane City Council , took her reply to mean police would not interfere with the business .
Washington voters passed Initiative 692 – the Medical Use of Marijuana Act – in 1998 .
The Legislature sought to clarify the law in 2007 , asking the Department of Health to define a legal and appropriate supply of marijuana .
The Health Department determined that a medically authorized person could possess a 60 - day supply , or 1 ½ pounds of marijuana or 15 plants .
Donn Moyer , a Health Department spokesman , said that enforcement of the laws is left to local , state and federal police .
A Health Department Web page – at www.doh.wa.gov/hsqa/ medical - marijuana / – includes a “ frequently asked questions ” section about medicinal marijuana .
One question : “ Is medical marijuana legal in Washington ? ”
The answer : “ Marijuana possession is illegal in Washington . ”
The agency describes the state ’s medical marijuana law as a legal mechanism that “ provides an affirmative defense for qualified patients and designated caregivers . ”
Regardless of state laws , marijuana is outlawed by the federal government , which does not accept that marijuana has medical benefits .
Another question : “ How do I get medical marijuana ?
Can I buy it ? ”
The DOH answer : “ The law allows a qualifying patient or designated provider to grow medical marijuana .
It is not legal to buy or sell it . ”
The owners of Change interpret the state law differently .
They contend they have the right to buy marijuana and resell it to people who have written authorization from their doctors .
Stevens said he obtains a wholesale supply of marijuana from local farmers with surplus crops and sells it – sales tax included – at retail prices .
And he urges patients to be careful .
“ Being able to use marijuana legally as medicine is a privilege , ” he said .
“ I tell our patients that it ’s a privilege that can be lost . ”
A sale to Judy on Tuesday resembled a typical retail transaction .
Stevens described the product , answered questions and made a recommendation based on Judy ’s questions .
When she settled on what she wanted , Judy pulled $ 80 from her billfold and handed it to Stevens .
He unscrewed a jar lid , fetched 5 grams of a variety called “ Snow Cap , ” weighed it , put it in a baggie and affixed a label urging users to keep the drug out of the reach of children .
and cautions that it may cause drowsiness .
Judy said she liked the arrangement .
“ I like coming here , ” she said , “ because it ’s private , I trust the source , the service is personal and I do n’t get hassled by anyone . ”
She smokes marijuana at least three times a day .
She does not work , lives on disability payments and said she has discontinued other pain medications now that marijuana is easier to obtain .
Some patients are n’t sure what to buy , so they are offered samples at what co-owner Zarate calls a “ taste bar . ”
The rise of such dispensaries may be inevitable .
Display ads tout the benefits of marijuana in this week ’s issue of the Nickel Nik , under classified listings for puppies , manufactured homes , cemetery plots and yard sales .
An ad by CBR Medical Inc. , with clinics across the state including one at 3115 E. Mission Ave. , claims marijuana can alleviate pain associated with many conditions , including epilepsy , AIDS and fibromyalgia .
Stevens said the next move for medical marijuana will be a push to force insurers – including the government ’s Medicare and Medicaid programs – to pay much like they do for prescription drug coverage .
“ That has to happen , ” he said .
Have to solve a problem ?
Try taking a nap .
But it has to be the right kind of nap  one that includes rapid eye movement , or REM , sleep , the kind that includes dreams .
Researchers led by Sara C. Mednick , an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Diego , gave 77 volunteers word - association tests under three before - and - after conditions : spending a day without a nap , napping without REM sleep and napping with REM sleep .
Just spending the day away from the problem improved performance ; people who stayed awake did a little better on the 5 p.m. session than they had done on the 9 a .m. test .
Taking a nap without REM sleep also led to slightly better results .
But a nap that included REM sleep resulted in nearly a 40 percent improvement over the pre-nap performance .
The study , published June 8 in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that those who had REM sleep took longer naps than those who napped without REM , but there was no correlation between total sleep time and improved performance .
Only REM sleep helped .
“ Dreams are fanciful , ” Dr. Mednick said .
“ They incorporate strange ideas that you would never have put together in waking life .
In REM sleep , it becomes more likely that ideas might come together in a solution . ”
In the tradition of Jonathan Swift 's " A Modest Proposal , " EFF board member and Princeton Computer Science Prof .
Ed Felten has written an essay in response to the recently passed " 3 strikes " legislation in France :
Yesterday the French parliament adopted a proposal to create a " three - strikes " system that would kick people off the Internet if they are accused of copyright infringement three times .
This is such a good idea that it should be applied to other media as well .
Here is my modest proposal to extend three - strikes to the medium of print , that is , to words on paper .
My proposed system is simplicity itself .
The government sets up a registry of accused infringers .
Anybody can send a complaint to the registry , asserting that someone is infringing their copyright in the print medium .
If the government registry receives three complaints about a person , that person is banned for a year from using print .
As in the Internet case , the ban applies to both reading and writing , and to all uses of print , including informal ones .
In short , a banned person may not write or read anything for a year .
A few naysayers may argue that print bans might be hard to enforce , and that banning communication based on mere accusations of wrongdoing raises some minor issues of due process and free speech .
But if those issues do n't trouble us in the Internet setting , why should they trouble us here ?
( CNN ) --
The top U.S. general , David Petraeus , painted a bleak picture of Afghanistan 's immediate future , saying insurgent attacks have risen to record levels not seen since 2001 .
U.S. General David Petraeus chats with John Nagl , president of Center for a New American Security .
" There is no question that the situation has deteriorated over the course of the past two years and that there are difficult times ahead , " said Gen. David Petraeus , who heads the US Central Command , on Thursday .
" The past week was the highest level of security incidents in Afghanistan 's history , at least that post - liberation history , " Petraeus said in a speech at the annual conference of the Center for a New American Security , a Washington think tank .
Petraeus 's comments came as the United States is embarking on new strategy in Afghanistan , with increased troop levels and a focus on counterinsurgency tactics .
Petraeus said America should draw on the lessons learned in Iraq .
At the height of Iraq 's insurgency , it suffered 160 violent attacks a day , he said .
That number has failen to between 10 and 15 a day .
Petraeus masterminded the so - called surge strategy , which is credited with helping stabilize Iraq .
Iraq continues to move forward , but Afghanistan " is headed in the other direction , " Petraeus said .
He said some of the violence " will go up because we are going to go after their sanctuaries and their safe havens as we must . "
Afghanistan posed unique challenges , Petraeus said , adding that it was imperative for U.S. soldiers to live near local people , build relationships and have a " phenomenal understanding " of the local culture .
He said training fledgling Afghan security forces will be critical to long - term success , just as it was in Iraq .

President Barack Obama has approved a plan that increases U.S. presence by 21,000 troops .
Last month Defense Secretary Robert Gates injected fresh energy into the beleaguered war effort by tapping Lt. Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , a former special operations chief , to take over as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
In May , Obama met with Afghanistan and Pakistan 's presidents and pledged a more coordinated effort to defeat the insurgents .
He has called for improved troop training and added civilian expertise in an effort to battle a resurgent Taliban .
After the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 , the United States invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban .
But in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in extremism and a rise in violence .
So far this year , 73 U.S. soldiers have died in Afghanistan , more than half of the 133 coalition deaths .

Your Wii Has A Minor Button - Combo Secret
Go to the Mii Channel .
Press A. Press B. Press 1 . Press and hold 2 .
Nintendo sent Kotaku copies of Personal Trainer : Walking yesterday , and while we think we do n’t need that much training to walk ( left foot and then right foot , yes ? ) , we are in fact learning things .
We have learned , for example , that the Wii possesses a previously hidden talent .
Try the button combo mentioned above and the image you see here will appear .
You wo n’t get Miis of Condoleezza Rice and Exclusives expert Geoff Keighley to appear .
That ’s just on my Wii .
But you will get proof that your Wii is capable of emitting your Miis to a DS .
Since launch , the Wii has been able to send Miis to Wii Remotes so that the Miis can be transmitted to other Wiis .
And Miis have been snaggable via non-Nintendo Mii-editing computer programs .
But Miis had n’t made it to the DS .
They can now that they have a home , as Nintendo informs us that Personal Trainer : Walking is the first DS game / walking - trainer ) to support Miis .
On the DS , the Miis are used to demonstrate how far you walked .
Like , you know , if you walked about 1000 steps between leaving your apartment this morning and getting to your downtown Manhattan office — with the help of the subway .
What other feats is your Wii capable of ?
Who knows .

[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : mathlink - 2.0.0.3
All : mathlink is a library for writing Mathematica packages in Haskell .
One simply writes some functions of type : ( MLGet a , MLPut b ) => a ->
IO b and provides a package specification in a simple DSL that mimics that of Mathematica 's mprep utility .
The result is a program that exposes functions that can be called from Mathematica .
This is a complete rewrite of my original implementation and more closely captures the functionality I originally intended .
I 've only tested it on my own platform ( 64 - bit Linux ) , but I 've taken pains to make sure the code should run on any platform .
( The only real issue in the code is picking the right functions to call when marshaling Ints . )
Please report any tweaks required to get it to work on your platform .
( That is , of course , only if , in fact , there are any other users out there .
Right now , as far as I know , I 'm it . )
I 'd also just like to hear from any Haskellers out there that also use Mathematica on a regular basis .
Ping me if you 're one .

This Sunday , America witnessed Pakistani President Zardari ’s disgraceful performance on Meet the Press .
He pandered ; he obfuscated ; he shirked any responsibility or blame ; he turned briefly eloquent – and then outrageously self - righteous .
It was clear that he is not one tenth the politician his wife was – and it seems not one tenth the leader .
She may have been corrupt ( as it seems was he ) – but he appears to lack her communicative gifts or her aptitude for politics .
On top of it , his management style seems be Bush - level incompetence .
The most ridiculous point Zardari tried was to invoke AIG ’s bailout as an argument to give more money to Pakistan .
David Gregory – to his credit – asks the tough question – the question that needs to be asked of Pakistan ’s leader ( especially given stories like this ) although Gregory does manage to shift responsibility for the criticism of Zardari off to another reporter :
The question a lot of people ask is are you – is Pakistan really committed to that war ?
In The New York Times Dexter Filkins , who , who ’s reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan , writes this : “ Whose side is Pakistan really on ? … Little in Pakistan is what it appears .
For years , the survival of Pakistan ’s military and civilian leaders has depended on a double game : assuring the United States that they were vigorously repressing Islamic militants–and in some cases actually doing so–while simultaneously tolerating and assisting the same militants .
From the anti-Soviet fighters of the 1980s and the Taliban of the 1990s to the homegrown militants of today , Pakistan ’s leaders have been both public enemies and private friends .
When the game works , it reaps great rewards : billions in aid to boost the Pakistani economy and military and Islamist proxies to extend the government ’s reach into Afghanistan and India . ”
Zardari ’s responded :
[ W ] hat billions are you talking about ?
Like I said , a billion dollar a year ?
That ’s not even – altogether , this aid package is not even one tenth of what you gave AIG .
So let ’s face it ; we need , in fact , much more help .
This is n’t the first time Zardari has found it prudent to invoke AIG to justify giving more billions to Pakistan – he apparently disconcerted lawmakers a few days earlier this week – as the New York Times reported :
[ W ] hen he asked for financial assistance , he likened it to the government ’s bailout of the troubled insurance giant , American International Group .
While it is probably true that Zardari needs more funds – his pique at being asked to justify these funds is galling – especially when so much of it was apparently spent preparing Pakistan ’s military to fight India instead of the Taliban .
Though this analogy is politically stupid – it does bring up an interesting parallel .
AIG has been the nexus of the financial crisis in much the same way that Pakistan is the center of the threat of strategic terrorism .
When synthetic CDOs were invented , they were structured in such a way as to create positions that were safer than AAA - rated debt .
( An explanation of what this means here . )
These positions were called super - senior .
Yet the ever “ cautious ” bankers decided to hedge against even these supposedly risk - free positions – allowing them to free up more capital , so that for the purposes of regulation , it was treated as if they had not lent out any money at all .
They decided to buy insurance , calling this insurance a credit default swap , hedging against the risk that even this super - safe investment would go bad .
There was one big player in this , one firm that provided so much of this insurance which led to this boom in lending and enormous leveraged positions – AIG – who insured these super - safe debts with nary a plan to deal with defaults .
After all – these debts were super - senior – there would only be defaults if historically unprecedented numbers of these mortgages went south .
( Precedent only went back forty years or so with modern macroeconomic record - keeping . )
AIG Financial – a small part of the AIG empire which spanned insurance across dozens of industries around the world – decided to leverage the entire company to insure these products – leading to enormous profits in the short - term – and systematic risk as soon as things went bad .
If AIG had not been able to pay on its insurance to the big banks , things would likely have been worse .
Pakistan meanwhile is the land of Dick Cheney ’s nightmares , where WMDs , nuclear weapons , terrorists , and a teetering state all exist .
Pakistan combines all of the elements national security experts fear could have disasterous consequences if they come together .
As Barton Gellman describes Pakistan ’s importance in his excellent biography of Dick Cheney :
The nexus , if it was anywhere , was in Pakistan – a nuclear state whose national hero sold parts to the highest bidder , whose intelligence service backed the Taliban , and whose North - West Frontier Province became a refugre for al Qaeda .
What it comes down to is that both are too big – and too connected – to fail .
Both have had billions of American dollars pumped into them to prop them up .
Both have prompted outrage as they have seemed to use this money to benefit themselves and not for the purposes it was intended .
Both are controlled by leaders whose hands were far from clean in creating the current crisis .
Neither the leadership of Pakistan nor the leadership of AIG have taken responsibility for the crisis that occurred oin their watch – in their realm of control – blaming America and the world at large for their problems instead .
Perhaps because of this , the leadership of both seem to believe that they deserve to be rewarded for their efforts rather than held accountable for their significant failures .
Yet even so , the costs of the failure of either is likely catastrophic .
Maybe this is the point Zardari was trying to make – his way of taunting us with the fact that he knows we cannot allow him to fail – just like AIG .

In BLONDES I mention that , for many women , the left breast is slightly — about 4 percent — larger than the right .
The factoid was buried in a discussion about sexual selection , the upshot of which is that breasts are a factor even in cultures that do n’t eroticize the chest any more than the face .
Breast symmetry is one cue of developmental stability , and large and symmetrical breasts suggest “ good genes . ”
That said , yes , it ’s normal to have one breast that is slightly larger than the other .
The larger your breasts , the more obvious the asymmetry .
For about 65 percent of us , the more voluminous one is the left .
But why ?
Breast asymmetry is associated with rapid growth spurts prior to and during puberty .
It ’s normal for one breast to respond more to surging estrogen levels .
Hormonal disruptions and other development problems accentuate the asymmetry .
But why the left ?
No one knows for sure , but there are interesting theories :
* The immune system is known to be functionally asymmetrical , and immune hypersensitivity is higher on the left side of the body .
It ’s possible that enhanced immunosensitivity has an effect on tissue - plumping growth hormones such as estrogen .
The immune system may send to the brain information that is asymmetrically expressed .
Immune system asymmetry may also explain why cancers occur 5 - 10 percent more often in the left breast and inflammation associated with herpes zoster affects the left side more than the right .
* Nursing infants may make the left breast even larger .
Although studies have not found a link between a larger left breast and handedness , many women report that they prefer having their dominant right hand free while breastfeeding , which means infants more often nurse on the left breast .
Favoring the left breast makes it larger .
Personally , I prefer the explanation my friend gave her curious eight - year - old daughter when she saw that Mom ’s left boob was bigger :
It ’s because I have a really big heart under it .
“ It takes money to make money . ”
Businesses , regardless of the scale , need to take into account their finances for various reasons such as for business expansion or for survival during bad times .
The way you fund your business could affect your capacity to implement certain plans like obtaining permits and licenses , hiring employees , purchasing inventory , marketing initiatives , and for business growth and expansion .
Although it is n’t essentially as vital as the vision of the business as well as the product / service it offer , finances are vital to make possible the good and great stuff .
Singapore SME Loan , for instance , provides loan assistance to small - medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in order for them to implement or carry out the plans they have for the business to grow and expand .
Some of the loan brokering service they offer include Working Capital and Business Term Loans , Equipment Financing and Hire Purchase , Commodity Trade Line and Financing , Temporary Bridging Loan , and Invoice Factoring .
Business Financial Management And Planning
Finance is necessary and essential for any business to help in carrying out and realizing the objectives and goals of the business .
Since finance is very much important , businesses should be responsible and careful in managing its finances , which is a crucial aspect to any business .
With financial management and planning , this will help in the decision - making processes , such as what to spend on , when is the right time to spend , as well as how much to spend , all of which depends on the availability of the funds .
Let ’s have a look at other reasons as to why finance and financial management is imperative in any business .
Financial Management Helps the Business to Continue to Exist
A good and successful business generates revenue .
This is where a business gets its finances to fund operational costs , such as payment for utility bills , procurement of inventory , and payment of the employees ’ salaries .
The more a business earns by selling quality products and / or services , the more the role of financial management and planning is crucial in a business as you ensure your earnings are put to good use for your business to continue to grow and exist .
Mismanagement of funds could be the collapse of a business .
Availability of Sufficient Funds
Adequate available funds are essential for short - term and long - term business goals to be achieved .
Having adequate available funds also ensures that there is enough available money for any unexpected circumstances .
Moreover , the business should also know where to get the funds should the need arise to handle the financial crisis .
Management System for Cash Flow
While a surplus of cash flow seems to be a good thing , managing it could be difficult .
Having a surplus of funds and not making use of it in such a way that is useful and beneficial to the business is a big waste of available financial resource .
Hence , you should have a plan on how and where to use these funds wherein it would build up your business and yield you more earnings .

From the ' better late than never ' files : Fedora Linux 11 was originally scheduled to be out this week ( May 26th ) , but that got bumped to June 2nd and now is being pushed back another week to June 9th .
Fedora staffer Jesse Keating noted that there was a late bug discovered in anaconda storage that is triggering the push back .
" The change is important
but invasive enough to require re-validating our storage tests , " Keating wrote in a mailing list posting .
" We were
already late in producing the Release Candidate and there is not enough
time to produce another one and validate it in time for next Tuesday's
release date .
Therefore we have decided to enact another week long slip
of the release . "
In the meantime , Fedora will push out a second release candidate and make sure it is validated ahead of June 9th .
" As much as we regret
slipping , we also wish to avoid easily trigger - able bugs in our release ,
particularly in software that cannot be fixed with a 0 - day update , " Keating wrote .
Personally , I think this is a very responsible move .
I know that many times with Fedora ( and other Linux distros too ) there is often a huge list of updates within the same day of an official release , making new releases a very painful and unstable experience .
Ensuring that the release is a solid as possible - especially in core elements - is good thing .
There are lots of new items in Fedora 11 to look forward too including full ext4 by default , faster boot times , DeviceKit and other features that will make this new release something to look forward too ( when finally released ) .

Photo by borman818 Money is one of those necessary evils that we can't live without , yet sometimes focus on too greatly as a source for happiness .
Yes , we all need it to survive , but in the end , it 's just our device for paying for goods and services .
Because it is a subject that none of us can avoid , I thought it would be fun to provide some historical facts about money .
Egyptians first began collecting taxes almost 5,000 years ago , beginning with offering goods and labor as their way of paying the tax .
This became much easier when Egypt and Mesopotamia started using silver and gold bars as currency , around 2500 B.C .
Founded in Italy in 1472 , and originally a pawnshop , Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , is the world 's oldest surviving bank .
Paper money originated in China in the year 910 and amazed Marco Polo when he visited there three centuries later .
Kublai Khan was known for over - printing notes and this eventually caused inflation to skyrocket .
Paper bills were abolished in China in the 15th century .
The cost of the U.S. Civil War inspired the U.S. government to introduce paper " green - backs " in July of 1861 .
The first paper notes were printed in denominations of 1 cent , 5 cents , 25 cents , and 50 cents .
Low - denomination U.S. bills do n't have a very long life - expectancy .
A $ 1 bill lasts 18 months ; $ 5 bill , two years ; $ 10 bill , three years ; $ 20 bill , four years ; and $ 50 and $ 100 bills , nine years .
All of the U.S. coins and bills in general circulation today have a total worth of about $ 829 billion and two - thirds of that cash is held overseas .
In a 2008 study , researchers found more cocaine residue on U.S. bills than on any other currency .
They also discovered fecal matter and staphylococcus .
Because of the filthiness of money , there was a time around 1916 in Washington D.C. when you could have your money washed , ironed , and reissued .
The paper used in U.S. bills is made of 75 % cotton and 25 % linen ; it is NOT made from trees .
Red and blue synthetic fibers of various lengths are distributed evenly throughout the paper .
Before World War I these fibers were made of silk .

The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing produces 38 million notes a day with a face value of approximately $ 541 million .
That does n't mean there is $ 541 million more money circulating today than there was yesterday , though , because 95 % of the notes printed each year are used to replace notes already in circulation .
The latest $ 5 bill design has an embedded security thread that contains more than 650,000 tiny glass domes , which create an optical illusion that the U.S.
Mint hopes will make it hard to counterfeit .
About half of U.S. bills ( 48 % ) printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing are $ 1 notes .
Martha Washington is the only woman whose portrait has appeared on a U.S. currency note .
It appeared on the face of the $ 1 Silver Certificate of 1886 and 1891 , and the back of the $ 1 Silver Certificate of 1896 .
U.S. bills measure 2.61 inches wide by 6.14 inches long , and the thickness is 0.0043 inches .
Larger sized notes in circulation before 1929 measured 3.125 inches by 7.4218 inches .
Paper money bears the signatures of four African American men who served as Registers of the Treasury ( Blanche K. Bruce , Judson W. Lyons , William T. Vernon , and James C. Napier ) and one African American woman who served as Treasurer of the United States ( Azie Taylor Morton ) .
No portraits of African Americans have appeared on paper money , but commemorative coins were issued in the 1940s bearing the images of George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington , followed more recently by the release of a Jackie Robinson coin .
In 1949 , Frank X. McNamara took friends to dinner in New York City , but forgot to bring his cash .
He vowed never to be embarrassed like that again , so he created the first credit card , the Diners Club Card .
It was initially made of cardboard and listed 14 participating restaurants on the back .
The original annual fee was just $ 3 .
The first ATM machine was built in 1967 by Scottish inventor , John Shepherd - Barron , for a Barclay 's Bank in North London .
He based the concept of the machine on a chocolate - bar dispenser .
Because plastic cards did not yet exist , Shepherd - Barron 's ATM accepted only checks laced with identifying traces of radioactive carbon - 14 .
Once the radioactivity was detected , customers would enter their four - digit PIN numbers .

We ask several roboticists , AI workers , SF writers , and other techie types a simple - minded question .
Is a Terminator - like scenario possible ?
And if so , how likely is it ?
The results are below :
David Brin
David Brin is a SF and non-fiction writer .
Among his most influential books are The Uplift War , Earth , The Postman , and the non-fictional The Transparent Society
Of course such a calamity is possible , and nightmares are great fun , in fiction and film .
Still , look at the premise .
Superficially , the lesson is the same one that the late Michael Crichton taught , every time : “ If man sticks his hand where it was n’t meant to go , it will get cut off ! ”
It is the old warning against hubris , as ancient as Gilgamesh .
But look closer .
From Terminator to Jurassic Park to The Matrix and so on , the real back - story is that the terrible new mistake — like AI or resurrected dinosaurs — was done in secret … and as stupidly as possible .
It ’s easy to see why this is done so often .
A director ’s # 1 need is to get the hero into dire , pulse - pounding jeopardy as quickly as possible !
Preferably against some overwhelming authority figure for the audience to hate , and for the hero to bring down , with little more than guts , defiance and sheer will .
Hey , I can dig it .
I ’ve gone to that well myself .
And the surest trick is to assume , from the start , that civilization failed .
That nobody blew a whistle , no professionals checked things out , no institutions functioned and that masses of bright citizens never had a clue .
Hey , it could go down that way !
Still , must that lazy assumption underlie every action epic , always and without exception ?
In fairness , some directors give an occasional nod toward a civilization that ’s not filled with clueless morons .
Spielberg , Cameron … and New York natives stand up for Spiderman in every film .
And the resulting films are more interesting .
In the Terminator world , it finally does boil down to the shared citizenship that I talk about in The Postman .
Everybody , your neighbors , standing up together and making more of a difference than any band of gods or demigods .

Your question is not that well defined !
First of all : Anything is possible in my world - view … it ’s all a question of probability …
But the Terminator scenario involves various aspects of differing degrees of plausibility ( hence differing degrees of estimated probability )
Backwards time travel ?
Maybe .
Many physicists feel it may be possible .
Backwards time travel , that does n’t come along with forwards time travel , and only transports you if you ’re naked ( and preferably studly ) ?
A bit less likely I ’d suggest …
Robots as smart , humanlike and hard - ass as the Terminator ?
VERY possible , no question .
Some SkyNet analogue taking over the world ?
Well , if someone built a global computer security system and intentionally made it highly intelligent , autonomous and creative … so as to allow it to better combat complex security threats ( and ever - more - intelligent computer worms and viruses ) … well , perhaps so .
It ’s not beyond the pale .
A narrow - AI computer security system would n’t spontaneously develop general intelligence , initiative and so forth ….
but an AGI computer security system might … and the boundary between narrow AI and AGI may grow blurry in the next decades …

On the face of it , it ’s ludicrous .
Why would a supposedly intelligent network mind waste so much energy and resources indulging in cinematically grandiose personal combat in grim wastelands with loud music ?
If it , for some reason , wanted to kill off humanity , it would just whip up a thousand new flu strains and release them all at once — and use neutron bombs to clean up .
On the other hand , if all you mean is are the robots going to take over , it ’s more or less inevitable , and not a moment too soon .
Humans are really too stupid , venal , gullible , mendacious , and self - deceiving to be put in charge of important things like the Earth ( much less the rest of the Solar System ) .
I strongly support putting AIs in charge because I ’m dead certain we can build ones that are not only smarter than human but more moral as well .

Time travel : Do n’t count on it .
Time travel that only works for naked people : Very doubtful .
The internet becomes self - aware and turns evil : Do n’t count on it .
T-1000 robots : Reply hazy , try again .
Novel self - assembling smart matter is undoubtedly in our future .
Many research groups are already developing materials that are capable of healing and replication ( two things that biology does extremely well ) .
Imagine smart infrastructure such as bridges and power lines that monitor and repair themselves , or search and rescue robots that can “ flow ” through debris and around obstacles to reassemble on the other side .
There is an enormous potential for incredible new technologies to grow out of these advances in fundamental material science .
( Homicidal obsessive robots made of smart matter : Outlook not so good . )
Backwards time travel , that does n’t come along with forwards time travel , and only transports you if you ’re naked ( and preferably studly ) ?
A bit less likely …
A robot - filled future : Without a doubt .
But these machines are unlikely to look anything like the terminators .
So far bipedal robots have been good for show but are largely impractical .
The robots of the future will be even more extraordinary and far stranger .
T4 will be wicked awesome : Outlook good .

Well , the time travel aspect of the Terminator movies probably is n’t possible , otherwise by now we ’d have a lot of tourists from the future coming back to take photos of quaint and carefree early 21st century life , and also to place winning bets .
What you ’re probably referring to is the idea that there comes a point in time where technology can function more or less autonomously from the people who created or administrated it , and that by some quirk of circumstance the technology comes to view humans as a hostile aggressor or an obstacle to progress which needs to be removed .
I was a teenager in the 1980s and so saw the first Terminator movie , although I must admit that it did n’t have very much effect on me because at that time the “ Terminator scenario ” just seemed like pure fantasy .
If you ask most people who are involved with robotics research or development today they will also dismiss the notion of a robotic takeover as merely an entertaining Hollywood plot device .
Despite some advances in the last couple of decades a vast chasm remains between the sorts of capabilities with which robots are endowed in the movies and what even the most advanced contemporary robots can do in reality .
The likelihood of a Terminator scenario occurring in the near future , as in the next few decades , seems nominal .
This is mainly because a great deal of work remains to be done in order to reach a point where technology becomes fully self - sustaining and can exist independently from human intervention for indefinite periods of time .
Even if the robots were to rise up and overthrow us , in the absence of infrastructure capable of sustaining their existence this would indeed be a Pyrrhic victory .
Looking to the longer term future , which might be the late 21st century or beyond , a Terminator scenario would at least in principle be possible if you make a sufficient number of assumptions .
In this flighty vision of a future world we imagine that the industrial revolution continues more or less unabated ( despite the end of cheap oil ) and the relentless march of automation — powered by the never ending quest for greater and greater economic efficiency — extends into all areas of life .
Agriculture is fully automated , as is virtually all industrial production , with humans living out little more than a parasitic existence , going along for a free , or almost free , ride .
We can safely assume that no significant changes have occurred within human psychology , and that wars still occur from time to time which are mainly targeted at disrupting the machinations of the technological bubble within which mankind has insulated himself .
If there is a time when humans are essentially superfluous — merely froth on the technological wave ( from the human perspective a kind of comfortable retirement ) — then it is at least in principle possible that we could be trivially usurped by a rival species of militant machinery .
Of course it ’s hard to make predictions about things that might or might not occur in the distant future , but one thing we can depend upon is that evolution will continue both in the biological and post - biological realms .
We may be able to hold rivals at bay by ensuring that we retain control over their ability to reproduce , but in the long term as a strategy this probably is n’t going to buy us very much time .
This is n’t a “ Judgment Day ” scenario though , it ’s just another chapter in the varied history of life on Earth , which has already seen countless batons transferred from one species to the next .
I ’m not much of a visionary though , and am far more concerned about things which might actually occur within my own lifetime .
In the next few decades I think there may be dangers arising from the uses and abuses of robotics technology , in a similar manner to the way that existing computer technology suffers from various forms of abuse .
As I write this , many of the industrialized nations are gearing up for telerobotic warfare — robot planes , and an assortment of unmanned ground vehicles .
What we ’ve already seen with the Predator UAV and Pacbots is just the tip of a very large iceberg .
As Illah Nourbakhsh put it in a recent talk , what we should fear in the foreseeable future is not unethical robots , but unethical roboticists ( see Resources below ) .
Unlike conventional fighter planes or tanks , telerobots capable of delivering deadly force will not be expensive to manufacture and so will inevitably fall into the hands of non-state actors which may include criminal gangs and cults .
As a near term scenario , imagine a cult consisting of a few tens of followers building a hundred telerobots equipped with firearms , then driving them into a city center , under supervisory control similar to a real time strategy game .
All of the technology needed for such a dastardly plan exists today , and will only get cheaper and less complex with time .
a Terminator - like scenario is not only theoretically possible , but also practical to fabricate in a foreseeable future .
People love to focus on grandiose gloom and doom scenarios — it makes their own personal troubles appear diminutive in stature — but at least as far as robotics is concerned I think the future is bright , and that the overwhelming majority of robotics applications in the foreseeable future will be peaceful and beneficial .

Yes , it is possible .
However , this requires further advances of a new field , called autonomous mental development ( AMD ) , which will publish its first issue of the new professional journal , IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development in May 2009 .
If a robot runs a task - specific program , its capabilities are very limited .
It is not able to deal with any of the complex scenes in Terminator .
However , robots that are capable of autonomous mental development are totally different .
They are able to develop their internal mental representations and skills while interacting with the physical world , very much like the way human individual develops from infancy to adulthood .
The AMD field has recently made some major breakthroughs that indicate that a human - like machine brain is possible from engineering point of view .
In other words , a Terminator - like scenario is not only theoretically possible , but also practical to fabricate in a foreseeable future .

Daniel H. Wilson completed his Ph.D. in robotics in 2005 at Carnegie Mellon University ’s Robotics Institute where he worked under Hans Moravec .
He is author of the humor book , How To Survive a Robot Uprising and host of The Works , a series on the History Channel that debuted on July 10 , 2008 .
Nothing is impossible , but the spontaneous evolution of a super - intelligent artificial intelligence ( e.g. , “ Skynet ” ) and the subsequent design , production , and employment of a fully autonomous robot army ( with “ Terminator ” model humanoid robots ) is unlikely in the extreme .
And do n’t even get me started on time travel .
On the other hand , I fully expect to see humanoid robots deployed to battle within the next several decades .
Terminator - style robots are easily and naturally tele - operated by human soldiers , they can use our weapons and vehicles , and they can naturally negotiate urban environments designed for humans .
Best of all , humanoid robots offer a natural means of interaction with potentially hostile locals — because these days war is less about conventional fighting on mass scale and more about cultural awareness .
So instead of unmanned robotic drones buzzing overhead , I imagine humanoid robots patrolling the streets wearing local garb , speaking the local language , and obeying local customs .

Vernor Vinge is the science fiction author largely credited with inventing the idea of the technological singularity .
Among his more influential books are Marooned in Realtime .
A Fire Upon the Deep , the short story collection True Names and Other Dangers , and his most recent novel Rainbows End .
When it comes to movies that depict existential threats , I do n’t think Terminator is as likely as classic oldies such as Dr. Strangelove and On the Beach .
The possibility of M.A.D. strategy nuclear war has been in eclipse since the departure of the Soviet Union and the rise of the nuclear terrorism threat , but in the future it is a very real risk , whether as an accident , a side effect of other crises ( such as global warming ) , or from diplomatic bungling ( such as brought us World War I ) .

.
An assassin drives toward his mark .
He drops guards left and right ; smooth , calm , and emotionless .
He breaches the mansion and meets up with his teammate .
She is disguised as a maid ; already in place on the inside of the staff .
They cover each other and make their kill .
They are flawless and clean , known only as Phantom .
There is a flash - back to the start of the story .
The young man , not yet an assassin , wakes in an unfamiliar bed .
He does not know who he is , but begins to piece together his surroundings .
He knows someone is after him , but not why .
Using a pipe to break the locked door he escapes and runs headlong into a masked female figure .
She instructs him to fight seriously or he will be killed .
They begin to fight … scientists watch from a detached control room , monitoring his progress .
Upon subduing the woman ( who we recognize as the other assassin from the intro ) he is tranquilized .
The scientists explain their plan of conscripting him to their service , rather than killing him for what “ he has seen ” .
They name him Zwei , the second half of Phantom ( with Ein being the other ) .
The instruct Ein to begin his training .
We are taken through his physical training , mental preparation , and weapons instruction .
He is retrained from the ground up .
He learns that by following orders he can subdue the pain of not knowing who he is .
Now , somewhat emotionless from the training , he meets another woman who we have seen earlier ( as an upper member of the mysterious organization ) .
She lets him know he is not a slave , that he has the power to accelerate his life and maybe , in time , lead the organization .
The opening credits of this series have a definite feel of a 007 movie intro .
There is a great deal of mystery surrounding this organization , who ’s only stated goals are uniting the entire criminal underworld .
It has promise , and I will be checking out at least a few more episodes to see where it ’s going
Overall Hook Rating : B
The scale of the D - Day landings , 65 years ago this week , will never be repeated .
But this last hurrah for British military might also have become the model for armed intervention from Bosnia to Afghanistan , says Peter Caddick - Adams .
Sixty - five years after the event , the 1944 campaign in Normandy remains a battle of awe - inspiring proportions .
The simple facts of D - Day itself still conjure visions of wonder in an era used to telephone - number salaries , international travel and lightning - speed communication , and represented an unprecedented feat of military planning .
Two hundred thousand seamen manned 6,939 ships , including 1,213 warships .
One astonished German described the off - shore scene as " a city on the water " .
Putting troops ashore involved 4,126 landing vessels of all types , including 1,073 tank landing craft , as well as 864 merchant ships .
American troops muster on Utah beach
By the day 's end , the Allies had deposited 132,715 troops and 20,000 vehicles directly on to the beaches , with another 23,490 parachutists and glider - borne troops dropped by the allied air forces .
The aerial armada supported the landings with 11,590 aircraft , which flew 14,674 sorties .
In the previous nine weeks 197,000 sorties had been flown ( at a cost of 1,251 aircraft and 12,000 aircrew ) and 195,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on German military and communications targets .
The cover of Time Magazine called the 1994 Normandy celebrations
The Last Crusade , implying that in the future no single invasion fleet or military force would be so concentrated - the subsequent invention and deployment of atomic weapons with their awesome destructive capabilities would make such a fleet too vulnerable a target .
It was Britain 's last day as a superpower .
No army in the world today could project such force and much of the effort on 6 June 1944 was British - about 60 % of the troops landed were UK or Commonwealth ( Canadians ) ; the warships were predominantly from the Royal Navy - even the landing craft taking the Americans to Omaha Beach were manned by British seamen - and much of the air power came from the RAF .
The allied co-operation for the campaign was the military forerunner of modern coalition warfare , Nato and the political antecedent of the EU
The senior commanders under Eisenhower ( an American ) were all British , led by Montgomery .
So the clock started ticking as more US troops gradually arrived ( and therefore started taking a higher percentage of the casualties ) and eventually the Americans had enough men ashore to warrant their own Army Group and their own direct command under Eisenhower .
So , while the Normandy campaign ended with more of an American flavour , it was prefaced by our last hurrah on D - Day itself .
We have never competed with the Americans on anything like equal terms since .
One of the myths of Operation Overlord ( the codename for the invasion of France ) is it was the biggest seaborne invasion in history .
It was not .
Nor was it the biggest maritime invasion of World War II .
That accolade goes to the 1943 invasion of Sicily - a far greater undertaking than Normandy and one from which many valuable lessons were learned .
Worse than Somme Ironically , because of the casualties , the Normandy campaign ended up as more attritional than the worst battles of the 1914 - 18 war , something its commanders - haunted by the shadow of the Somme - desperately tried to avoid .
The scene on Utah beach
Enlarge Image
The campaign lasted 77 days ( as against the 90 days predicted by allied planners ) , and resulted in the destruction of the German Seventh Army and Fifth Panzer Army in the Falaise Pocket by 21 August .
Some 209,672 allied soldiers were killed , wounded or went missing , 16,714 allied aircrew lost their lives .
German losses were estimated at 250,000 .
Additionally , 2,483 Normans connected with the French Resistance were executed before or during the campaign , while as many as 35,000 civilians died ( the lowest estimate is 15,000 ) and 60,000 were wounded in the liberation .
This averages out at 6,600 casualties per day for the entire campaign .
This daily average exceeds the Great War daily casualty rates of Verdun 1916 ( 2,300 per day over 299 days ) , the Somme 1916 ( 6,400 / day over 142 days ) or Passchendaele 1917 ( 4,600 / day over 113 days ) .
By mid-July 1944 , the region was as heavily populated with troops as the Western Front of World War I : there were 2,052,299 allied troops and nearly half - a- million German soldiers in Normandy that summer of 1944 .
Rainbow coalition From a purely European spectacle , it can be argued that the allied co-operation for the campaign was the military forerunner of modern coalition warfare , Nato and the political antecedent of the European Union .
More than 200,000 casualties British , Free French , Belgian , Dutch , Luxembourgois , Czechs , Poles , Greek , Danish and Norwegian naval and military forces all took part , or flew overhead with the vast air armada .
Many soldiers from the Irish Republic fought with British units , while some anti-Nazi Austrians and German Jews were involved in the allied deception and intelligence war .
You 'll find a rainbow of nationalities in Normandy this summer - Swedish and Chinese , Pakistani , Nigerian and Colombian military folk all trek to the region , for the campaign is widely studied today by military leaders from around the world .
They walk the terrain looking not at the tactics , but at the example of a multinational military operation , encompassing air , land and sea forces , which ended in victory but saw costly mistakes and unwelcome surprises along the way .
In many ways , the way military business has been done in Bosnia , Iraq or Afghanistan and on UN peacekeeping missions owes much to the seeds sown on 6 June 1944 .

Microblogging Mormons are up in arms after the Twitter account of the Church of Latter Day Saints was hijacked by pranksters .
Scallywags broke into the profile , probably by taking advantage of a weak password , to post tweets suggesting that the founder of the church , Joseph Smith , was a liar .
Mendacious updates to the @LDSChurchNews feed suggested Smith had fabricated translations of sacred texts .
A number of followers subsequently posted their concerns about the messages on the microblogging site , net security firm Sophos reports .
A report by Church News , the official news site of the LDS Church , confirmed that the Mormons shut down the compromised account on Thursday after it was hijacked by hackers last weekend .
The church found it tricky to track down Twitter administrators but received a sympathetic hearing once they did get in touch .
It 's unclear when the suspended account , which had been active for about two months , will be restored .
Twitter profile hacking , more generally , is becoming increasingly commonplace .
Previous victims have included the New York Times and Britney Spears , among many others . ®
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - British actor Christian Bale forced a rewrite of upcoming action movie “ Terminator Salvation , ” because his star had grown too big for the small role of John Connor he chose , the filmmakers said on Friday .
Director McG , whose real name is Joseph McGinty Nichol , said he had the disconcerting experience of going to England to convince Bale to play central character Marcus Wright in the man vs. machines film , only to have Bale tell the director he wanted to play Connor instead .
McG told reporters that the script was a “ moving target ” that became a filmmaking challenge , and that he worked day and night with Bale , who starred last year in box office smash “ The Dark Knight , ” talking about how to work Connor into the movie .
Connor is an iconic character in the film franchise that began in 1984 with “ The Terminator , ” but his role was originally small in the series ’ fourth movie , “ Terminator Salvation , ” which debuts in theaters on May 21 .
“ A lot of the work was integrating ( Connor ) into scenes ... and having that feel integral and sensible , as opposed to grafted on just because there was a star in the part , ” John Brancato , a screenwriter on the film , told reporters .
He said originally the main character was Marcus Wright , an executed death row inmate who donates his body to science , and re-emerges alive after machines have taken over the world by unleashing a nuclear holocaust on mankind .
In the movie , Connor and Wright become equally important characters .
Wright is played by Australian actor Sam Worthington .
Bale said that he asked to be consulted about who would play Worthington opposite him .
“ There ’s a benefit of currently a lot of people in the States not being familiar with him , and so you can really enjoy that performance that much more , ” Bale said .
“ He ’s got so many movies that are going to be coming out , because many other people have realized that he ’s bloody good . ”
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
For 65 years , Elisabeth Mann has carried with her the pain only a Holocaust survivor can know .
Elisabeth Mann , the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust , sits with her children , Nancy and Thomas .
The only one in her Hungarian Jewish family to make it out of the Nazi death camps , life for a long time felt like punishment .
Branded in her mind are the images of , for example , a pile of babies set ablaze , snarling dogs and the laughter of an SS officer pointing to the black smoke of incinerated bodies that filled the sky .
And on her heavy heart is the anguish , including the blame she feels for her brother Laci 's death .
He was 13 and not feeling well when the family arrived by cattle car at Auschwitz - Birkenau .
Watch Mann describe the brutal trip to the camp »
" I told him to go with my mother because mothers are the people who take care of sick children , " she cried , while sitting in her Los Angeles , California , home .
" I did n't know that with my advice I killed my brother because all the mothers and all the children were taken to the gas chamber right away . "
Given the horrors she 's lived and witnessed , one might think Mann , now in her 80s , would be among those demanding that Nazi war criminals be brought to justice .
And yet she 's uncomfortable with the ongoing attempts to deport to Germany for trial John Demjanjuk , an 89 - year - old Cleveland , Ohio , man allegedly linked to mass killings at Sobibor , a death camp in Poland .
Demjanjuk insists it was n't him .
The pursuit of him -- and of suspects like him -- is n't one Mann supports .
She said she never wanted revenge , because " I did not want to be like them . "
Mann does n't think going after war criminals now is worth the cost and energy , nor does she think the legal process will make a difference to such men who 've already lived a full life .
Watch Mann explain why money is wasted in the hunt »
" What is punishment for a person who is capable to do such horror , such horrible things to living people ? "
Mann , an artist , wondered aloud .
" I cannot imagine that that person has a soul or conscience or heart .
...
He simply would n't feel it .
...
What kind of punishment could you give to a person like that ? "
Her argument does n't work for Efraim Zuroff , who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust , a systematic effort that wiped out 6 million Jews , or two - thirds of European Jewry .
" It has to be clear to everybody that the Holocaust was not a natural disaster .
...
It was created by man , against man , " he said from Jerusalem , Israel , where he coordinates Nazi war crimes research for the Simon Wiesenthal Center , a Jewish human rights organization .
" When responsibility can be determined , people have to be held accountable . "
On Monday , the day before Holocaust Remembrance Day , the center released its latest status report on Nazi war criminal investigations and prosecutions .
Demjanjuk tops the list of the 10 most wanted .
Others on the list include Sandor Kepiro , a former Hungarian officer who allegedly helped kill 1,200 people in Novi Sad , Serbia , as well as Milivoj Asner , a onetime Croatian police chief , now believed to be living in Austria , who allegedly persecuted and deported to the Nazi camps hundreds of Jews , Serbs and Gypsies .
In a written statement about the report , Zuroff said that since the start of 2001 , there have been 76 convictions , at least 48 indictments , and hundreds of investigations have been launched .
Central to these actions has been a project Zuroff has helped oversee called Operation : Last Chance , a push -- started in 2002 -- to support worldwide government efforts to pursue aging Nazi war crime suspects .
While some countries have stepped up , including the U.S. , Germany , Serbia and Spain , others , such as Australia , Austria and Ukraine , have shown a " lack of political will " and have failed to act , the statement says .
" The easiest thing in the world is to just forget , " Zuroff , 60 , said by phone .
" The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the murderers .
...
We do n't think people deserve a prize for reaching an old age . "
Mann 's own children could n't agree more .
Like Zuroff , they think pursuing Nazi war criminals is the least that can be done to honor victims .
" I 'm definitely in favor of going after these folks , regardless of their age , " said Mann 's daughter , Nancy .
" A lot of people suffered , and are still suffering , because of the crimes that were done in the past . "
Watch daughter explain that ' murder is murder ' »
Thomas , Mann 's son , said that going after Nazi war criminals " sends a message to our society and the world that it 's not OK to do these things , " and that it helps bring awareness " to people who do n't know about the Holocaust , and there are lots of them . "
Watch son on why punishment falls short »
He told the story of a college freshman in Southern California who stood up during a presentation his mother was giving and said she 'd never heard of the Holocaust .
" That really brings it home , " Thomas said .
By pursuing suspected Nazi criminals , the process " reminds people that this did happen " and shows that " people do care that this happened . "

The Most Dangerous Bike Ride Trail
For those who want to experience an unforgettable adrenalin rush , you need to refuse to settle with anything short of the best .
For the passionate bike riders who are willing to travel to The Cliffs of Moher there is a treat in store , the most dangerous bike ride trail on this planet .
The mare sight of it makes me dizzy .
So , if your willing and brave enough here is a sneak preview of what you could find there .
A Gem of Ireland : The Cliffs of Moher
Towering at a top height of 700 feet above the Atlantic ocean , the Cliffs of Moher located near the charming ( I fell in love with it ) town of Doolin in Co. Clare Ireland offer a truly enriching experience for the brave and adventurous at heart .
You know all about Jack and Kelly Osbourne , but what about Aimee ?
Aimee Osbourne is the oldest daughter of rock legend Ozzy Osbourne and TV host Sharon Osbourne , but she opted out of being part of the family 's MTV reality show , The Osbournes .
In fact , she even criticized her parents for series .
Instead , the 25 - year - old has been focusing on her singing and acting careers .
Osbourne was even a part of MTV's Wuthering Heights ( 2003 ) alongside Erika Christensen , and Katherine Heigl .
Osbourne is also currently a columnist for the pop culture magazine , Nylon , and has appeared in her share of fashion shows .
Strobe lights and smoke in the air are common in a night club , but in a classroom ?
A freshman at Clayton Valley High School in Concord , California says that 's just what she had to endure in algebra as her classmates went wild .
" People smoking marijuana in the classroom .
They smoke cigarettes . "
Arielle said .
" There was one kid who peed in a bottle and threw it across the room . "
Arielle Moore used her cell phone to capture 30 seconds of the bizarre behavior she witnessed in her class so she could show her parents how hard it was to learn in the environment .
When school officials saw the chaotic snippet , they suspended a few students -- including Arielle .
They say she was n't allowed to videotape the classroom .
They eventually cleared Arielle 's suspension .
After lying dormant for a few months , the Sun is once again witnessing revival of Coronal Mass Ejection ( CME ) activities since May 5 .
On May 5 , the Sun produced an impressive coronal mass ejection ( CME ) and a burst of radio emissions , signalling the passage of a shock wave through its outer atmosphere , an alert from NASA said on Thursday .
NASA 's STEREO - B spacecraft is monitoring an active region hidden behind the Sun's Eastern limb since the big star was spotless for last few months .
" The activity continued apace on May 6 , with at least two more eruptions .
The blast site is not yet visible from Earth , but the sun is turning the region toward us for a better view ... may be on May 7 and 8 , " NASA said .
Welcoming this renewed activity , after remaining " silent " ( without sun spots ) for a period of atleast six months , astronomers of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ( TIFR ) said , " with the advent of activity , we will be able to get new clues on the delay and also the beginning of a new 11 - year - solar cycle , which is due this year .
" Besides , the shock front propagating or moving away from the Sun will also provide clues to the interplanetary medium , Dr Mayank Vahia of TIFR said .
Forecasts in 2006 predicted Cycle 24 to start between late 2007 and early 2008 , but new estimates suggested a delay until 2009 .
" The scientists are curious to know whether a new - cycle sunspot was in the offing shortly .
For the last few months the Sun was silent and there was no sun spots on it , " Vahia said .
Scientists have also made some observations on the sun which was silent and the data would be precious , he said .
" It is always fascinating to study the active Sun , " SM Chitre , a former theoretical solar astronomer of TIFR added .

She chats with an accountant and also with a curious journalist ( played by the New York magazine writer Mark Jacobson ) , and pays a visit to a creepy sex geek whose Web site rates the services of New York ’s escorts and who styles himself the Erotic Connoisseur .
( He is played by Glenn Kenny , a film critic and entertainment writer  and thus a cordial screening - room acquaintance of mine  with a combination of grandiose self - regard and theatrical self - disgust that recalls Orson Welles in his Paul Masson wine commercials . )
What Chelsea reveals , as she tries to refine her marketing strategies and improve her brand , is not that everyone is a whore  equating capitalism with prostitution would be an easy , moralizing route for the film to take  but rather that everyone is hustling , trying to get a bit of leverage in a tough economic climate .
Chelsea , which might not be her real name , has a live - in boyfriend named Chris ( Chris Santos ) , who works as a personal trainer , tending to the bodies of some of the same kinds of guys who hire Chelsea for her services .
The similarities between them are established a little too pointedly , but they are nonetheless thought provoking .
Both Chris and Chelsea belong to a sector of the economy that depends on the blurring of certain distinctions , between service and friendship , say , or profit and affection .
Therapists , exercise instructors , nannies , manicurists , bartenders  when you think about it , they are all paid for something that can easily be mistaken for love .
“ The Girlfriend Experience ” traces this potential category mistake in both directions .
One john , as he and Chelsea strip down , rhapsodizes about the communication between them , which of course is the basis for any successful relationship .
( “ Yeah , totally , ” she says , slipping between the sheets . )
But Chelsea , who experiences a twinge of romantic jealousy  disguised , perhaps , as professional rivalry  when she sees a once - loyal client on the town with another escort , is not immune to such feelings and finds herself drawn to a sympathetic new customer in ways that throw her off balance .
This upsets Chris , and it also puts a crack in the movie ’s smooth veneer of cynical indifference .
The idea that Chelsea , the girlfriend for sale , is herself succumbing to the false allure of the girlfriend experience , is an interesting one , but neither the script , by Brian Koppelman and David Levien ( who also wrote “ Ocean ’s Thirteen ” ) , nor Ms. Grey ’s cool , tentative acting can quite sustain the level of emotional complication necessary to bring it to dramatic life .
Mr. Soderbergh ’s fractured chronology and chilly , observant style do n’t help matters .
The film , having mystified Chelsea ’s poise and made much of her gift for persuasive artifice , cannot manage the complication of her vulnerability or chart the terrain of her inner life .
And this may be the point , at least in part .
“ The Girlfriend Experience ” is about , and also traffics in , the intoxification of surfaces , and to say it objectifies Ms. Grey , who is very young ( just 21 ) and very pretty , would be more plot summary than critique .
Ms. Grey , whose career in pornography has been distinguished both by the extremity of what she is willing to do and an unusual degree of intellectual seriousness about doing it , is not so much acting here as posing a series of philosophical problems , testing the conceptual and experiential boundaries between degradation and empowerment , predator and prey , person and commodity .

All winter you have the house closed up and the furnace on .
A good part of the summer you have the house closed up and the air conditioning on .
When you think about it , not much fresh air gets through .
And with today ’s newer homes being built tighter to make them more energy - efficient , more indoor pollution gathers and does n’t have a chance to escape or let fresh air in .
This could lead to the sick building syndrome or you feeling sick all the time .
There are specific types of houseplants you can easily grow to diminish indoor pollution plus other simple ways that can clean the air inside your home .
Some of the poisons and indoor pollution that are found in homes are benzene , formaldehyde , acetone , carbon tetra chloride , chloroform , dichlorobenzene , ethyl acetate , methylene chloride , tetrachloroethylene , toluene , trichloroethylene and xylene .
More than 350 chemicals were found in the common home in a 1984 study .
NASA has conducted studies with houseplants and indoor poisons .
A more comprehensive study in 1990 by PCAC and Wolverton Environmental Services , Inc expanded on the NASA study and tested fifty houseplants for their ability to remove these various toxins and gases and clean the indoor air .
Formaldehyde might be the most common found in homes , it is in foam insulation , plywood , particle board , floor coverings , carpet backing , adhesive binders , tobacco smoke and most common household cleaning products to name a few .
Benzene is found in tobacco smoke , gasoline , synthetic fibers , inks , oils , plastics and detergents .
Trichloroethylene ( TCE ) is another commonly found poison in inks , paints , dry cleaning , varnishes and lacquers .
Other toxins removed by listed plants are xylene , toluene and ammonia .
Houseplants by themselves can reduce and eliminate a certain amount of poisons , toxic gases and odors from your home .
You can enhance the removal of these toxins by surrounding the roots of the houseplants with activated charcoal .
According to the NASA study , the activated carbon or activated charcoal absorbs larger quantities of the toxins and poisons and retains them until the roots , soil and microorganisms degrade and assimilate these toxins .
You can put the activated charcoal on the top of the dirt and also at the bottom of the houseplant pots to attract the harmful toxins into the pots .
One brand that I know that you can buy at the garden shop is called Hoffman horticultural charcoal .
This also keeps the soil fresh in each houseplant pot .
Over watering houseplants can have a negative effect if the soil starts to get moldy .
This can cause allergies in the home .
Water when the houseplant is dry down to 1 ” to 2 ” or you can buy a water meter for houseplants .
Where should you put the houseplants
Plants can look nice almost anywhere and you should put them anywhere , but there is an area called your personal living area .
This is an area where you spend most of your time , sitting at the computer , sleeping or on the couch or chair reading or watching TV .
Your personal breathing zone is an area of 6 to 8 cubic feet ( 0.17 to 0.23 cu. m. ) .
Put at least a couple of plants in this zone .
At the bottom of the article I listed the most efficient plants for reducing toxins .
Other ways to clean indoor air
To get rid of odors including cigarette smoke , you can leave a couple bowls of white vinegar or activated charcoal sitting out .
Both will do a nice job of getting rid of odors .
You can put baking soda on carpet and furniture and let it sit before vacuuming .
Note : I will add this as a warning , some people , including myself , are very allergic to products like Carpet Fresh , so be careful when using products like this .
In fact so allergic it put me in the emergency room one night with breathing problems .
It is best to use baking soda .
Use ventilation fans occasionally , most homes have at least one ventilation fan .
Turn it on once in awhile and cause the air to circulate , this will dilute the accumulated toxins in the indoor air .
Use a HEPA vacuum .
HEPA stands for high - efficiency particulate air filter .
When changing filters in your air conditioner or furnace , look for a filter with a high MERV rating , which stands for minimum efficiency reporting value .
This is the industry rating system that measures the ability of the filter to trap particles .
This last method of cleaning your house is n’t simple nor can you do it yourself , but having the ducts in your house cleaned professionally can remove many allergens and accumulated dust .
These are the top 25 houseplants listed in order of their ability to remove the most toxins and poisonous gases :
Corn plant ( Dracaena massangeana ) Dumb cane ( Camilla ) Dumb cane ( Exotica ) Peace lily Peach lily Warneckei Dendrobium orchid Gerbera daisy King of hearts Lady Jane Weeping fig Areca palm Azalea Bamboo palm Dragon tree Dwarf date palm English ivy Florist ’s mum Janet Craig Kimberly queen fern Lady palm Lily turf Parlor palm Peacock plant Tulip
Other houseplants are ;
Aloe vera , Arrowhead vine , Boston fern , Chinese evergreen , Christmas cactus , Chrysanthemum , Dracaena marginata , Ficus alii , Golden pathos , Heart leaf philodendron , Lacy tree philodendron , Marginata , Moth orchid , Mother - in - law tongue , Mums , Prayer plant , Red emerald philodendron , Rubber plant , Schefflera , Spider plant , Wax begonia

Minute Maid Park booze vendor could lose a license Ballpark alcohol seller could lose a license
Recommended Video :
The company that sells alcoholic beverages at Minute Maid Park could lose one of its state licenses at the stadium because of an incident last summer in which an allegedly drunken driver leaving an Astros game hit and killed a pedestrian .
Catering giant Aramark , which holds the ballpark ’s concessions contract , faces an administrative hearing because of allegations that it sold or delivered alcohol to an intoxicated person , according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission .
Cancellation of the permit is the standard penalty for a case this severe , said TABC Capt.
Rick Cruz .
A date for the hearing has not been set .
The possible permit revocation does not mean that the ballpark suddenly will go dry .
Aramark has two licenses and only one is in jeopardy , the TABC said .
The agency did not say which permit — beer or liquor — is involved .
The two permits cover different parts of the ballpark and different types of beverages , the agency said .
Aramark declined to comment .
TABC spokeswoman Carolyn Beck said in cases of cancellation another owner or operator may be allowed to get a permit for the same location .
Should Aramark lose one of its licenses , another vendor might be able to step in and acquire a permit , she said .
An Astros representative could not be reached for comment .
Cruz said the TABC investigation began in February .
He would not reveal details of the probe , but prosecutors and police said it arose from the death of a Texas Department of Transportation worker , David Hall Jr. , who was struck while working on a downtown Houston street on Aug. 30 .
Hall was assisting a cleanup crew in the left lane in the 100 block of Travis when authorities say Ray John Wilson veered around a TxDOT truck blocking the left lane and hit him .
Wilson , an Aramark employee , continued for about a quarter of a mile before he was stopped by a police officer in an unmarked car , authorities said .
Police arrested him on suspicion of DWI , as well as failure to stop and render aid .
Prosecutors said Wilson failed a field sobriety test and tested over the legal limit for alcohol .
He faces trial in August on intoxication manslaughter charges .
“ We definitely have reason to believe that he was given free drinks , ” said Houston Police Department Officer Don Egdorf .
Egdorf said Wilson told officers he had not been working and had had only two drinks at the ballpark , but investigators said they believe he consumed more .
Egdorf said Wilson admitted he was coming from the Astros game .
The fatal crash happened minutes after he left the ballpark .
Hall ’s family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Wilson .
Aramark has not been named a defendant , but proceedings have been halted pending the outcome of the criminal case .

In London on Saturday the 16th of May , a national demonstration takes places demanding that Palestine be freed by the lifting of the siege and the ending of the Israeli occupation .
By : Sameh A. Habeeb
The demonstration marks the continued determination of the pro-Palestine movement in Britain to push for justice .
Enormous demonstrations took place all over Britain during the Israeli massacre of December and January , and now the British will tell their government and the world that they have n't forgotten and have n't forgiven just because the occupation has returned to its pre-December 27th levels .
While Gordon Brown has ignored calls for an independent inquiry in to the massacre , much of the British population has found it impossible to accept the Prime Minister 's position .
The demonstrators will aassemble at 12 noon on Malet Street , London WC1E 7HY and march to Trafalgar Square where performers and speakers will include : Lowkey , Mecca 2 Medina , Jeremy Hardy , speakers from Gaza , the West Bank and East Jerusalem , Jeremy Corbyn MP , Martin Linton MP , George Galloway MP , Daud Abdullah - Deputy Gen Sec Muslim Council of Britain , Jean Lambert MEP , Jenny Tonge MEP , Manuel Hassassian - Palestinian General Delegate to the UK .
The demonstration was called by : Palestine Solidarity Campaign , Stop the War Coalition , British Muslim Initiative , Palestinian Forum in Britain and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament .
And is supported by : Action Palestine , Amos Trust , Arab Media Watch , Association of Palestinian Communities UK , Britain - Palestine Twinning Network , Campaign Against the Arms Trade , Friends of Al - Aqsa , Friends of Lebanon , Friends of Sabeel UK , The Green Party , Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions UK , Jewish Socialist 's Group , Jews for Justice for Palestinians , Labour Friends of Palestine , Midlands Palestinian Community Association , Muslim Association of Britain , NUS Black Students Campaign , UNISON , Pax Christi , Public and Commercial Services Union , Rail Maritime and Transport Union , Viva Palestina , War on Want , Zaytoun .

A Sneak Peak at Google Wave
Over the last years the web has moved towards more real - timeness and collaboration , with plenty of online communication forms to choose from .
Google now is showing off a preview of a new product , framework and protocol called Google Wave .
I ’ve not seen this in action yet but judging from the screenshots and descriptions , Google Wave ( the product ) is an app running in modern browsers which is part wiki , part chat , part collaborative office and sharing tool , and part email .
Take a look at the screenshot below , via Google :
To the left side you ’ll see a navigation pane offering you to view the Inbox , Active threads – or “ waves ” , as Google calls them – a history , spam waves and more .
The inbox lists threads in which you participate , because ( if I understand it right ) you started them or were invited .
A particular thread can consist of a mail - type conversation with a friend , like “ BBQ on Sunday , ” or a document sharing photo snapshots , which are drag - and - dropped into the document window .
That document window , to the right , offers the multi-user real time view onto the document , and you apparently can edit in different places within it .
You can also play - back the history of the document to see how it evolved .
Avatars of the people participating in a particular wave can be seen on top .
If two people are online at the same time then “ a wave acts just like an instant message – except that you see each character as it is typed , ” Tim O’Reilly writes .
“ When you ’re talking with someone , you know what someone is saying before they finish their sentence .
You can respond , or even finish their sentence for them .
So too with Wave . ”
Search is provided at the top of the middle pane .
It ’s apparently real time , too , and searches can be saved and added to the left side navigation .
Sounds cool ?
Let ’s see what Google will release .
“ Google Wave will be available later this year , ” Google writes on their Wave homepage , and the following pieces are available elsewhere :
The following screenshots further show off the functionality of the program , courtesy of Google , and if you want to know more , Techcrunch has a good write - up too .
Without a real live app to test we need to keep in mind though that Google may talk about all the glory of the app but hardly jump to point out potential quirks , bugs and shortcomings .
I ’m curious how well the app will live up to the very interesting bits we were offered , which browsers exactly it supports ( and at what speed ) , and how its features compare to those of blogging platforms , chat programs , mail clients , wikis , real time collaboration tools like Etherpad , and social news sites like Friendfeed .
Collaborative ( rich ) text editing
An extension to Wave handling event planning
A map is included

Materials researchers at Penn State University have reported the highest known breakdown strength for a bulk glass ever measured .
Breakdown strength , along with dielectric constant , determines how much energy can be stored in an insulating material before it fails and begins to conduct electricity .
A bulk glass with high breakdown strength and high dielectric constant would make an ideal candidate for the next generation of high energy density storage capacitors to power more efficient electric vehicles , as well as other portable and pulsed power applications .
The highest dielectric breakdown strengths for bulk glasses are typically in the 4 - 9 MV / cm range .
The breakdown strength for the tested samples were in the 12 MV / cm range , which in conjunction with a relatively high permittivity , resulted in energy densities of 35 J/cm3 , as compared to a maximum energy density of 10 J/cm3 for polypropylene , the most common dielectric for pulsed power applications .
“ For a bulk glass , this is extraordinary , ” says Nick Smith , a Ph.D. candidate in materials science and engineering at Penn State , who is lead author on the report and performed the testing .
Smith used samples of 50 micron - thick commercial glass , which he etched for testing with hydrofluoric acid until the samples were only 10 - 20 microns thick .
The resulting glass was so thin it could be flexed like a piece of plastic film , yet so delicate it could easily disintegrate if mishandled .
The thinner the glass , the more electric field can be applied before failure .
The etched glass was placed in a polymer fluid for testing and up to 30,000 volts were applied .
When the breakdown point was reached , electricity began to flow through the glass suddenly , with a flash and a bang that resembles a lightning bolt conducting through air .
The polymer fluid was used to contain the lightning .
In each case , failure occurred within 40 to 80 seconds .
The bulk glass tested is an alkali - free barium boroaluminosilicate glass produced in large quantities for flat panel displays and microelectronics packaging .
Its high energy storage capability is attributed to the highly polarizable barium atoms , which contribute to the enhanced permittivity , and the alkali - free composition , which inhibits energy loss .
Also a factor is the nearly defect - free quality of the glass .
The specific process used to manufacture this glass yields a more flaw - free material , especially at the surface , which further enhances resistance to breakdown .
Sheets of 30 - micron - thick glass , which are expected to be available commercially in the near future , are likely to have even higher breakdown strength than the etched glass due to an even more uniform flaw - free surface .
“ This opens a potentially new market for glass , ” says Smith .
“ We are always looking for new functionalities in glass .
Ideally , manufacturing will get to a point where they can make any size sheet they need for any size capacitor . ”
Contributing author Michael Lanagan points out that engineering challenges remain as they scale up from the small size glass capacitors tested to those ready for commercial production .
“ We ’ll lose some of the energy density as we increase in volume , " he says , “ but we should still end up with some remarkable capacitance . ”
In addition to Smith , the authors are graduate student Badri Rangarajan , engineering science and mechanics , Michael T. Lanagan , associate professor of engineering science and mechanics , and Carlo G. Pantano , distinguished professor of materials science and engineering .

Under fire from Republicans for what she knew about harsh questioning of terror detainees , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday acknowledged that she had learned in 2003 that the C.I.A. had subjected suspects to waterboarding , but she asserted that the agency had misled Congress about its techniques .
At a tense press conference , Ms. Pelosi said for the first time that a staff member alerted her in February 2003 that top lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee had been briefed on the use of tough interrogation methods on terror suspects .
But she said the fact that she did not speak out at the time due to secrecy rules did not make her complicit in any abuse of detainees .
She accused the C.I.A. and Bush administration of lying to Congress about what was actually transpiring with the detainees .
“ I am saying that the C.I.A. was misleading the Congress and at the same time the administration was misleading the Congress on weapons of mass destruction , ” Ms. Pelosi said .
Ms. Pelosi said she was told at that briefing that waterboarding , one of the most controversial of the harsh techniques employed , was not being used .
The C.I.A. , reacting to Ms. Pelosi ’s remarks , said that agency records declassified last week and cited by congressional Republicans show that Ms. Pelosi had taken part in a September 2002 briefing on interrogation techniques was “ true to the language in the Agency ’s records . ”
An agency spokesman , George Little , added that the C.I.A. director , Leon E. Panetta , had pointed out in a recent letter to Congress that the information “ is drawn from the past files of the C.I.A. ” and represented contemporaneous memoranda “ and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals . ”
According to the C.I.A. records , Ms. Pelosi attended the Sept. 4 briefing about the agency ’s interrogation techniques with her Republican counterpart , Representative Porter J. Goss of Florida .
Based on agency notes from the briefing , the two lawmakers were told the specific techniques “ that had been employed ” on Abu Zubaydah .
By then , that C.I.A. already used a number of harsh methods on Mr. Zubaydah , including waterboarding .
The C.I.A. records do not list the individual techniques that lawmakers were told about .
However , in an op - ed last month , Mr. Goss said he remembers being told specifically about waterboarding during the September 2002 briefing .
“ I am slack jawed to read that members claim to have not understood that the techniques on which they were briefed were to actually be employed ; or that specific techniques such as “ waterboarding ” were never mentioned , ” Mr. Goss wrote in The Wall Street Journal .
Other Republicans took sharp issue with the speaker ’s remarks .
“ The speaker ’s comments continue to raise more questions than provide answers , ” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the House Republican minority leader .
“ It ’s pretty clear that they were well aware of what these enhanced interrogation techniques were ; they were well aware that they ’d been used ; and it seems to me that they want to have it both ways .
You ca n’t have it both ways . ”
Senator Kit Bond of Missouri , vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , issued a more scathing response .
“ It ’s outrageous that a member of Congress would call our terror - fighters liars , ” he said in a statement released by his office .
“ Instead of prosecuting or persecuting , our country should be supporting our intelligence professionals who work to keep us safe . ”
The Republican - driven furor over what Ms. Pelosi knew about waterboarding and other techniques has put the speaker on the defensive .
She repeatedly referred to a carefully prepared statement to respond to multiple questions at the session with reporters .
Ms. Pelosi blamed the dispute on Republicans and others , saying they are trying to shift attention from those who authorized the interrogations and other tactics now found to be questionable .
Republicans have said the speaker was now criticizing the Bush administration for abusing terror suspects when she herself was aware of it at the time .
“ This is a diversionary tactic to take the spotlight off of those who conceived , developed and implemented these policies , which all of us long opposed , ” Ms. Pelosi said .
Ms. Pelosi said that at the sole briefing she attended as the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee in September 2002 , the only mention of waterboarding by C.I.A. officials was that while it was deemed to be legal , the technique was not being used .
On Friday , Congressional Republicans , citing a new accounting that showed some top Democrats taking part in briefings on harsh methods in 2002 , had accused Democrats of full complicity in approving the Bush administration ’s brutal interrogations .
The chart said that in a briefing on Sept. 4 , 2002 , attended by Ms. Pelosi , the interrogation methods that ” had been employed ” against a prisoner , Abu Zubaydah , were described .
But according to the legal memorandums released last month , Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded 83 times the month before the briefing , so any objection from Democrats at the Sept. 4 briefing would have come too late .
Indeed , Ms. Pelosi said Thursday that she had learned only after the Sept. 4 briefing that waterboarding had already been used and that some administration experts had questioned its legality .
“ We later find out that it had been taking place before they even briefed us about the legal opinions and told us that they were not being used , ” she said , referring to the interrogation techniques .
Ms. Pelosi said she had supported a letter opposing the tactics sent in 2003 by Representative Jane Harman of California , who replaced Ms. Pelosi as the top Democrat on the intelligence panel when Ms. Pelosi took over as Democratic leader .
But she said that she realized a letter would not change administration policy and said she instead set about to win Democratic control of Congress , then held by Republicans .
“ It was clear we had to change the leadership in Congress and in the White House , ” she said .
“ That was my job — the Congress part . ”
Ms. Pelosi urged the C.I.A. to disclose the contents of the briefing she attended and said she did not believe there was more she could have done when she learned of the waterboarding .

An anonymous reader writes ,
This Italian news piece reports the latest uncostitutional boutade of PM Silvio Berlusconi , who actually declared " I am tempted to direct and strong actions against the media because of their disinformation about me " .
Translated from mafiaspeak ( his ties with that organization have been widely documented in several trials , so this is no slander ) , this means : " I am going to sue the hell out of anybody not incensing me , and order their immediate firing just like I did a few years ago with journalistic legends like Indro Montanelli , Eugenio Scalfari and others " .
But what is all the fuss about ?
Well , those evil media people – and yes , I am one of them – dared to report yet another series of diplomatical blunders by Berlusconi .
I.e. shouting in presence of H.M. the Queen of England , who had to reprimand him ; Ignoring the assembled world leaders to have a friendly chat on his mobile phone while the International press was watching ;
Claiming credit for the success of yesterday 's G20 meeting after a very embarassing performance before his " not - so- peers " ; Accusing America as the only responsible of the Italian crisis and requesting Barack Obama to " sort out the mess you made in my country " , and the list goes on and on .
And … ready for the final straw ?
The Italian minister responsible for policing the Internet is none other than… a former showgirl and Berlusconi 's mistress , with family ties in the local equivalent of the RIAA .
Do you really want a piece of the Interweb in the manicured hands of such a person ?
It was on an average Wednesday that a very serious Israeli newspaper conducted a very wild experiment .
For one day , Haaretz editor - in - chief Dov Alfon sent most of his staff reporters home and sent 31 of Israel ’s finest authors and poets to cover the day ’s news .
The idea behind the paper ’s June 10 special edition was to honor Israel ’s annual Hebrew Book Week , which opened the same day , by inviting Israeli authors to get away from their forthcoming novels and letting them bear witness to the events of the day .
This was n’t a Sabbath supplement , a chance to balance the news with extra color .
This was a near complete replacement of the newspaper itself .
Save for the sports section and a few other articles , all the reporters ’ notebooks were handed over to poets and novelists , both bestselling and up - and - coming .
Their articles filled the pages , from the leading headline to the weather report .
“ We really tried to give a real newspaper , ” Alon said .
For the liberal , Hebrew language Israeli daily — the country ’s oldest — it was a bold but signature move .
From its founding in 1918 , Haaretz has distinguished its brand by highlighting Israeli cultural , literary and artistic life with a vigor unmatched by its competitors .
That , along with its dense in - depth political and business reporting ( achieved with smaller type and far fewer photos than Israel ’s other dailies ) has won it an elite audience , albeit one far smaller than its competitors .
Its weekday circulation of some 50,000 compares with 400,000 for Yediot Aharonot , Israel ’s largest daily , and 160,000 for Ma’ariv , the second largest .
But as the old cliché goes , they are the right readers .
“ The likelihood of Haaretz readership , ” Israeli media analysts Dan Caspi and Yehiel Limor write , “ rises with income , education , and age . ”
Its elite audience gives it an influence disproportionate to its circulation , as does its internationally read English language Internet edition , which features translations of many of the Hebrew stories .
Its readership , along with the paper ’s dovish political stances , has won it a reputation as Israel ’s version of The New York Times .
It ’s hard to imagine the Times doing anything like the June 10 experiment , though .
For this edition of the paper , nearly all the rules taught in journalism school were thrown out the window .
Writers used the first person and showed up in nearly every photograph alongside their interview subjects , including the likes of Defense Minister Ehud Barak and President Shimon Peres .
Among those articles were gems like the stock market summary , by author Avri Herling .
It went like this : “ Everything ’s okay .
Everything ’s like usual .
Yesterday trading ended .
Everything ’s okay .
The economists went to their homes , the laundry is drying on the lines , dinners are waiting in place …
Dow Jones traded steadily and closed with 8,761 points , Nasdaq added 0.9 % to a level of 1,860 points … .
The guy from the * shakshuka *[ an Israeli egg - and - tomato dish ] shop raised his prices again … . ”
The TV review by Eshkol Nevo opened with these words : “ I did n’t watch TV yesterday . ”
And the weather report was a poem by Roni Somek , titled “ Summer Sonnet . ”
( “ Summer is the pencil / that is least sharp / in the seasons ’ pencil case . ” )
News junkies might call this a postmodern farce , but considering that the stock market wo n’t be soaring anytime soon , and that “ hot ” is really the only weather forecast there is during Israeli summers , who ’s to say these articles are n’t factual ?
Alongside these cute reports were gripping journalistic accounts .
David Grossman , one of Israel ’s most famed novelists , spent a night at a children ’s drug rehabilitation center in Jerusalem and wrote a cover page story about the tender exchanges between the patients , ending the article in the style of a celebrated author who ’s treated like a prophet : “ I lay in bed and thought wondrously how , amid the alienation and indifference of the harsh Israeli reality , such islands — stubborn little bubbles of care , tenderness and humanity — still exist . ”
Grossman ’s pen transformed a run -of - the - mill feature into something epic .
So , too , did 79 - year - old author Yoram Kaniuk , whose novel “ Adam Resurrected ” was recently adapted for a movie starring Jeff Goldblum and Ayelet Zurer .
He went into the field to write about couples in the hospital cancer ward .
The thing is , he ’s a cancer patient , too .
“ A woman walking with a cane brings her partner a cup of coffee with a trembling hand .
The looks they exchange are sexier than any performance by Madonna and cost a good deal less , ” Kaniuk wrote .
“ I think about what would happen if I were to get better …how I would live without the human delicacy to which I am witness ? ”
“ I got more telephone calls today than I have in years past , ” Kaniuk said in a phone interview .
“ People were very moved , because I wrote it like a writer and not like a journalist .
If you see something beautiful and touching , why not write it ? ”
The masterful articles by Kaniuk and Grossman made it seem like there ’s actually some hope to be reported in a country flooded with doomsday news bulletins .
The next day , Haaretz ’s usual staff reporters were back on the job .
Yossi Melman , Haaretz ’s commentator on security and intelligence issues , emphasized that he liked the experiment , but said , “ It would be very difficult to replace journalists with authors and run a newspaper .
We are trained ; we know how to do it .
For them , you know , there is a tendency to elaborate . ”
At the editor ’s desk , Alfon sees things otherwise .
“ I think it is a humility lesson for journalists , ” he said .
He kept five writers in the newsroom in case of breaking news , but nothing big happened .
So the authors ’ accounts prevailed , gripping stories were printed and dozens of readers called in with praise .
“ Thirty - one writers decided , what are the real events of the day ? ” he mused .
“ What is really important in their eyes ?
They wrote about it , and our priorities as journalists were suddenly shaken by this . ”

Facebook is exceptionally popular , and with all of that fame comes plenty of trouble .
Scams are hardly new to the social networking site , and now it Facebook faces one of its most serious yet : a phishing routine that threatens to infect user computers with malware .
The scam , which started nailing Facebook users yesterday , goes something like this : a member receives a message from a friend packing a link , usually with the subject line " Hello " or " areps.at " or other addresses ending with " .at " .
Those who click on that link will be sent to a website asking for their login information , which is then stolen by the culprits .
( Source : go.com )
Drive - by Download
However , what makes this particular scheme even worse than the average phishing scam is the fact that it also secretly uploads malware onto an unsuspecting user 's computer .
This kind of attack is well known by security experts , who call it a " drive - by download . "
The URLs , or addresses , were pretty convincing before Facebook blocked them .
According to reports , they resembled other Facebook pages , making it likely that users would go ahead and enter their email addresses ( or login ) and password , the usual process for logging on to Facebook .
However , this nasty scam actually steals the user 's information , changes their password , and then sends the same " Hello " or " .at " malware - laden message to each of that user 's friends .
Get Koobface on Facebook
The malicious web sites are , according to sources , capable of infecting computers with either the Koobface worm or Trojan .
BHO .
Although this is just one in a series of similar attacks , Facebook is not convinced the problem should prevent users from visiting the site .
" The impact of this attack or the previous ones are not widespread and only impacted a tiny fraction of a percent of users .
We 've been updating our monitoring systems with information gleaned from the previous attacks so that each new attack is detected more quickly , " said company spokesman Barry Schnitt .
( Source : cnet.com )
In other words , users have become guinea pigs in Facebook 's effort to learn phishing strategies and prevent future attacks .
This is hardly comforting words for Facebook fans .
In an unremarkable office , little more than a hefty free kick from Manchester United 's Old Trafford stadium , the marketing supremo of a substantial quoted company sets up a viewing of her latest advertising idea .
Projected on to the screen , one after the other , are the faces of about 30 women - all at the precise moment of orgasm .
The soundtrack is pure Meg Ryan , faking it in When Harry Met Sally , although these women are slightly less loud and have a light operatic accompaniment .
The marketing chief is as satisfied with her new ad as its stars appear to be .
This is SSL International , owner of the Durex condom brand – a business that is " into the act of sex " , explains Anna Valle , the marketing chief .
She has a " roadmap to expand across the whole sex landscape " and she intends to use it .
Her mission is to transform Durex from a straightforward form of contraception and protection into a brand that promises better sex .
To that end , SSL is now selling Durex Play , a label used on vibrators , penis rings , oils and lubricants which , in two years , has gone from a twinkle in chief executive Garry Watts ' eye to a £ 40 m brand .
" Foreplay , " declares Valle , " is a key occasion . "
The latest Play offering is Play O - a warming gloop which promises more and better orgasms - which went on sale last year and has evidently been flying off the shelves .
" Our research shows that 40 % of women are not satisfied with their orgasms " , says Valle .
" That is a missed opportunity .
And 67 % do not orgasm on a regular basis .
That is a big need " .
In the large open plan office outside the screening room , there is a display of ideas for new products .
There is a bright pink pyramid , with a base about 20 cm square .
Asking what it is , or where one might put it , seems too naive .
Alongside there is a contraption which plugs into an iPod , presumably for busy women on the move , who are determined not to miss any opportunity , even if it is on the Tube or in a queue for a cash machine .
In these recession - battered times , sex is not a bad business to be in .
" We are very careful not to say ' recession - proof ' , " says Watts , " but people are not going to stop having sex .
There is an element of resilience . "
The same is true with footcare , he adds - not that the SSL boss has any sort of foot fetish ( to my knowledge ) but because , alongside the vibes and lubes , the company sells bunion pads and toenail fungus treatments , because it owns the Dr Scholl 's brand outside the US .
The link between condoms and cracked heel ointment , he explains , is not a desire to cover the market from nightclub to nursing home , but because the products share the same distribution channels .
But whether it is footcare or fruit - flavoured condoms , business is booming .
SSL unveils its annual profits tomorrow and is expected to turn in profits up 30 % at £ 76 m from sales up 20 % at about £ 640 m .
The company is making big gains from overseas sales as a result of the weak pound but , excluding the impact of currency gains , underlying sales were still up 6 % .
In fact , SSL is so confident it is likely to push through a hefty increase in its dividend to shareholders at a time when other companies are paring back their payouts or axing them altogether .
The SSL brands are available in 130 countries , but 75 % of sales come from Europe and the board is eyeing expansion opportunities .
Last month , the group exercised an option to take its holding in Russian condom company BLBV to just over 50 % .
Other deals gave it full ownership of a Ukraine condom business and the Crest brand in Switzerland .
" The obvious hole now is Korea , " said Watts , " and we do n't have much condom business in Japan or in Latin America .
They are top of the list . "
Prices of possible bolt - on acquisitions , he said , have come down " because there is no private equity competition out there any more " .
China is a mega - market .
" We started there a couple of years ago , " says Valle .
" Now it is the size of the UK . "
A new SSL condom factory , adding to its plants in Thailand and India , opens there next month and will be able to turn out 1bn condoms a year at a third of the costs in Europe .
Building loyalty is key to success in selling condoms , because this is not a business where buyers linger very long to admire the packaging , read the instructions or mull the best buy .
As analysts at Deutsche Bank , who rate SSL shares a buy , put it in a recent note : " The average consumer takes just seven seconds to make their condom product selection and many consumers are concerned about the quality of the product , due to the potential severity of the consequences of failure . "
In other words , a well - known brand that fits but does n't split is essential to success .
The SSL finance director , Mark Moran , said : " The trick is ensuring consistency .
We do n't want cheap knock - offs that do n't do the job properly . "
Watts is also waiting to see if the Dr Scholl brand in the US , part of the vast Schering group , becomes available in the wake of Schering 's takeover by Merck .
" If it does come free , we will have a good look .
But it will depend on the price .
With a turnover of £ 200 m , it would not be transformational , but it would give us two global brands , instead of one and a half . "
Deutsche Bank reckons there are risks - such as a stronger pound , condom safety , new launches and the horrors that can accompany acquisitions .
But , it says : " If anything , the problem SSL faces is that of having too many opportunities " .
Scholl and Durex , they say , could move into more pharmaceutical and lifestyle products - from orthopaedics and foot fashion to testing for sexually transmitted diseases , erotic underwear and producing a wider range of " devices " .
New products are already being lined up , from aids to " libido , stimulation and mood enhancement " - including an erection - enhancing condom for those with endurance issues - to a clothing range .
" You can get people to wear a T - shirt with Durex on it , " said Valle .
" It 's that good a brand " .

The big , fat , silver torpedo that is the Chipotle burrito is as iconic ( in this city , anyway ) as an Absolut bottle or a Converse shoe .
So what better way to start off a brand new campaign than to ditch the thing you ’re most famous for in favor of a bland , new Taco Bell - styled menu and some insipid value statements that are saturating the market in this shitty economy .
Oh , and how about a new logo , too ?
Something that could sit nicely on the shelf at Target with the other Archer Farms produce ?
Butler , Shine , Stern & Partners have , in one campaign , unraveled the hard work that so many agencies ( including TDA Advertising & Design in Boulder ) have built up over the last decade .
No doubt a knee - jerk reaction to these tough economic times , the new work has abandoned the pithy wit and “ it ’s a big fucking burrito , eat it or sod off ” attitude of the Chipotle of old , and replaced it with the lackluster positioning of “ hey , come eat at Chipotle , because you ’re poor and we understand that . ”
Pass me a bucket .
What was so great about the Chipotle advertising of the past what that is had personality and balls .
Chipotle was n’t just a place to eat , it was an attitude .
Some of the ads I had loved in the past ( all featuring the silver burrito ) include :
OPEN WIDE .
NO , WIDER .
BURRITOS SO BIG , YOU WANNA RIDE ‘EM .
OURS GO TO ELEVEN .
OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE LARGER THAN THEY APPEAR ( written backwards ) .
These lines were the heart and soul of the Chipotle brand .
They had the cool factor without trying too hard .
They were honest , and they were memorable .
They were a point of differentiation , a flag stuck firmly in the ground saying “ this is who we are , take us or leave us . ”
And then along came marketing pussies and strategists who decided that a unique selling proposition was not all that valuable .
Instead , Chipotle should jump on the bandwagon of VALUE and dump everything else in the trash .
Oh , and throw away that big , fat , silver burrito , too .
People know what it is , they do n’t need to be reminded of it .
Now , I ask you , did you ever hear anyone say “ man , I ’d love to eat out tonight but Chipotle is so fucking expensive ” in the last few years .
That ’s what I thought .
Chipotle is fast food , it just happens to be great fast food .
That ’s why people lined up around the block when a new store opened .
They wanted the big burrito .
If they did n’t , they ordered something else , but the taste and flavor of the burrito was embedded in all of the other dishes ( of which there were n’t many ) .
Now , we have this LOW ROLLER MENU , which is a pale attempt to copy the dollar menus and value menus of the other chains .
Why copy McDonald ’s , Burger King and Taco Bell ?
They suck .
Do your own thing .
I , for one , do n’t consider myself a low roller .
I ’m not a high roller either .
I never thought $ 6 for a 1lb burrito was extravagant or costly .
And now , a few bucks less for a small salad and a taco , well , that ’s not tempting me at all .
This shitty work is a prime example of what happens when brands get scared and decide to follow the herd .
Instead of zigging when everyone else is zagging , Chipotle has abandoned their steadfast position and have left it wide open for someone else with balls .
It happened to Airwalk ( read The Tipping Point ) .
It almost happened to Sony .
I never thought I ’d see the day when it would happen to a brand like Chipotle .
What a crying fucking shame .

This article is the winner in the university category of the Plus new writers award 2009 .
On a sunny morning in 2001 , a piece of investment plan landed on the desk of Dick Fuld , the then Chief Executive of Lehman Brothers .
The document , compiled by a team of maths and physics PhDs , included a calculation to show how the bank will always end up with a profit if they invest on the real estate markets .
Fuld was impressed .
The next five years saw the bank borrowing billions of dollars to invest in the housing market .
It worked .
The housing market boom had turned Lehman Brothers from a modest firm into the world 's fourth largest investment bank .

But as the housing market started to shrink , the assumptions that the PhDs made began to break down one by one .
The investment now became a mistake , resulting in a stunning loss of $ 613 billion .
On September 15 2008 Lehman Brothers collapsed —
" The largest bankruptcy in the US history , " as described by Wikipedia .
The money making model
Imagine that you are working for Lehman Brothers and one morning you receive a phone call from HSBC .
" Hi !
A hundred customers have each borrowed $ 1 million from us for a year .
We would like to buy an insurance from you which will cover us in the case of any of them defaulting .
From their application forms we reckon they each have a 3 % chance of default .
How much will the insurance cost ? "
You can in fact calculate it , easily .
The 100 customers each have a 3 % chance of defaulting , so you expect three customers to default next year .
That is , you will need to pay $ 3 million next year .
Assuming the interest rate is about 3 % each year , next year 's $ 3 million would be worth 3/( 3/100+1) =3/1.03=2.91 million now .
Therefore HSBC will have to pay you at least $ 2.91 million for the insurance .
Obviously Lehman Brothers was n't a charity and so , to make money , they would double the price to $ 5.82 million and expect to make $ 2.91 million out of each of these deals on average .
This kind of insurance is called a credit default swap ( CDS ) .
The legendary CDO
After putting down the phone , you might be quite worried about what would happen if ten of the borrowers defaulted , because then you would have to pay $ 10 million back !
In this case , consider this deal : how about paying me a certain premium , and if more than ten defaults occur , you will only need to pay for ten of them and I will pay for the rest .
If less than ten defaults occur , you will have to pay for all the defaults and I wo n't pay anything .
The type of deal that I am offering is called the senior tranche of a collateralised debt obligation ( CDO ) contract , while the one you are getting is called the junior tranche of the CDO .
Looks like a safe investment ?
Better think twice !
The attractiveness of the senior tranche is that almost all of the time I do n't have to pay anything , just pocketing my premium .
Imagine how unlikely it is to have more than ten borrowers defaulting together !
Senior tranches were generally considered to be almost as safe as borrowing money from the government .
Since the senior tranche offers a better return than , but seems to be just as safe as , putting the money in the bank , the investors just loved it .
In 2004 there were only $ 157.4 billion of CDO being issued , but by 2007 the amount grew to $ 481.6 billion .
But do n't you find it a bit unfair that you can have something as safe as bank deposits , that offers a higher return ?
The pitfalls
Yes , it is unfair !
In fact , CDO is a lot riskier than bank deposits , but Lehman Brothers , like many investors , did n't seem to know that .
Let 's go back to our original model .
The first source of error is that we have assumed that each investor has a 3 % chance of defaulting .
How do we know that ?
It must be from historical data .
The problem is , there has n't been a national drop of housing price since the great depression in the 1920s , so the chance that a borrower defaults was calculated on the basis of a good period when the housing prices surged .
However , the housing market crashed in 2007 .
Many borrowers ' properties are now worth even less than the loan they have to pay in the future , so many of them refuse to pay .
To worsen the situation , 22 % of these borrowers are the so - called subprime borrowers — those who had little income and had little hope of returning money .
Banks were not afraid of lending money to them because even if they defaulted , the insurance would pay them back .
The participation of the subprime borrowers makes lending much riskier than before .
In fact , the default probability in the US has quadrupled from the 3 % as assumed in the model to 12 % since 2007 , making it four times riskier .
This means that investors like Lehman Brothers will be hit four times harder than they have anticipated .
Actually it is worse than that .
The profitability , or lack of it , of financial products more complicated than CDS and CDO may depend on the square of the default probability , rather than the probability itself .
Now as the default probability rises from 0.03 to 0.12 , the square of the probability increased from 0.0009 to 0.0144 — that 's an increase by a factor of 16 !
The Lehman Brothers headquarters on the night of September 15 , 2008 .

There is also a second and more subtle source of error .
Whether you can make money from selling the CDO insurance for the bank depends on whether the borrowers return the money , which in turns depends on the economy .
So if the economy goes down , you are a lot more likely to lose money .
If you are an active investor , then you probably have invested in the stock market as well .
Now if the market crashes you lose both the money invested in the stock market and in the CDO .
Suppose , on the other hand , that instead of spending the money on CDO , you bet on whether Manchester United will win the European Champion League .
This time in order to lose all your money you need both the market to go down and Manchester United to lose their match — this is less likely than just having the market go down .
Therefore , investing on CDO is a riskier choice than betting for Manchester United .
The error in our model is that we have not taken into account this extra risk due to its dependence of CDO on the market .
These two errors were sufficient to mask the risk in CDO .
In fact , the errors are so serious that 27 out of 30 of the CDOs issued by Merril Lynch were downgraded from AAA ( the safest investment ) to " junk " when the errors were spotted .
The fall of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers , unaware of the hidden risks , decided to invest big on CDO .
It even had a 35 to 1 debt to equity ratio , that is , it only owned $ 1 out of every $ 36 in its bank account — the other $ 35 were borrowed from somewhere .
This meant that a loss of just 3 % of the money on its balance sheet , would have meant the loss of all the money it owned .
After suffering heavy losses ( more than 3 % of the money in its balance ) from CDO , borrowers began to lose confidence and called back the loans .
As Lehman had always relied on short - term loans , its lenders were able to pull their cash back quickly .
Now the bank was in trouble .
It borrowed much more than it was able to return and soon found itself unable to pay back .
On 15th September 2008 , the world 's fourth biggest investment bank was gone , forever .

Boot me up , shut me down
One of the Fedora Project 's major goals for this release was to make boot and shutdown times much faster .
Fedora 11 claims to be at the login screen in 20 seconds .
In my testing , Fedora 11 actually beat the goal by a couple of seconds and shutting down was even faster , usually taking just over 10 seconds to power the system off .
Much of the speed gain at boot was made possible by removing what the Fedora Project refers to as " bloated tasks " from the boot process .
I was a little suspicious that those might have been handed off after login - meaning to the GNOME - session - but thankfully , logging into GNOME is just as quick as ever .
There 's also a grab bag of smaller improvements in Fedora 11 , like a better out - of - the - box experience for systems with fingerprint readers , stronger hashes ( SHA - 2 , rather than just MD5 or SHA - 1 ) , and a new way for desktop programs to automatically install items such as applications , fonts , and multimedia codecs .
Developers will be happy to know that the latest version of Fedora ships with a number of improved tools including GCC 4.4 and even Python 2.6 .
As for the applications , Fedora includes Firefox 3.5 - although it was still labeled as 3.1b3 in the preview release - the new OpenOffice 3.1 , Rhythmbox , and a few of the other usual GNOME suspects like GIMP , the F - Spot photo manager , Pidgin , and Transmission .
Bit of a looker : KDE in Fedora 11 finally beats GNOME
On the KDE side , you 'll find all the improvements of version 4.2 - including support for Plasma widgets , the latest version of Dolphin file manager that has now matched most of Konquerer 's feature - set , and updates for the KDE app suite like KMail , Kontact , KDevelop , and KWrite .
I 've avoided KDE during the jump from 3.5 to 4.0 , but now that 4.2 is here , the four - series KDE desktop finally feels mature enough for everyday use and in many respects - especially the eye - candy - it trumps our old friend GNOME .
But KDE did take considerably longer to login to than GNOME .
It appears there 's a price to pay for the fancy graphics , and you 'll likely notice it more with Fedora 11 's very short boot times .
Performance - wise , Fedora 11 is plenty snappy .
Of course , the speed will vary greatly according to your PC 's specs , but aside from the faster boot times - which are very noticeable - I did n't notice a huge change over Fedora 10 .
I only encountered one persistent bug in the preview release , which would cause the audio subsystem to go haywire every once and while , and hope this has now been fixed .
Take the leap
If you 've never given Fedora a try , now is a great time .
Not only does the latest version continue Fedora 's tradition of slick and stable releases , it packs in enough nice new features to make it well worth the upgrade .
And for those who are n't sold on using the ext4 filesystem , it is n't hard to install with ext3 .
I would definitely recommend Fedora 11 to anyone using 10 , but think it might also be a nice alternative for those growing tired of Ubuntu or just looking to play around with a new Linux distro . ®

Amazing pictures of cat that spent a WEEK with crossbow bolt through its body
A kitten lost one of its nine lives when a callous thug shot it with a crossbow .
Dave the tabby cat was targeted while playing away from home .
He staggered around with the 14 - inch bolt in his body for a week before finally making it back to his garden .
The bolt entered his neck and came out by his left elbow missing his heart by an inch and his lungs by a fraction .
Miraculously the bolt failed to pierce Dave 's vital organs and arteries
Though he is now on the mend , his ordeal has left its scar on his owners , the Childerhouse family .
Parents Andrew and Juliet said their daughters Hannah , 12 , and Phoebe , eight , were hysterical when they spotted Dave limping across the grass .
Mr Childerhouse , 48 , of Terrington St Clement , Norfolk , said : ' This defies understanding of people 's minds .
It is absolutely horrific .
Who would do this to a cat ?
' Dave is a very friendly cat so someone probably got very close and then let him have it . '
Dave went missing on June 2 and the family gave up hope of finding him as the week went by .
But eight days later Hannah heard his bell outside and ran out to find him limping along with the crossbow bolt through his body .
Near miss :
An X - ray shows how the crossbow bolt passed through the cat 's chest cavity
Mrs Childerhouse , 46 , said : ' Hannah was having her breakfast and said she could hear Dave .
' I looked out of the living room window and saw him with what looked like a play dart .
' Hannah was screaming constantly - she could not go to school . '
She added : ' The police think it was someone riding past who shot him , but in our view it was a clean shot at close range . '
Mr Childerhouse , a sign maker , said : ' The girls were hysterical .
But Dave could still walk around and looked comfortable .
There was no blood showing from the wound .
' He was starving and very smelly from where he had been lying in his own mess . '
The 11 - month - old kitten was treated at Mill House Veterinary Surgery in King 's Lynn by Sarah Colegrove who said Dave was lucky to have survived .
She said the blunt bolt tip meant many of Dave 's major organs and main arteries were pushed out of the way rather than being cut .
On the mend : Dave gets a cuddle from Hannah Childerhouse , 12 , with her sister Phoebe , eight , and mother Juliet
' We took an X - ray and it showed the arrow was going right through his thoracic cavity , ' the vet said .
' One of the main problems was infection .
As the arrow went in it pushed a lot of hairs and rubbish from the skin into the chest .
' The arrow came out fairly easily but it looked as if the skin was trying to heal around it so it must have been there for several days .
' Dave is the most amazing little cat .
He is on strong antibiotics now and we are keeping our fingers crossed he comes out of this okay . '
Dave is now recovering after five days in intensive care .
The RSPCA will meet some of the £ 800 cost of Dave 's veterinary treatment .

South Korea agreed to join the operation after North Korea tested a nuclear device on Monday , its second nuclear test in three years .
The North had earlier warned the South not to participate in the operation , known as the Proliferation Security Initiative .
“ We consider this a declaration of war against us , ” North Korea said in a statement carried by its official news agency , KCNA .
“ Any hostile act against our peaceful vessels , including search and seizure , will be considered an unpardonable infringement on our sovereignty , and we will immediately respond with a powerful military strike . ”
The North Koreans also said in the statement that they “ no longer feel bound by the armistice ” that ended the fighting in the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
Technically , the two Koreas have remained at war for more than 50 years , because the 1953 armistice was never replaced with a final peace treaty .
The North Koreans had previously called the armistice a “ useless piece of paper ” and declared that they no longer felt bound by it .
But they have rarely used the threat of abandoning the armistice .
At the United Nations , the United States and Japan were drawing up a rough draft of a Security Council resolution that would concentrate on five or six ways to flesh out existing sanctions against North Korea that had never been enforced , diplomats said .
Although China supports the idea of sanctions , it wants to work slowly and to bolster measures first passed in 2006 rather than creating new ones , they said .
The proposals include banning imports and exports of all arms  only heavy weapons are restricted now .
“ We want to dry out their resources for the military , ” said a senior Western diplomat , speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the negotiations .
Mr Lieberman is a controversial figure because of his views on Israeli Arabs Israel 's PM - designate has signed his first coalition deal , which could see controversial right - winger Avigdor Lieberman becoming foreign minister .
Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud struck the deal with Mr Leiberman 's party Yisrael Beiteinu , which has been accused by some critics of anti-Arab racism .
But it includes a clause stressing both parties ' preference for a unity cabinet which could alter the portfolios .
Mr Netanyahu has also been seeking the support of the centrist Kadima party .
If Kadima also joins the coalition line - up , party leader and current Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni could keep her position , although talks have so far proved inconclusive .
Mr Netanyahu has a deadline of 3 April to form a government in the wake of elections in February .
Ms Livni , whose party outpolled Likud by a single seat in the election but was seen as less able to build a coalition , has demanded Mr Netanyahu signs up to a two - state solution with the Palestinians before she joins the government .
New formula Yisrael Beiteinu is a strong supporter of Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank , seen as illegal under international law and a major obstacle to a peace deal .
Mr Netanyahu was prime minister in the late 1990s
It also advocates a peace deal which jettisons Israeli land populated by Arab citizens and annexes settlements in the West Bank and Mr Lieberman has proposed that Arab citizens sign loyalty oaths or lose their citizenship .
Correspondents say the designation of the former bouncer at a Moldovan nightclub as Israeli foreign minister could harm some of the country 's international relations .
Mr Netanyahu also favours a revised peace formula , which concentrates on economic development of autonomous Palestinian areas rather than agreeing territorial deals with the Palestinians .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana has warned Israel that it must work towards a two - state solution to maintain its current international diplomatic support .
" Let me say very clearly that the way the EU will relate to a government [ of Israel ] that is not committed to a two - state solution would be very different , " he said at a news conference .
If Kadima sees through its stated intention to lead the opposition , Likud is expected to try to bring in smaller hard - line parties like Jewish Home , National Union and United Torah Judaism .
That would give it a solid right - wing majority of 65 in the 120 - seat parliament .
The deal with Yisrael Beiteinu envisages it getting five cabinet posts .
In addition to foreign affairs Mr Leiberman would be named deputy prime minister .
Other posts include the ministers of internal security , infrastructure , tourism , and the immigrants integration .

NEW YORK , April 6 ( UPI ) --
Americans are more optimistic about the economy now than they were before President Barack Obama was inaugurated , a New York Times / CBS News poll indicated .
The poll found Americans support the president 's handling of the economy , as well as of foreign policy , including Iraq and Afghanistan , the Times reported Monday .

There is still some anxiety about the economy , with 70 percent of those surveyed saying they are somewhat or very concerned someone in their household will lose a job during the next 12 months .
However , the percentage of Americans who think the country is on the right track has risen to 39 percent from 15 percent in mid-January , while the percentage who say the country is on the wrong track has declined to 53 percent from 79 percent in January .
The percentage of people who think the economy is getting worse has declined to 34 percent from 54 percent in January and the percentage of those who see the economy as getting better has risen from 7 percent to 20 percent .
The poll contains bad news for Republicans , showing that only 31 percent of those surveyed had a favorable view of the GOP -- the lowest favorable rating since the New York Times / CBS News poll started asking the question 25 years ago .
The telephone survey of 998 adults was conducted Wednesday through Sunday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
We ’ve known for a while that some of the major financial institutions in the United States are in serious trouble .
We saw several government - engineered buyouts of some banks at the tail end of last year and other financial firms simply failed .
Many thought the 700 billion worth of “ TARP ” funds would be enough to shore up America ’s financial institutions , but it appears that there ’s another round of major financial institutions that are in serious trouble .
Barron ’s has recently released a report about the financial status of America ’s 13 largest banks and have found that seven of them are in seriously in trouble and are insolvent for all intensive purposes .
Barron ’s stated that out of all of the banks that were studied , Citibank was the one in the most trouble .
This is n’t much of a surprise considering all of the bailout money the bank has taken in the last 6 months .
After Citibank , Bank of America was the second most troubled bank .
The other five banks that were in serious trouble included Wells Fargo , which was bragging to its customers about how financially stable they were just a few months ago .
PNC , JP Morgan Chase , US Bank Corp and the Bank of New York were also on the list of the banks that are facing serious financial trouble .
The six financial institutions that were considered relatively health included BB&T , Capital One , Comerica , KeyCorp Marshall & Isley and Sun Trust .
Barron ’s reported that these banks are all have sufficient amounts of capital for the time being .
If you have money in one of the seven banks that Barron ’s has listed as “ in trouble ” , you do n’t need to worry immediately .
Remember that the first $ 250,000 of your money in any checking or savings account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( the FDIC ) , throughout the rest of 2009 .
In 2010 and beyond that number drops back down to $ 100,000 .
If you have any more money than that into one single bank , you should immediately take any money over $ 250,000 in a bank and move it to another financial institution .
Customers of these troubled banks should also take notice that the customer service provided by their banks will likely take a nosedive as often happens with banks that are not faring well .
If you are a small business owner and frequently need to make use of a bank ’s services in any other means than a cookie - cutter fashion , you might want move your funds to a small - town community bank or a credit union that can provide you better customer service .

On Tuesday — after Democrats joined with Republicans in the Senate to vote against President Obama ’s request for $ 80 million to close the Guantanamo Bay prison — Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) told reporters that he did n’t want terrorist suspects in US prisons .
Yet in the midst of scoring — or deflecting — a political point , Reid apparently forgot a basic fact : there are dozens of terrorists in US jails .
Senate Democrats , including Reid , moved to strip the Gitmo shutdown money after the Republicans initiated a scare campaign , warning that the worst will happen if Obama transfers Gitmo detainees to federal prison facilities in the United States .
Looking for a winning political issue , Republican House members and senators have been sending letters to Obama and declaring , “ Not in my state . ”
Though Reid ’s home state of Nevada has no federal prisons , he joined this chorus , saying : “ Part of what we do n’t want is [ terrorists ] be put in prisons in the United States .
We do n’t want them around the United States . ”
But there already are dozens , if not scores , of terrorists in US prisons .
Since 9/11 , according to Human Rights Watch , federal courts have tried 145 people on terrorism charges .
Those found guilty are in US jails .
And it ’s no secret that a number of prominent terrorists — including key figures connected to al Qaeda — have been sent to high security federal prisons .
Here ’s a sampling :
* Omar Ahmad - Rahman , a.k.a. the Blind Sheikh , who was convicted for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center attack , is in the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina .
* Richard Reid , the failed shoe - bomber terrorist , is in the supermax federal prison in Florence , Colorado .
* John Walker Lindh , the so - called “ American Taliban , ” is in the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex .
* Ramzi Yousef , one of the planners of the 1993 WTC bombing and a nephew of 9/11 plotter Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , is in Florence .
* Jose Padilla , accused of plotting a dirty bomb attack ( before those particular charges were dropped ) , is in Florence .
* Zacarias Moussaoui , dubbed the “ 20th hijacker , ” is in Florence .
* Ahmed Ressam , who planned to bomb Los Angeles International Airport , is in Florence .
* Mohamed al - Owhali , Khalfan Khamis Mohamed , Mohamed Odeh , and Wadih el Hage — each convicted for the bombings of the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998 — are in Florence .
* Domestic terrorists Terry Nichols and Ted “ Unabomber ” Kaczynski are also in the Florence facility .
The United States does have the ability to lock up terrorists .
And none of these bad guys have been able to escape and terrorize the communities surrounding these federal jails .
( Thirteen members of the ring behind the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole were imprisoned in Yemen , but they managed to escape ; most remain at large . )
Adding some or all of the 240 detainees now in Gitmo would certainly pose challenges to federal prison authorities .
But the system has worked .
Officials Hardin , Montana , have even expressed interest in taking the Gitmo prisoners to fill the town ’s detention facility , which has been sitting vacant since completion in 2007 .
Republicans , eager for any political ammo , are trying to turn Gitmo into a NIMBY issue .
And they have at least succeeded in frightening Reid and his fellow Senate Democrats — to such an extent that Reid ended up echoing their demagogic talking points .
( A senior Democratic Senate aide says that Reid did try to “ walk back the comments a bit . ” )
“ At this time , [ Reid ] opposes transferring detainees to American prisons , ” a Reid spokesperson says .
“ If the administration proposes a plan that recommends the transfer of some detainees to Americans prisons , he will evaluate it carefully and make a judgment at that time .
He will always strongly oppose the release of any terrorists onto American streets . ”
On Thursday , Obama is scheduled to deliver a speech outlining his plan for closing down Gitmo — in an effort to regain support for the funding request he submitted to Congress .
He will , no doubt , appeal to reason and make a calm and deliberate case to back up his position .
And , no doubt , the Republicans will try to blast him for shuttering Gitmo and possibly sending nasty terrorists into the American heartland .
It would be good for the Obama White House if during this round Reid does n’t give aid and comfort to fear - mongering GOPers .
Cisco Systems will appoint a director to ensure that its Linksys products comply with the terms of free software licenses , and in return the Free Software Foundation will dismiss its lawsuit against the networking giant , the parties said on Wednesday .
Cisco will also make an undisclosed contribution to the foundation and has agreed to notify Linksys users of their rights under applicable licenses .
The new director will report periodically to the foundation regarding Cisco 's compliance efforts .
The settlement deal appears to end a process that began in 2003 when the FSF started looking into complaints that users of the Linksys WRT54G wireless router were not receiving all the source code , based on Linux , that they were entitled to under the terms that Cisco had licensed the software .
Since then , the foundation says it discovered similar transgressions and tried to work with Cisco to ensure the proper disclosures .
But late last year the foundation gave up , complaining that Cisco was unwilling to take the necessary steps towards compliance , and the FSF filed a copyright infringement lawsuit suit against Cisco .
It was the first time the FSF had gone to court over a license violation , Brett Smith , FSF compliance engineer , wrote in a blog post Wednesday .
He stressed that the group would prefer not to take companies to court .
" We 're not out to wreck businesses or make lots of money .
We just want compliance .
And any company selling free software should n't have any problem providing that , " he wrote .
Cisco has been in trouble before for failing to comply with open source licenses .
In 2007 , it came under fire for compliance issue in one of its IP phones .
Companies like Cisco may not intentionally share open source code improperly .
It may be that they have not implemented the sometimes complicated and costly internal processes to track and share code properly .
The Free Software Foundation said it will continue to monitor Cisco 's compliance with open source licenses in Linksys products .

Will may seek to defend greed ( Or maybe not – it ’s actually kind of hard to tell . ) – along with Ayn Rand and other market fundamentalists .
But just about everyone else lists it as a fundamental cause of the financial crisis .
Will tries to make the case that free markets punish greed .
But what Will presumes is that an unregulated market is a free market – and on this fundamental point he is wrong .
The market Will describes is not one heavily regulated by the government – but it is regulated by ebay which in this instance takes on the role of the government for this small market .
The financial markets on Wall Street though were largely unregulated – especially the shadow banking system ( which was created in such a way as to be unregulated ) – and they were in this sense free from government interference .
But they were controlled by a small number of individuals – and in this sense were part of a world where freedom was available only to a princely few .
Will makes the point that greed is an immutable human characteristic – and thus does not account for the booms and busts of our business cycle ( and of financial crises such as this . )
But what does is the combination of perverse incentives for short - term profit ( indeed a form of legal fraud ) , a relaxation of the regulations designed to keep the markets stable that tends to occur when Republicans have power , and greed .
There has always been an historical wariness in America about the combination of greed and concentrations of wealth – focusing on a national bank , on various financiers , on “ the malefactors of great wealth ” and indeed , on Wall Street .
The people , in their wisdom , could see that this concentration of financial power undermined the democratic distribution of political power .
But by the 1980s , there was an additional reason to be wary – as Ronald Reagan unleashed a money revolution .
This money revolution – like all revolutions – was the commingling of many forces – globalization , the ad - hoc Bretton Woods II agreement , and the relaxation of regulations and reduction of taxes .
This revolution helped to concentrate an increasing percentage of the world ’s wealth in the hands of a small number of Wall Street ( and also London ) bankers .
The function of these bankers – their expertise – was to balance risk and profit to their customers ’ satisfaction – to maximize profit for themselves and their customers while minimizing ( or controlling for ) risks .
As a small percentage of individuals accumulated more and more wealth around the world , these individuals entrusted more and more of this wealth to Wall Street bankers – and the more money the bankers controlled , the bigger their cut .
As Michael Osinski explained in a piece for New York magazine :
When you ’re close to the money , you get the first cut .
Oyster farmers eat lots of oysters , do n’t they ?
This closeness to the money created an easy money culture – in which enormous sums money were distributed whether they was deserved or not and the culture began to prize attempts to satisfy the bottomless desire that is greed .
Wall Street bankers took on the culture of gamblers – except with the market going up , everyone made money .
The long boom began to create perverse incentives – as risks began to seem safer , as luck and a rising tide and short term profits made everyone seem like geniuses , they all became accustomed to a certain lifestyle .
Financial innovations sought to overturn many of “ the fundamental rules of banking ” including “ that default risk is an inevitable liability of the business . ”
The combination of innovation and the culture of greed and gambling led to greater and greater risks being taken .
As steady foundations of banking – both as a business and as a culture deteriorated – and as the cautionary tales of Oliver Stone ’s Wall Street and Liar ’s Poker morphed into guides – a new culture of excess developed – excessive greed , excessive pay , excessive drinking , excessive spending , excessive personal risks , and eventually excessive professional risks .
Wall Street bankers began to betray all the symptoms of the easy money culture – like gamblers whose knew their earnings were ephemeral and that every up would be followed by a down to be followed by an up – as long as they could stay at the table .
But as Matt Taibbi wrote , “ this was a casino unique among all casinos , one where middle - class taxpayers cover the bets of billionaires … ”
Osinski tells a story of how this easy money culture affected the individuals :
Now that I was spending more time on the floor , I wondered why the men ’s room always stank .
Then one afternoon at three , when I was in there taking a leak , I discovered the hideous truth .
Traders had a contest .
Coming in at eight , they never left their desks all day , eating and drinking while working .
Then , at three o’clock , they marched into the men ’s room and stood at the wall opposite the urinals .
Dropping their pants , they bet $ 100 on who could train his stream the longest on the urinals across the lavatory .
As their hydraulic pressure waned , the three traders waddled , pants at their ankles , across the floor , desperately trying to keep their pee on target .
This is what $ 2 million of bonus can do to grown men .
This easy money culture warped the incentives at Wall Street firms as well – as they were structured in such a way as to generously reward short - term success ( without controlling sufficiently for long - term failure . )
Rather than being paid large salaries , most of a banker ’s income was handed out in enormous bonuses based on yearly performance .
As long as fees were generated , as long as this quarter ’s profits were growing – bankers would be rewarded with enough profits to last a lifetime .
This alone is enough of an incentive to cause massive fraud .
But at the same time , the culture of Wall Street ensured that money would be spent ridiculously , ostentatiously , and quickly .
Perhaps no one has been more articulate in his visceral disgust for the excesses of Wall Street than Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone .
[ I ]t ’s time to admit it :
We ’re fools , protagonists in a kind of gruesome comedy about the marriage of greed and stupidity .
And the worst part about it is that we ’re still in denial – we still think this is some kind of unfortunate accident , not something that was created by the group of psychopaths on Wall Street whom we allowed to gang - rape the American Dream .
The story of AIG – in its way – symbolizes better than anything else what this culture did to Wall Street .
Back to Taibbi :
AIG is what happens when short , bald managers of otherwise boring financial bureaucracies start seeing Brad Pitt in the mirror .
This is a company that built a giant fortune across more than a century by betting on safety - conscious policyholders – people who wear seat belts and build houses on high ground – and then blew it all in a year or two by turning their entire balance sheet over to a guy who acted like making huge bets with other people ’s money would make his dick bigger .
A culture of greed and excess – a lack of respect for tradition – a market free only to a princely few – negligence bordering on fraud with regards to the evaluation or risk – and an increasing percentage of the world ’s wealth concentrated in the hands of a few .
Together , these were the recipe for this financial disaster .
The problem with greed is that it is unsustainable .
It exists in a cycle , like all unsustainable desires .
Government regulation , like morality , seeks to control and channel greed in less destructive ways – to mitigate the effects of this cycle .
The true cause of this financial crisis was not greed – but the ideology that held that finally the immutable human vice of greed had been overcome with clever financial innovation and the magic of the market .

President Obama , Dick Cheney Face Off on National Security Issues
The president and former VP deliver dueling speeches terrorism .
May 21 , 2009  -- President Obama today strongly defended his administration 's terrorism policies and his decision to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay , saying the policies of his predecessor were based on fear ideology rather than sound strategic principles .
" We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates .
We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat .
But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process ; in checks and balances and accountability , " Obama said at the National Archives in Washington .
" Too often , our government made decisions based upon fear rather than foresight , and all too often trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions , " he said .
The president 's comments did not go unchallenged , as former Vice President Dick Cheney spoke shortly afterward , offering a sharp rebuke to Obama 's criticisms and the current administration 's national security policy .
" The administration seems to pride itself on searching for some kind of middle ground in policies addressing terrorism , " Cheney said in a competing speech at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , D.C. , immediately following Obama 's speech .
" But in the fight against terrorism , there is no middle ground , and half - measures keep you half exposed . "
" I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program , " Cheney added later in the speech .
" The interrogations were used on hardened terrorists after other efforts failed .
They were legal , essential , justified , successful , and the right thing to do . "
Obama gave a professorial explanation on why his administration needed to reverse the Bush Administration policies that " established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable . "
In a speech that ran nearly 50 minutes , Obama laid out his case for ending so - called enhanced interrogation methods , closing the detention center Guantanamo Bay and moving detainees currently held there .
He stressed that he inherited these complex legal and ethical questions from the previous administration .
" We are cleaning up something that is -- quite simply -- a mess ; a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant basis , and that consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country , " he said .
Obama Stands by Decision on Photos
Obama said the toughest issue facing his administration , and the one that is causing him headaches from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill , concerns the detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted but also cannot be released because of the threat they pose .
The president did not lay out a specific plan for these terror suspects but said there must be " clear , defensible and lawful standards for those who fall in this category . "
" We must have fair procedures so that we do n't make mistakes .
We must have a thorough process of periodic review , so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified , " he said .
The president defended his recent decision to not release photographs showing alleged abuse of detainees held by the U.S. because of the potential impact it would have on the American military .
" There is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong , and nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes .
However , it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos would inflame anti-American opinion , and allow our enemies to paint U.S. troops with a broad , damning and inaccurate brush , endangering them in theaters of war , " he said .
Obama rejected calls for an independent " truth commission " that would look into a wide range of Bush administration national security decisions on the grounds that the nation 's " existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability . "
" The Congress can review abuses of our values , and there are ongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques .
The Department of Justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws , " he said .
Obama Puts Blame on Bush Administration
Obama repeatedly pointed the finger at the Bush administration for what he called " a series of hasty decisions " that , while " motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people , " led to controversial policies on interrogation and detention of terrorists .
" Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles , we too often set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford , " he said .
He stressed that the problem of how to move forward with Guantanamo Bay detainees is not a result of his decision to close the facility , but rather the detention center 's existence .
Even the Supreme Court was not spared a rebuke from the president on this issue .
" The Supreme Court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents , " he said .
Cheney Publicly Criticizes Obama Security Policies
Before Obama 's words on counterterrorism policies were even able to sink in , Cheney launched into his competing speech , saying the president 's policies are making the nation less safe .
Cheney recently has been Obama 's harshest critic , and today he continued questioning the president 's decisions and defending the policies of his predecessor .
" When President Obama makes wise decisions , he deserves our support .
When he mischaracterizes the decisions we made , he deserves an answer . "
Cheney said .
Among Obama 's " wise decisions , " according to Cheney : his approach to Afghanistan and his decision not to release the detainee abuse photos .
Cheney outlined the Bush administration 's " broad strategic approach " behind the key anti-terror policies -- Guantanamo Bay , interrogation , wiretapping -- and argued it is dangerous to dismantle them .
It 's not about looking backward , the former vice president said , it 's about the best way to protect the country going forward .
" [ T ] hough I 'm not here to speak for George W. Bush , I am certain that no one wishes the current administration more success in defending the country than we do , " he said .
" We understand the complexities of national security decisions .
We understand the pressures that confront a president and his advisers . "
Cheney Continues Obama Rebuke
Over the last several weeks , Cheney has been on a fierce public campaign to discredit Obama 's national security decisions .
" He is making some choices that , in my mind , will in fact raise the risk to the American people of another attack , " Cheney said in March .
But Obama has not shied away from engaging with the former vice president .
" Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we can't reconcile our core values , our Constitution , our belief that we do n't torture , with our national security interests , " the president said in March .
On issue by issue , the two have squared off and spared no punches .
The president said the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay inflames anti-U.S. sentiment and is inconsistent with American values .
" We will close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and determine how to deal with those who have been held there , " Obama said right after taking office in January .
Cheney said last week : " Guantanamo Bay is a great facility .
It 's very well run .
These people are very well treated . "
Addressing the enhanced interrogation tactics of the Bush administration , Obama last month , " What I 've said -- and I will repeat -- is that waterboarding violated our ideals and our values .
I do believe that it is torture . "
Cheney disagreed .
" It was done legally .
It was done in accordance with our constitutional practices and principles , " he said .
But perhaps their core disagreement is the fundamental approach to national security .
" We are going to be able to effectively balance our national security needs with our civil liberties concerns , " Obama said in March .
Cheney countered : " This is a war .
It 's not a law enforcement problem . "
White House officials say they are happy to have someone as unpopular as former Cheney emerge as their primary opponent in this national security debate .
But Republicans say the fact that Obama is delivering a comprehensive national security speech today is evidence that Cheney 's criticisms are gaining traction .
Obama Dealt a Rebuke from Senate , Democrats
Obama is facing skepticism from more than just the former vice president .
Yesterday the United States Senate delivered a harsh rebuke to Obama with a 90 - 6 vote against the $ 80 million he requested to shut down that Guantanamo Bay prison .
The Senate 's message was clear : do not close the Guantanamo detainee center until you have a plan of what to do with the detainees .
Gitmo Detainees to Supermax ?
Nearly 540 detainees at Guantanamo Bay were transferred or released to foreign countries under President Bush .
Now , 240 detainees remain , including those no other country has been willing to accept , ones the U.S. will eventually prosecute , and prisoners judged too dangerous to release , but the evidence against them would likely not withstand a trial .
The decision on what to do with the remaining prisoners is an especially complicated dilemma for Obama .
Democrats and Republicans are promising a fight to keep the detainees not only out of the U.S. but even out of U.S. prisons .
When asked if he'd be comfortable with the prisoners being transferred to American prisons , Reid paused and said , " not in the United States . "
Today Obama said that his administration will seek to transfer some detainees to " supermax " facilities in the United States , noting that nobody has ever escaped from one .
Obama is also considering sending roughly 100 detainees from Yemen to a rehabilitation center in Saudi Arabia .
At least 11 Guantanamo detainees sent there by the Bush administration , however , have graduated and have become involved again with terrorism , including al Qaeda 's deputy leader in Yemen .
An internal Pentagon report indicates that 14 percent of the detainees released from the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay under President Bush -- 74 out of 540 -- returned to terrorism .
" In my view , these men are exactly where they belong , locked up and safe is a secure prison , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
Annamite Striped Rabbit
What ’s black and brown and striped all over ?
A new species of rabbit hopping around the forests of Southeast Asia , according to the Aug. 19th issue of the journal Nature .
Discovered by biologists from the Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , the rabbit lives in the rugged Annamite Mountains of Laos , an extremely isolated region that has yielded several new species of mammals in recent years .
Arunachal Macaque
The Arunachal Macaque ( Macaca munzala ) , a relatively large brown primate with a comparatively short tail , is a macaque native to Arunachal Pradesh in north - eastern India .
Its species name comes from Munzala ( “ monkey of the deep forest ” ) as it was called by the Dirang Monpa tribe .
It was unknown to scientists until 2004 , when a group of scientists from the Nature Conservation Foundation , India reported it .
Australian Snubfin Dolphin
The Australian snubfin dolphin , Orcaella heinsohni ( Beasley , Robertson , Arnold , 2005 ) , is a recently recognised species of dolphin first described in 2005 .
Experts say the discovery of a new mammal is extremely rare .
In fact , the Australian Snubfin is the first new dolphin species to be discovered in 56 years !
Two scientists at James Cook University , Isabel Beasley and Peter Arnold , took DNA samples from the population of dolphins off the coast of Townsville , Queensland and sent them to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla , California .
The results showed that George Heinsohn , ( an Australian biologist who worked at James Cook University in the 1960s and 1970s on dolphin species for whom Orcaella heinsohni is named ) was correct in his hypothesis that the Townsville population was a new species .
Bornean Clouded Leopard
The Bornean Clouded Leopard ( Neofelis diardi ) is a medium - sized wild cat found on Borneo , Sumatra and the Batu Islands in the Malay Archipelago and publicised under that name by the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) on March 14 , 2007 .
Its coat is marked with irregularly - shaped , dark - edged ovals which are said to be shaped like clouds , hence its common name .
Though scientists have known of its existence since the early 19th century , it was positively identified as being a distinct species in its own right in 2006 , having long been believed to be a subspecies of the mainland Clouded Leopard ( Neofelis nebulosa ) .
Calayan Rail
Exactly one hundred years after the last visit by an ornithologist , a team of bird , mammal , reptile and amphibian specialists arrived in May this year on the island of Calayan , one of the Babuyan Islands in the northernmost part of the Philippines archipelago .
There , they made the remarkable discovery of a new species of rail , which they have named the Calayan Rail Gallirallus calayanensis .
( The formal description appears in Forktail 20 : 1 –7 , published by the Oriental Bird Club . )
The rail appears to be restricted to forests on coralline limestone areas , which probably make up less than half the island ’s surface , and the extent of their suitable habitat is likely to be much less than 100 km² , and could be smaller than 10 km² .
Des suspects they are abundant , but very localised .
Camiguin Hanging Parrot
Both adults in general green ; yellow / green breast and abdomen ; red forehead , crown , lower back and upper tail coverts ; gold / yellow wash on back of crown and head ; band of orange / red on nape which varies from bird to bird ; blue cheeks ; blue greater underwing coverts ; blue undertail and underside of flight feathers .
Bill orange .
Eye grey / brown .
Female has less blue on cheeks .
Call : Calls are described as high - pitched and repetitious notes .
Dingiso
The Dingiso is currently ( 2003 ) listed as a vulnerable species .
It is endemic to Indonesia .
It was first discovered by an Australian named Dr Tim Flannery in 1987 .
He roamed the mountains in New Guinea and discovered four new varieties of tree kangaroo .
He named this Dendrolagus mbaiso , referring to it as “ It ’s a beautiful thing , and no biologist had ever seen one before . ”
Flannery describes the Dingiso as “ none was as unusual as Dingiso and none such an interesting evolutionary and culturual story to tell .
“ Did you know ?
The Dingiso is the only known species of semi-terrestrial tree kangaroo .
Ghost Slug
A new all white worm - eating slug has been discovered in back gardens in south Wales .
A “ ghost ” slug found in a garden in Cardiff has been declared a new species by specialists at the National Museum of Wales and Cardiff University .
They have given the creature a partially Welsh name , Selenochlamys ysbryda , or ghost ( ysbryd ) slug .
Creatures of this type are more usually found in Turkey and Georgia .
The origin of the ghost slug , and its route into Britain , is completely unknown , and specimens have not been seen in Europe before this was discovered in Cardiff last year .
Mary River Turtle
The Mary River Turtle , Elusor macrurus , is an endangered short - necked turtle that inhabits the Mary River in South - East Queensland , Australia .
In the 1960s and 1970 ’s , they were popular as pets in Australia , with about 15,000 sent to shops every year during a ten year period .
They were originally known as the “ Pet Shop ” turtle .
Hatchlings have a SCL ( Straight Carapace Length ) of between 2 - 3.5 cm .
Pygmy Three - toed Sloth
The Pygmy Three - toed Sloth ( Bradypus pygmaeus ) is a three - toed sloth .
Its habitat is located on the tiny island of Isla Escudo deVeraguas off the coast of Panama .
As its name suggests , it is a dwarf of its mainland relatives ; it is likely a product of insular dwarfism .
It weighs 40 % less and is 20 % smaller than other three - toed sloths .

SleepWatcher 2.2.1 ( running with Mac OS X 10.5 and above , source code included ) is a command line tool ( daemon ) for macOS that monitors sleep , wakeup and idleness of a Mac .
It can be used to execute a Unix command when the Mac or the display of the Mac goes to sleep mode or wakes up , after a given time without user interaction or when the user resumes activity after a break or when the power supply of a Mac notebook is attached or detached .
It also can send the Mac to sleep mode or retrieve the time since last user activity .
A little bit knowledge of the Unix command line is required to benefit from this software .
For Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4 , use SleepWatcher 2.0.5 ( and sources ) .
For Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.2 , download SleepWatcher 1.0.1 . BrightnessSync 1.2.1 is a preference pane for OS X : When you own a MacBook Pro with a Mini DisplayPort and a LED Cinema Display , you have noticed that you can control the brightness of the internal display of the MacBook Pro with the brightness keys of the keyboard .
And in the Displays preferences , you can enable automatic brightness adjustment for the internal display .
To modify the brightness of the LED Cinema Display , you always have to use the Displays preferences , and the brightness of the external display can't be adjusted automatically .
BrightnessSync eliminates this shortcoming : it enables automatic brightness adjustment for both the internal and the external display .
And because the LED Cinema Display is more brilliant than the internal display of the MacBook Pro , BrightnessSync lets you set brightness levels for different ambient light conditions for the two displays independently .
With this , there is nearly no need for manually adjusting the brightness for one of the both displays .
BrightnessSync 1.2.1 is compatible with OS X 10.8 to 10.11 .
BrightnessSync 1.0.1 runs with Mac OS X 10.5 to 10.7 and uses Apple private APIs that have vanished with OS X 10.8 .

First , trim the leads off of the back of the power supply
Get out your LilyPad power supply piece and trim the metal parts that are sticking out the back of it .
Small clippers like the ones shown in the photo work well , but you can also use scissors .
Stabilize your battery on the fabric .
Generally , you want to do everything you can to keep the power supply from moving around on the fabric .
I recommend gluing or sewing the battery down before starting on the rest of the project .
You may also want to glue or sew something underneath the power supply to help prevent it from pulling on the fabric and bouncing around as you move .
If you are working on a thin or stretch piece of fabric -- first of all , reconsider this choice !
It 's much easier to work on a heavy piece of non-stretchy fabric .
If you are determined to forge ahead with a delicate fabric , choose the location for your power supply wisely .
It 's the heaviest electronic module , so put it somewhere where it will not distort the fabric too badly .
definitely glue or sew something underneath the power supply .
Sew the + petal of the power supply down to your garment .
If you are new to sewing , check out this great introduction before you start for info on how to thread a needle , tie knots and make stitches .
Cut a 3 - 4 foot length of conductive thread .
Thread your needle , pulling enough of the thread through the needle that it will not fall out easily .
Tie a knot at the end of the longer length of thread .
Do not cut the thread too close to the knot or it will quickly unravel .
Coming from the back of the fabric to the front , poke the needle into the fabric right next to the + petal on the power supply and then , from the front of the fabric , pull it through .
The knot at the end of the thread will keep the thread from pulling out of the fabric .
Now make a stitch going into the hole in the hole in the + petal on the power supply .
Do this several more times , looping around from the back of the fabric to the front , going through the + petal each time .
Pay special attention to this stitching .
It is the most important connection that you 'll sew in your project .
You want to make sure you get excellent contact between the petals on the power supply and your conductive thread .
Go through the hole several times ( at least 5 ) with your stitching .
Keep sewing until you can't get your needle through anymore .
Do not cut your thread , just proceed to the next step .
Sew from the battery to the LilyPad .
Once you 've sewn the + petal of the battery down , make small neat stitches to the + petal of your LilyPad .
I used a jacket with a fleece lining and stitched only through the inner fleece lining so that no stitches were visible on the outside of the jacket .
Sew the + petal of your LilyPad down , finishing the connection .
When you reach the LilyPad , sew the + petal down to the fabric with the conductive thread .
Just like you were with the battery petal , you want to be extra careful to get a robust connection here .
This stitching is making the electrical connection between your power supply and LilyPad .
When you are done with this attachment , sew away from the LilyPad about an inch along your stitching , tie a knot , and cut your thread about an inch away from the knot so that your knot wo n't come untied .
Put fabric glue on each of your knots to keep them from unraveling .
Once the glue dries , trim the thread close to each knot .
Australian businessman Dick Smith has pledged to help Australian Greens leader Bob Brown pay a $ 240,000 legal bill which is threatening to force him into bankruptcy .
Senator Brown has to pay the money to Forestry Tasmania after failing in his efforts to stop logging in Tasmania 's Wielangta Forest .
He has told The World Today that he has been inundated with offers of support , including a $ 50,000 interest free loan , a $ 900 stimulus payment , and a cake for a raffle .
Senator Brown says he has been told he could end up bankrupt and lose his seat in the Senate if he does not pay .
Speaking from his helicopter over Lake Eyre today , Mr Smith said it was inappropriate for the industry to threaten someone 's political future .
" I 'm very disturbed when I understand the legal letter which came in to Bob Brown threatened to make him a bankrupt , and of course , Forestry Tasmania would know that means he'd have to vacate his seat from Federal Parliament , " Mr Smith said .
" And I do n't really like that at all .
I think that type of threat is quite uncalled for in Australia . "
Mr Smith says he and other entrepreneurs will help Senator Brown raise the money if needed .
" I believe it 's just not acceptable and Forestry Tasmania will do themselves great damage if they think they can remove Bob Brown from Parliament because he does n't have much money , " he said .
" I know if need be , I 'll come in with some money and I 'm sure others will too . "
Forestry Tasmania says Senator Brown has known about the debt for a long time and the case has cost the organisation more than $ 800,000 .
Ken Jeffreys from Forestry Tasmania says Senator Brown refused a compromise offer that would have reduced the court bill he owes the company .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says he is distressed to read that Senator Brown is under pressure to pay the legal bill .
But Mr Rudd has told Sky News he does not know the facts of the case .
" I 've actually got a lot of time for Bob just as a person , a bloke I 've got to know over the years , " he said .
" I did n't actually know these facts until I read them in the press today so I 'm quite concerned about it for him personally .
" As for what can be done about it , that 's a separate matter . "

Sgt John Russell 's family has released a photo of him
A US soldier has been charged with five counts of murder a day after five fellow soldiers were shot dead at a military counselling clinic in Iraq .
Sgt John Russell was also charged with one count of aggravated assault , spokesman Maj Gen David Perkins said .
Sgt Russell , serving with the 54th Engineering Battalion based in Germany , was taken into custody after the shooting in Camp Liberty , Baghdad .
One Navy doctor , an Army doctor and three enlisted personnel were killed .
The clinic provides troops with help for personal issues or combat stress .
Weapon confiscated
Maj Gen Perkins said Sgt Russell had been referred to the clinic by his superiors , and that his weapon had been taken away about a week before the incident .
Details of the shooting are still unclear .
" We have many different accounts into exactly what happened , " Maj Gen Perkins said .
Sgt Russell was " probably " on his third tour of duty in Iraq , but was due to return home soon , officials said .
An inquiry is under way into whether there are sufficient mental health facilities in Iraq for troops .
Almost one in five US soldiers deployed in Iraq suffer from Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder , according to the US military 's Battlemind website .
Incidents of US troops shooting fellow soldiers are rare .
The last such reported incident took place on 14 September 2008 , when Sergeant Joseph Bozicevich allegedly shot dead two of his superior officers .
This case is still being investigated .
Monday 's shooting was the deadliest single incident involving US forces since 10 April , when five soldiers were killed by a truck bomb in the northern city of Mosul .
YOKOHAMA , Japan -- Jose Canseco came out swinging but did n't
last long in his debut in mixed martial arts .
The former Oakland Athletics slugger was defeated by South Korean
super heavyweight Hong Man Choi by a knockout just 1 minute , 17
seconds into the first round at Yokohama Arena .
Ex-major leaguer Jose Canseco hurt his right knee shortly into his MMA debut and lost in 1 minute , 17 seconds .

The referee stopped the fight when the 7 - foot - 2 , 330 - pound Choi
knocked Canseco to the mat and started punching his head .
" That 's a big man , " Canseco said after the fight .
" I ran into
one of his left jabs and that almost knocked me out .
You have no
idea how scary it was facing a man that big . "
Canseco did land the first blow with a right to the upper body
of Choi but that was all the damage he could inflict on the Korean
giant .
Shortly into the fight , Canseco hurt his right knee and was
unable to do much after that .
" I hurt my knee back home real bad but I did n't want to
disappoint the fans , " Canseco said .
" I knew that at some point
during the fight my knee was going to give out and once I was down
I knew I was n't going to get up .
He 's just too heavy to move . "
Canseco came into the arena to " Wild Thing " with a baseball
bat on his shoulder .
The way things turned out , he probably should
have kept the bat .
He took a few swings of the bat after the fight was over and was
helped out of the ring by his girlfriend , Heidi Northcott .
Canseco , who hit 462 home runs over 17 seasons in the major
leagues , has had several fights inside the ring since leaving
baseball but has never taken on professional fighters like Choi ,
who improved to 2 - 2 in MMA .
He boxed Danny Bonaduce , a former " Partridge Family " child
star , to a draw in a celebrity match in January .
The 1988 AL MVP ,
who named alleged steroid abusers like himself in his two books ,
lost to former Philadelphia Eagle Vai Sikahema in his first foray
into celebrity boxing .
By his acknowledgment , the baseball outcast needs the money .
It 's one reason why Canseco has accepted a wide variety of offbeat
jobs to make ends meet .
He said he will work on getting his knee back in shape before
taking on any more fights .
" I have no idea if I 'll do this again , " Canseco said .
" I've
gotta get my knee better before I commit to anything like this . "
This document , or rather , reports of it , emerged in February 2006 .
We labeled it the White House Memo and began promoting awareness of it .
We did not get far with the US corporate media .
This is the same document that Vincent Bugliosi refers to as " the Manning Memo " in his book " The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder " .
Bugliosi rightly makes it central to his case .
Part of the conversation recorded in the memo is recreated in Crawford , Texas , rather than the White House , in Oliver Stone ’s 2008 film " W . "
The memo was first mentioned in Philippe Sands ' 2005 book " Lawless World : America and the Making and Breaking of Global Rules . "
And it was Sands , an attorney from England , who publicized the memo in February 2006 .
Now the British media is questioning whether the British government 's upcoming review of the Iraq War lies will include such damning pieces of evidence as the White House Memo .
And Philippe Sands is advocating for its inclusion .
Peace groups led by the Stop the War Coalition in England are planning a rally at Parliament on Wednesday to demand that the governmental inquiry be public .
Secrecy , after all , is what allowed the war in the first place .
And what difference might it make if the public in the United Kingdom or ( can you imagine it ! ) in the United States knew about this memo ?
Well , this is a document that goes beyond proving that Bush wanted war and lied about the reasons for it ( That 's so 2002 ) .
This document proves that Bush was willing to provoke Saddam Hussein into attacking Americans .
On January 31 , 2003 , prior to the full - scale invasion of Iraq in March , President George W. Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the White House .
After their meeting , they spoke to the media ( video ) and claimed not to have decided on war , to be working hard to achieve peace , and to be worried about the imminent threat from Iraq to the American people .
They claimed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to al Qaeda , and -- Bush implied , but avoided explicitly stating -- to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
They also claimed to have UN authorization for launching an attack on Iraq .
These were all blatant lies , as revealed in the White House Memo , which recorded what Bush and Blair had talked about behind closed doors just prior to the press conference .
And yet , to my knowledge , not one of the reporters you see in the above video has made a peep about it .
Blair advisor David Manning took notes that day .
The accuracy of his memo has never been challenged by Bush or Blair .
According to Manning , Bush proposed to Blair a number of possible ways in which they might be able to create an excuse to launch a war against Iraq .
One of Bush ’s proposals was " flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq , painted in UN colours [ sic ] .
If Saddam fired on them , " Bush argued , " he would be in breach " of UN resolutions .
In other words , Bush wanted to falsely paint US planes with UN colors and try to get Iraq to shoot at them .
This is what Bush really thought about the horrible , evil threat of Saddam Hussein : he wanted to provoke him .
He wanted to get US pilots shot at in order to start a war that Congress would then fund for years , and perhaps decades , on the grounds that doing so would " support the troops . "
Bush understood that the United Nations had not passed a resolution to legalize an attack on Iraq .
The White House Memo describes Bush telling Blair that " the US would put its full weight behind efforts to get another resolution and would ' twist arms ' and ' even threaten ' .
But he had to say that if ultimately we failed , military action would follow anyway . "
( These are Manning 's notes of what Bush said . )
In other words , going to the United Nations was not actually an attempt to avoid war , but an attempt to gain legal cover for a war that would be launched regardless of whether that project succeeded .
And Bush was n’t kidding about twisting arms ; that very same day the National Security Agency ( NSA ) launched a plan to bug the phones and e-mails of UN Security Council members .
At this time , a month and a half before the full - on invasion of Iraq , the US military was already engaging in hugely escalated bombing runs over Iraq and redeploying troops , including to newly constructed bases in the Middle East , all in preparation for an invasion of Iraq , and all with money that had not been appropriated for these purposes .
The reporters who questioned Bush and Blair on January 31 , 2003 , did not know about or ask about those activities .
That Bush was interested in provoking Iraq is confirmed by extensive covert operations called DB / Anabasis reported by Michael Isikoff and David Corn in their 2006 book " Hubris : The Inside Story of Spin , Scandal , and the Selling of the Iraq War . "
These operations " envisioned staging a phony incident that could be used to start a war .
A small group of Iraqi exiles would be flown into Iraq by helicopter to seize an isolated military base near the Saudi border .
They then would take to the airwaves and announce a coup was under way .
If Saddam responded by flying troops south , his aircraft would be shot down by US fighter planes patrolling the no-fly zones established by UN edict after the first Persian Gulf War .
A clash of this sort could be used to initiate a full - scale war .
On February 16 , 2002 , President Bush signed covert findings authorizing the various elements of Anabasis .
The leaders of the congressional intelligence committees -- including Porter Goss , a Republican , and Senator Bob Graham , a Democrat -- were briefed . "
A similar story came out about Dick Cheney with regard to Iran in 2008 .
Journalist Seymour Hersh reported at a journalism conference in 2008 that at a 2008 meeting in the Vice President ’s office , soon after an incident in the Strait of Hormuz in which a US carrier almost shot at a few small Iranian speedboats , " There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war .
The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build -- we in our shipyard -- build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy Seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up .
Might cost some lives .
And it was rejected because you can't have Americans killing Americans .
That 's the kind of -- that 's the level of stuff we 're talking about .
Provocation .
But that was rejected . "
After the invasion of Iraq , with no weapons or ties to 9/11 having been found , Diane Sawyer asked Bush on camera ( ABC News , December 16 , 2003 ) about the claims he had made about " weapons of mass destruction , " and he replied : " What ’s the difference ?
The possibility that [ Saddam ] could acquire weapons , if he were to acquire weapons , he would be the danger . "
Iraqi deaths as a result of the invasion and occupation , measured above the high death rate under international sanctions preceding the attack , are estimated at 1.2 to 1.3 million by two independent sources ( Just Foreign Policy ’s updated figure based on the Johns Hopkins / Lancet report , and the British polling company Opinion Research Business ’s estimate as of August 2007 ) .
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the number of Iraqis who have fled their homes has reached 4.7 million .
If these estimates are accurate , a total of nearly 6 million human beings have been displaced from their homes or killed , as of August 2008 .
Many times that many have certainly been injured , traumatized , impoverished , and deprived of clean water and other basic needs .
That we can't prosecute torture is bad enough .
That you have to cross an ocean to even find a discussion of accountability for war lies is worse .
A lawyer and genetic scientist has raised the disturbing possibility of false matches being made in the police national DNA database ( NDNAD ) .
He suggests that the DNA database – which at the end of September 2008 had 4,343,624 , samples , including those from hundreds of thousands of innocent people – is now so large that it is mathematically predicted an innocent person will be matched to a crime they did not commit .
This has been recognised for some time but Brian Costello 's reasoning is very persuasive and it concerns the continuous comparison of new DNA samples taken during arrest or from volunteers with the DNA taken from nearly half a million crime scenes " Whenever a new subject sample is loaded on to the NDNAD , " he writes in the Crimeline briefing for lawyers , " it is compared with all the existing crime scene samples to cross - check for a match .
Correspondingly , whenever a new crime scene sample is loaded onto the NDNAD it is compared to all the subject samples to cross -check for a match .
Crime scene samples are also compared to all the other crime scene samples to check if crime scenes are linked . "
Here is the important bit .
" The number of comparisons being made as samples are continually uploaded to the NDNAD is enormous .
For example , each time a new crime scene sample is loaded it is automatically compared to the 5 m odd subject samples .
The next crime scene sample is also compared to the 5 m subject samples .
Assuming the two crime scene samples are different , then 10 m comparisons have been made from the uploading of just two fresh crime scene samples . "
Costello , who worked for five years as a genetic researcher , is now completing his qualification as a barrister in Britain , having qualified as a lawyer in Australia in 2004 .
He sets out the case mathematically and claims that due to the size of the database and the number of comparisons being made " full profile chance matches ( adventitious matches ) are now actually expected to have occurred " .
Costello says that it is accepted that under ideal conditions there will be one false match per one trillion checks .
He calculates that about 2.5tn comparisons have been made ( 500,000 [ crime scene samples ] x 5,000,000 [ subject samples ] = 2,500,000,000,000 ) so it is reasonable to expect that at least two errors have occurred .
But he adds , " Unfortunately , a simple mathematical analysis will not give the true picture .
Two factors will increase the probability of adventitious matches : firstly , the condition of crime scene samples may lead to incomplete profiles ; and secondly , individuals who are related are more likely to share the same profile than unrelated individuals . "
Costello's research continues but what seems clear to me is that a system that is claimed to be foolproof has inbuilt flaws that are beginning to take effect when there are just 4.3 m samples on record .
What happens if there are 60 m samples on the NDNAD ?
And what about the profiles of innocent people kept by this appalling government despite the European court 's ruling ?
You only have to think of the false positives that have already been perpetrated in the criminal records bureau to realise that this technology is far from perfect even though juries are led to believe that it is .
So , you 've got nothing to fear if you 've done nothing wrong ?
Rubbish .
The Obama administration has sent a number of signals that it takes the information infrastructure of the nation seriously , having approved stimulus money for broadband and established a post for a national CTO .
In parallel with these actions , the administration authorized a review of the national cybersecurity policy , and that review is now complete .
Depending on how you read the resulting report , it concluded either that we do n't have a cybersecurity policy , or that we have too many of them ; in either case , its authors have made a number of very specific suggestions as to how to improve the situation .
The report is fairly blunt , stating early on that " the architecture of the Nation ’s digital infrastructure , based largely upon the Internet , is not secure or resilient . "
As our network infrastructure has developed , the focus has been on things like performance , ease - of - use , and compatibility , and security consciousness was pretty low for much of its history .
So , it 's not a surprise that both government and private computer systems have been victimized , and evidence suggests that both private parties and foreign governments have been behind these attacks .
Meanwhile , as the authors of the report put it , " the Federal government is not organized to address this growing problem effectively now or in the future . "
Responsibilities are spread across a variety of different agencies and , although past administrations have made progress in bringing the policies of different groups into alignment , there is still no overarching policy direction , nor a single authority to coordinate it .
Obviously , the report recommends that we fix all of that .
It suggests that the nation should have a single cybersecurity coordinator , operating within the National Security Council .
The position should be considered high priority , as indicated by the recommendation that this officer should be based within the White House proper , in order to be accessible .
The cybersecurity office should include staff dedicated to both privacy concerns and civil liberties , which will be welcome news to anyone worried that this might lead to NSA - style monitoring programs .
Among the tasks assigned to this office will be developing a coherent security strategy and establishing metrics by which progress can be measured .
The office will work with private industry and other interested parties to develop an incident response plan .
This last item will require some coordination with the diplomatic corps , as the report calls for bringing together " like - minded nations " to formulate standards on " acceptable legal norms regarding territorial jurisdiction , sovereign responsibility , and use of force . "
Relevant to the use of force , it appears that , in a less public effort , the administration is apparently pursuing a parallel effort within the Pentagon , which will see the Department of Defense set up an equivalent branch .
Well , partially parallel — the Pentagon version will not only develop defensive tactics and tools , but will focus on providing offensive weaponry as well .
Perhaps the most striking thing about the report , however , is that it suggests that the US may be facing the prospect of being left as a technological backwater when it comes to security , and a national effort will be required to avoid that fate .
The authors suggest a historic analog : " similar to the period after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October , 1957 , the United States is in a global race that depends on mathematics and science skills . "
In response , it suggests that the new office develop a research and development framework , and accompany it with a public information campaign that will stress the importance of security considerations .
If necessary , the government should incentivize the use of secure practices and equipment by private industry through programs like targeted tax breaks .
Whether we 'll ultimately see the sorts of leaps in science and technology education that occurred following the Sputnik launch wo n't be clear for years .
But there is some urgency to acting now .
After several years of decline , the number of students that intend to major in computer science is beginning to rise again , and integrating security into their education could provide cybersecurity the sort of boost that the authors of the report say is required .

A home security system is nothing complex .
It is a basic activity of making your home safer and peaceful .
We want to make your experience of living in your house more relaxing .
Most of the time we are all tired of the office work and the housework we do all day .
We are not only exhausted but frustrated .
We ca n’t always stay hyperactive to notice the minimum movement inside or outside of the house .
And of course , the burglar is never entering your home with a drum roll .
Mishaps are unpleasant and cause panics .
Home security systems minimize the loss to an extreme extent .
The question here is how ?
How a home security system is so efficient to protect us from mishaps ?
The answer to this is the components it has .
There are several components of this system which participate effectively in making the atmosphere is secure and sound .
Consult with your local locksmith or security expert such as www.ilocksecurity.com.au for further advice .
Basically , the entry points i.e. doors and windows are secured and connected to one master control panel located somewhere in the house .
Most of the people have master control in their bedroom or their living room so that they may have quick access to it .
What makes up a Home Security System ?

LaSalle , Illinois : Open Court ( 1932 ) .
The Federal Opposition is on the back foot as leader Malcolm Turnbull concedes that accusations the Prime Minister was involved in the OzCar affair cannot be sustained .
The Federal Government is demanding Mr Turnbull apologise and step down for accusing both Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan of seeking favours for a friend , car dealer John Grant , and misleading Parliament about it .
A disputed email Mr Turnbull questioned Mr Rudd about has been found to be a fake by the Federal Police .
" The case that Mr Rudd misled the house about the communication is not sustained , " Mr Turnbull told AM .
" There is no doubt about that . "
Mr Turnbull has reiterated that the Liberals had nothing to do with creating the fake email .
" It was not created or composed by us .
If it is a fake as is apparently the case , it was a fake that was created in the Treasury , " he said .
" Now how on earth can I be responsible for a fake that is created in Mr Swan 's Department ?
" It is absurd for Mr Rudd to say it is a question of my character that a senior official has , so it is alleged , created a fake email .
" Now , if that is the case that raises an issue for a senior official .
It does n't raise an issue for us . "
But Mr Turnbull says the Opposition acted " reasonably and responsibly " by asking the PM to explain himself and basing its accusations on evidence a Treasury official - Godwin Grech - gave to a Senate inquiry on Friday .
" Mr Rudd should apologise to me for accusing us of fabricating an email , " he said .
" We were entitled to rely on what he ( Grech ) said , but if he 's wrong then the case against Mr Rudd is not there . "
Mr Grech is in charge of the Government 's OzCar scheme and gave key evidence about the scandal to a senate inquiry on Friday .
Mr Grech told the inquiry he recalled receiving a short email from the Prime Minister 's office asking him to assist Mr Grant , a friend of Mr Rudd's who had supplied the PM with a ute .
Mr Turnbull says there is now doubt about Mr Grech 's evidence .
" If the email that has turned out to be a fake , that raises huge questions over that , the basis of that , " he said .
" Having said that , everything we did , we acted reasonably and responsibly on it .
We had no reason to believe that Mr Grech was not telling absolutely the truth . "
" He is a very senior Treasury official .
A person in whom the Government , Mr Rudd and Mr Swan have placed considerable trust so we were entitled to rely on what he said but if he is wrong then the case against Mr Rudd is not there . "
Despite the setback Mr Turnbull is still pursuing the Treasurer over the OzCar affair , saying Mr Swan did give special treatment to Mr Grant and that is plain from the emails tendered to the Senate .
Mr Turnbull says the spotlight should stay on Mr Swan .
" What Mr Rudd is trying to do is to divert attention from the fact that Mr Swan unquestionably misled the Parliament , " he told AM .
" He did give special treatment to Mr Grant .
He did use the leverage of the Federal Government over Ford Credit when it was desperately seeking $ 500 million in order to survive so that Mr Grant could secure an advantage and that is plain from ... the emails that are not in contention that have been tendered to the Senate by the Treasury . "
Hockey rings Grech
Meanwhile , Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey has revealed he rang Mr Grech at the weekend .
Mr Grech worked for Mr Hockey for a short time several years ago , but Mr Hockey says he has n't spoken to him for about two years .
He says he tried to get in touch with Mr Grech on Saturday .
" I sought out his mobile phone number and rang and left a message to say ' I hope you 're OK , take care of yourself ' and that is the only time I have attempted to contact him in years , " he said .
Based on an interview by political correspondent Lyndal Curtis for AM .
This is a discussion about the huge and looming crisis in our nation ’s health care system and the need for a radical paradigm changing reform .
Because the issues discussed below necessarily involve a politically difficult restructuring of a large and well establish sector of our economy , the breadth and details of this reform have so far has been largely excluded from public policy discussions and debate .
AHIP – American Health Insurance Plans - representing the private , for profit , health insurance companies and their partners had their annual national convention in San Diego , California this week .
They are the association of all the major health insurers in the United States and their lobbying clout is unsurpassed .
Major public political leaders of both parties , men like Jeb Bush , Dr. Howard Dean , and Tom Daschle attended .
As a practicing family physician who has been seeing patients since Medicare was started I can tell you what really ails our national health system .
Making the correct diagnosis is important .
Yet those in Washington – both in the White House and in Congress - both Republicans and Democrats – and the national media - are eagerly avoiding the right diagnosis and thus preventing public discussion about the necessary cures .
As you all know if we do n’t make the right diagnosis the disease will not be cured and the patient will not get better .
Today the biggest barrier to improving our health care system in the United States is the private health insurance companies .
They are the disease we suffer from .
The best , and perhaps the only , public policy cure that will work is a single payer , Medicare for All , health care financing program .
Yet due to financial power of the health insurance industry , their great financial lobbying clout , embarrassingly our elected officials are doing everything they can to avoid the current golden opportunity to create a single payer system .
I want to make only three main points :
The individual insurance companies are out for profit and must work to maximize their value on the stock market and not our friends .
They treat patients like widgets or cost centers .
This is not a culture of trust , caring , compassion , and fiduciary responsibility .
If you were dumb enough to hope that Countrywide Mortgage would preserve your home and Lehman Brothers would preserve your retirement fund , then you will be stupid enough to expect Anthem Blue Cross and the other insurance companies to be there to protect your health .
Yet it seems all Washington continues under this delusion .
The employer based private health insurance industry has been created by us , is hugely subsidized by public policy and public money and is expensive , inefficient , costly , and a structural barrier to a healthy America .
It needs to be eliminated .
The only cure for our problem is a single payer , national , universal , health financing program like Medicare for All .
This is not socialized medicine , but an efficient way to pool risk and share the unexpected costs of illness .
Fifty percent of our population has virtually no medical expenses while five percent consume 25 percent of all personal medical care costs .
This why we need the insurance principle : unexpected medical expenses are relatively rare and can be huge and should be spread across the whole population .
Financial costs related to illness cause over 50 percent of personal bankruptcies in the United States .
Over 46 million Americans are rationed out of the medical system ( and during this economic catastrophe this number is growing by 10,000 people per day ) 46 million people are subject to excess morbidity and mortality because they cannot afford financing and the insurance industry cannot profit from them .
Health insurance is important and necessary .
We need an efficient , national , publicaly sponsored , universal health financing system .
This is the only treatment that will be a cure .
First , let me dwell on the track record of an individual insurance company , specifically United Health Plans .
United Health Group is America ’s largest health insurance company .
According to their 2008 annual report United has 75,000 employees , insure 29.1 million Americans directly and cover up to 78 million people , contract with 650,000 doctors and 5200 hospitals .
Their insurance programs include : a government subsidized Medicare Advantage program called Secure Horizons , a Medicare Part D prescription program called Prescription Solutions , and they have an exclusive arrangement with AARP to offer a Medicare supplement .
The company has a subsidiary , Ingenix ( remember this name ) which provides " actuarial data , claims management services , and health intelligence " in 56 countries and in the USA to 6000 hospitals , 240,000 MDs , 1500 health plans , and 250 government agencies .
In 2008 United Health had total revenues of approximately $ 81.2 billion ( $ 75.9 billion from health insurance and $ 1.6 billion from Ingenix ) and their 2008 net revenue was $ 5.2 billion from health insurance .
( This profit was in essence moneys diverted from health insurance premiums paid by government , individuals and employees to obtain medical care even after the company ’s huge administrative costs are deducted . )
They had an additional $ 229 million profit from Ingenix .
According to SEC filings during our current economic and health care crisis their 2009 first quarter total revenue went up 8 % to $ 22 billion and their net profit was $ 984 million .
According to the company ’s own report they have a medical loss ratio of about 80 per cent - that is , of collected premiums they spend only about 80 % on actual medical care , that is we loose 20 per cent of the money we pay them to their overhead and profit .
Some recent corporate history with you will demonstrate how far their corporate culture is from taking care of the sick and disabled .
In 2006 The Wall Street Journal reported that company executives were back dating their stock options .
Because of the ensuing scandal in October 15 , 2006 company President and CEO William McGuire , who usually made between $ 60 and $ 120 million a year was forced to resign but he took with him the largest golden parachute ever paid , a compensation package estimated to be $ 1.1 billon .
He was subsequently forced to pay back to the SEC $ 468 million in refunds and $ 7 million in penalties .
In 2008 the net realized profit of the United HealthCare Group fell 36 per cent from 2007 – from $ 4.65 billion in 2007 to $ 2.98 billion in 2008 due to legal costs .
In 2008 , an investigation by New York State Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo found that Ingenix and its parent UnitedHealth Group defrauded consumers and providers by manipulating its database used to quantify reasonable and customary medical care provider rates to make them remarkably lower than the actual cost of typical medical expense .
This provided health insurance companies over the past 15 years the means to inappropriately lower payment of provider claims , thereby increasing the insurance companies ’ profits and often leaving patients to pay the difference .
The company paid a $ 50 million fine and set another $ 50 million aside to revamp its data system as an external organization under non-profit public supervision .
In 2008 United Health paid another $ 895 million in legal and settlement costs in two other class action law suits , the major one brought by CALPERS retirement fund over the stock option deception .
In addition , on January 15 , 2009 , UnitedHealth Group announced a $ 350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association and others for not paying claims for out of network medical services to their patients .
Anyone can easily see that the management of this company has no sense of public fiduciary responsibility and has focused major resources on making profit and manipulating the financing of health care .
It is a real stretch to imagine that the same board of directors and top officials , so caught up in these huge illegal money grabs would really be interested in paying attention to my patients ’ , and your family ’s , and our neighbors ’ sickness and pain or in any remediation of our health care system ’s problems .
In addition it is important to mention AARP – the AARP that supported the poorly designed Medicare Part D which became very profitable to insurance companies due to its mandated subsidies .
The American Association of Retired People have an exclusive contract with this same United Health care to sell their health insurance policies .
Do you know that AARP ’s annual budget is over $ 1 billion a year and over $ 700 million of that comes from fees for selling insurance products .
Some of these products are total rip offs as was recently revealed by our conservative Republican Senator from Iowa , Chuck Grassley who sent AARP a searing letter dated November 3 , 2008 .
It embarrassed AARP and forced them to withdraw from the market several scandalous products ( Essential Health Insurance Plan and Essential Plus Health Insurance Plan ) developed by the United Health Group and sold by AARP to 44,000 people .
You will note that AARP is always invited to the public policy table and the hearings to contribute to major political discussions about health care reform .
This is totally inappropriate .
AARP is part of the problem and not part of the solution .
It is nothing but an insurance broker disguised as an advocacy group – and they will never take on the health insurance industry .
AARP will represent the insurance industry rather than the public welfare in discussions about health reform .
Now examine the health insurance system as a whole :
It should be obvious that the only functional purpose of the insurance company is to collect money ( premiums ) from one set of folks ( people / patients ) and pool it and then pay it to another set of folks ( medical providers ) .
Other than acting as a bank , there is NO value added .
All the rest is expensive smoke and mirrors : marketing , false consumer choices , medical rating , care management – all of which they do poorly and very expensively .
In fact , all these expensive activities are designed to either maximize profit or to be a window dressing rationale for their profit .
Furthermore , the health insurance industry itself and its egregious expenses and profits are virtually wholly a creation of tax payer subsidy and 70 years of one sided industry supportive legislation .
Federal programs such as Medicare , Medicaid , the Veteran ’s Administration , Crippled Children ’s Services , SCHIP , and the Ryan White
Act take huge numbers of potentially expensive or chronically ill Americans out of the pool of privately insured people , allowing these private firms to cherry pick the most affordable enrollees .
Few people remember that the first private health insurance companies like the original Blue Cross and Blue Shield were not for profit entities with some charitable purpose .
In 1944 FDR ’s attorney general charged the South - Eastern Underwriters Association , an insurance company , with anti-trust price fixing .
The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court , where the insurers made the audacious defense that they could not be regulated under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution because they were not a business , not " commerce . "
The insurance company lost , but within a year their lobbyists took their revenge .
In 1945 the McCarran - Ferguson Act declared that " No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate , impair , or supersede any law enacted by any State for regulating the business of insurance ... "
This why we are stuck with the relatively fragmented and impotent state attorney generals and 50 state agencies to regulate the massive corporate businesses represented by AHIP .
( It takes a creative and powerful attorney general like Andrew Cuomo of New York to have an impact . )
Since then and along the way the insurance lobby has had its way with state legislatures .
First , the health insurance companies were allowed to give up community ( a geographic standard ) rating for medical rating ( an individual disease history standard ) – so they could increasingly exclude potentially expensive patients and secondly , not for profit health insurance companies were allowed to become for - profit so their companies and enrollees could be cheaply acquired by the expanding for - profit corporate giants like United Health care .
In this process , over the last 65 years , the health insurance companies have long given up any semblance of being service organizations .
They became the disease in our health care system .
Now we have to deal with massive powerfully oligopolistic insurance companies .
In February , 2009 the US GAO surveyed the small group health insurance market .
They found " The five largest carriers in the small group market , when combined , ( had ) ... three - quarters or more of the market in 34 of the 39 states ... and they ( had ) ...90 percent or more in 23 of these states . "
Each health provider has to deal with potentially 1500 different insurance companies , each with their own care rules and payment querks .
In my office I regularly deal with about 40 payers .
A study published just last month in HEALTH AFFAIRS , demonstrated that " billing and insurance - related functions " cost each FTE physician at least $ 85,276 a year ( or about 10 % of gross revenue ) in time and staff .
In the last 30 years the number of health system administrators has grown by 3000 % while the number of physicians has grown 300 % .
In the past 9 years workers ’ pay has grown 29 % while the cost of health insurance net of administration has grown 75 % and the net cost of health insurance administration has risen 106 % .
This year per capita health expenditures in the United States will approach $ 8000 a year or about 17 % of our GNP .
A study by an international management consulting firm demonstrated that on an internationally adjusted comparative basis annual health care spending for each person in the United States is over $ 2000 a year more than would be econometrically appropriate given our nation ’s wealth .
This added expense is almost wholly due to the costs of the private , for profit health insurance system and adds no value .
The bottom line is that the private , for profit health insurance companies divert on the order of $ 350 billion of insurance premium money from medical services .
This is a sum which approaches the size of the peacetime Pentagon budget .
Single payer reform will reallocate these moneys to care for the uninsured .
In order to understand why single payer reform has not been given a fair hearing in Washington I want to detail the power of AHIP .
In 2008 alone they gave $ 36,695,680 to Congressional candidates - $ 17,493,170 to democrats and $ 19,128,523 to republicans .
Senator Baucus , chairing the health reform hearings at the Senate Finance Committee , has raised $ 11.4 million from 2005 through now .
Of this about $ 500,000 came from insurance companies , $ 500,000 from pharmaceutical companies , and $ 500,0000 from health professionals .
This is why two weeks ago my concerned colleagues from the California Nurses Association and Physicians for A National Health Program had to disrupt the order of his hearings to point out he was ignoring the single payer reform option .
It is important to understand why a " public health insurance plan " created to " stand beside " existing private health insurance plans does not provide a cure .
This proposal is based in part on the experience in Massachusetts .
The current Massachusetts universal coverage health reform plan is being looked upon as a model for the nation .
It has had some success , yet it cannot and must not be used as a model for national reform with a " stand along public health plan " option .
The Massachusetts model relies on government subsidy directed through the private health insurance carriers .
There are three important observations here :
A 2007 study sponsored by AHIP reviewed prior experience with this type of reform model in 8 states in the 1990s ( Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts ( in 1996 ) , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Vermont , and Washington ) .
They found that " in general ... , individual health insurance markets deteriorated ....
Often , insurance companies chose to stop selling individual insurance in the market .... Enrollment in individual insurance also tended to decrease , and premium rates tended to increase , sometimes dramatically ... ( And ) we did not observe any significant decreases in the level of uninsured persons following the enactment of these market reforms . "
The result was that all these reform programs failed and went out of existence .
Even with state government subsidy and leverage on premium charges many residents are excused from the " universal " program because they cannot afford the premiums .
Many others are faced with unacceptably high and unaffordable copayments , deductibles , and benefit limits built into the approved insurance plans .
The program is totally dependent on the private insurance companies and there is no cost and minimal quality control mechanisms built in .
The state of Massachusetts is thus currently facing a huge and perhaps intolerable budgetary deficit .
Finally , the cure is conceptually simple , but admittedly politically difficult .
If the disease is an expensive and dysfunctional private , for profit health insurance system , the only possible cure is a single payer , Medicare for All reform .
This option must not only be on the table , but must be passed into law .
Our elected representatives must be supported to have the courage to objectively evaluate its benefits , and then given the backbone to pass it .
This option already exists in the detailed legislative form contained in HR 676 by Congressman Conyers and already endorsed by 70 Congressmen and women .
It contains five simple to understand solution components :
AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT
– Everyone receives a card assuring payment for all needed care by any willing licensed provider .
This would eliminate the need for expensive marketing and sales campaigns and the broker system .
Universal coverage will also shrink the need for workman ’s compensation insurance as well as medical malpractice insurance .
FREE CHOICE OF DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL
DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS REMAIN INDEPENDENT and negotiate fees and budgets with public agencies .
This is not socialized medicine .
A PUBLIC AGENCY PROCESSES AND PAYS ALL BILLS .
This should massively cut the administrative overhead drain generated both by insurance companies , by employer HR departments , and by medical providers from the order of 40 % of costs to 10 % of costs allowing an estimated savings of $ 50 billion in the first year and up to $ 250 billion annually which can be used to cover the currently uninsured without the need to add new taxpayer subsidy .
Money is provided by this law to retrain displaced insurance company workers .
The system would be FINANCED BY PROGRESSIVE TAXES .
This would lift the burden of health insurance costs from America ’s businesses making them more internationally competitive ; widely expand the risk poll , thus lowering the cost for every individual participant , and eliminate the need for expensive HR systems .
The information , discussion , and perspective presented here has been virtually absent from White House , Congressional , and media discussions of the need to reform the health care system .
This seems to be largely because of the political and financial clout of AHIP .
It is important to know that single payer reform , Medicare for All , is the only proposal in the public arena with broad , enthusiastic support from the men and women on the street who must understand these facts to be motivated to get involved .
COLOMBO , Sri Lanka–Volunteers dug mass graves in the marshes of Sri Lanka 's northern war zone Monday as they buried hundreds of civilians killed in artillery attacks that the U.N. characterized as a " bloodbath . ''
A doctor in the war zone said as many as 1,000 civilians may have been killed in two days of shelling that marked some of the worst violence in this Indian Ocean island nation since the civil war flared up again more than three years ago .
With the civilian death toll skyrocketing , the Tamil Tiger rebels and a coalition of international human rights groups separately called for the U.N. Security Council to urgently hold talks on the conflict .
But with several nations protesting such talks , that seemed unlikely .
The government and the separatist rebels both denied responsibility for the artillery attacks that struck the tiny sliver of northeast coast still held by the rebels in two waves .
The worst barrage pounded the area , which holds an estimated 50,000 trapped civilians , from Saturday night until Sunday morning , health officials said .
Another attack hit the area overnight Sunday , landing in a newly demarcated " safe zone " where the government had urged civilians to gather , according to Dr. V. Shanmugarajah , who works at a makeshift hospital in the area .
A total of 430 ethnic Tamil civilians , including 106 children , were either brought to the hospital for burial or died at the facility , he said .
More than 1,300 wounded came to the hospital as well , he said .
But , he said , the death toll was likely far higher because many of those killed would have been buried in the bunkers where they were slain , and many of the gravely wounded never made it to the hospital for treatment .
" There were many who died without medical attention , '' Shanmugarajah said .
" Seeing the number of wounded , and from what the people tell me , I estimate the death toll to be around 1,000 . ''
Volunteers dug mass graves in the marsh near the hospital , putting 50 to 60 bodies in each pit , he said .
One of the hospital 's nurses was killed along with his family as they sheltered from the onslaught in a trench that was then filled with soil and turned into their grave , he said .
" The U.N. has consistently warned against the bloodbath scenario as we 've watched the steady increase in civilian deaths over the last few months , " U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss said .
" The large - scale killing of civilians over the weekend , including the deaths of more than 100 children , shows that that bloodbath has become a reality . ''
The hospital in the war zone was so overwhelmed that many of those wounded in Saturday 's barrage had still not been treated Monday morning .
Every time Shanmugarajah left the operating room , he was mobbed by those seeking treatment , he said .
" The hospital death rate is increasing , but we are helpless , '' he said .
People were begging the doctors to send them away on a Red Cross ship that comes every few days to evacuate the wounded , saying they could not bear the shelling anymore , he said .
Reports of the fighting are difficult to verify because the government bars journalists and aid workers from the war zone .
U.N. figures compiled last month showed that nearly 6,500 civilians had been killed in three months this year as the government drove the separatist rebels from their northern strongholds and vowed to end the war .
Selvarasa Pathmanathan , a top rebel official , appealed to the international community and the Security Council to take up the war ``as a matter of urgency , " according to a statement posted on the rebel - linked Web site TamilNet .
Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International and other rights groups called on Japan , the largest international donor to Sri Lanka , to press the U.N. to urgently address the war , and British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called for discussions to be held at all levels of the U.N. on the plight of the civilians .
" No one can be in any doubt that this is an issue that deserves the international community 's attention , " Miliband told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York .
Sri Lanka is not on the Security Council agenda because Russia , China , Japan and Vietnam consider the fighting an internal matter .
The rebels , listed as a terror group by the U.S. and the EU , blamed the artillery assaults on the government , with Pathmanathan calling them " a deliberate massacre of Tamil civilians by the Sri Lankan armed forces . ''
Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe denied the government was responsible for any artillery attacks and claimed health officials in the area were under pressure from the rebels to lie .

" We have consciously avoided firing into the areas where civilians are forcibly held by the LTTE , " he said , referring to the rebels by the acronym of their formal name , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam .
Rights groups have accused the government of bombing and shelling the war zone despite pledges to stop using heavy weapons , and accuse the rebels of holding civilians as human shields and shooting at many who tried to flee .
The government has brushed off international calls for a humanitarian truce , saying any pause in the fighting would give the rebels time to regroup and prolong a war that has already lasted more than a quarter century .

With much fanfare , the government of Gordon Brown unveiled Contest 2 , its sequel to the UK 's previous counter - terrorism strategy .
In the lead - up to its emergence , bits of the programme were leaked to the media , including that approximately 60,000 people such as security guards and shop clerks would receive training on what to watch for in terms of suspicious behaviour and how to react in the aftermath of a terrorist attack .
That aspect of the strategy was preceded by a new anti-terrorist campaign launched by the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) and the Metropolitan police involving advertisements appearing at tube stations , on billboards in London and elsewhere , and even on the radio .
These ads raise the spectre of terrorism and the reward for action by diligent citizens who in the tube and billboard ads notice suspicious behaviour , such as chemical containers in a skip or an individual studying CCTV cameras , and report the incidents via a confidential anti-terrorism hotline .
The radio commercial provides the alternative to citizens failing to act with the sound of a devastating explosion .
In a UK context these campaigns represent an effort to widen public participation in counter - terrorism , essentially turning citizens into stakeholders in the effort .
They also reflect a continued government concern about the risk of terrorism , particularly through low - level attacks carried out by so - called " self starters " who exist outside those groups and individuals already known to the police and security service .
Encouraging suspicion through counter - terrorism training of ordinary citizens or public advertising campaigns is not , however , without its own risks .
There is the potential for certain citizens to be demonised and stigmatised when their activities receive excessive scrutiny and , through calls to the hotline , to unwarranted attention from the police .
Indeed , this point plus the wider implications for civil liberties of state - sanctioned snitching were the issues that emerged when a similar effort was proposed in the US in 2002 .
In January 2002 , the Bush administration introduced the Terrorism Information and Prevention System ( Tips ) with the goal of increasing public participation in domestic counter - terrorism .
The goal of Tips was to " enable millions of America transportation workers , postal workers , and public utility employees to identify and report suspicious activities linked to terrorism and crime " .
It was to do so by setting up a special hotline , similar to the one in the British advertising , that these workers could call to report suspicious behaviour .
The US deputy attorney general hailed the programme as providing " millions of American truckers , letter carriers , train conductors , ship captains , utility employees , and others , whose routines allow them to be the 'eyes and ears ' of police , a formal way to report suspicious or potential terrorist activity " .
The programme largely escaped wider public attention until a story in an Australian newspaper compared it to something that could have emerged from the former German Democratic Republic .
Very quickly a maelstrom of criticism erupted that ran across the American political spectrum from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Village Voice on the left to the New York Times in the centre to Republican congressmen Dick Armey and Bob Barr on the right , the latter who called it a " snitch system " , that appeared to typify " the very type of fascist or communist government we fought so hard to eradicate in other countries in decades past " .
The New York Times ran interviews with some workers who potentially might be called upon to report information .
A delivery driver remarked on the increased number of satellite dishes he had delivered to " Arabs " after 11 September while another driver complained that " [ i] mmigrants stare more than anybody else " .
In an editorial the paper decried the new version of the programme : " Even if it is limited to public places , the programme is offensive .
The idea of citizens spying on citizens , and the government collecting data on everyone who is accused , is a staple of totalitarian regimes . "
By then , Tips had made a host of enemies , including Armey , the then Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives .
With little fanfare , Armey inserted a clause into the Homeland Security Act that prohibited any efforts to implement Tips .
The programme died when Bush signed the act into law in November 2002 .
Whether similar controversy as in the US will appear in the UK remains to be seen .
Past experience with CCTV would suggest not .
Nevertheless , there remains a fine line between encouraging a well - informed public to be vigilant about terrorism and promoting paranoia that will lead to neighbour spying on neighbour .
Ah , to have been a fly on the meeting in which Apple marketing execs picked The Submarines ' song " You , Me , and the Bourgeoisie " as the main theme for their iPhone ads !
The catchy song was a stroke of marketing genius ( and one imagines that it worked out pretty well for The Submarines , too ) , but a closer look at the song 's lyrics makes it a surprising choice for the iPhone campaign .
Why 's that ?
It 's an anti-consumerism anthem .
Plastic bottles
Imported water
Cars we drive wherever we want to
Clothes we buy , it 's sweatshop labor
Drugs from corporate enablers
We 're not living the " good life "
Unless we 're fighting the good fight
So says the song , and it's clear that " fighting the good fight " involves turning our backs on most of the things listed above .
What do we need instead ?
Well , as The Beatles knew , all you need is love .
Love can free us from all excess
From our deepest debts
Cause when our hearts are full we need much less
But Apple 's entire iPhone campaign — indeed , the company 's entire product line — is predicated on consumerism , the purchase of expensive technology , owning the trendiest gadgets , and creating a sense of need in people who never knew their lives were incomplete without a glossy black phone .
As with most companies , Apple stands to lose big if people truly " need much less " and turn their backs on US consumption patterns .
It 's a truly odd pairing of image and lyrics , which is no doubt part of the reason that the lyrics are not , in fact , in any of the commercials .
( This is unlike older Apple ads featuring Feist and Chairlift . )
Steve Jobs is widely reputed to have Buddhist leanings ; how the man pairs " nonattachment " with " running Apple " is a mystery we may never plumb .
The song may resonate with a Jobsian " billionaire 's detachment " from the material world that binds us to a cycle of suffering , but it stands in stark counterpoint to the product it 's being used to sell .
Mr. Moneybags and investor extraordinaire Warren Buffett criticized Apple earlier today for not disclosing Jobs ’ liver transplant as it was taking it place .
In an interview with CNBC , Buffet stated :
If I have any serious illness , or something coming up of an important nature , an operation or anything like that , I think the thing to do is just tell the American , the Berkshire shareholders about it .
I work for ’em .
Some people might think I ’m important to the company .
Certainly Steve Jobs is important to Apple .
So it ’s a material fact .
Whether he is facing serious surgery or not is a material fact .
Whether I ’m facing serious surgery is a material fact .
Whether ( General Electric CEO ) Jeff Immelt is , I mean , so I think that ’s important .
A valid argument , to be sure , but there ’s a bit of nuance that Buffett is overlooking .
Granted , Steve Jobs undergoing a liver transplant is an important fact , but is it material to the extent that it would affect Apple ’s future prospects as a company ?
Not really .
Apple ’s performance over the past 6 months suggests that the company is more than capable of excelling even in Jobs ’ absence .
Just because the mainstream media likes to think that Steve Jobs is Apple does n’t make it so .
Also , investors are like sports gamblers .
Every piece of information they can get their hands on is important in their eyes .
“ Did Tom Brady get enough sleep last night ? ” “ Did Shaq jam his pinky finger in practice yesterday ? ” “ Is Peyton Manning using Rogaine ? ”
Just because information is desired does n’t mean that it ’s as important as those who desire it would lead you to believe .
That ’s not to downplay Jobs ’ procedure , but merely to point out that investors will never be happy with the information at their disposal .
If Apple disclosed Jobs ’ surgery 2 months ago , pundits and critics would be shouting that Apple should have disclosed a few weeks prior that Jobs was considering the operation in the first place .
Again , Steve Jobs may embody Apple , but the company is hardly a one - man show .
Also , why are people overlooking the fact that over the past few months , Apple has publicly and officially stated a number of times that Jobs would be returning to Apple at the end of June , right on schedule ?
Is n’t that really the most important nugget of information ?

( CNN ) -- Matt Aldridge would have trouble contemplating life without the Shriners Hospital for Children in Greenville , South Carolina .
Maddie Aldridge has received extensive care at South Carolina 's Shriners Hospital , including leg amputation .
Aldridge , 28 , and his 21 - month - old daughter , Maddie , were born without shinbones .
Both had their legs amputated at Shriners near their first birthdays .
Like all care given to youths admitted to any of North America 's 22 Shriners Hospitals , their surgeries and follow - up treatments were free to them .
Aldridge estimates the care he received through his teens in the Shriners ' system -- which admits children irrespective of their parents ' income -- cost hundreds of thousands of dollars , approaching the lifetime limits of some insurance policies .
Now , he and his wife , Renee , take Maddie to Greenville -- about a 90 - minute drive from their South Carolina home -- at least every six weeks , partly for treatment of a hip condition .
Without Shriners ' cover - all - costs policy , the family would be in serious trouble , said Aldridge , who works at a Wal - Mart cell phone connection center .
Renee is a stay - at - home mother , and the family does n't have private medical insurance .
" If it were n't for Shriners , we'd be financially devastated , " Matt Aldridge said .
" With just the care Maddie has received already , we probably would be bankrupt . "
For the Aldridges and many other families , accessing care from Shriners may get a lot more difficult .
The system 's board says it may ask the fraternity 's membership in July for authority to close six hospitals -- including the one in Greenville -- largely because the endowment fund that supports the hospitals dropped from $ 8.5 billion to $ 5.2 billion over the last year as the stock market plummeted .
The others that could close are in Erie , Pennsylvania ; Shreveport , Louisiana ; Spokane , Washington ; Springfield , Massachusetts ; and Galveston , Texas .
The Galveston hospital 's operations have been suspended since Hurricane Ike flooded it last year .
See map of where all 22 Shriners hospitals are »
Deflated investments are n't the only reason the fund has dropped .
The hospitals normally operate with donations and the fund 's interest , but the system 's $ 856 million 2009 budget is outpacing both , causing the hospitals to take about $ 1 million per day from the fund , said Ralph Semb , president and CEO of Shriners Hospitals .
Do n't Miss Shriners treating some victims of Mexico fire
Other proposals from the system 's board would close just one hospital or none , but slash spending systemwide .
Leaders also are exploring other options , such as partnering with non-Shriners hospitals .
But one way or another , the system must cut spending by about 30 percent to survive , Semb said .
" If we do nothing , every hospital would have to cut 25 to 30 percent from their budgets , which in effect would shut about six of them anyway , because they could n't give the services they 've been giving , " Semb said .
Still , the hospitals can't close without consent of the fraternity 's membership .
Two - thirds of the roughly 1,400 representatives at the group 's July 6 - 8 Imperial Council Session in San Antonio , Texas , would have to vote for it .
Learn about the Shriners fraternity »
History shows that might be difficult .
Members , some of whom transport children to hospitals themselves , killed a 2003 proposal to close the hospital in Minneapolis , Minnesota , after a similar market downturn .
" I do n't think it will happen .
I do n't think it should happen , " said Carl V. Nielsen , a 40 - year Shriner and a board member for the Minneapolis hospital , which is not on the current possible - closure list .
" That would leave large areas of the country without a Shriners hospital , and the cost of transportation of the patients back and forth [ to the remaining hospitals ] would be too great . "
Shriners Hospitals , which deals with certain specialties up to age 18 , have treated hundreds of thousands of children free of charge since the first facility opened in Shreveport in 1922 .
Most offer orthopedic care .
Four , including the Galveston hospital , care for children who are burned .
One of those facilities , in Sacramento , California , is treating a few children burned in Friday 's day care center fire in northern Mexico .
The Greenville hospital , which generally draws children from six states , gets about 900 inpatients and about 1,100 outpatient visits yearly , according to Rod Brown , the chairman of that hospital 's board of governors .
Since news of the possible closures broke , many -- including some Shriners and people who 've used the hospitals -- have spoken out in hopes of keeping the facilities open .
Hundreds have turned out for rallies in some of the cities .
Several " save Shriners Hospital " pages on Facebook call on readers to support fundraisers .
Families who lose a nearby Shriners hospital -- even those who have insurance -- would be in trouble , said Nielsen , an Iowa resident , retired attorney and former state legislator .
" Say you 've got a series of operations to do on the child , and it 's going to cost $ 100,000 .
Even with the good insurance policies , the families still have to pay 20 percent on that , and that 's more money than most have stashed away , " he said .
The Aldridges have more surgeries in their future .
In addition to being born without her shinbones , Maddie has only eight fingers .
She will need operations to make her hands more efficient .
Watch how hospital 's closure would affect the Aldridges »
If the Greenville facility were to close , the family would think about moving to Kentucky , where the next nearest Shriners hospital is .
Or , they would stay and drive eight hours to the Kentucky facility .
Option No. 1 would take the lifelong South Carolina residents from friends and relatives .
The other would mean more missed days at work and school for the family , which also includes Maddie 's 3 - year - old sister .
In any event , the family says it wo n't consider taking Maddie out of the Shriners system .
Matt Aldridge , who took up competitive power - lifting thanks in part to encouragement from Shriners staff and competed in the 2004 Paralympic Games in Greece , said the system gives top - notch care .
" Not only is it a financial thing , but it's also quality of care , " said Aldridge , who became a Shriner himself in part because of the care he received .
" Shriners doctors are considered to be the foremost experts in what they treat . "
Semb said some of the six hospitals -- which he said were chosen because they were relatively underutilized -- could stay open if they strike a partnership with non-Shriners facilities .
In such a deal , Shriners doctors would perform major surgery at the partner hospital , and the partner would bill the patients ' insurance if they have it .
Follow - up care would be done at the Shriners facility , still free of charge .
Nielsen and other Shriners are proposing an alternative for the July meeting : Let Shriners hospitals themselves accept insurance or Medicaid from the families who have it , but cover the co-pays and deductibles .
Semb said the idea has some merit , but he cautioned that to accept insurance and Medicaid , the hospitals would subject themselves to more federal oversight and possibly curtail their ability to treat patients as they see fit .
Meanwhile , Renee Aldridge is circulating petitions against the closures and intends to deliver them to the San Antonio meeting .
Wide swaths of the country should n't be deprived of the expertise and the free treatment that Shriners doctors give , she said .
" Some may be able to go to another place , but a lot of doctors wo n't put the time and care in that Shriners does , " she said .

Purdue University muslims to woman against Sharia : “ You have no right to speak ”
Few dare to speak out against Sharia Law , and fewer still get the chance to do so in our one - sided , speech - coded , liberal halls of academia .
When they do , they are treated with disrespect by both the school administration and students .
And it would not be a stretch to say that they take their lives in their hands , delivering a message that the biased or blind media is unwilling to give .
One such person is Nonie Darwish , a woman who lived under Sharia for 47 years .
On April 9 , 2009 , she gave a speech at Purdue University on the threat of Sharia Law .
Some Muslims in attendance helped Darwish make her point , by shouting that she had no right to speak , and questioning how much her jewelry cost .
School and security officials , did nothing to quiet the crowd .
Although , as you will see in this video , they did plenty to quiet the speaker ’s sponsor , the Conservative Coalition for American Values , outside before the event .
If she had attempted to give this speech in an Islamic country , she ’d be buried neck deep and stoned to death .
If she ’d given it in many countries in Europe , she possibly be arrested for hate speech .
So far , here in America , she only gets the treatment you see in the video .
So far , we say , if our media –a nd organizations pretending to stand up for women , like NOW — does not begin reporting stories like this .

( CNN ) --
As the number of swine flu cases rises around the world , so is a gradual backlash -- with some saying the threat the virus poses is overblown .
Workers in South Korea , where one case of swine flu is confirmed , disinfect a terminal Sunday at Incheon airport .
By Monday , 985 cases of the virus , known as influenza A ( H1N1 ) , had been confirmed in 20 countries , the World Health Organization said .
The number of fatalities was at 26 , including one in the United States .
" There is too much hysteria in the country and so far , there has n't been that great a danger , " said Congressman Ron Paul , a Republican from Texas .
" It 's overblown , grossly so . "
Paul , who was a freshman congressman during a swine flu outbreak in 1976 , said Congress voted to inoculate the whole country at the time .
Twenty - five people died from the inoculation while one person was killed by the flu , Paul said , adding that he voted against inoculation .
Watch Ron Paul talk about 1976 swine flu »
The United States ' only death this year from the virus was a 22 - month - old boy in Texas who was visiting from Mexico .
The other 25 deaths happened in Mexico .
" I wish people would back off a little bit , " Paul said .
Others shared Paul 's sentiment , saying the fear of the flu has gotten out of hand .
" We have people without symptoms going into the emergency rooms asking to be screened for swine flu at the expense of people with real illness , " said Cathy Gichema , a nurse in Pikesville , Maryland .
" Schools are being shut for probable causes -- sending these kids congregating to the malls .
How is that helping ? " Gichema said .
Dr. Mark Bell , principal of Emergent Medical Associates , which operates 18 emergency departments in Southern California , said the level of fear is unprecedented .
" I have n't seen such a panic among communities perhaps ever , " Bell said .
" Right now , people think if they have a cough or a cold , they 're going to die .
That 's a scary , frightening place to be in .
I wish that this hysteria had not occurred and that we had tempered a little bit of our opinions and thoughts and fears in the media . "
Governments and health officials , however , say the concern is not unfounded .
The virus , a hybrid of swine , avian and human flu , can jump from person to person with relative ease .
And while most of the cases were reported in Mexico and the United States , some have been confirmed in countries outside North America .
On Saturday , the virus strain was found in a herd of swine in Alberta , Canada , and the animals may have caught the flu from a farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico .
It could be the first identified case of pigs infected in the recent outbreak .
" We have determined that the virus H1N1 , found in these pigs , is the virus which is being tracked in the human population , " said Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency .
But Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals , and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork .
The number of pigs infected was not disclosed .
In his weekly radio address Saturday , President Obama said the concerns over the new virus are justified because lack of immunity makes it potentially risky .
" Unlike the various strains of animal flu that were in the past , it 's a flu that is spreading from human to human .
This creates the potential for a pandemic , which is why we are acting quickly and aggressively , " Obama said .
The president , who said the virus is a " cause for concern but not alarm , " added the government has anti-viral treatment to treat the current strain of H1N1 .
In addition , WHO started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations .
iReport.com : How should H1N1 be handled ?
" I think the world is infinitely better prepared than it was 90 years ago , " said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl , referring to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed as many as 20 million people .
In Mexico , the epicenter of the outbreak , masks have become a common fixture .
Nearly half the cases in Mexico involve patients 19 and younger , the health ministry said .
" I can hold for maybe another week or two and that 's it , " said Guillermo Jimenez , a waiter who has n't worked in a week since the government ordered about 35,000 public venues to shut down .
" We do n't have any money .
We have mouths to feed .
I do n't know what I 'm going to do now . "
Still , some say the hype over H1N1 has led to undue hysteria .
" I 'm sure the deaths in Mexico have something do with the infrastructure , " said Anthony Markovich , a graduate student in Marina del Ray , California .
" I know our health care system has its flaws , but it is more advanced . "
The world should focus on diseases that have more fatalities , according to Markovich .
" This is a joke compared to other things going on , " he said .
" Malaria is killing thousands of people daily , the economy is not getting any better , it is time to move on . "
Pakistan resident Faisal Kapadia agreed .
" When you put it in context , 700 cases in the world is nothing , " said Kapadia , a commodities trader in Karachi .
" I understand it is a horrible new disease and governments should find a cure for it , but the media has created too much paranoia . "
CNN 's Emanuella Grinberg and Madison Park contributed to this report .

Budget - strapped Chicago public schools to implement staggered class schedules
By Clement Daly and Naomi Spencer
7 April 2009
A consequence of dozens of public school closings in the past few years , suburban Chicago ’s Lockport Township High School has introduced a two - shift school day .
In an effort to alleviate chronic overcrowding , school officials have moved to implement a staggered schedule for the nearly 4,000 students on the township ’s two campuses .
Nearly 800 junior and senior students now begin the school day at 6:50 a.m .
The currently voluntary schedule will become mandatory next year , when all juniors and seniors will be required to start school at 6:44 a.m .
Under the plan , juniors and seniors can start at 6:50 a.m. and be eligible to finish the day as early as 11:45 a.m. for seniors and 1:44 p.m. for juniors .
Freshmen and sophomores will not be able to complete classes until 3:44 p.m .
Notwithstanding the personal strain borne by the students , teachers , coaches , administrators , as well as their families , the new scheduling has disrupted life at the high school in general .
Extracurricular activities and sports have been limited as a result , while school assemblies have been scrapped outright .
The challenges facing Lockport are by no means unique to the township ; neither is their early - bird and staggered schedule scheme .
In nearby Frankfort , the 4,100 - student Lincoln - Way East High School introduced a 7 a.m. start time prior to the completion of the school district ’s third school earlier this year .
Similarly , in neighboring Plainfield , the school day began at 7:20 a.m. at Plainfield Central High School until the opening of a fourth school in the district this year .
The transformation of the school day points to a deepening crisis in the public education system .
Urban — and , increasingly , suburban — school districts throughout the US have been subjected to cuts in funding and pressure to replace crumbling public schools with small , privately administered schools .
As a result , remaining public school districts like Lockport Township have seen a swelling of their student populations even as their budgets and staffing levels are attacked .
Recent estimates from the Chicago Public Schools ( CPS ) put the school district ’s budget deficit at $ 475 million for 2010 .
Having drawn down its reserves by $ 100 million to cover this year ’s shortfall , no further funds from the reserve will be available without affecting the district ’s bond rating .
Outside of a rise in Chicago property taxes , the burden of the shortfall will be passed on to the district ’s teachers , officials , retirees , and students .
Newly appointed CPS chief Ron Huberman made this clear when he recently pointed to the $ 145 million for contractual pay increases for teachers , the $ 130 million for higher pension contributions , the $ 30 million to cover rising healthcare costs , and the $ 35 million for miscellaneous expenses such as utilities , transportation , and fuel as reasons for the deficit .
School district officials have also announced that they will be looking at costs associated with workers ’ compensation , substitute teachers , and Central Office operations to help balance the budget for the next fiscal year that begins on July 1 .
“ Let me be clear .
We do not believe that we can balance next year ’s budget through efficiencies and management improvements alone .
We need to find new revenues , ” Huberman said in a public statement last month .
On April 6 , the Chicago Tribune reported that Illinois Governor Pat Quinn was advocating “ sweeping changes ” to cut the education shortfall , including “ reducing pension benefits for incoming teachers and requiring existing ones to pay 2 percent more of their paychecks toward retirement . ”
Illinois teachers already contribute 9.4 percent of their salaries toward the Teachers Retirement System fund .
Quinn estimated the change would allow the state to reduce its payments to the pension fund by $ 443 million next year .
Governor Quinn has also proposed cutting more than 30 grant programs , including after - school tutoring programs and those aimed at reducing class sizes , in order to cut state education costs by $ 200 million .
This new round of attacks on the living standards of teachers , students , and school officials will be bound up with the continuation of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley ’s Renaissance 2010 initiative .
The plan has resulted in the closure and consolidation of dozens of schools since 2004 , with 16 more to be affected this coming fall .
What at first appears to be a glaring contradiction between suburban school districts that are overcrowded and under - resourced , and the continued drive by the CPS to close and consolidate dozens of city schools for low enrollment and under - performance , is in fact the logical outcome of the same process : the increasing subjugation of social institutions such as education to the profit motive .
The irrational and anarchic means by which the market allocates social resources thus produces such contradictions .
However , the crisis confronting Chicago - area schools is only a piece of the rapidly worsening national economic crisis that is impacting the education system at large .
A survey of 850 administrators across 48 states , issued March 24 by the American Association of School Administrators ( AASA ) , suggests that the vast majority of schools are facing swelling class sizes , staff layoffs and program cuts .
Some 75 percent of respondents characterized their school districts as “ inadequately funded ” ; 21 percent said they had undertaken “ short - term borrowing to meet payroll and accounts payable . ”
Administrators reported that in the 2009 - 2010 school year , 44 percent of schools were increasing class size , 28 percent were cutting extracurricular activities , 22 percent were cutting academic programs , and one - third were putting off needed maintenance .
The percentage of schools laying off staff quadrupled from an already high 11 percent in the 2008 - 2009 school year , to 44 percent in 2009 - 2010 .
Administrators also identified nearly 17,600 jobs that have been “ slated for elimination in the 2009 - 10 school year . ”
The AASA report notes , “ This represents a small portion of the 574,000 jobs that researchers have predicted for elimination in FY09 , FY10 , and FY11 . ”
The Obama administration has seized upon this crisis as a pretext for an all - out assault on public education .
The Obama stimulus package will provide about $ 100 billion for public schools , universities , and early childhood education over the next two years .
The figure falls far short of what is needed .
Indeed , statements by Education Secretary Arne Duncan make clear that the political establishment sees the desperate state of affairs as an opportunity to enact a vast restructuring of the nation ’s public education .
Last week Duncan — the former head of the Chicago school system — widely touted the government ’s $ 44 billion in “ stimulus ” funds earmarked for the education system , plus a plan to put aside $ 5 billion as an incentive for financially desperate school districts .
Duncan has made clear that the funds are contingent on the pursuit of various right - wing reforms , including drastically extending the school day and / or year for disadvantaged children , so - called merit pay programs for teachers , and enforcement of testing standards introduced under the Bush administration .
Duncan has also aggressively pushed for increased public funding for privately administered charter schools .
The nature of such reforms indicates who is to be held accountable for the nation ’s deteriorating public educational institutions : the teachers , administrators , and students .
Duncan warned that the Obama administration will “ come down like a ton of bricks ” on districts that do not comply with these policy aims .

As you know , I received some excellent advice on how to handle the nativity situation from many of your readers .
Based on this advice , I decided to contact several organizations , such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation , ACLU of Indiana , Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and the Anti-Discrimination Support Network .
Each one of these organizations responded to my request for assistance , and as a result of the pressure they put on the library , I ’m happy to inform you that the library has written a display policy which states : “ Exhibits or displays cannot promote any one commercial , political , or doctrinal viewpoint .
Displays of a religious nature will not be accepted . ”
Furthermore , after receiving assistance from these organizations , the library board decided to suspend the library employee who revealed my library record for one month .
This is the same employee who posted an exaggerated post of my complaint about the nativity scene to elwoodindiana.org , and even though I think she deserved to be terminated from her job at the library , I am pleased to know that she was disciplined for the pain and suffering she caused me and my family .
Unfortunately , I do not think this library employee would have received any type of punishment had it not been for the pressure put on the library and its board by the organizations mentioned above .
Additionally , I do not think the library would have drafted a display policy prohibiting displays of a religious nature if it had not been for the assistance of these organizations .
Early this year I decided to surround myself with other atheists by joining the CFI Indiana – Hamilton County Atheists and Freethinkers Meetup .
Since I have not known very many atheists in my life , it has been great to converse with other nonbelievers for a change .
They are a great group of people ; however , the majority of people I come in contact with daily think atheists are immoral people who cannot be trusted because they do not believe in god .
As a matter of fact , the Indiana atheist bus campaign , “ You Can Be Good Without God ” , was rejected in Bloomington , Indiana because it was deemed too controversial .
It is amazing that there are people who truly believe that a person cannot be good without god .
After discussing this issue with the Hamilton County Atheists , we decided to form an American Cancer Society Relay for Life team .
Even though we are accustomed to doing charitable things individually , we thought it would be good to come together as nonbelievers to raise money for the American Cancer Society .
Hopefully , people will see that we can be good without god .

I do n't get to do many " feel - good stories " here , but this is one .
I just received an update from Tyson , the atheist patron of Elwood Public Library in Indiana who complained about a nativity scene in the library last December .
You may recall that the library 's director initially decided to ignore the complaint and behaved in an unprofessional manner .
Nobody was prepared for what happened next .
A library employee , presumably the director , contacted the local paper and revealed Tyson 's identity , at which point he started receiving threats from Christians in his community .
He complained to the library 's board of directors .
A library employee then published his library record on a public blog !
The Associated Press then picked up a version of the story from which Tyson 's version of events was curiously omitted .
And that is where we left off ... until I received this update from Tyson .
Here is what Tyson had to say :
The full policy can be viewed as a .pdf file at http://www.elwood.lib.in.us/PDF-Policies/Library%20Display%20Policy%2009.pdf
As great as that is , Tyson informs us that it gets even better : Very nice !
It is so tempting to simply ignore these situations , even when a flagrant violation of the law is right in front of us .
Tyson had the courage to stand up for separation of church and state .
Not only did he complain , but he persisted in making sure that those who trashed him for doing so were held accountable .
You better believe I will be renewing my memberships in these organizations for the foreseeable future !
In addition to his success with the library , Tyson shared the following with us : I have a huge smile on my face right now !
It is so nice to get good news of this kind and see how much can be accomplished through courage and perseverance .
Tyson , you are an inspiration !
Thank you so much for sharing this with us .

It looks like there is a tear coming from his eye , though !
Two Israeli officers have testified that troops in the West Bank beat , bound and blindfolded Palestinian civilians as young as 14 .
The damaging disclosures by two sergeants of the Kfir Brigade include descriptions of abuses they say they witnessed during a search - and - detain operation involving hundreds of troops in Hares village on 26 March .
The testimonies have been seen by The Independent and are expected to add fuel to the controversy over recent remarks by Colonel Itai Virob , commander of Kfir Brigade , in which he said violence against detained Palestinians was justified in order to accomplish missions .
Both the soldiers , from the Harub battalion , highlighted the tight tying of the plastic hand restraints placed on detainees .
" There are people who think you need to tighten the restraints all the way , until no drop of blood will pass from here to there , " one soldier said .
" It does n't take much time until the hands turn blue .
There were a lot of people that you know were n't feeling anything . "
He said about 150 Palestinians , some as young as 14 , were bound , blindfolded and detained at the village school during the operation , which lasted from 3 am to 3 pm .
He was told it was aimed at preventing village youths throwing stones against nearby settler roads .
It was clear many of the people detained had done nothing wrong , but they were held to gather intelligence , he said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The worst beatings were in the bathrooms , he said .
" The soldiers who took [ detainees ] to the toilet just exploded [ over ] them with beatings ; cursed them with no reason .
When they took one Arab to the toilet so that he could urinate , one of them gave him a slap that brought him to the ground .
He had been handcuffed from behind with a nylon restraint and blindfolded .
He was n't insolent , he did n't do anything to get on anyone 's nerves ... [ it was ] just because he's an Arab .
He was something like 15 years old . "
The soldier said he saw a lot of soldiers " just knee [ Palestinians ] because it 's boring , because you stand there 10 hours , you 're not doing anything , so they beat people up . "
A second soldier described a " fanatical atmosphere " during the search operations .
" We would go into a house and turn the whole thing upside down , " he recalled , but no weapons were found .
" They confiscated kitchen knives . "
The first soldier said involvement was widespread .
" There were a lot of reservists that participated , and they totally had a celebration on the Palestinians : curses , humiliation , pulling hair and ears , kicks , slaps .
These things were the norm . "
He said the incidents in the toilet were the " extreme " and added that the beatings did not draw blood .
They were " dry beatings , but it 's still a beating " .
The second soldier said some troops stole from houses they searched , even though the people were so poor it was hard for them to find anything to take .
Last month , Colonel Virob testified in a military court that hitting detained Palestinians could be justified .
" Standing them against walls , pushing them , a blow that does n't cause injury .
Certainly , these are things that are commonly used in an attempt to accomplish the mission , " he said .
Despite a reprimand of Colonel Virob by the head of central command , General Shamni , and a disavowal by army chief of staff Lt General Gabi Ashkenazi , the remarks are seen by Breaking the Silence , an organisation that collects testimonies of soldiers , as proof that the alleged abuses in Hares cannot be dismissed as an isolated occurrence or low - level improvisations .
In Hares , Ihab Shamlawi , a university student , recalled watching as a high school pupil asked soldiers permission to go to the bathroom .
" They put him on the floor , they kicked his legs and beat him , " he said .
Ten or 15 other soldiers were watching , Mr Shamlawi recalled .
" They all laughed , " he said .
The army spokesman 's office yesterday said an investigation had been opened and added that , following Colonel Virob 's previous remarks , General Shamni had distributed pamphlets to troops underscoring that " when someone is detained , stopped or held ... Israel Defence Force soldiers ... are absolutely and clearly forbidden to use any force or violence against them " .

Going out on a limb
In my previous article , The Code Sample , I ruffled the feathers of a few readers who objected to my implication that “ I ’d just Google it ” is not an acceptable answer during the technical part of an interview .
To be fair , the derisive sentiment in that post was directed specifically at interviewees who abusively name drop about Google to dodge answering any technical questions .
… candidate that thinks “ I ’d just Google it . ” is an acceptable answer to any technical interview question …
Still , I am going to tempt fate and take it one step further by and say that it is almost never a good idea to use this “ phone - a - friend ” lifeline in a real interview .
Let me explain by addressing the obvious objections to the premise .
Objection : I ’ll be able to Google things on the job .
It ’s unrealistic to test me in a hypothetical Google - free universe .
It ’s true that everyone expects that you will need to look things up to do your job , and that it completely unreasonable to expect a programmer to have an encyclopedic knowledge of every aspect of even their best tool .
Here ’s the rub .
You are at an interview , not working at the job .
On the job , the goal is to solve problems and get things done using any tool at your disposal .
At the interview , the goal is to demonstrate why they should hire you instead of one of the other candidates who also have access to Google .
A job interview is a competition , not a pass - fail test .
The REAL hypothetical universe is the one where a job is filled by an interviewer talking to single candidate then making a decision based on whether that person can do the job or not .
Objection : What about Interviewers who ask hyper - specific technical questions ?
Look , we all hate these types of questions .
I ’d even argue that many interviewers use them more to prove how smart they are rather than to evaluate the candidate ( even though they probably Googled both the question AND answer ) .
As an early weed - out tactic , I really hate these types of questions .
Sometimes , however , an interviewer faced with 20 candidates of which 15 could competently perform the duties of the job just needs a final jeopardy tie - breaker round when the race is too close to call .
I know this may spark a debate about how unfair these questions are , but try to be pragmatic .
The only agenda you should bring to the interview is closing the deal , not changing the way the interviewer thinks or conducts their business .
If you are really determined to make a difference , discuss the interviewing tactics with them AFTER you have secured the job and have been working there a while .
They are more likely to be open to your input when you are n’t in a position to directly benefit from them accepting it .
Sometimes “ I ’d Google it ” is an immediate fail .
There are times when this response is going to pretty much end the interview as demonstrated in this example lifted from TheDailyWTF .
Com .
Q : What is a class ?
A : I do not know , but I would look it up .
Q : Okaaay , moving on to another question .
What is a SQL join ?
A : I do not know , but I would look it up .
Almost every question we asked yielded the same response .
This is a funny example , but I have heard very similar responses from real candidates who actually proposed in response to situational questions that they ’d Google things like “ How to optimize code ” and “ how to normalize a database . ”
I could probably be convinced to soften my position on technical trivia , but never - ever - ever invoke Google on a situational or general approach type question .
In fact , it is arguably better to wing it than admit ignorance on a question like this .
You are probably dead meat if you ca n’t answer the situational questions anyway , so you might as well go down fighting .
If you ignore my advice , at least understand this
I ’ll concede that invoking Google in an interview is rarely a deal - killer on technical questions when I do interviews , especially if several candidates can’t answer the same question and lead me to suspect the question might be too trivial to be fair game .
It is also very uncommon for me to make a decision on a candidate based on a single technical question .
That said , do n’t delude yourself into thinking that you actually answered the question when you appeal to Google .
Whether you like it or not , the the interviewer is thinking one of two things :
“ I ’d Just Google it . ” == “ I do n’t Know . ”
Or worse …
“ I ’d Just Google it . ” == “ I do n’t Know , and I ’m not willing to admit it . ”
The second inference is much more damaging to your chances .
It is probably safer just to say “ I do n’t know , ” because you are in effect saying it anyway .
That is , unless you imagine the interviewer does n’t think you are aware of Google .
If that is the case you ’ve got bigger problems .

Tonon ’s article : " The Costs of Speaking Truth to Power : How Professionalism Facilitates Credible Communication " Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 2008 18(2):275-295 .
Bill Black is an Associate Professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri – Kansas City ( UMKC ) .
He was the Executive Director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention from 2005 - 2007 .
He has taught previously at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and at Santa Clara University , where he was also the distinguished scholar in residence for insurance law and a visiting scholar at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics .
Before getting to Black 's response regarding specific regulation , I want to address something Geekesque said that really bothered me .
He referred to Professor Black as a " has been regulator " .
As you can see from his bio , this is factually incorrect .
Black was called to testify before the Senate last year on the deregulation that led to the current crisis .
But even if it were true , it is a disgraceful criticism .
The only reason why someone as authoritative as Bill Black may have been put out to pasture over the last ten years is because he is such an authority .
It is a statement of the corruption of our government and the power of Wall Street that Bill Black does n't have a law enforcement position .
To criticize someone for being cast out by crooks and thieves is a low point for the Daily Kos recommended list .
Now on to the law :
I pointed the Professor to Geekesque 's diary and posed several questions to him .
I told him that there were two main challenges to his allegations : 1 , the law is not a mandate and 2 .
even if it were , it would n't apply because most of these banks are holding companies outside the jurisdiction of the law .
Professor Black responded to me and then he wrote a detailed response on the NPR website today .
Here are some excerpts .
Regarding which institutions apply :
Any bank , S&L , or credit union receiving FDIC insurance is covered .
Any investment banking firm taht has converted to a bank charter is covered .
Bank holding companies are n't federally insured , but that 's irrelevant as to their banks , which are subject to PCA -- and their insolvent banks is what we 're discussing .
The distinction they 're attempting to draw is disingenuous .
I do n't know what they mean by " bailout banks " , but if their point is that Treasury is attempting to evade the PCA 's mandate for least cost resolution by subsidizing bank holding companies rather than banks they they 've just proved my point .
Regarding the mandate of the law :
When insured institutions do not meet their capital requirements ( as must be true of many large banks if Geithner is remotely correct about the $ 2 trillion cost of resolving the crisis ) , regulatory action is mandatory to promptly correct that situation .
Each appropriate Federal banking agency and the Corporation ( acting in the Corporation 's capacity as the insurer of depository institutions under this chapter ) shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions .
( 1831o ( a ) ( 2 ) )
The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions at the least possible long - term loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund . ( 1831o ( a ) ( 1 ) ) .
PCA ( Section 1831o ) was adopted in 1991 as part of FDICIA .
It was based on the belief that regulatory discretion led to regulatory forbearance which increased moral hazard and increased losses during the S&L debacle .
PCA was based on three central premises : ( 1 ) increase the capital requirement , ( 2 ) mandate that the regulators take " prompt corrective action " well before the insolvency so that S&Ls and banks could be resolved without cost to the insurance fund ( or taxpayers ) , and ( 3 )
I asked Professor Black about this section :
( i ) appoint a receiver ( or , with the concurrence of the Corporation , a conservator ) for the institution ; or
( ii ) take such other action as the agency determines , with the concurrence of the Corporation , would better achieve the purpose of this section , after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose .
" ( ii ) seems to negate the whole " shall " part does it not ? "
And finally :
Note that neither the agency nor the FDIC can certify any of these standards , because the insolvent banks ( i ) do n't have positive net worth , ( ii ) has complied with an approved capital restoration plan , ( iii ) is profitable or has an upward , sustainable trend in earnings , or ( iv ) has reduced the ratio of nonperforming loans .
( II ) the head of the appropriate Federal banking agency and the Chairperson of the Board of Directors both certify that the institution is viable and not expected to fail .
( I ) the agency determines , with the concurrence of the Corporation , that ( aa ) the insured depository institution has positive net worth , ( bb ) the insured depository institution has been in substantial compliance with an approved capital restoration plan which requires consistent improvement in the institution 's capital since the date of the approval of the plan , ( cc ) the insured depository institution is profitable or has an upward trend in earnings the agency projects as sustainable , and ( dd ) the insured depository institution is reducing the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ; and
( ii ) Exception Notwithstanding clause ( i ) , the appropriate Federal banking agency may continue to take such other action as the agency determines to be appropriate in lieu of such appointment if -
the appropriate Federal banking agency shall appoint a receiver for the insured depository institution if the institution is critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized .
C ) even if the agency head had legally made such a specific initial determination , this clause kicks in at 270 days ( and many large banks have been insolvent since the collapse of the nonprime secondary market in March 2007 ( well past the 270 day clause ) :
B ) the agency head has to make specific initial determinations that it is factually least cost not to appoint a receiver .
There is no evidence that they have or could ( part A immediately above ) make that initial determination .
A ) whatever they do has to be least cost to the FDIC , and none of the actions taken are remotely least cost .
All of them involve paying risk capital , which receivership avoids .
So , in a nutshell , he was n't talking about holding companies on the Moyers show .
He was talking about institutions that are insured under FDIC .
And the law is mandatory in that it required the government to choose " prompt corrective action " that is the least cost .
And while there is a little loophole of flexibility there , the Obama admin is not using that loophole so it does n't even apply .
And even if they wanted to , the deadline has run out .
That is gist of my correspondence with Professor Black .
He also went on to write a detailed explanation which he posted today at the Bill Moyers Journal website .
I will post it in its entirety below .
But before I do I want to make one point .
Even if there 's a hole in Professor Blacks legal argument , which I suspect the White House council 's office would argue here was , one thing should be very clear :
Bill Black was not " lying . "
The tendency to smear every critic of the Obama administration 's policies , as opposed to just disagreeing , reminds me of the Bush White House under Karl Rove .
It is obvious from the initial interview , from these citations above , and from the post cited below , that Bill Black is absolutely telling the truth .
He is making a rational legal judgment .
Now here is his post from today .
It 's technical stuff .
Read it anyway .
William K. Black on The Prompt Corrective Action Law
The Prompt Corrective Action Law : Section 1831o
William K. Black
Associate Professor of Economics and Law
University of Missouri – Kansas City
Please note that the views and opinions expressed are not necessarily the views and opinions held by Bill Moyers or BILL MOYERS JOURNAL
My comments in the Bill Moyers Journal interview about the " Prompt Corrective Action " ( PCA ) law ( adopted in 1991 ) have sparked considerable comment in the blogsphere .
Here is the portion of the interview transcript that discusses the PCA law .
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , certainly in the financial sphere , I am .
I think , first , the policies are substantively bad .
Second , I think they completely lack integrity .
Third , they violate the rule of law .
This is being done just like Secretary Paulson did it .
In violation of the law .
We adopted a law after the Savings and Loan crisis , called the Prompt Corrective Action Law .
And it requires them to close these institutions .
And they 're refusing to obey the law .
BILL MOYERS : In other words , they could have closed these banks without nationalizing them ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , you do a receivership .
No one -- Ronald Reagan did receiverships .
Nobody called it nationalization .
BILL MOYERS : And that 's a law ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : That 's the law .
BILL MOYERS : So , Paulson could have done this ?
Geithner could do this ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Not could .
Was mandated -
BILL MOYERS : By the law .
WILLIAM K . BLACK : By the law .
I first published an article about the PCA law over a month ago entitled : " Why is Geithner Continuing Paulson ’s Policy of Violating the Law ? " ( February 23 , 2009 ) .
I was the staff leader for Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Ed Gray ’s successful reregulation of the S&L industry .
That reregulation provided the tools that allowed the agency to place in receivership many of the worst control frauds .
Gray inherited ( and for a time supported ) a dominant strategy of covering up the scale of the S&L industry ’s insolvency .
He personally recruited vigorous senior regulators such as Michael Patriarca and Joe Selby to reverse that strategy .
The PCA law was adopted largely in response to the enormous cost to the taxpayers of our predecessor ’s failed strategy of not closing insolvent S&Ls .
The new law had an impressive start , thanks in great part to the transformed reregulatory spirit .
How many readers recall the 1991 - 92 subprime crisis ?
It did n’t happen because we took prompt regulatory action against subprime S&L lenders that were following practices ( e.g. , qualifying borrowers at the teaser rate , offering " neg am " mortgages , etc ) that we knew would lead to widespread failures .
The broadcast of Bill Moyers Journal interview has raised enormously the public ’s awareness of the PCA .
A commentator has responded by arguing that the PCA law does not mandate that the regulators place insolvent banks into receivership .
I am delighted that the debate has turned to focus in part on the issue of why virtually all economists and white - collar criminologists believe that it is essential to take prompt regulatory action to resolve failed banks , particularly ones that are insolvent due to " control fraud " , i.e. , where the person that controls a seemingly legitimate entity uses it as a " weapon " to defraud .
In the financial world accounting fraud is the " weapon of choice . "
Banks owned by holding companies are fully subject to the law
The commentator ’s primary concern can be answered briefly because it criticizes a claim I never made .
S( he ) notes that banking holding companies and insurance companies are not subject to PCA .
I did not say that they were .
As the interview excerpt shows , we were talking about " [ savings ] institutions " and " banks " that can be put into " receivership " ( I ’m going to use " bank " here to refer to any FDIC - insured depository institution . )
The FDIC ( and if it lacks the funds , the U.S. Treasury ) is only legally obligated to pay depositors of FDIC - insured banks up to the deposit insurance limits .
The federal banking regulators have receivership powers only over federally insured depository institutions .
The FDIC and the U.S. Treasury have no obligation to pay the debts of bank holding companies or insurance companies – and should n’t be paying those debts .
The commentator uses this strawman argument ( refuting a claim no one made ) to imply that the fact that PCA does n’t apply to bank holding companies means that the federal financial regulators did not have to comply with the PCA law .
S( he ) lists a series of companies , primarily large bank holding companies ( BHCs ) and declares that their existence means : " So , pretty much all of the really big players do n't fall under the PCA in the first place . "
Bank holding companies , of course , are called that because they own banks – and the U.S. banks they own are subject to PCA .
The fact that a bank is owned by a holding company is irrelevant to the PCA ’s requirements ; it provides no immunity from the PCA .
BHCs are " really big players " because they own massive banks subject to the PCA .
The banks are the " really big players " and they are subject to the PCA law .
When we put insolvent banks into receivership their BHCs and affiliates lose all control of the bank .
The FDIC has sole control of it .
PCA does not apply to the corporate owners of banks or their non-bank affiliates .
However , the bank subsidiaries are the dominant assets of almost all holding companies that own banks .
As such , the failure of the banking within the group is likely to trigger the failure of the holding company .
To sum up the first point : banks are the issue .
U.S. banks have FDIC insurance and are subject to the PCA law , regardless of whether they are owned by a BHC .
Deposit insurance covers only insured banks , not BHCs , so the FDIC , the Treasury and the taxpayers do not owe any obligation to pay their creditors .
If the commentator is worried that BHCs will escape receivership , s( he ) need not fear .
BHCs and insurance companies such as AIG are subject to the bankruptcy laws , which can be used to block and even " claw back " excessive and fraudulent executive compensation .
( Treasury is also requesting Congress to grant it authority to place BHCs and some insurers into receivership . )
The PCA law mandates receivership in these circumstances
The commentator ’s secondary argument is that the PCA law does not mandate that deeply insolvent banks be placed in receivership .
S( he ) points to several discretionary exceptions in the law , but none of the exceptions apply to insolvent banks that cannot be promptly corrected ( recapitalized ) .
They must be placed in receivership to comport with the stated purpose and language of the law .
Moreover , neither the Bush nor the Obama administration has purported to act in accordance with the inapplicable exceptions .
I will respond to the argument primarily by citing other scholars on the PCA that were writing at an earlier time and in an apolitical context .
The scholarly literature on the PCA is fairly extensive and quite consistent .
I ’ve drawn on Nieto & Wall ( 2007 ) ( see n. 2 ) for the quotations in the following discussion ( other than statutory language ) , but other sources do not differ materially on the origins , singular purpose , and provisions of the PCA law .
The PCA law , as I noted in the interview , arose as a corrective to problems exposed during the S&L debacle .
The consensus was that the central problem was that regulators , sometimes bowing to political or industry pressure ( " regulatory capture " ) , were delaying placing failed banks into receivership and greatly raising the cost to taxpayers .
The US has a long history with the basics required to implement PCA : binding capital adequacy standards and the ability to take substantial actions against banks that failed to meet the standards .
The supervisors had the authority to adopt many of the provisions of PCA using their pre-existing powers if they had so chosen .
However , the experience of the 1980s had clearly indicated that US supervisors valued discretionary responses targeted at keeping some banks ( especially thrifts and large banks ) in operation after they had became financially distressed .
( p. 12 )
Economists and white - collar criminologists broadly agree that prompt receiverships of failed banks reduce taxpayer costs and systemic risk .
[ A] llowing insolvent banks to continue in operation runs the risk that they will accumulate even larger losses leading to even greater market disruption when the bank ’s continued operation is no longer tenable .
In contrast , if a bank is required to be closed before its losses exceed the bank ’s equity and subordinated debt then depositors and other creditors should not be exposed to any loss .
Moreover , prompt resolution reduces the probability that more than one systemically important bank will be insolvent at the same time .
In sum , a supervisory focus on limiting deposit insurance costs is unlikely to result in significantly higher expected losses due to systemic financial problems and may well result in lower expected costs .
( p. 18 )
Leaving the senior officers that caused bank failure in control creates particularly severe risks to the taxpayers .
Prompt corrective supervisory action seeks to minimize expected losses to the deposit insurer and taxpayer by limiting supervisors ’ ability to engage in forbearance .
Along with reducing taxpayer losses , PCA should also reduce banks ’ incentive to engage in moral hazard behavior by reducing or eliminating the subsidy to risk - taking provided by mispriced deposit insurance .
These potential benefits from PCA appear to have been recognized , as reflected in the increasing number of recommendations to policy makers to introduce PCA type of provisions in their national legislation .
Japan , Korea and , more recently Mexico have adopted this prudential policy . ( p. 31 ) .
" Moral hazard " can lead to both " reactive " control fraud and wildly imprudent risks .
Either can cause a dramatic increase in taxpayer losses .
As I explained in the interview , leaving the managers in place that caused the failure also prevents us from obtaining honest evaluation of assets and the criminal referrals that are essential to resolve this crisis .
The PCA law states its sole , express purpose :
(1) Purpose
The purpose of this section is to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions at the least possible long - term loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund . ( 1831o ( a ) ( 1 ) ) .
The administration ’s duty , under the rule of law , is to administer the law to achieve that purpose .
Prompt receiverships " resolve the problems " of insolvent and failing banks " at the least possible long - term loss . "
Because the problem prompting passage of the PCA law was supervisory delay in closing insolvent banks , the law mandated " prompt corrective action . "
This , of course , need not mean receivership for troubled banks that can promptly recapitalize themselves by raising equity .
The mandate to the regulators is that either the bank or the regulator must promptly correct the capital inadequacy .
In 1991 the Congress moved to limit taxpayer exposure to losses at failed banks with the passage of FDICIA .
The PCA provisions of FDICIA create a structured system of supervisory responses to declines in bank capital , culminating in the bank being forced into receivership within 90 days after its tangible equity capital dropped below two percent of total assets .
( pp. 11-12 )
Note that two percent tangible capital ( the point below which a bank is " critically undercapitalized " ) is a much higher number than it may appear , for many banks have large amounts of " goodwill " ( an intangible ) on their books as an asset .
The authors emphasize the regulators " forc[ing ] " the bank into receivership if it does not promptly restore its capital .
They expressly tie these provisions to the PCA law ’s intent to combat regulatory forbearance through " mandatory " supervisory intervention .
The key innovation of PCA is that it recommends a reduction of supervisory discretion to exercise forbearance by proposing a series of capital adequacy tranches with a set of mandatory supervisory actions for each of the undercapitalized tranches .
Mandatory supervisory actions are intended to override the incentives supervisors would otherwise have to engage in forbearance .
( p. 19 )
The authors also explain that the PCA law was intended to protect the regulators " independence " from the common political pressures to keep failing banks open by " requir[ing ] them to intervene .
The US supervisors did not need political or judicial approval prior to PCA to intervene at a troubled bank or to force an insolvent bank into resolution .
The major change in supervisory practice resulting from PCA is that after PCA the supervisors were required to intervene as a bank ’s supervisory capital ratios deteriorated .
The independence of supervisory action provided to supervisors before PCA is critical to the effective operation of PCA .
A system that requires the prior approval of political authorities creates the potential for delay and forbearance in supervisory intervention to the extent that the political authorities do not follow the supervisors ´ recommendations .
Moreover , if this condition is not met , the requirement of prior political approval reduces the effectiveness of PCA in discouraging banks from taking excessive risk .
( p. 22 )
If the bank cannot promptly raise capital on its own to return to health it must be placed in receivership .
Nieto &
Wall explain that such receiverships are the normal U.S. means of dealing with failed banks , lead to the removal of the bank officers that caused the failure , are not remotely akin to " nationalization " , and substantially reduce the cost to the taxpayers .
2.3 Should banks be closed with positive regulatory capital ?
Both SEIR [ the academic proposal of Drs. Kaufman and Benston that led to the adoption of the PCA law ] and PCA call for timely resolution , which is a policy where banks with sufficiently low , but still positive , equity capital are forced into resolution .
In the US context , resolution is understood to include : ( 1 ) the government assuming control of the failed bank , firing the senior managers and removing equity holders from any governance role , and ( 2 ) the government returning the bank ’s assets to private control through some combination of sale to a healthy bank or banks , new equity issue , or liquidation .
Timely resolution provides two important benefits .
First , forcing a bank into resolution while it still has positive regulatory capital truncates if not eliminates the value of the deposit insurance put option , reducing the incentive of the bank ’s shareholders to support excess risk taking .
Second , timely resolution is critical to limiting deposit insurance losses .
If insolvent banks are allowed to continue in operation then the potential losses from failure can be very large .
( pp. 20 - 21 )
These mandatory provisions of the PCA law are " critical " to its effectiveness .
Note the scholars ’ emphasis on the provisions that " require minimum and automatic supervisory action " and subject banks to " mandatory closure " before they become insolvent .
Three aspects of the philosophy underlying SEIR / PCA are critical to its effective operation .
First , the primary goal of prudential supervisors should be to minimize deposit insurance losses , a goal which is also likely to result in a reduction in the expected social costs of systemic financial problems .
The PCA policy applied in the US goes beyond those three principles of Basle II in that it limits even further supervisory discretion as to when to forbear from intervening by specifying capital / asset ratios that require minimum and automatic supervisory action .
The third critical part of PCA follows from the first two parts , banks should be subject to mandatory closure at positive levels of regulatory capital ratio .
This provides an incentive to banks ’ managers to recapitalize the bank or look for a healthy merger partner and , ultimately , contribute to reduce the cost of deposit insurance .
( p. 31 )
The authors also explain provisions of the PCA law that make its requirements anathema to the bankers that caused the failures ( i.e. , firing managers and restricting management " bonuses and raises " ) and the regulators whose laxity permitted widespread frauds .
No bank may make a capital distribution ( dividend or stock repurchase ) if after the payment the bank would fall in any of the three undercapitalized categories unless the bank has prior supervisory approval .
All undercapitalized banks must submit a capital restoration plan and that plan must be approved by the bank ’s supervisor .
All undercapitalized banks also face growth restrictions .
Significantly undercapitalized banks must restrict bonuses and raises to management .
Critically undercapitalized banks must be placed in receivership within 90 days unless some other action would better minimize the long - run losses to the deposit insurance fund .
Supervisors are also given a variety of discretionary actions they may take .
For example , the supervisors may dismiss any director or senior officer at a significantly undercapitalized bank and may further require that their successor be approved by the supervisory agency .
( p. 13 )
PCA requires that the inspector general of the appropriate supervisory agency prepare a report whenever a bank failure results in material losses .
The report addresses why the loss occurred and what should be done to prevent such losses in the future .
A copy of the report is to be provided to the Comptroller General and to any member of Congress requesting the report .
21 FDICIA also provides for public release of the reports upon request .... ( p. 14 )
Recent IG reports of this nature have led to the removal of two of the most senior Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) leaders .
Regulators that place fraudulent banks that they have failed to supervise properly into receivership risk their reputations and careers .
One can well understand why senior regulators are so hostile to complying with the PCA law .
( As Treasury Secretary , and as a leading colleague of then Secretary Paulson , I have concentrated on Mr. Geithner ’s role , but each of the top federal banking regulators is complicit in failing to comply with the PCA law . )
Before the legal minutia , let ’s not lose sight of the policy issue
To review the bidding to date : there is a consensus among economists and white - collar criminologists ( and senior regulators that have successfully resolved prior crises such as William Seidman , Edwin Gray , and Paul Volcker ) that failing banks should be placed promptly into receivership if they cannot recapitalize .
So the fundamental question , even if the PCA law was never passed , is what can the nation do to end the disastrous Paulson / Geithner policy of covering up the largest banks ’ losses and leaving the CEOs and senior officers that caused their failures , often through fraud , in power ?
How many of those of us that voted for Mr. Obama believed that they were voting for a continuation of Bush ’s failed financial regulatory policies ?
Given the terrible cost to taxpayers during the early years of the S&L debacle of " forbearance " for failed S&Ls , the horrific failure of Japan ’s embrace of the cover up of its bank losses , and the great success of the vigorous reregulation of the S&L industry why would we adopt the failed strategy instead of the proven success ?
The way we reregulated the S&L industry was not simply an economic success , it was vital to restoring at least some integrity .
We insisted on honest accounting , used prompt receiverships , and rooted out the control frauds .
This led to over 1000 felony convictions related to the debacle – the greatest criminal justice success in history against elite white - collar criminals .
On to the legal specifics
The commentator argues that the PCA law does not mandate receiverships , citing exceptions to the mandatory language .
None of the exceptions apply in the circumstances we are discussing and neither the Bush nor the Obama administration purports to be following such exceptions .
Instead , what is occurring is a coverup designed to evade the PCA that relies on abusive accounting to hide the banks ’ losses that arose due to mortgage and accounting fraud .
There is a certain awful symmetry to thinking that the cure for accounting fraud is greater accounting fraud countenanced , even arguably mandated , by the government .
Governmental abuse of accounting makes it far harder to prosecute bank officials that enriched themselves through accounting fraud .
To begin , we need to review the context of the discussion during the interview .
Here ’s the relevant portion of interview that led to the discussion about the PCA law :
BILL MOYERS : Why are they firing the president of G.M. and not firing the head of all these banks that are involved ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : There are two reasons .
One , they 're much closer to the bankers .
These are people from the banking industry .
And they have a lot more sympathy .
In fact , they 're outright hostile to autoworkers , as you can see .
They want to bash all of their contracts .
But when they get to banking , they say , ‘ contracts , sacred . '
But the other element of your question is we do n't want to change the bankers , because if we do , if we put honest people in , who did n't cause the problem , their first job would be to find the scope of the problem .
And that would destroy the cover up .
BILL MOYERS : The cover up ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK : Sure .
The cover up .
BILL MOYERS : That 's a serious charge .
WILLIAM K. BLACK : Of course .
BILL MOYERS : Who 's covering up ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Geithner is charging , is covering up .
Just like Paulson did before him .
Geithner is publicly saying that it 's going to take $ 2 trillion — a trillion is a thousand billion — $ 2 trillion taxpayer dollars to deal with this problem .
But they 're allowing all the banks to report that they 're not only solvent , but fully capitalized .
Both statements can't be true .
It ca n't be that they need $ 2 trillion , because they have masses losses , and that they 're fine .
These are all people who have failed .
Paulson failed , Geithner failed .
They were all promoted because they failed , not because ...
BILL MOYERS : What do you mean ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , Geithner has , was one of our nation 's top regulators , during the entire subprime scandal , that I just described .
He took absolutely no effective action .
He gave no warning .
He did nothing in response to the FBI warning that there was an epidemic of fraud .
All this pig in the poke stuff happened under him .
So , in his phrase about legacy assets .
Well he 's a failed legacy regulator .
BILL MOYERS : But he denies that he was a regulator .
Let me show you some of his testimony before Congress .
Take a look at this .
TIMOTHY GEITHNER : I 've never been a regulator , for better or worse .
And I think you 're right to say that we have to be very skeptical that regulation can solve all of these problems .
We have parts of our system that are overwhelmed by regulation .
Overwhelmed by regulation !
It was n't the absence of regulation that was the problem , it was despite the presence of regulation you 've got huge risks that build up .
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , he may be right that he never regulated , but his job was to regulate .
That was his mission statement .
BILL MOYERS : As ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which is responsible for regulating most of the largest bank holding companies in America .
And he 's completely wrong that we had too much regulation in some of these areas .
I mean , he gives no details , obviously .
But that 's just plain wrong .
BILL MOYERS : How is this happening ?
I mean why is it happening ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Until you get the facts , it 's harder to blow all this up .
And , of course , the entire strategy is to keep people from getting the facts .
BILL MOYERS : What facts ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : The facts about how bad the condition of the banks is .
So , as long as I keep the old CEO who caused the problems , is he going to go vigorously around finding the problems ?
Finding the frauds ?
The context then is Geithner saying that it would cost the taxpayers $ 2 trillion to bail out the insolvent banks , yet virtually all the banks are reporting they are solvent and " well capitalized . "
I noted that both statements could not be true .
Geithner has every incentive to understate , not overstate , the cost of bailing out the banks and his $ 2 trillion estimate is materially lower than most analysts , so there is every reason to believe that the banks are not recognizing at least $ 2 trillion in losses .
We know that the big banks hold a greatly disproportionate share of the worst assets .
That means that many , probably most , of the big banks are massively insolvent ( because $ 2 trillion far exceeds what they claim to hold as capital ) .
We know that many large bank stocks ( before the announcement of the huge TARP II subsidy for banks ) were trading at prices that indicated market expectations that they had suffered massive capital losses and were essentially high risk options capitalizing the value of moral hazard .
( Remember , the worst thing we can do is to maximize moral hazard .
We are maximizing moral hazard by leaving open insolvent banks under the control of managers that caused the failure , often through fraud . )
If Geithner is right about the scale of the banks ’ insolvency many of the large banks have to be hopelessly insolvent , but engaging in accounting fraud to hide that insolvency .
That was the context for our PCA discussion .
These large banks have not been able to recapitalize .
They have been deeply insolvent since , at the latest , March 2007 when the secondary market in nonprime assets collapsed .
( If we are fortunate it will never be restored because it was inherently dangerous .
If it is it will cause future crises . )
The PCA law is characterized by mandates that the regulators ensure that a bank , well before , insolvency , is recapitalized – promptly .
Failing that action , the PCA law requires the regulators to act to correct the problem by selling the bank or putting it in receivership .
In the context we are discussing – the deep insolvency of many large banks that means that the law mandates receivership .
Here are the specifics :
Immediately after the " purpose " clause quoted above comes the mandate ( " shall " ) to act in accordance with that purpose to achieve prompt corrective action :
(2) Prompt corrective action required
Each appropriate Federal banking agency and the Corporation ( acting in the Corporation ’s capacity as the insurer of depository institutions under this chapter ) shall carry out the purpose of this section by taking prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions .
Well before insolvency , as soon as a bank becomes " undercapitalized " , it must ( " shall " ) file a plan to promptly restore its capital adequacy and that plan must meet strict standards .
( IV ) Capital restoration plan required
( IV ) In general
Any undercapitalized insured depository institution shall submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency within the time allowed by the agency under subparagraph ( D ) .
( B) Contents of plan
The capital restoration plan shall —
( IV ) specify —
( IV ) the steps the insured depository institution will take to become adequately capitalized ;
( II ) the levels of capital to be attained during each year in which the plan will be in effect ;
( III ) how the institution will comply with the restrictions or requirements then in effect under this section ; and
( IV ) the types and levels of activities in which the institution will engage ; and
Subsection ( C ) ( 1 ) of the law mandates ( " shall not accept ... unless " ) tough standards on the agency in terms of capital restoration plans it is permitted to approve .
(C) Criteria for accepting plan
The appropriate Federal banking agency shall not accept a capital restoration plan unless the agency determines that —
( i ) the plan —
( I ) complies with subparagraph ( B ) ;
( II ) is based on realistic assumptions , and is likely to succeed in restoring the institution ’s capital ; and
( III ) would not appreciably increase the risk ( including credit risk , interest - rate risk , and other types of risk ) to which the institution is exposed ; and
( ii ) if the insured depository institution is undercapitalized , each company having control of the institution has —
( I ) guaranteed that the institution will comply with the plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on average during each of 4 consecutive calendar quarters ; and
( II ) provided appropriate assurances of performance
No deeply insolvent large U.S. bank could provide , " based on realistic assumptions " a plan to return itself to adequate capitalization .
That means that the bank is prohibited to pay any bonus or give any raise to any senior executive official .
(4) Senior executive officers ’ compensation restricted
(A) In general
The insured depository institution shall not do any of the following without the prior written approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency :
( i) Pay any bonus to any senior executive officer .
( ii ) Provide compensation to any senior executive officer at a rate exceeding that officer ’s average rate of compensation ( excluding bonuses , stock options , and profit - sharing ) during the 12 calendar months preceding the calendar month in which the institution became undercapitalized .
( B) Failing to submit plan
The appropriate Federal banking agency shall not grant any approval under subparagraph ( A ) with respect to an institution that has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan .
Deeply insolvent banks , however , fall into a more severe category under the PCA law .
They are " severely undercapitalized , " and the law mandates that the bank or the regulators promptly restore them to adequate capital or place them in conservatorship or receivership ( and prohibit a wide range of business activities ) .
(h) Provisions applicable to critically undercapitalized institutions
(1) Activities restricted
Any critically undercapitalized insured depository institution shall comply with restrictions prescribed by the Corporation under subsection ( i ) of this section .
(2) Payments on subordinated debt prohibited
(A) In general
A critically undercapitalized insured depository institution shall not , beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized , make any payment of principal or interest on the institution ’s subordinated debt .
( B) Exceptions
The Corporation may make exceptions to subparagraph ( A ) if —
( i ) the appropriate Federal banking agency has taken action with respect to the insured depository institution under paragraph ( 3 ) ( A ) ( ii ) ; and
( ii ) the Corporation determines that the exception would further the purpose of this section .
(3) Conservatorship , receivership , or other action required
(A) In general
The appropriate Federal banking agency shall , not later than 90 days after an insured depository institution becomes critically undercapitalized —
( i ) appoint a receiver ( or , with the concurrence of the Corporation , a conservator ) for the institution ; or
( ii ) take such other action as the agency determines , with the concurrence of the Corporation , would better achieve the purpose of this section , after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose .
( B) Periodic redeterminations required
Any determination by an appropriate Federal banking agency under subparagraph ( A ) ( ii ) to take any action with respect to an insured depository institution in lieu of appointing a conservator or receiver shall cease to be effective not later than the end of the 90 - day period beginning on the date that the determination is made and a conservator or receiver shall be appointed for that institution under subparagraph ( A ) ( i ) unless the agency makes a new determination under subparagraph ( A ) ( ii ) at the end of the effective period of the prior determination .
(C) Appointment of receiver required if other action fails to restore capital
( i) In general Notwithstanding subparagraphs ( A ) and ( B ) , the appropriate Federal banking agency shall appoint a receiver for the insured depository institution if the institution is critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized .
( ii ) Exception Notwithstanding clause ( i ) , the appropriate Federal banking agency may continue to take such other action as the agency determines to be appropriate in lieu of such appointment if —
( I ) the agency determines , with the concurrence of the Corporation , that ( aa ) the insured depository institution has positive net worth , ( bb ) the insured depository institution has been in substantial compliance with an approved capital restoration plan which requires consistent improvement in the institution ’s capital since the date of the approval of the plan , ( cc ) the insured depository institution is profitable or has an upward trend in earnings the agency projects as sustainable , and ( dd ) the insured depository institution is reducing the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ; and
( II ) the head of the appropriate Federal banking agency and the Chairperson of the Board of Directors both certify that the institution is viable and not expected to fail .
( i) Restricting activities of critically undercapitalized institutions
To carry out the purpose of this section , the Corporation shall , by regulation or order —
( 1 ) restrict the activities of any critically undercapitalized insured depository institution ; and
( 2 ) at a minimum , prohibit any such institution from doing any of the following without the Corporation ’s prior written approval :
(A) Entering into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business , including any investment , expansion , acquisition , sale of assets , or other similar action with respect to which the depository institution is required to provide notice to the appropriate Federal banking agency .
( B) Extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction .
(C) Amending the institution ’s charter or bylaws , except to the extent necessary to carry out any other requirement of any law , regulation , or order .
(D) Making any material change in accounting methods .
(E) Engaging in any covered transaction ( as defined in section 371c ( b ) of this title ) .
( F) Paying excessive compensation or bonuses .
(G) Paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would increase the institution ’s weighted average cost of funds to a level significantly exceeding the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the institution ’s normal market areas .
Parsing through this legalese yields the following :
• The regulators must place an insolvent bank into receivership or conservatorship
• Normally , this should be done no later than 90 days after becoming " critically undercapitalized " , i.e. , well before the bank became insolvent .
• The 90 day limit can only be pushed back if the FDIC and the primary regulator agree in writing that doing so would best serve the purposes of the Act – which is to minimize the cost of resolving the insolvent bank – and " document " that the delay would reduce that cost .
To our knowledge , the FDIC and the OCC ( the primary regulator of most of the largest banks ) have not made such joint determinations for any of the large , deeply insolvent banks .
Given the fact that delaying receiverships of deeply insolvent banks typically increases the cost of resolving the failure , it is unlikely that the regulators could provide honest documentation to support a failure to act .
• Even if we were to assume , counterfactually , that they provided such documentation , they would have to place the big insolvent banks in receivership or conservatorship .
After being insolvent for 270 days ( and many of the big banks will have been insolvent for roughly two years ) , the regulators can no longer extend the clock .
They cannot extend the clock for an insolvent bank beyond 270 days .
A " critically undercapitalized " bank ’s clock extension can only be extended if it meets each of four criteria :
( I ) the agency determines , with the concurrence of the Corporation , that ( aa ) the insured depository institution has positive net worth , ( bb ) the insured depository institution has been in substantial compliance with an approved capital restoration plan which requires consistent improvement in the institution ’s capital since the date of the approval of the plan , ( cc ) the insured depository institution is profitable or has an upward trend in earnings the agency projects as sustainable , and ( dd ) the insured depository institution is reducing the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ; and
A deeply insolvent bank ( recall , that is what we were discussing ) has negative net worth .
It will also typically fail the other minimum requirements .
The bank must meet all four of the requirements .
To sum it all up , the interview explained why Geithner ’s statements about a $ 2 trillion bailout cost means that many large banks have to be deeply insolvent .
The PCA law mandates that deeply insolvent banks be placed in receivership or conservatorship .
The exceptions to PCA ’s mandatory closure directives do not apply to insolvent banks .
Indeed , it does not appear that the regulators have complied with the provision that delays the requirement to appoint a receiver .
The regulators could not , in good faith , invoke that delay provision for a deeply insolvent bank .
The PCA ’s Achilles ’ heel has always been accounting fraud
Nieto &
Wall note the vulnerability of the PCA law to accounting fraud by banks and regulators .
3.4 Accurate and timely financial information
Arguably , the biggest weakness of PCA is its reliance on regulatory capital measures of a bank ’s capital , measures which may significantly deviate from the bank ’s economic capital .
Banks that are threatened by PCA mandated supervisory actions have a strong incentive to report inflated estimates of the value of their portfolios .
The extent to which banks are allowed to overestimate their capital under PCA depends in part on the accounting rules and in part on the enforcement of the rules .
Thus , if bank prudential supervisors want to preserve their discretion despite the requirements for mandatory actions in PCA , supervisors need only accept a troubled bank ’s inflated estimates of its regulatory capital adequacy ratio .
In the US , PCA is vulnerable to problems both in the accounting principles and their enforcement .
( p. 27 )
To the extent that outside auditors are unable or unwilling to force banks to recognize losses in their asset portfolios , PCA depends on the effectiveness of bank examinations by the supervisory agencies .
Yet relying on the supervisors to enforce honest accounting creates a contradiction in PCA .
PCA is designed to limit supervisory discretion in enforcing capital adequacy , yet PCA will only be fully effective if the bank supervisors use their discretion in conducting on - site examinations to force timely recognition of declines in portfolio value .
The vulnerability in enforcement is highlighted by Eisenbeis and Wall ’s ( 2002 ) finding that deposit insurance losses at failed banks in the US did not decrease as a proportion of the failed bank ’s assets after the adoption of PCA as should have happened if the supervisors were following timely resolution .
( p. 28 )
These are the points I was making in the interview .
We need honest accounting and honest asset values .
We will not get them if we allow the failed bankers and regulators to remain in charge .
They have strong incentives to inflate asset values in order to escape the consequences of PCA .
The people of America , however , have a compelling interest in demanding that the government comply with that law and resolve cases at the least cost to the taxpayers .
Secretary Geithner is not simply writing the PCA law effectively out of existence ; he is creating an unprecedented ( and unauthorized ) rival system in place that will maximize fraudulent bank CEOs ’ perverse incentives .
The transcript of his press conference rolling out the TARP II bill contains two separate references to his creation of " capital insurance " for favored banks .
PRESS BRIEFING
BY
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TIMOTHY GEITHNER
U.S. Department of Treasury
Washington , D.C .
8:56 A.M. EDT
But the critical part of that program is to make it clear that they will be able to raise capital from the government if they can't raise in the markets so that they can get through a deeper recession .
That will help reduce the odds of a deeper recession , help make sure , again , they can provide a level of lending that will be necessary to support recovery .
****
And a program of insurance -- you could call it capital insurance for the banking system so that banks have the cushion of capital necessary to lend and expand even if the economy goes through a broader -- a deeper recession .
This program is dangerous because it optimizes moral hazard , but it also violates the express purpose of the PCA law to resolve bank problems at the lowest cost to the FDIC and the taxpayers .
Providing taxpayer " capital insurance " subsidies to insolvent or troubled banks increases the taxpayers ’ costs .
TARP II is designed to provide a federal subsidy to insolvent and failing banks .
