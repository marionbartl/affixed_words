Mounds at a site in the northern plains of Mars bear a striking resemblance to mud volcanoes on Earth ( Image : University of Arizona / JPL / NASA )
IS LIFE bubbling onto the Martian surface in muddy squirts ?
The discovery of what could be mud volcanoes on the planet suggest it is possible , providing a new focus in the hunt for alien microbes .
Three plumes have recently been identified as sources of methane in Mars ’s atmosphere ( New Scientist , 24 January , p 19 ) .
This has led to suggestions that the gas could have been produced by microbes living a few kilometres beneath the surface , where …
Somebody asked me yesterday how to find out how big the runtime representation of a type is .
I hacked this up using the internal unpackClosure# primitive :
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash , UnboxedTuples #-} module Size where import GHC .
Exts import Foreign unsafeSizeof :: a ->
Int unsafeSizeof a = case unpackClosure # a of ( # x , ptrs , nptrs # ) -> sizeOf ( undefined : : Int ) + -- one word for the header I# ( sizeofByteArray # ( unsafeCoerce # ptrs ) +# sizeofByteArray # nptrs )
Try it in GHCi :
Prelude > :! ghc -c Size.hs Prelude > :l Size
Ok , modules loaded : Size . Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof 3.3 16 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof " a " 24 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof ( 1,2,3,4 ) 40 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof True 8 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof $! Data.Complex .(:+) 2 3 24 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof $! 3 16 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof $ ! ( 3:: Integer ) 16 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof $ ! ( 3:: Int ) 16 Prelude Size > unsafeSizeof $ ! ( 2^64 :: Integer ) 24
I ’m on a 64 - bit machine , obviously .
It does n’t always do the right thing , but for ordinary algebraic types it should work most of the time .
Remember to use $ ! , as the size returned for an unevaluated thunk is always just one word ( unpackClosure # does n’t work for thunks ) .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors is offering buyouts to virtually all of its remaining hourly workers , becoming the latest automaker to try to cut labor costs by giving nervous workers an incentive to leave the company .
The move follows a similar move by Chrysler LLC , which made an offer to its hourly workers on Monday .
The GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) offer , which takes effect Friday , is less lucrative than the deal proposed by Chrysler , or even offers that GM has made to its hourly staff in the past .
The automaker will give most of its 62,000 U.S. hourly workers $ 20,000 , as well as a voucher good towards the purchase of a GM car worth $ 25,000 .
In the past , GM offered between $ 45,000 to $ 62,500 to workers to retire early , and $ 140,000 to employees who left the company and agreed to give up post - retirement health care coverage .
Those offers were all cash .
Chrysler 's offer is for to $ 50,000 to virtually all of its 27,000 U.S. hourly workers , along with a voucher good for up to $ 25,000 on the purchase of a vehicle .
" Given our financial situation , we feel this is a responsible , " said Sherrie Childers Arb , a GM spokeswoman .
She said the company has not set a target for how many workers it wants or expects to take the offer .
The UAW agreed last week to eliminate a so - called " jobs bank " at GM as well as at Chrysler and Ford .
The jobs bank had provided near full pay to UAW members whose positions were eliminated .
Childers
Arb said the company believes a significant number of workers will take the offer , even if they had turned down previous , more generous offers , especially with the elimination of the jobs bank and the restructuring going on at GM .
" We hope as many who are eligible to take the program , take it , " she said .
Neither Chrysler nor the UAW are commenting on the buyout offer there .
According to a letter from UAW vice president General Holiefield , the head of the union 's negotiating team with Chrysler , he negotiated the new offer with Chrysler because of the rising concern among some members about the company 's future prospects .
His letter said that many workers may have accepted the earlier package if they had known about the end of the jobs bank and other difficulties facing the company .
The letter was posted on one of the UAW local 's Web site .
Some retirement - eligible workers at Chrysler plants that are set to close could get up to $ 115,000 in cash in addition to the $ 25,000 voucher .
The packages are similar to ones Chrysler offered to its hourly workers late last year , although the voucher replaces part of the cash that was offered in 2008 .
GM offered buyouts to all 74,000 of its U.S. hourly workers in 2008 and had about 19,000 leave the company .
Ford had about 7,000 of about 54,000 workers take various buyout offers .
Chrysler did not have buyout figures immediately available .
If more workers take the latest offers from GM or Chrysler than the companies want to cut , the 2007 labor deal allows them to hire new workers at a significantly lower pay scale , and with far less lucrative benefits than those who were on staff when the 2007 deal was struck .
David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research , said the fact that the latest offer includes a voucher for a car , rather than all cash , is a sign of the need to preserve cash , as well as the realization that workers might be willing to leave with less money in their pocket this time around .
" As people become more scared , a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush , " he said .
Cole said if enough workers chose to leave Chrysler , it could increase the chance that Chrysler would chose to combine with another automaker rather than hire new workers .
The GM offer comes ahead of sales reports from major automakers due later Tuesday what are expected to show exceptionally weak January sales .
It could end up being the worst month for the industry since 1982 .
Sales tracker Edmunds.com is forecasting that GM sales fell 38 % , while it expects Chrysler sales will plunge 48 % from a year ago , the largest drop expected among the major automakers .
GM and Chrysler were both in danger of running out of the cash they needed to operate at the end of last year until they received a $ 13.4 billion in emergency loan from the Treasury Department .
Under terms of the loan , both companies must show progress towards bringing its labor costs in line with those at the nonunion U.S. plants of Asian automakers such as Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Honda Motor ( HMC ) , or risk having the federal loan recalled .
BEIJING -- China called for the creation of a new currency to eventually replace the dollar as the world 's standard , proposing a sweeping overhaul of global finance that reflects developing nations ' growing unhappiness with the U.S. role in the world economy .
The unusual proposal , made by central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan in an essay released Monday in Beijing , is part of China 's increasingly assertive approach to shaping the global response to the financial crisis .

Music News -
The USA experimental pop group , Animal Collective has confirmed additional European and North American shows for this spring .
The new itinerary picks up with a twenty two city European tour that runs from March 4 at Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo , Norway , thru March 28 at Stiff Kitten in Belfast , Northern Ireland .
The avant - garde group takes off time before revving up a 24 - date run across North America , beginning May 11 at 9:30 Club in Washington , DC , and wrap June 10 at Club Firestone in Orlando , FL .
Animal Collective is out promoting their eighth studio album , " Merriweather Post Pavillion , " which was recently released on cd from Domino Records .
The release is their follow - up to 2007 's critically acclaimed album " Strawberry Jam " .
The new record 's title comes from the Maryland concert venue of the same name , which is located in Symphony Woods in Columbia , MD .
The facility , Merriweather Post Pavillion was designed by architect Frank Gehry and opened back in 1967 .
The outdoor space impacted Animal Collective 's members and has influenced the type of music they make .
" We used to go to shows there while growing up and have fond memories of times spent on the lawn , " the Baltimore , MD based band explained in a note accompanying the LP version of the album .
" For most of the time we 've been playing together , both in Animal Collective and the years before , we 've tried to make music that would be deserving of an amazing outdoor listening experience .
As both a name and a place , Merriweather Post Pavilion represents this for us . "
Animal Collective is Panda Bear ( Noah Lennox ) , Avey Tare ( David Portner ) , Geologist ( Brian Weitz ) and Deakin ( Josh Dibb ) , though albums released under the Collective name can feature contributions from any or all of the members .
Since the release of " Strawberry Jam " and the subsequent tour Deakin has been on hiatus from the group and is not expected to participate in the 2009 shows .
AC is an enjoyable band that should be experienced .

Google of late has been contracting its contract work force , but today the company announced real layoffs , in its HR group , no less – the folks responsible for hiring .
100 people will be laid off or redeployed , and as SAI notes , it ’s a very clear sign that the company is feeling what all of us are feeling – a very significant recession .
When Google catches a cold , it ’s a sure bet a lot of other companies have pneumonia , or worse .
I ’ve been making my way back to classical texts lately , and The Art of War has been on my list to read for a while now .
My mom was kind enough to give me The Art of War : Complete Texts and Commentaries for Christmas last year , and I was happy to get some time to dig in .
The book itself is rather dauntingly thick , but that is because of the immense amount of text contained within .
As opposed to most translations , Cleary ’s tome contains not just the traditional Art of War by Sun Tzu but also related texts and a full treatment of Sun Bin ’s complementary Art of War .
Through this , you get a complete understanding of both Sun Tzu ’s and Sun Bin ’s take on conflict .
The treatment of the texts varies depending on the part of the book .
The first part , featuring Sun Tzu’s Art of War , features Cleary ’s translation intermixed with several interpretations and commentaries .
The commentaries are provided by several scholars and provide added insights to the original text .
Initially , I found this mixture annoying , as each paragraph of the original was followed by several paragraphs of commentary , often repeating or paraphrasing what had been said previously .
After a while , though , this style grew on me and I was able to glean additional understanding through these commentaries .
The second part of the book ties in other Asian works , such as the Tao Te Ching , to the Art of War .
This section explains how the Taoist concepts permeate throughout several classical texts and how one complements the others .
This background and surrounding information makes the Art of War that much more relevant and meaningful .
Also useful are the historic references explaining what was going on in Asia around the time of each writing .
The third part covers Sun Bin ’s Art of War , also called the Lost Art of War .
Sun Bin ’s writing follows in the tradition of Sun Tzu’s , expanding upon the same principles .
Some of this part of the book gets redundant as Sun Bin paraphrases and quotes Sun Tzu frequently , but still worth reading .
As advertised , the Art of War is about far more than war .
It is about any sort of struggle or confrontation .
Taken literally , I can see how the advice would have helped in ancient warfare ; taken metaphorically , you can easily apply the techniques to business , politics , or any other place that contention or conflict exists .
A large part of the writings deal with leadership and the best qualities of a leader : “ Leadership is a matter of intelligence , trustworthiness , humaness , courage , and sternness . ”
Sun
Tzu highlights the importance of discipline in leadership , with established rewards and punishments that are consistently applied across the board .
Good advice for a general as well as a corporate executive , head coach , or politician .
One of my favorite parts of the Art of War is when Sun Tzu speaks of knowing yourself and knowing your enemy :
So it is said that if you know others and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ; if you do not know others but know yourself , you win one and lose one ; if you do not know others and do not know yourself , you will be imperiled in every single battle .
I ’ve found this piece of advice to be vital in a number of different situations .
Many people make the mistake of going into competition without understanding their opponents , and worse , sometimes without even knowing themselves .
Whenever you ’re in a conflict , you must know your own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of your opponent .
Sun
Tzu ’s advice rings true in a great many situations
Screen User ’s Manual
Short Table of Contents

1 Overview
Screen is a full - screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes , typically interactive shells .
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and , in addition , several control functions from the ISO 6429 ( ECMA 48 , ANSI X3.64 ) and ISO 2022 standards ( e.g. insert / delete line and support for multiple character sets ) .
There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy - and - paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between windows .
When screen is called , it creates a single window with a shell in it ( or the specified command ) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would .
Then , at any time , you can create new ( full - screen ) windows with other programs in them ( including more shells ) , kill the current window , view a list of the active windows , turn output logging on and off , copy text between windows , view the scrollback history , switch between windows , etc .
All windows run their programs completely independent of each other .
Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the user ’s terminal .
When a program terminates , screen ( per default ) kills the window that contained it .
If this window was in the foreground , the display switches to the previously displayed window ; if none are left , screen exits .
Shells usually distinguish between running as login - shell or sub -shell .
Screen runs them as sub- shells , unless told otherwise ( See shell .screenrc command ) .
Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current window .
The only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initiate a command to the window manager .
By default , each command begins with a control - a ( abbreviated C- a from now on ) , and is followed by one other keystroke .
The command character ( see Command Character ) and all the key bindings ( see Key Binding ) can be fully customized to be anything you like , though they are always two characters in length .
Screen does not understand the prefix C- to mean control , although this notation is used in this manual for readability .
Please use the caret notation ( ^ A instead of C - a ) as arguments to e.g. the escape command or the -e option .
Screen will also print out control characters in caret notation .
The standard way to create a new window is to type C -a c .
This creates a new window running a shell and switches to that window immediately , regardless of the state of the process running in the current window .
Similarly , you can create a new window with a custom command in it by first binding the command to a keystroke ( in your .screenrc file or at the C - a : command line ) and then using it just like the C - a c command .
In addition , new windows can be created by running a command like :
screen emacs prog.c
from a shell prompt within a previously created window .
This will not run another copy of screen , but will instead supply the command name and its arguments to the window manager ( specified in the $ STY environment variable ) who will use it to create the new window .
The above example would start the emacs editor ( editing prog.c ) and switch to its window .
- Note that you cannot transport environment variables from the invoking shell to the application ( emacs in this case ) , because it is forked from the parent screen process , not from the invoking shell .
If /etc / utmp is writable by screen , an appropriate record will be written to this file for each window , and removed when the window is closed .
This is useful for working with talk , script , shutdown , rsend , sccs and other similar programs that use the utmp file to determine who you are .
As long as screen is active on your terminal , the terminal ’s own record is removed from the utmp file .
See Login .
2 Getting Started
Before you begin to use screen you ’ll need to make sure you have correctly selected your terminal type , just as you would for any other termcap / terminfo program .
( You can do this by using tset , qterm , or just set term=mytermtype , for example . )
If you ’re impatient and want to get started without doing a lot more reading , you should remember this one command : C - a ? ( see Key Binding ) .
Typing these two characters will display a list of the available screen commands and their bindings .
Each keystroke is discussed in the section on keystrokes ( see Default Key Bindings ) .
Another section ( see Customization ) deals with the contents of your . screenrc .
If your terminal is a “ true ” auto - margin terminal ( it does n’t allow the last position on the screen to be updated without scrolling the screen ) consider using a version of your terminal ’s termcap that has automatic margins turned off .
This will ensure an accurate and optimal update of the screen in all circumstances .
Most terminals nowadays have “ magic ” margins ( automatic margins plus usable last column ) .
This is the VT100 style type and perfectly suited for screen .
If all you ’ve got is a “ true ” auto - margin terminal screen will be content to use it , but updating a character put into the last position on the screen may not be possible until the screen scrolls or the character is moved into a safe position in some other way .
This delay can be shortened by using a terminal with insert - character capability .
See Special Capabilities , for more information about telling screen what kind of terminal you have .
3 Invoking Screen
Screen has the following command - line options :
‘ -a ’
Include all capabilities ( with some minor exceptions ) in each window ’s termcap , even if screen must redraw parts of the display in order to implement a function .
‘ - A ’ Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the display .
By default , screen may try to restore its old window sizes when attaching to resizable terminals ( those with ‘ WS ’ in their descriptions , e.g. suncmd or some varieties of xterm ) . ‘ -c file ’
Use file as the user ’s configuration file instead of the default of $ HOME /. screenrc . ‘ -d [ pid.sessionname ] ’ ‘ - D [ pid.sessionname ] ’
Do not start screen , but instead detach a screen session running elsewhere ( see Detach ) .
‘ -d ’ has the same effect as typing C - a d from the controlling terminal for the session .
‘ - D ’ is the equivalent to the power detach key .
If no session can be detached , this option is ignored .
In combination with the -r / - R option more powerful effects can be achieved : -d -r Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first .
-d - R Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first .
-d - RR Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it .
Use the first session if more than one session is available .
- D -r Reattach a session .
If necessary detach and logout remotely first .
- D -R
Attach here and now .
In detail this means :
If a session is running , then reattach .
If necessary detach and logout remotely first .
If it was not running create it and notify the user .
This is the author ’s favorite .
- D -RR Attach here and now .
Whatever that means , just do it .
Note :
It is a good idea to check the status of your sessions with screen - list before using this option .
‘ -e xy ’
Set the command character to x , and the character generating a literal command character ( when typed after the command character ) to y .
The defaults are C - a and a , which can be specified as ‘ - e ^Aa ’.
When creating a screen session , this option sets the default command character .
In a multiuser session all users added will start off with this command character .
But when attaching to an already running session , this option only changes the command character of the attaching user .
This option is equivalent to the commands defescape or escape respectively .
( see Command Character ) . ‘ -f ’ ‘ - fn ’ ‘ - fa ’
Set flow - control to on , off , or automatic switching mode , respectively .
This option is equivalent to the defflow command ( see Flow Control ) .
‘ -h num ’
Set the history scrollback buffer to be num lines high .
Equivalent to the defscrollback command ( see Copy ) .
‘ - i ’ Cause the interrupt key ( usually C-c ) to interrupt the display immediately when flow control is on .
This option is equivalent to the interrupt argument to the defflow command ( see Flow Control ) .
Its use is discouraged .
‘ -l ’ ‘ - ln ’ Turn login mode on or off ( for /etc / utmp updating ) .
This option is equivalent to the deflogin command ( see Login ) .
‘ - ls [ match ] ’ ‘ - list [ match ] ’
Do not start screen , but instead print a list of session identification strings ( usually of the form pid.tty. host ; see Session Name ) .
Sessions marked ‘ detached ’ can be resumed with screen -r .
Those marked ‘ attached ’ are running and have a controlling terminal .
If the session runs in multiuser mode , it is marked ‘ multi ’.
Sessions marked as ‘ unreachable ’ either live on a different host or are dead .
An unreachable session is considered dead , when its name matches either the name of the local host , or the specified parameter , if any .
See the -r flag for a description how to construct matches .
Sessions marked as ‘ dead ’ should be thoroughly checked and removed .
Ask your system administrator if you are not sure .
Remove sessions with the ‘ - wipe ’ option .
‘ - L ’ Tell screen to turn on automatic output logging for the windows .
‘ - Logfile " file " ’
By default logfile name is " screenlog.0 " .
You can set new logfile name with the - Logfile option .
‘ -m ’
Tell screen to ignore the $ STY environment variable .
When this option is used , a new session will always be created , regardless of whether screen is being called from within another screen session or not .
This flag has a special meaning in connection with the ‘ -d ’ option : -d -m Start screen in detached mode .
This creates a new session but does n’t attach to it .
This is useful for system startup scripts .
-D -m
This also starts screen in detached mode , but does n’t fork a new process .
The command exits if the session terminates .
‘ - O ’ Select a more optimal output mode for your terminal rather than true VT100 emulation ( only affects auto - margin terminals without ‘ LP ’) .
This can also be set in your . screenrc by specifying ‘ OP ’ in the termcap command .
‘ - p name_or_number |- |=|+ ’ Preselect a window .
This is useful when you want to reattach to a specific window or you want to send a command via the ‘ - X ’ option to a specific window .
As with screen ’s select command , ‘ - ’ selects the blank window .
As a special case for reattach , ‘ = ’ brings up the windowlist on the blank window , while a ‘ + ’ will create new window .
The command will not be executed if the specified window could not be found .
‘ -q ’ Suppress printing of error messages .
In combination with ‘ - ls ’ the exit value is set as follows : 9 indicates a directory without sessions .
10 indicates a directory with running but not attachable sessions .
11 ( or more ) indicates 1 ( or more ) usable sessions .
In combination with ‘ -r ’ the exit value is as follows : 10 indicates that there is no session to resume .
12 ( or more ) indicates that there are 2 ( or more ) sessions to resume and you should specify which one to choose .
In all other cases ‘ - q ’ has no effect .
‘ - Q ’ Some commands now can be queried from a remote session using this flag , e.g. ’ screen - Q windows ’ .
The commands will send the response to the stdout of the querying process .
If there was an error in the command , then the querying process will exit with a non -zero status .
The commands that can be queried now are : echo info lastmsg number select time title windows ‘ -r [ pid.sessionname ] ’ ‘ -r sessionowner /[ pid.sessionname ] ’ Resume a detached screen session .
No other options ( except combinations with ‘ -d ’ or ‘ - D ’) may be specified , though the session name ( see Session Name ) may be needed to distinguish between multiple detached screen sessions .
The second form is used to connect to another user ’s screen session which runs in multiuser mode .
This indicates that screen should look for sessions in another user ’s directory .
This requires setuid - root .
‘ - R ’ resumes screen only when it ’s unambiguous which one to attach , usually when only one screen is detached .
Otherwise lists available sessions .
‘ - RR ’ Resume the first appropriate detached screen session .
If successful , all other command - line options are ignored .
If no detached session exists , start a new session using the specified options , just as if ‘ - R ’ had not been specified .
This option is set by default if screen is run as a login - shell ( actually screen uses ‘ - xRR ’ in that case ) .
For combinations with the ‘ - D ’/‘ -d ’ option see there .
‘ -s program ’
Set the default shell to be program .
By default , screen uses the value of the environment variable $ SHELL , or / bin / sh if it is not defined .
This option is equivalent to the shell command ( see Shell ) .
See also there .
‘ - S sessionname ’
Set the name of the new session to sessionname .
This option can be used to specify a meaningful name for the session in place of the default tty .host suffix .
This name identifies the session for the screen - list and screen -r commands .
This option is equivalent to the sessionname command ( see Session Name ) .
‘ -t name ’
Set the title ( name ) for the default shell or specified program .
This option is equivalent to the shelltitle command ( see Shell ) .
‘ - T term ’
Set the $ TERM enviroment variable using the specified term as opposed to the default setting of screen .
‘ - U ’ Run screen in UTF - 8 mode .
This option tells screen that your terminal sends and understands UTF - 8 encoded characters .
It also sets the default encoding for new windows to ‘ utf8 ’. ‘ -v ’ Print the version number .
‘ - wipe [ match ] ’
List available screens like screen - ls , but remove destroyed sessions instead of marking them as ‘ dead ’.
An unreachable session is considered dead , when its name matches either the name of the local host , or the explicitly given parameter , if any .
See the -r flag for a description how to construct matches .
‘ -x ’ Attach to a session which is already attached elsewhere ( multi- display mode ) .
Screen refuses to attach from within itself .
But when cascading multiple screens , loops are not detected ; take care .
‘ - X ’ Send the specified command to a running screen session .
You may use the - S option to specify the screen session if you have several running .
You can use the -d or -r option to tell screen to look only for attached or detached screen sessions .
Note that this command does n’t work if the session is password protected .
4 Customizing Screen
You can modify the default settings for screen to fit your tastes either through a personal . screenrc file which contains commands to be executed at startup , or on the fly using the colon command .
• Startup Files :
The .screenrc file .
• Source : Read commands from a file .
• Colon : Entering customization commands interactively .
4.1 The .screenrc file
When screen is invoked , it executes initialization commands from the files . screenrc in the user ’s home directory and / usr / local / etc / screenrc .
These defaults can be overridden in the following ways :
For the global screenrc file screen searches for the environment variable $ SYSSCREENRC ( this override feature may be disabled at compile - time ) .
The user specific screenrc file is searched for in $ SCREENRC , then $ HOME /.screenrc .
The command line option ‘ -c ’ specifies which file to use ( see Invoking Screen .
Commands in these files are used to set options , bind commands to keys , and to automatically establish one or more windows at the beginning of your screen session .
Commands are listed one per line , with empty lines being ignored .
A command ’s arguments are separated by tabs or spaces , and may be surrounded by single or double quotes .
A ‘ # ’ turns the rest of the line into a comment , except in quotes .
Unintelligible lines are warned about and ignored .
Commands may contain references to environment variables .
The syntax is the shell - like $ VAR or $ {VAR} .
Note that this causes incompatibility with previous screen versions , as now the ’$ ’- character has to be protected with ’\ ’ if no variable substitution is intended .
A string in single - quotes is also protected from variable substitution .
Two configuration files are shipped as examples with your screen distribution : etc/screenrc and etc/etcscreenrc .
They contain a number of useful examples for various commands .
4.2 Source
Command : source file ( none )
Read and execute commands from file file .
Source commands may be nested to a maximum recursion level of ten .
If file is not an absolute path and screen is already processing a source command , the parent directory of the running source command file is used to search for the new command file before screen ’s current directory .
Note that termcap / terminfo / termcapinfo commands only work at startup and reattach time , so they must be reached via the default screenrc files to have an effect .
4.3 Colon
Customization can also be done online , with this command :
Command : colon ( C- a : )
Allows you to enter . screenrc command lines .
Useful for on - the - fly modification of key bindings , specific window creation and changing settings .
Note that the set keyword no longer exists , as of version 3.3 .
Change default settings with commands starting with ‘ def ’.
You might think of this as the ex command mode of screen , with copy as its vi command mode ( see Copy and Paste ) .
5 Commands
A command in screen can either be bound to a key , invoked from a screenrc file , or called from the colon prompt ( see Customization ) .
As of version 3.3 , all commands can be bound to keys , although some may be less useful than others .
For a number of real life working examples of the most important commands see the files etc/ screenrc and etc/ etcscreenrc of your screen distribution .
In this manual , a command definition looks like this :
– Command : command [ - n ] ARG1 [ ARG2 ] … ( keybindings )
This command does something , but I ca n’t remember what .
An argument in square brackets (‘ [ ] ’) is optional .
Many commands take an argument of ‘ on ’ or ‘ off ’ , which is indicated as state in the definition .
• Default Key Bindings : screen keyboard commands .
• Command Summary : List of all commands .
5.1 Default Key Bindings
As mentioned previously , each keyboard command consists of a C - a followed by one other character .
For your convenience , all commands that are bound to lower - case letters are also bound to their control character counterparts ( with the exception of C - a a ; see below ) .
Thus , both C - a c and C - a C-c can be used to create a window .
The following table shows the default key bindings :
5.2 Command Summary
6 New Window
This section describes the commands for creating a new window for running programs .
When a new window is created , the first available number is assigned to it .
The number of windows is limited at compile - time by the MAXWIN configuration parameter ( which defaults to 40 ) .
• Chdir : Change the working directory for new windows .
• Screen Command : Create a new window .
• Setenv :
Set environment variables for new windows .
• Shell : Parameters for shell windows .
• Term :
Set the terminal type for new windows .
• Window Types : Creating different types of windows .
• Window Groups : Grouping windows together
6.1 Chdir
Command : chdir [ directory ] ( none )
Change the current directory of screen to the specified directory or , if called without an argument , to your home directory ( the value of the environment variable $ HOME ) .
All windows that are created by means of the screen command from within . screenrc or by means of C - a : screen … or C - a c use this as their default directory .
Without a chdir command , this would be the directory from which screen was invoked .
Hardcopy and log files are always written to the window ’s default directory , not the current directory of the process running in the window .
You can use this command multiple times in your . screenrc to start various windows in different default directories , but the last chdir value will affect all the windows you create interactively .
6.2 Screen Command
Command : screen [ opts ] [ n ] [ cmd [ args ] | //group ] ( C-a c , C- a C-c )
Establish a new window .
The flow - control options ( ‘ -f ’ , ‘ - fn ’ and ‘ - fa ’ ) , title option ( ‘ -t ’ ) , login options (‘ - l ’ and ‘ - ln ’) , terminal type option ( ‘ - T term ’ ) , the all - capability - flag ( ‘ - a ’) and scrollback option ( ‘ -h num ’) may be specified with each command .
The option ( ‘ - M ’) turns monitoring on for this window .
The option ( ‘ - L ’) turns output logging on for this window .
If an optional number n in the range 0 … MAXWIN - 1 is given , the window number n is assigned to the newly created window ( or , if this number is already in - use , the next available number ) .
If a command is specified after screen , this command ( with the given arguments ) is started in the window ; otherwise , a shell is created .
If ‘ // group ’ is supplied , a container - type window is created in which other windows may be created inside it .
See Window Groups .
Screen has built in some functionality of ‘ cu ’ and ‘ telnet ’.
See Window Types .
Thus , if your . screenrc contains the lines
# example for . screenrc : screen 1 screen - fn -t foobar 2 - L telnet foobar
screen creates a shell window ( in window # 1 ) and a window with a TELNET connection to the machine foobar ( with no flow - control using the title ‘ foobar ’ in window # 2 ) and will write a logfile ‘ screenlog .2 ’ of the telnet session .
If you do not include any screen commands in your . screenrc file , then screen defaults to creating a single shell window , number zero .
When the initialization is completed , screen switches to the last window specified in your . screenrc file or , if none , it opens default window #0 .
6.3 Setenv
Command : setenv var string ( none )
Set the environment variable var to value string .
If only var is specified , the user will be prompted to enter a value .
If no parameters are specified , the user will be prompted for both variable and value .
The environment is inherited by all subsequently forked shells .
Command : unsetenv var ( none )
Unset an environment variable .
6.4 Shell
Command : shell command Command : defshell command ( none )
Set the command to be used to create a new shell .
This overrides the value of the environment variable $ SHELL .
This is useful if you ’d like to run a tty - enhancer which is expecting to execute the program specified in $ SHELL .
If the command begins with a ‘ - ’ character , the shell will be started as a login - shell .
Typical shells do only minimal initialization when not started as a login - shell .
E.g .
Bash will not read your ~/. bashrc unless it is a login - shell .
defshell is currently a synonym to the shell . screenrc command .
Command : shelltitle title ( none )
Set the title for all shells created during startup or by the C - a C -c command .
See Naming Windows , for details about what titles are .
6.5 Term
Command : term term ( none )
In each window screen opens , it sets the $ TERM variable to screen by default , unless no description for screen is installed in the local termcap or terminfo data base .
In that case it pretends that the terminal emulator is ‘ vt100 ’.
This wo n’t do much harm , as screen is VT100 / ANSI compatible .
The use of the term command is discouraged for non -default purpose .
That is , one may want to specify special $ TERM settings ( e.g. vt100 ) for the next screen rlogin othermachine command .
Use the command screen - T vt100 rlogin othermachine rather than setting and resetting the default .
6.6 Window Types
Screen provides three different window types .
New windows are created with screen ’s ‘ screen ’ command ( see Screen Command ) .
The first parameter to the ‘ screen ’ command defines which type of window is created .
The different window types are all special cases of the normal type .
They have been added in order to allow screen to be used efficiently as a console with 100 or more windows .
The normal window contains a shell ( default , if no parameter is given ) or any other system command that could be executed from a shell .
( e.g. ‘ slogin ’ , etc ... ) .
’ , etc ... ) .
If a tty ( character special device ) name ( e.g. ‘ / dev/ttya ’) is specified as the first parameter , then the window is directly connected to this device .
This window type is similar to ‘ screen cu - l / dev / ttya ’.
Read and write access is required on the device node , an exclusive open is attempted on the node to mark the connection line as busy .
An optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma separated list of flags in the notation used by ‘ stty ( 1 ) ’ : < baud_rate > Usually 300 , 1200 , 9600 or 19200 .
This affects transmission as well as receive speed .
cs8 or cs7 Specify the transmission of eight ( or seven ) bits per byte .
ixon or - ixon Enables ( or disables ) software flow - control ( CTRL- S/ CTRL -Q ) for sending data .
ixoff or - ixoff Enables ( or disables ) software flow - control for receiving data .
istrip or - istrip Clear ( or keep ) the eight bit in each received byte .
You may want to specify as many of these options as applicable .
Unspecified options cause the terminal driver to make up the parameter values of the connection .
These values are system - dependent and may be in defaults or values saved from a previous connection .
For tty windows , the info command shows some of the modem control lines in the status line .
These may include ‘ RTS ’ , ‘ CTS ’ , ‘ DTR ’ , ‘ CD ’ and more .
This depends rather on on the available ioctl( ) ’s and system header files than on the physical capabilities of the serial board .
The name of a logical low ( inactive ) signal is preceded by an exclamation mark (‘ ! ’ ) , otherwise the signal is logical high ( active ) .
Unsupported but shown signals are usually shown low .
When the CLOCAL status bit is true , the whole set of modem signals is placed inside curly braces (‘ { ’ and ‘ } ’ ) .
When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR bit is true , the signals ‘ CTS ’ or ‘ CD ’ are shown in parenthesis , respectively .
For tty windows , the command break causes the Data transmission line ( TxD ) to go low for a specified period of time .
This is expected to be interpreted as break signal on the other side .
No data is sent and no modem control line is changed when a break is issued .
’ ) is specified as the first parameter , then the window is directly connected to this device .
This window type is similar to ‘ ’.
Read and write access is required on the device node , an exclusive open is attempted on the node to mark the connection line as busy .
An optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma separated list of flags in the notation used by ‘ ’:
If the first parameter is // telnet , the second parameter is expected to be a host name , and an optional third parameter may specify a TCP port number ( default decimal 23 ) .
Screen will connect to a server listening on the remote host and use the telnet protocol to communicate with that server .
For telnet windows , the command info shows details about the connection in square brackets (‘ [ ’ and ‘ ] ’) at the end of the status line .
b BINARY .
The connection is in binary mode .
e ECHO .
Local echo is disabled .
c SGA .
The connection is in ‘ character mode ’ ( default : ‘ line mode ’ ) .
t TTYPE .
The terminal type has been requested by the remote host .
Screen sends the name screen unless instructed otherwise ( see also the command ‘ term ’ ) . w NAWS .
The remote site is notified about window size changes .
f LFLOW .
The remote host will send flow control information .
( Ignored at the moment . )
Additional flags for debugging are ‘ x ’ , ‘ t ’ and ‘ n ’ ( XDISPLOC , TSPEED and NEWENV ) .
For telnet windows , the command break sends the telnet code IAC BREAK ( decimal 243 ) to the remote host .
6.7 Window Groups
Screen provides a method for grouping windows together .
Windows can be organized in a hierarchical fashion , resembling a tree structure .
New screens are created using the screen command while new groups are created using screen // group .
See Screen Command .
Once a new group is created , it will act as a container for windows and even other groups .
When a group is selected , you will see the output of the windowlist command , allowing you to select a window inside .
If there are no windows inside a group , use the screen command to create one .
Once inside a group , using the commands next and prev will switch between windows only in that group .
Using the windowlist command will give you the opportunity to leave the group you are in .
See Windowlist .
Command : group [ grouptitle ] ( none )
Change or show the group the current window belongs to .
Windows can be moved around between different groups by specifying the name of the destination group .
Without specifying a group , the title of the current group is displayed .
Using groups in combination with layouts will help create a multi-desktop experience .
One group can be assigned for each layout made .
Windows can be made , split , and organized within each group as desired .
Afterwhich , switching between groups can be as easy as switching layouts .
7 Selecting a Window
This section describes the commands for switching between windows in an screen session .
The windows are numbered from 0 to 9 , and are created in that order by default ( see New Window ) .
• Next and Previous : Forward or back one window .
• Other Window : Switch back and forth between two windows .
• Select : Switch to a window ( and to one after kill ) . • Windowlist : Present a list of all windows for selection .
7.1 Moving Back and Forth
Command : next ( C - a SPC , C-a n , C - a C-n )
Switch to the next window .
This command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows .
( On some terminals , C- SPC generates a NUL character , so you must release the control key before pressing space . )
Command : prev ( C- a p , C- a C-p , C-a C-h , C-a Backspace )
Switch to the previous window ( the opposite of C - a n ) .
7.2 Other Window
Command : other ( C - a C-a )
Switch to the last window displayed .
Note that this command defaults to the command character typed twice , unless overridden .
For instance , if you use the option ‘ - e ] x ’ , this command becomes ] ] ( see Command Character ) .
7.3 Select
Command : select [ n |-|. ] ( C- a n , C- a ' )
Switch to the window with the number n .
If no window number is specified , you get prompted for an identifier .
This can be a window name ( title ) or a number .
When a new window is established , the lowest available number is assigned to this window .
Thus , the first window can be activated by select 0 ; there can be no more than 10 windows present simultaneously ( unless screen is compiled with a higher MAXWIN setting ) .
There are two special arguments , select - switches to the internal blank window and select .
switches to the current window .
The latter is useful if used with screen ’s - X option .
7.4 Windowlist
Command : windowlist [ - b ] [ - m ] [ - g ]
Command : windowlist string [ string ]
Command : windowlist title [ title ] ( C - a " )
Display all windows in a table for visual window selection .
If screen was in a window group , screen will back out of the group and then display the windows in that group .
If the - b option is given , screen will switch to the blank window before presenting the list , so that the current window is also selectable .
The -m option changes the order of the windows , instead of sorting by window numbers screen uses its internal most - recently - used list .
The -g option will show the windows inside any groups in that level and downwards .
The following keys are used to navigate in windowlist : k , C-p , or up
Move up one line .
j , C-n , or down
Move down one line .
C-g or escape Exit windowlist .
C -a or home Move to the first line .
C-e or end Move to the last line .
C-u or C-d Move one half page up or down .
C-b or C-f
Move one full page up or down .
0..9 Using the number keys , move to the selected line .
mouseclick
Move to the selected line .
Available when mousetrack is set to on . / Search .
n Repeat search in the forward direction .
N Repeat search in the backward direction .
m Toggle MRU . g Toggle group nesting .
a
All window view .
C-h or backspace Back out the group . , Switch numbers with the previous window . .
Switch numbers with the next window .
K Kill that window .
space or enter Select that window .
The table format can be changed with the string and title option , the title is displayed as table heading , while the lines are made by using the string setting .
The default setting is ‘ Num Name % =Flags ’ for the title and ‘ %3 n %t %=%f ’ for the lines .
See the string escapes chapter ( see String Escapes ) for more codes ( e.g. color settings ) .
Windowlist needs a region size of at least 10 characters wide and 6 characters high in order to display .
8 Session Management Commands
Perhaps the most useful feature of screen is the way it allows the user to move a session between terminals , by detaching and reattaching .
This also makes life easier for modem users who have to deal with unexpected loss of carrier .
• Detach : Disconnect screen from your terminal .
• Power Detach : Detach and log out .
• Lock : Lock your terminal temporarily .
• Multiuser Session : Changing number of allowed users .
• Session Name : Rename your session for later reattachment .
• Suspend : Suspend your session .
• Quit : Terminate your session .
8.1 Detach
Command : autodetach state ( none )
Sets whether screen will automatically detach upon hangup , which saves all your running programs until they are resumed with a screen -r command .
When turned off , a hangup signal will terminate screen and all the processes it contains .
Autodetach is on by default .
Command : detach ( C - a d , C- a C-d )
Detach the screen session ( disconnect it from the terminal and put it into the background ) .
A detached screen can be resumed by invoking screen with the -r option ( see Invoking Screen ) .
The -h option tells screen to immediately close the connection to the terminal (‘ hangup ’ ) .
Command : password [ crypted_pw ] ( none )
Present a crypted password in your . screenrc file and screen will ask for it , whenever someone attempts to resume a detached session .
This is useful , if you have privileged programs running under screen and you want to protect your session from reattach attempts by users that managed to assume your uid .
( I.e. any superuser . )
If no crypted password is specified , screen prompts twice a password and places its encryption in the paste buffer .
Default is ‘ none ’ , which disables password checking .
8.2 Power Detach
Command : pow_detach ( C - a D D )
Mainly the same as detach , but also sends a HANGUP signal to the parent process of screen .
Caution :
This will result in a logout if screen was started from your login - shell .
Command : pow_detach_msg [ message ] ( none )
The message specified here is output whenever a power detach is performed .
It may be used as a replacement for a logout message or to reset baud rate , etc .
Without a parameter , the current message is shown .
8.3 Lock
Command : lockscreen ( C- a x , C- a C-x )
Call a screenlock program ( / local / bin /lck or /usr / bin / lock or a builtin , if no other is available ) .
Screen does not accept any command keys until this program terminates .
Meanwhile processes in the windows may continue , as the windows are in the detached state .
The screenlock program may be changed through the environment variable $ LOCKPRG ( which must be set in the shell from which screen is started ) and is executed with the user ’s uid and gid .
Warning :
When you leave other shells unlocked and have no password set on screen , the lock is void :
One could easily re-attach from an unlocked shell .
This feature should rather be called lockterminal .
8.4 Multiuser Session
These commands allow other users to gain access to one single screen session .
When attaching to a multiuser screen the sessionname is specified as username / sessionname to the - S command line option .
Screen must be compiled with multiuser support to enable features described here .
• Multiuser : Enable / Disable multiuser mode .
• Acladd : Enable a specific user .
• Aclchg : Change a users permissions .
• Acldel : Disable a specific user .
• Aclgrp : Grant a user permissions to other users .
• Displays : List all active users at their displays .
• Umask : Predefine access to new windows .
• Wall : Write a message to all users .
• Writelock : Grant exclusive window access . • Su : Substitute user .
8.4.1 Multiuser
Command : multiuser state ( none )
Switch between single - user and multi-user mode .
Standard screen operation is single - user .
In multi-user mode the commands acladd , aclchg and acldel can be used to enable ( and disable ) other users accessing this screen .
8.4.2 Acladd
Command : acladd usernames Command : addacl usernames ( none )
Enable users to fully access this screen session .
Usernames can be one user or a comma separated list of users .
This command enables to attach to the screen session and performs the equivalent of aclchg usernames +rwx " # ? " .
To add a user with restricted access , use the aclchg command below .
Addacl is a synonym to acladd .
Multi-user mode only .
8.4.3 Aclchg
Command : aclchg usernames permbits list Command : chacl usernames permbits list ( none )
Change permissions for a comma separated list of users .
Permission bits are represented as ‘ r ’ , ‘ w ’ and ‘ x ’.
Prefixing ‘ + ’ grants the permission , ‘ - ’ removes it .
The third parameter is a comma separated list of commands or windows ( specified either by number or title ) .
The special list ‘ # ’ refers to all windows , ‘ ? ’ to all commands .
If usernames consists of a single ‘ * ’ , all known users are affected .
A command can be executed when the user has the ‘ x ’ bit for it .
The user can type input to a window when he has its ‘ w ’ bit set and no other user obtains a writelock for this window .
Other bits are currently ignored .
To withdraw the writelock from another user in e.g. window 2 : ‘ aclchg username - w+w 2 ’.
To allow read - only access to the session : ‘ aclchg username -w " # " ’.
As soon as a user ’s name is known to screen , he can attach to the session and ( per default ) has full permissions for all command and windows .
Execution permission for the acl commands , at and others should also be removed or the user may be able to regain write permission .
Chacl is a synonym to aclchg .
Multi-user mode only .
8.4.4 Acldel
Command : acldel username ( none )
Remove a user from screen ’s access control list .
If currently attached , all the user ’s displays are detached from the session .
He can not attach again .
Multi-user mode only .
8.4.5 Aclgrp
Command : aclgrp username [ groupname ] ( none )
Creates groups of users that share common access rights .
The name of the group is the username of the group leader .
Each member of the group inherits the permissions that are granted to the group leader .
That means , if a user fails an access check , another check is made for the group leader .
A user is removed from all groups the special value ‘ none ’ is used for groupname .
If the second parameter is omitted all groups the user is in are listed .
8.4.6 Displays
Command : displays ( C - a * )
Shows a tabular listing of all currently connected user front - ends ( displays ) .
This is most useful for multiuser sessions .
The following keys can be used in displays list : k , C-p , or up Move up one line .
j , C-n , or down
Move down one line .
C-a or home Move to the first line .
C-e or end Move to the last line .
C-u or C-d Move one half page up or down .
C-b or C-f
Move one full page up or down .
mouseclick
Move to the selected line .
Available when mousetrack is set to on .
space Refresh the list .
d Detach the selected display .
D Power detach the selected display .
C - g , enter , or escape Exit the list .
The following is an example of what displays could look like : xterm 80x42 jnweiger@/dev/ttyp4 0( m11 ) &rWx facit 80x24 mlschroe@/dev/ttyhf nb 11( tcsh ) rwx xterm 80x42 jnhollma@/dev/ttyp5 0( m11 ) & R.x ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) ( D ) ( E ) ( F ) ( G ) ( H ) ( I )
The legend is as follows :
(A) The terminal type known by screen for this display .
( B) Displays geometry as width x height .
(C) Username who is logged in at the display .
(D) Device name of the display or the attached device
(E) Display is in blocking or nonblocking mode .
The available modes are " nb " , " NB " , " Z < " , " Z > " , and " BL " .
( F) Number of the window
( G) Name / title of window
( H) Whether the window is shared
( I) Window permissions .
Made up of three characters : ( 1st character ) ‘ - ’ : no read ‘ r ’ : read ‘ R ’ : read only due to foreign wlock ( 2nd character ) ‘ - ’ : no write ‘ . ’ : write suppressed by foreign wlock ‘ w ’ : write ‘ W ’ : own wlock ( 3rd character ) ‘ - ’ : no execute ‘ x ’ : execute Displays needs a region size of at least 10 characters wide and 5 characters high in order to display .
8.4.7 aclumask
Command : aclumask [ users ]+/- bits ... Command : umask [ users ]+/- bits ... ( none )
This specifies the access other users have to windows that will be created by the caller of the command .
Users may be no , one or a comma separated list of known usernames .
If no users are specified , a list of all currently known users is assumed .
Bits is any combination of access control bits allowed defined with the aclchg command .
The special username ‘ ? ’ predefines the access that not yet known users will be granted to any window initially .
The special username ‘ ?? ’ predefines the access that not yet known users are granted to any command .
Rights of the special username nobody cannot be changed ( see the su command ) .
Umask is a synonym to aclumask .
8.4.8 Wall
Command : wall message ( none )
Write a message to all displays .
The message will appear in the terminal ’s status line .
8.4.9 Writelock
Command : writelock on |off|auto ( none )
In addition to access control lists , not all users may be able to write to the same window at once .
Per default , writelock is in ‘ auto ’ mode and grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first to switch to the particular window .
When he leaves the window , other users may obtain the writelock ( automatically ) .
The writelock of the current window is disabled by the command writelock off .
If the user issues the command writelock on he keeps the exclusive write permission while switching to other windows .
Command : defwritelock on|off|auto ( none )
Sets the default writelock behavior for new windows .
Initially all windows will be created with no writelocks .
8.4.10 Su
Command : su [ username [ password [ password2 ] ] ] ( none )
Substitute the user of a display .
The command prompts for all parameters that are omitted .
If passwords are specified as parameters , they have to be specified un-crypted .
The first password is matched against the systems passwd database , the second password is matched against the screen password as set with the commands acladd or password .
Su may be useful for the screen administrator to test multiuser setups .
When the identification fails , the user has access to the commands available for user ‘ nobody ’.
These are detach , license , version , help and displays .
8.5 Session Name
Command : sessionname [ name ] ( none )
Rename the current session .
Note that for screen - list the name shows up with the process - id prepended .
If the argument name is omitted , the name of this session is displayed .
Caution :
The $ STY environment variable will still reflect the old name in pre-existing shells .
This may result in confusion .
Use of this command is generally discouraged .
Use the - S command - line option if you want to name a new session .
The default is constructed from the tty and host names .
8.6 Suspend
Command : suspend ( C - a z , C - a C-z )
Suspend screen .
The windows are in the detached state while screen is suspended .
This feature relies on the parent shell being able to do job control .
8.7 Quit
Command : quit ( C - a \ )
Kill all windows and terminate screen .
( see Key Binding ) .
9 Regions
Screen has the ability to display more than one window on the user ’s display .
This is done by splitting the screen in regions , which can contain different windows .
• Split : Split a region into two • Focus : Change to the next region •
Only : Delete all other regions • Remove : Delete the current region • Resize : Grow or shrink a region • Caption : Control the window ’s caption • Fit : Resize a window to fit the region • Focusminsize : Force a minimum size on a current region • Layout : Manage groups of regions
9.1 Split
Command : split [ - v ] ( C-a S , C- a | )
Split the current region into two new ones .
All regions on the display are resized to make room for the new region .
The blank window is displayed in the new region .
The default is to create a horizontal split , putting the new regions on the top and bottom of each other .
Using ‘ -v ’ will create a vertical split , causing the new regions to appear side by side of each other .
Use the remove or the only command to delete regions .
Use focus to toggle between regions .
When a region is split opposite of how it was previously split ( that is , vertical then horizontal or horizontal then vertical ) , a new layer is created .
The layer is used to group together the regions that are split the same .
Normally , as a user , you should not see nor have to worry about layers , but they will affect how some commands ( focus and resize ) behave .
With this current implementation of screen , scrolling data will appear much slower in a vertically split region than one that is not .
This should be taken into consideration if you need to use system commands such as cat or tail -f .
9.2 Focus
Command : focus [ next|prev|up|down|left|right|top|bottom ] ( C- a Tab )
Move the input focus to the next region .
This is done in a cyclic way so that the top left region is selected after the bottom right one .
If no option is given it defaults to next .
The next region to be selected is determined by how the regions are layered .
Normally , the next region in the same layer would be selected .
However , if that next region contains one or more layers , the first region in the highest layer is selected first .
If you are at the last region of the current layer , next will move the focus to the next region in the lower layer ( if there is a lower layer ) .
Prev cycles in the opposite order .
See Split for more information about layers .
The rest of the options ( up , down , left , right , top , and bottom ) are more indifferent to layers .
The option up will move the focus upward to the region that is touching the upper left corner of the current region .
Down will move downward to the region that is touching the lower left corner of the current region .
The option left will move the focus leftward to the region that is touching the upper left corner of the current region , while right will move rightward to the region that is touching the upper right corner of the current region .
Moving left from a left most region or moving right from a right most region will result in no action .
The option top will move the focus to the very first region in the upper list corner of the screen , and bottom will move to the region in the bottom right corner of the screen .
Moving up from a top most region or moving down from a bottom most region will result in no action .
Useful bindings are ( h , j , k , and l as in vi ) : bind h focus left bind j focus down bind k focus up bind l focus right bind t focus top bind b focus bottom Note that ‘ k ’ is traditionally bound to the kill command .
9.3 Only
Command : only ( C- a Q )
Kill all regions but the current one .
9.4 Remove
Command : remove ( C-a X )
Kill the current region .
This is a no - op if there is only one region .
9.5 Resize
Command : resize [ - h| - v|-b| - l| -p ] [ [+|-] n [ % ] | = | max | min | _ | 0 ] ( none )
Resize the current region .
The space will be removed from or added to the surrounding regions depending on the order of the splits .
The available options for resizing are ‘ -h ’ ( horizontal ) , ‘ - v ’ ( vertical ) , ‘ - b ’ ( both ) , ‘ - l ’ ( local to layer ) , and ‘ - p ’( perpendicular ) .
Horizontal resizes will add or remove width to a region , vertical will add or remove height , and both will add or remove size from both dimensions .
Local and perpendicular are similar to horizontal and vertical , but they take in account of how a region was split .
If a region ’s last split was horizontal , a local resize will work like a vertical resize .
If a region ’s last split was vertical , a local resize will work like a horizontal resize .
Perpendicular resizes work in opposite of local resizes .
If no option is specified , local is the default .
The amount of lines to add or remove can be expressed a couple of different ways .
By specifying a number n by itself will resize the region by that absolute amount .
You can specify a relative amount by prefixing a plus ‘ + ’ or minus ‘ - ’ to the amount , such as adding +n lines or removing -n lines .
Resizing can also be expressed as an absolute or relative percentage by postfixing a percent sign ‘ % ’.
Using zero ‘ 0 ’ is a synonym for min and using an underscore ‘ _ ’ is a synonym for max .
Some examples are : resize +N increase current region by N resize - N decrease current region by N resize N set current region to N resize 20 % set current region to 20 % of original size resize + 20 % increase current region by 20 % resize - b = make all windows equally resize max maximize current region resize min minimize current region Without any arguments , screen will prompt for how you would like to resize the current region .
See focusminsize if you want to restrict the minimun size a region can have .
9.6 Caption
Command : caption always | splitonly [ string ]
Command : caption string [ string ] ( none )
This command controls the display of the window captions .
Normally a caption is only used if more than one window is shown on the display ( split screen mode ) .
But if the type is set to always , screen shows a caption even if only one window is displayed .
The default is ‘ splitonly ’.
The second form changes the text used for the caption .
You can use all string escapes ( see String Escapes ) .
Screen uses a default of ‘ %3 n %t ’.
You can mix both forms by providing the string as an additional argument .
9.7 Fit
Command : fit ( C- a F )
Change the window size to the size of the current region .
This command is needed because screen does n’t adapt the window size automatically if the window is displayed more than once .
9.8 Focusminsize
Command : focusminsize [ ( width| max | _ ) ( height| max | _ ) ] ( none )
This forces any currently selected region to be automatically resized at least a certain width and height .
All other surrounding regions will be resized in order to accommodate .
This constraint follows every time the focus command is used .
The resize command can be used to increase either dimension of a region , but never below what is set with focusminsize .
The underscore ‘ _ ’ is a synonym for max .
Setting a width and height of 0 0 ( zero zero ) will undo any constraints and allow for manual resizing .
Without any parameters , the minimum width and height is shown .
9.9 Layout
Using regions , and perhaps a large enough terminal , you can give screen more of a desktop feel .
By being able to split regions horizontally or vertically , you can take advantage of the lesser used spaces of your terminal .
The catch to these splits has been that they ’re not kept between screen detachments and reattachments .
Layouts will help organize your regions .
You can create one layout of four horizontal regions and then create a separate layout of regions in a two by two array .
The regions could contain the same windows , but they do n’t have to .
You can easily switch between layouts and keep them between detachments and reattachments .
Note that there are several subcommands to layout .
Command : layout new [ title ] ( none )
Create a new layout .
The screen will change to one whole region and be switched to the blank window .
From here , you build the regions and the windows they show as you desire .
The new layout will be numbered with the smallest available integer , starting with zero .
You can optionally give a title to your new layout .
Otherwise , it will have a default title of layout .
You can always change the title later by using the command layout title .
Command : layout remove [ n|title ] ( none )
Remove , or in other words , delete the specified layout .
Either the number or the title can be specified .
Without either specification , screen will remove the current layout .
Removing a layout does not affect your set windows or regions .
Command : layout next ( none )
Switch to the next layout available
Command : layout prev ( none )
Switch to the previous layout available
Command : layout select [ n|title ] ( none )
Select the desired layout .
Either the number or the title can be specified .
Without either specification , screen will prompt and ask which screen is desired .
To see which layouts are available , use the layout show command .
Command : layout show ( none )
List on the message line the number (s ) and title (s ) of the available layout (s ) .
The current layout is flagged .
Command : layout title [ title ] ( none )
Change or display the title of the current layout .
A string given will be used to name the layout .
Without any options , the current title and number is displayed on the message line .
Command : layout number [ n ] ( none )
Change or display the number of the current layout .
An integer given will be used to number the layout .
Without any options , the current number and title is displayed on the message line .
Command : layout attach [ title| : last ] ( none )
Change or display which layout to reattach back to .
The default is : last , which tells screen to reattach back to the last used layout just before detachment .
By supplying a title , You can instruct screen to reattach to a particular layout regardless which one was used at the time of detachment .
Without any options , the layout to reattach to will be shown in the message line .
Command : layout save [ n|title ] ( none )
Remember the current arrangement of regions .
When used , screen will remember the arrangement of vertically and horizontally split regions .
This arrangement is restored when a screen session is reattached or switched back from a different layout .
If the session ends or the screen process dies , the layout arrangements are lost .
The layout dump command should help in this siutation .
If a number or title is supplied , screen will remember the arrangement of that particular layout .
Without any options , screen will remember the current layout .
Saving your regions can be done automatically by using the layout autosave command .
Command : layout autosave [ on | off ] ( none )
Change or display the status of automatically saving layouts .
The default is on , meaning when screen is detached or changed to a different layout , the arrangement of regions and windows will be remembered at the time of change and restored upon return .
If autosave is set to off , that arrangement will only be restored to either to the last manual save , using layout save , or to when the layout was first created , to a single region with a single window .
Without either an on or an off , the current status is displayed on the message line .
Command : layout dump [ filename ] ( none )
Write to a file the order of splits made in the current layout .
This is useful to recreate the order of your regions used in your current layout .
Only the current layout is recorded .
While the order of the regions are recorded , the sizes of those regions and which windows correspond to which regions are not .
If no filename is specified , the default is layout - dump , saved in the directory that the screen process was started in .
If the file already exists , layout dump will append to that file .
As an example : layout dump / home / user / .screenrc will save or append the layout to the user ’s . screenrc file .
10 Window Settings
These commands control the way screen treats individual windows in a session .
See Virtual Terminal , for commands to control the terminal emulation itself .
• Naming Windows : Control the name of the window • Console :
See the host ’s console messages • Kill : Destroy an unwanted window • Login : Control /etc / utmp logging • Mode : Control the file mode of the pty • Monitor : Watch for activity or inactivity in a window • Windows :
List the active windows • Hardstatus :
Set a window ’s hardstatus line
10.1 Naming Windows ( Titles )
You can customize each window ’s name in the window display ( viewed with the windows command ( see Windows ) by setting it with one of the title commands .
Normally the name displayed is the actual command name of the program created in the window .
However , it is sometimes useful to distinguish various programs of the same name or to change the name on - the - fly to reflect the current state of the window .
The default name for all shell windows can be set with the shelltitle command ( see Shell ) .
You can specify the name you want for a window with the ‘ -t ’ option to the screen command when the window is created ( see Screen Command ) .
To change the name after the window has been created you can use the title - string escape - sequence ( ESC k name ESC \ ) and the title command ( C - a A ) .
The former can be output from an application to control the window ’s name under software control , and the latter will prompt for a name when typed .
You can also bind predefined names to keys with the title command to set things quickly without prompting .
• Title Command :
The title command .
• Dynamic Titles :
Make shell windows change titles dynamically .
• Title Prompts :
Set up your shell prompt for dynamic Titles .
• Title Screenrc : Set up Titles in your .screenrc .
10.1.1 Title Command
Command : title [ windowtitle ] ( C-a A )
Set the name of the current window to windowtitle .
If no name is specified , screen prompts for one .
10.1.2 Dynamic Titles
screen has a shell - specific heuristic that is enabled by setting the window ’s name to search|name and arranging to have a null title escape - sequence output as a part of your prompt .
The search portion specifies an end - of - prompt search string , while the name portion specifies the default shell name for the window .
If the name ends in a ‘ : ’ screen will add what it believes to be the current command running in the window to the end of the specified name ( e.g. name : cmd ) .
Otherwise the current command name supersedes the shell name while it is running .
Here ’s how it works : you must modify your shell prompt to output a null title - escape - sequence ( ESC k ESC \ ) as a part of your prompt .
The last part of your prompt must be the same as the string you specified for the search portion of the title .
Once this is set up , screen will use the title - escape - sequence to clear the previous command name and get ready for the next command .
Then , when a newline is received from the shell , a search is made for the end of the prompt .
If found , it will grab the first word after the matched string and use it as the command name .
If the command name begins with ‘ ! ’ , ‘ % ’ , or ‘ ^ ’ , screen will use the first word on the following line ( if found ) in preference to the just - found name .
This helps csh users get more accurate titles when using job control or history recall commands .
10.1.3 Setting up your prompt for shell titles
One thing to keep in mind when adding a null title - escape - sequence to your prompt is that some shells ( like the csh ) count all the non-control characters as part of the prompt ’s length .
If these invisible characters are n’t a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will result in an incorrect display .
One way to get around this is to use a prompt like this :
set prompt= '{ No value for `esc ' } [ 0000 m
{
No value for `esc'}k {
No value for `esc '}\ % '
The escape - sequence ‘ { No value for `esc ' } [ 0000 m ’ not only normalizes the character attributes , but all the zeros round the length of the invisible characters up to 8 .
Tcsh handles escape codes in the prompt more intelligently , so you can specify your prompt like this :
set prompt= " %{\ek\e\\ %}\ % "
Bash users will probably want to echo the escape sequence in the PROMPT_COMMAND :
PROMPT_COMMAND='printf " \033k\033\134 " '
( I used ‘ \ 134 ’ to output a ‘ \ ’ because of a bug in v1.04 ) .
10.1.4 Setting up shell titles in your .
screenrc
Here are some . screenrc examples :
screen -t top 2 nice top
Adding this line to your . screenrc would start a niced version of the top command in window 2 named ‘ top ’ rather than ‘ nice ’.
shelltitle '> |csh ' screen 1
This file would start a shell using the given shelltitle .
The title specified is an auto - title that would expect the prompt and the typed command to look something like the following :
/usr/joe/src/dir>
trn
( it looks after the ’> ’ for the command name ) .
The window status would show the name ‘ trn ’ while the command was running , and revert to ‘ csh ’ upon completion .
bind R screen - t '% |root : ' su
Having this command in your . screenrc would bind the key sequence C-a R to the su command and give it an auto - title name of ‘ root : ’.
For this auto - title to work , the screen could look something like this :
% !em emacs file .c
Here the user typed the csh history command !em which ran the previously entered emacs command .
The window status would show ‘ root : emacs ’ during the execution of the command , and revert to simply ‘ root : ’ at its completion .
bind o title bind E title " " bind u title ( unknown )
The first binding does n’t have any arguments , so it would prompt you for a title when you type C-a o .
The second binding would clear an auto - titles current setting ( C - a E ) .
The third binding would set the current window ’s title to ‘ ( unknown ) ’ ( C - a u ) .
10.2 Console
Command : console [ state ] ( none )
Grabs or un - grabs the machines console output to a window .
When the argument is omitted the current state is displayed .
Note :
Only the owner of / dev / console can grab the console output .
This command is only available if the host supports the ioctl TIOCCONS .
10.3 Kill
Command : kill ( C - a k , C- a C-k )
Kill the current window .
If there is an exec command running ( see Exec ) then it is killed .
Otherwise the process ( e.g. shell ) running in the window receives a HANGUP condition , the window structure is removed and screen ( your display ) switches to another window .
When the last window is destroyed , screen exits .
After a kill screen switches to the previously displayed window .
Caution : emacs users may find themselves killing their emacs session when trying to delete the current line .
For this reason , it is probably wise to use a different command character ( see Command Character ) or rebind kill to another key sequence , such as C - a K ( see Key Binding ) .
10.4 Login
Command : deflogin state ( none )
Same as the login command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
This defaults to ‘ on ’ unless otherwise specified at compile time ( see Installation ) .
Both commands are only present when screen has been compiled with utmp support .
Command : login [ state ] ( C-a L )
Adds or removes the entry in /etc / utmp for the current window .
This controls whether or not the window is logged in .
In addition to this toggle , it is convenient to have “ log in ” and “ log out ” keys .
For instance , bind I login on and bind O login off will map these keys to be C- a I and C - a O ( see Key Binding ) .
10.5 Mode
Command : defmode mode ( none )
The mode of each newly allocated pseudo - tty is set to mode .
mode is an octal number as used by chmod ( 1 ) .
Defaults to 0622 for windows which are logged in , 0600 for others ( e.g. when - ln was specified for creation , see Screen Command ) .
10.6 Monitoring
Command : activity message ( none )
When any activity occurs in a background window that is being monitored , screen displays a notification in the message line .
The notification message can be redefined by means of the activity command .
Each occurrence of ‘ % ’ in message is replaced by the number of the window in which activity has occurred , and each occurrence of ‘ ^G ’ is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap ( usually an audible bell ) .
The default message is ' Activity in window %n '
Note that monitoring is off for all windows by default , but can be altered by use of the monitor command ( C - a M ) .
Command : defmonitor state ( none )
Same as the monitor command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is ‘ off ’ .
Command : monitor [ state ] ( C-a M )
Toggles monitoring of the current window .
When monitoring is turned on and the affected window is switched into the background , the activity notification message will be displayed in the status line at the first sign of output , and the window will also be marked with an ‘ @ ’ in the window - status display ( see Windows ) .
Monitoring defaults to ‘ off ’ for all windows .
Command : silence [ state | sec ] ( C- a _ )
Toggles silence monitoring of windows .
When silence is turned on and an affected window is switched into the background , you will receive the silence notification message in the status line after a specified period of inactivity ( silence ) .
The default timeout can be changed with the silencewait command or by specifying a number of seconds instead of on or off .
Silence is initially off for all windows .
Command : defsilence state ( none )
Same as the silence command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is ‘ off ’ .
Command : silencewait seconds ( none )
Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait before displaying a message .
Default is 30 seconds .
10.7 Windows
Command : windows [ string ] ( C - a w , C - a C-w )
Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows .
Each window is listed by number with the name of the program running in the window ( or its title ) .
The current window is marked with a ‘ * ’; the previous window is marked with a ‘ - ’ ; all the windows that are logged in are marked with a ‘ $ ’ ( see Login ) ; a background window that has received a bell is marked with a ‘ ! ’; a background window that is being monitored and has had activity occur is marked with an ‘ @ ’ ( see Monitor ) ; a window which has output logging turned on is marked with ‘ ( L ) ’; windows occupied by other users are marked with ‘ & ’ or ‘ && ’ if the window is shared by other users ; windows in the zombie state are marked with ‘ Z ’.
If this list is too long to fit on the terminal ’s status line only the portion around the current window is displayed .
You can customize the output format to any string you like including string escapes ( see String Escapes ) .
In this case , if the string parameter is passed , the maximum output size is unlimited ( instead of 1024 bytes if no parameter is passed ) .
10.8 Hardstatus
Screen maintains a hardstatus line for every window .
If a window gets selected , the display ’s hardstatus will be updated to match the window ’s hardstatus line .
The hardstatus line can be changed with the ANSI Application Program Command ( APC ) : ‘ ESC_ < string > ESC \ ’.
As a convenience for xterm users the sequence ‘ ESC ] 0..2 ; < string >
^G ’ is also accepted .
Command : defhstatus [ status ] ( none )
The hardstatus line that all new windows will get is set to status .
This command is useful to make the hardstatus of every window display the window number or title or the like .
status may contain the same directives as in the window messages , but the directive escape character is ‘ ^E ’ ( octal 005 ) instead of ‘ % ’.
This was done to make a misinterpretation of program generated hardstatus lines impossible .
If the parameter status is omitted , the current default string is displayed .
Per default the hardstatus line of new windows is empty .
Command : hstatus status ( none )
Changes the current window ’s hardstatus line to status .
10.9 Mousetrack
Command : mousetrack [ on|off ] ( none )
This command determines whether screen will watch for mouse clicks .
When this command is enabled , regions that have been split in various ways can be selected by pointing to them with a mouse and left - clicking them .
Without specifying on or off , the current state is displayed .
The default state is determined by the defmousetrack command .
Command : defmousetrack on|off ( none )
This command determines the default state of the mousetrack command , currently defaulting of off .
11 Virtual Terminal
Each window in a screen session emulates a VT100 terminal , with some extra functions added .
The VT100 emulator is hard - coded , no other terminal types can be emulated .
The commands described here modify the terminal emulation .
11.1 Control Sequences
The following is a list of control sequences recognized by screen .
‘ ( V ) ’ and ‘ ( A ) ’ indicate VT100 - specific and ANSI - or ISO - specific functions , respectively .
ESC E Next Line ESC D Index ESC M Reverse Index ESC H Horizontal Tab Set ESC Z Send VT100 Identification String ESC 7 ( V ) Save Cursor and Attributes ESC 8 ( V ) Restore Cursor and Attributes ESC [s ( A ) Save Cursor and Attributes ESC [ u ( A ) Restore Cursor and Attributes ESC c Reset to Initial State ESC g Visual Bell ESC Pn p Cursor Visibility ( 97801 ) Pn = 6 Invisible 7 Visible ESC = ( V ) Application Keypad Mode ESC > ( V ) Numeric Keypad Mode ESC # 8 ( V ) Fill Screen with E's ESC \ ( A ) String Terminator ESC ^ ( A ) Privacy Message String ( Message Line ) ESC !

ESC _ ( A ) Application Program Command ( Hardstatus ) ESC ] 0 ; string ^G ( A ) Operating System Command ( Hardstatus , xterm title hack ) ESC ] 83 ; cmd ^G ( A ) Execute screen command .
This only works if multi-user support is compiled into screen .
The pseudo - user " : window : " is used to check the access control list .
Use " addacl : window : - rwx # ? " to create a user with no rights and allow only the needed commands .

11.2 Input Translation
In order to do a full VT100 emulation screen has to detect that a sequence of characters in the input stream was generated by a keypress on the user ’s keyboard and insert the VT100 style escape sequence .
Screen has a very flexible way of doing this by making it possible to map arbitrary commands on arbitrary sequences of characters .
For standard VT100 emulation the command will always insert a string in the input buffer of the window ( see also command stuff , see Paste ) .
Because the sequences generated by a keypress can change after a reattach from a different terminal type , it is possible to bind commands to the termcap name of the keys .
Screen will insert the correct binding after each reattach .
See Bindkey for further details on the syntax and examples .
Here is the table of the default key bindings .
( A ) means that the command is executed if the keyboard is switched into application mode .

11.3 Digraph
Command : digraph [ preset [ unicode - value ] ] ( C - a C-v )
This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence .
The next two characters typed are looked up in a builtin table and the resulting character is inserted in the input stream .
For example , if the user enters ‘ a " ’ , an a -umlaut will be inserted .
If the first character entered is a 0 ( zero ) , screen will treat the following characters ( up to three ) as an octal number instead .
The optional argument preset is treated as user input , thus one can create an " umlaut " key .
For example the command ‘ bindkey ^K digraph ' " ' ’ enables the user to generate an a -umlaut by typing ‘ CTRL -K a ’ .
When a non -zero unicode - value is specified , a new digraph is created with the specified preset .
The digraph is unset if a zero value is provided for the unicode - value .
The following table is the builtin sequences .

11.4 Bell
Command : bell_msg [ message ] ( none )
When a bell character is sent to a background window , screen displays a notification in the message line .
The notification message can be re-defined by this command .
Each occurrence of ‘ % ’ in message is replaced by the number of the window to which a bell has been sent , and each occurrence of ‘ ^G ’ is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap ( usually an audible bell ) .
The default message is ' Bell in window %n '
An empty message can be supplied to the bell_msg command to suppress output of a message line ( bell_msg " " ) .
Without a parameter , the current message is shown .
Command : vbell [ state ] ( C - a C- g )
Sets or toggles the visual bell setting for the current window .
If vbell is switched to ‘ on ’ , but your terminal does not support a visual bell , the visual bell message is displayed in the status line when the bell character is received .
Visual bell support of a terminal is defined by the termcap variable vb .
See Bell , for more information on visual bells .
The equivalent terminfo capability is flash .
Per default , vbell is ‘ off ’ , thus the audible bell is used .
Command : vbell_msg [ message ] ( none )
Sets the visual bell message .
Message is printed to the status line if the window receives a bell character ( ^G ) , vbell is set to ‘ on ’ and the terminal does not support a visual bell .
The default message is ‘ Wuff , Wuff !! ’.
Without a parameter , the current message is shown .
Command : vbellwait sec ( none )
Define a delay in seconds after each display of screen ’s visual bell message .
The default is 1 second .
11.5 Clear
Command : clear ( C- a C )
Clears the screen and saves its contents to the scrollback buffer .
11.6 Info
Command : info ( C-a i , C - a C-i )
Uses the message line to display some information about the current window : the cursor position in the form ‘ ( column , row ) ’ starting with ‘ ( 1,1 ) ’ , the terminal width and height plus the size of the scrollback buffer in lines , like in ‘ ( 80,24 ) +50 ’ , the current state of window XON / XOFF flow control is shown like this ( see Flow Control ) : + flow automatic flow control , currently on .
- flow automatic flow control , currently off .
+(+) flow flow control enabled .
Agrees with automatic control .
-(+) flow flow control disabled .
Disagrees with automatic control . +(-) flow flow control enabled .
Disagrees with automatic control . -(-) flow flow control disabled .
Agrees with automatic control .
The current line wrap setting (‘ + wrap ’ indicates enabled , ‘ - wrap ’ not ) is also shown .
The flags ‘ ins ’ , ‘ org ’ , ‘ app ’ , ‘ log ’ , ‘ mon ’ and ‘ nored ’ are displayed when the window is in insert mode , origin mode , application - keypad mode , has output logging , activity monitoring or partial redraw enabled .
The currently active character set (‘ G0 ’ , ‘ G1 ’ , ‘ G2 ’ , or ‘ G3 ’ ) , and in square brackets the terminal character sets that are currently designated as ‘ G0 ’ through ‘ G3 ’.
If the window is in UTF - 8 mode , the string ‘ UTF - 8 ’ is shown instead .
Additional modes depending on the type of the window are displayed at the end of the status line ( see Window Types ) .
If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a non-default state , the info line is started with a string identifying the current state .
For system information use time .
Command : dinfo ( none )
Show what screen thinks about your terminal .
Useful if you want to know why features like color or the alternate charset do n’t work .
11.7 Redisplay
Command : allpartial state ( none )
If set to on , only the current cursor line is refreshed on window change .
This affects all windows and is useful for slow terminal lines .
The previous setting of full / partial refresh for each window is restored with allpartial off .
This is a global flag that immediately takes effect on all windows overriding the partial settings .
It does not change the default redraw behavior of newly created windows .
Command : altscreen state ( none )
If set to on , " alternate screen " support is enabled in virtual terminals , just like in xterm .
Initial setting is ‘ off ’.
Command : partial state ( none )
Defines whether the display should be refreshed ( as with redisplay ) after switching to the current window .
This command only affects the current window .
To immediately affect all windows use the allpartial command .
Default is ‘ off ’ , of course .
This default is fixed , as there is currently no defpartial command .
Command : redisplay ( C - a l , C - a C-l )
Redisplay the current window .
Needed to get a full redisplay in partial redraw mode .
11.8 Wrap
Command : wrap [ on | off ] ( C - a r , C- a C-r )
Sets the line - wrap setting for the current window .
When line - wrap is on , the second consecutive printable character output at the last column of a line will wrap to the start of the following line .
As an added feature , backspace ( ^H ) will also wrap through the left margin to the previous line .
Default is ‘ on ’.
Without any options , the state of wrap is toggled .
Command : defwrap state ( none )
Same as the wrap command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initially line - wrap is on and can be toggled with the wrap command ( C - a r ) or by means of " C - a : wrap on|off " .
11.9 Reset
Command : reset ( C-a Z )
Reset the virtual terminal to its “ power - on ” values .
Useful when strange settings ( like scroll regions or graphics character set ) are left over from an application .
11.10 Window Size
Command : width [ - w | -d ] [ cols [ lines ] ] ( C-a W )
Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns , or set it to cols columns if an argument is specified .
This requires a capable terminal and the termcap entries ‘ Z0 ’ and ‘ Z1 ’.
See the termcap command ( see Termcap ) , for more information .
You can also specify a height if you want to change both values .
The -w option tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window size , -d vice versa .
Command : height [ - w | -d ] [ lines [ cols ] ] ( none )
Set the display height to a specified number of lines .
When no argument is given it toggles between 24 and 42 lines display .
11.11 Character Processing
Command : c1 [ state ] ( none )
Change c1 code processing .
‘ c1 on ’ tells screen to treat the input characters between 128 and 159 as control functions .
Such an 8 - bit code is normally the same as ESC followed by the corresponding 7 - bit code .
The default setting is to process c1 codes and can be changed with the ‘ defc1 ’ command .
Users with fonts that have usable characters in the c1 positions may want to turn this off .
Command : gr [ state ] ( none )
Turn GR charset switching on / off .
Whenever screen sees an input char with an 8th bit set , it will use the charset stored in the GR slot and print the character with the 8th bit stripped .
The default ( see also ‘ defgr ’) is not to process GR switching because otherwise the ISO88591 charset would not work .
Command : bce [ state ] ( none )
Change background - color - erase setting .
If ‘ bce ’ is set to on , all characters cleared by an erase / insert / scroll / clear operation will be displayed in the current background color .
Otherwise the default background color is used .
Command : encoding enc [ denc ] ( none )
Tell screen how to interpret the input / output .
The first argument sets the encoding of the current window .
Each window can emulate a different encoding .
The optional second parameter overwrites the encoding of the connected terminal .
It should never be needed as screen uses the locale setting to detect the encoding .
There is also a way to select a terminal encoding depending on the terminal type by using the ‘ KJ ’ termcap entry .
See Special Capabilities .
Supported encodings are eucJP , SJIS , eucKR , eucCN , Big5 , GBK , KOI8 - R , CP1251 , UTF - 8 , ISO8859 - 2 , ISO8859-3 , ISO8859 - 4 , ISO8859 - 5 , ISO8859-6 , ISO8859 - 7 , ISO8859 - 8 , ISO8859 - 9 , ISO8859 - 10 , ISO8859 - 15 , jis .
See also ‘ defencoding ’ , which changes the default setting of a new window .
Command : charset set ( none )
Change the current character set slot designation and charset mapping .
The first four character of set are treated as charset designators while the fifth and sixth character must be in range ‘ 0 ’ to ‘ 3 ’ and set the GL / GR charset mapping .
On every position a ‘ . ’ may be used to indicate that the corresponding charset / mapping should not be changed ( set is padded to six characters internally by appending ‘ . ’ chars ) .
New windows have ‘ BBBB02 ’ as default charset , unless a ‘ encoding ’ command is active .
The current setting can be viewed with the Info command .
Command : utf8 [ state [ dstate ] ] ( none )
Change the encoding used in the current window .
If utf8 is enabled , the strings sent to the window will be UTF - 8 encoded and vice versa .
Omitting the parameter toggles the setting .
If a second parameter is given , the display ’s encoding is also changed ( this should rather be done with screen ’s ‘ - U ’ option ) .
See also ‘ defutf8 ’ , which changes the default setting of a new window .
Command : defc1 state ( none )
Same as the ‘ c1 ’ command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is ‘ on ’.
Command : defgr state ( none )
Same as the ‘ gr ’ command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is ‘ off ’.
Command : defbce state ( none )
Same as the ‘ bce ’ command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is ‘ off ’.
Command : defencoding enc ( none )
Same as the ‘ encoding ’ command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is the encoding taken from the terminal .
Command : defcharset [ set ] ( none )
Like the ‘ charset ’ command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Shows current default if called without argument .
Command : defutf8 state ( none )
Same as the ‘ utf8 ’ command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Initial setting is on if screen was started with ‘ - U ’ , otherwise off .
Command : cjkwidth [ state ] ( none )
Toggle how ambiguoous characters are treated .
If cjkwidth is on screen interprets them as double ( full ) width characters .
If off then they are seen as one cell ( half ) width characters .
12 Copy and Paste
For those confined to a hardware terminal , these commands provide a cut and paste facility more powerful than those provided by most windowing systems .
• Copy : Copy from scrollback to buffer • Paste : Paste from buffer into window • Registers : Longer - term storage • Screen Exchange : Sharing data between screen users • History : Recalling previous input
12.1 Copying
Command : copy ( C - a [ , C- a C -[ , C-a ESC )
Enter copy / scrollback mode .
This allows you to copy text from the current window and its history into the paste buffer .
In this mode a vi - like full screen editor is active , with controls as outlined below .
• Line Termination : End copied lines with CR / LF • Scrollback :
Set the size of the scrollback buffer • Copy Mode Keys : Remap keys in copy mode • Movement : Move around in the scrollback buffer • Marking : Select the text you want • Repeat count : Repeat a command • Searching : Find the text you want •
Specials :
Other random keys
12.1.1 CR/LF
Command : crlf [ state ] ( none )
This affects the copying of text regions with the copy command .
If it is set to ‘ on ’ , lines will be separated by the two character sequence ‘ CR ’/‘ LF ’.
Otherwise only ‘ LF ’ is used .
crlf is off by default .
When no parameter is given , the state is toggled .
12.1.2 Scrollback
To access and use the contents in the scrollback buffer , use the copy command .
See Copy .
Command : defscrollback num ( none )
Same as the scrollback command except that the default setting for new windows is changed .
Defaults to 100 .
Command : scrollback num ( none )
Set the size of the scrollback buffer for the current window to num lines .
The default scrollback is 100 lines .
Use info to view the current setting .
Command : compacthist [ state ] ( none )
This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank lines when scrolling up text into the history buffer .
Turn compacting ‘ on ’ to hold more useful lines in your scrollback buffer .
12.1.3 Markkeys
Command : markkeys string ( none )
This is a method of changing the keymap used for copy / history mode .
The string is made up of oldchar = newchar pairs which are separated by ‘ : ’.
Example :
The command markkeys h= ^B:l=^F:$=^E would set some keys to be more familiar to emacs users .
If your terminal sends characters , that cause you to abort copy mode , then this command may help by binding these characters to do nothing .
The no -op character is ‘ @ ’ and is used like this : markkeys @=L=H if you do not want to use the ‘ H ’ or ‘ L ’ commands any longer .
As shown in this example , multiple keys can be assigned to one function in a single statement .
12.1.4 Movement Keys
h , C-h , or left arrow move the cursor left .
j , C-n , or down arrow move the cursor down .
k , C-p , or up arrow move the cursor up .
l ( ’el ’ ) , or right arrow move the cursor right .
0 ( zero ) or C - a move to the leftmost column .
+ and - move the cursor to the leftmost column of the next or previous line .
H , M and L move the cursor to the leftmost column of the top , center or bottom line of the window .
| moves to the specified absolute column .
g or home moves to the beginning of the buffer .
G or end moves to the specified absolute line ( default : end of buffer ) .
% jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer .
^ or $ move to the first or last non-whitespace character on the line .
w , b , and e move the cursor word by word .
B , E move the cursor WORD by WORD ( as in vi ) .
f / F , t / T move the cursor forward / backward to the next occurence of the target .
( eg , ’ 3 fy ’ will move the cursor to the 3rd ’y ’ to the right . )
; and , Repeat the last f/F/t/T command in the same / opposite direction .
C-e and C-y scroll the display up / down by one line while preserving the cursor position .
C-u and C -d scroll the display up / down by the specified amount of lines while preserving the cursor position .
( Default : half screenful ) .
C-b and C -f move the cursor up / down a full screen .
Note that Emacs - style movement keys can be specified by a . screenrc command .
( markkeys " h= ^B:l=^F:$=^E " )
There is no simple method for a full emacs - style keymap , however , as this involves multi-character codes .
12.1.5 Marking
The copy range is specified by setting two marks .
The text between these marks will be highlighted .
Press :
space or enter to set the first or second mark respectively .
If mousetrack is set to on , marks can also be set using left mouse click .
Y and y can be used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of line .
W marks exactly one word .
12.1.6 Repeat Count
Any command in copy mode can be prefixed with a number ( by pressing digits 0… 9 ) which is taken as a repeat count .
Example :
C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y
will copy lines 11 to 15 into the paste buffer .
12.1.7 Searching
/ vi - like search forward .
? vi - like search backward .
C -a s emacs style incremental search forward .
C-r emacs style reverse i-search .
Command : ignorecase [ on|off ] ( none )
Tell screen to ignore the case of characters in searches .
Default is off .
Without any options , the state of ignorecase is toggled .
n Repeat search in forward direction .
N Repeat search in backward direction .
12.1.8 Specials
There are , however , some keys that act differently here from in vi .
Vi does not allow to yank rectangular blocks of text , but screen does .
Press :
c or C to set the left or right margin respectively .
If no repeat count is given , both default to the current cursor position .
Example :
Try this on a rather full text screen :
C-a [ M 20 l SPACE c 10 l 5 j C SPACE .
This moves one to the middle line of the screen , moves in 20 columns left , marks the beginning of the paste buffer , sets the left column , moves 5 columns down , sets the right column , and then marks the end of the paste buffer .
Now try :
C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE
and notice the difference in the amount of text copied .
J joins lines .
It toggles between 4 modes : lines separated by a newline character ( 012 ) , lines glued seamless , lines separated by a single space or comma separated lines .
Note that you can prepend the newline character with a carriage return character , by issuing a set crlf on .
v or V is for all the vi users who use : set numbers - it toggles the left margin between column 9 and 1 .
a before the final space key turns on append mode .
Thus the contents of the paste buffer will not be overwritten , but appended to .
A turns on append mode and sets a ( second ) mark .
> sets the ( second ) mark and writes the contents of the paste buffer to the screen - exchange file ( / tmp/screen - exchange per default ) once copy - mode is finished .
See Screen Exchange .
This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback buffer to that file :
C-a [ g SPACE G $ > .
C -g gives information about the current line and column .
x or o ( ’ oh ’ ) exchanges the first mark and the current cursor position .
You can use this to adjust an already placed mark .
C-l ( ’el ’ ) will redraw the screen .
@ does nothing .
Absolutely nothing .
Does not even exit copy mode .
All keys not described here exit copy mode .
12.2 Paste
Command : paste [ registers [ destination ] ] ( C- a ] , C-a C- ] )
Write the ( concatenated ) contents of the specified registers to the stdin stream of the current window .
The register ‘ . ’ is treated as the paste buffer .
If no parameter is specified the user is prompted to enter a single register .
The paste buffer can be filled with the copy , history and readbuf commands .
Other registers can be filled with the register , readreg and paste commands .
If paste is called with a second argument , the contents of the specified registers is pasted into the named destination register rather than the window .
If ‘ . ’ is used as the second argument , the display ’s paste buffer is the destination .
Note , that paste uses a wide variety of resources : Usually both , a current window and a current display are required .
But whenever a second argument is specified no current window is needed .
When the source specification only contains registers ( not the paste buffer ) then there need not be a current display ( terminal attached ) , as the registers are a global resource .
The paste buffer exists once for every user .
Command : stuff [ string ] ( none )
Stuff the string string in the input buffer of the current window .
This is like the paste command , but with much less overhead .
Without a paramter , screen will prompt for a string to stuff .
You can not paste large buffers with the stuff command .
It is most useful for key bindings .
See Bindkey .
Command : pastefont [ state ]
Tell screen to include font information in the paste buffer .
The default is not to do so .
This command is especially useful for multi character fonts like kanji .
Command : slowpaste msec Command : defslowpaste msec ( none )
Define the speed text is inserted in the current window by the paste command .
If the slowpaste value is nonzero text is written character by character .
screen will pause for msec milliseconds after each write to allow the application to process the input .
only use slowpaste if your underlying system exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of text .
defslowpaste specifies the default for new windows .
Command : readreg [ - e encoding ] [ register [ filename ] ] ( none )
Does one of two things , dependent on number of arguments : with zero or one arguments it it duplicates the paste buffer contents into the register specified or entered at the prompt .
With two arguments it reads the contents of the named file into the register , just as readbuf reads the screen - exchange file into the paste buffer .
You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the -e option .
The following example will paste the system ’s password file into the screen window ( using register p , where a copy remains ) : C- a : readreg p /etc / passwd C-a : paste p
12.3 Registers
Command : copy_reg [ key ] ( none )
Removed .
Use readreg instead .
Command : ins_reg [ key ] ( none )
Removed .
Use paste instead .
Command : process [ key ] ( none )
Stuff the contents of the specified register into the screen input queue .
If no argument is given you are prompted for a register name .
The text is parsed as if it had been typed in from the user ’s keyboard .
This command can be used to bind multiple actions to a single key .
Command : register [ - e encoding ] key string ( none )
Save the specified string to the register key .
The encoding of the strin

— Weinberg ’s Second Law
Recently , AppleInsider has been provided with a bit more clarity on Apple 's pre-release build cycles for Snow Leopard in addition to being tipped off to several Pro application updates currently undergoing beta tests .
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard
According to people familiar with the matter , Apple 's roadmap for the final stretch of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard development currently calls for the release of three ' key ' builds through the company 's high - membership Apple Developer Connection .
Each of the builds will carry a significance in its own right , the first of which is scheduled to appear between now and the start of WWDC 2009 during the second week of June .
This build will reportedly include " big updates " to system components and functionality .
The next build is said to arrive alongside the start of WWDC on June 8th .
It 's expected to be the first build of the next - gen OS that will be " feature complete , " bundling significant changes to the Mac OS X interface , assuming those changes are not approved for inclusion in the aforementioned build .
A third and final build is tentatively scheduled to make its way to developers in the weeks between WWDC and the software 's formal release .
This build is expected to serve as a lead - in to the final candidate stage that precedes the declaration of a Gold Master build suited for duplication on optical media .
People familiar with the matter have previously estimate that it will take Apple upwards of two - months from the time it shows off a feature complete Snow Leopard at WWDC to deliver the software to market , suggesting a release date around August .
Apple may also choose to seed more marginal builds intermittently between these key builds if it runs into unexpected issues and requires additional feedback from developers .
Mac OS X 10.5.7 Juno
Meanwhile , Mac OS X 10.5.7 remains on track for a release sometime during the month of April .
The release , code - named Juno , will be the seventh maintenance and security update to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard since its release in October 2007 .
It will also be one of the last updates to Leopard with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard rapidly approaching .
Developers have been receiving new builds of Juno on a weekly basis , usually on Thursday or Friday evenings .
The latest , which arrived this weekend , was labeled Mac OS X 10.5.7 build 9J39 .
It bundled five new fixes , bringing the total number of documented code corrections expected in the release to 99 .
Amongst the areas addressed in build 9J39 were issues with iChat encryption , Mail signatures , USB drivers , and System Profiler 's ability to properly show information on Mini DisplayPort adapters .
Pro App updates
Also under evaluation by developers and a select group of creative professionals are several Pro Application updates that are nearing a public release .
Among them is a new version of Apple 's ProRes Codec for its high - definition lossy video compression format and a significant update to the company 's professional color grading software application labeled Color 1.5 .
Novell developer Aaron Bockover has created a clever Firefox plugin that uses Moonlight to play conventional Windows media streaming video content at websites like C - SPAN .
The plugin takes advantage of the video codecs that Microsoft provides for Moonlight , Novell 's open source implementation of Microsoft 's Silverlight rich Internet application framework .
Moonlight 1.0 , which was officially released Wednesday , automatically downloads a proprietary codec pack from Microsoft in order to provide Linux users with legally licensed support for Microsoft 's video formats .
Bockover 's plugin uses the NPAPI to register itself as the default consumer of Windows Media content and then , when it is invoked by the browser , uses Moonlight to embed a Silverlight - based streaming video player — which he wrote entirely in XAML and JavaScript — in the page to handle WMV .
Linux users typically rely on embedded Totem or MPlayer plugins to view streaming WMV content in the browser .
This can be problematic , because it requires the user to obtain the Microsoft codecs on their own , by buying them commercially from Fluendo or using unlicensed codecs obtained from servers outside of the United States .
Moonshine eliminates that complexity and legal ambiguity by allowing users to watch WMV content with fully licensed codecs that are obtained directly from Microsoft with an automatic updater .
" Moonshine provides an NPAPI plugin that advertises it supports Windows Media to Firefox .
When Firefox comes across said media , it loads the Moonshine plugin .
Moonshine in turn loads Moonlight , and proxies NPAPI calls directly to Moonlight , " Bockover explains in a blog entry .
" Moonshine then injects the Silverlight JavaScript into the browser , and binds it to the Moonlight plugin instance .
From the browser perspective , it 's Windows Media , but the real stuff under the hood is just pure unadulterated Moonlight , driving a standard Silverlight application . "
Like Moonlight , the Moonshine plugin is deployed as a Firefox extension that can be installed directly through the browser .
After it is installed , WMV streams work out of the box on C - SPAN and other sites .
The embedded player has a standard user interface with a volume control , full - screen playback support , and a tracking slider that shows playback progress and can be used to jump to a specific part of videos .
In addition to providing the browser plugin , Bockover has also released a desktop application that operates on the same principle .
The desktop application leverages XULRunner and loads a Moonlight canvas into an HTML block within the XUL user interface .
In order to use the desktop application , you have to compile the plugin from source .
I had no difficulty getting it to work on my desktop computer with openSUSE 11.1 after I installed the mozilla - xulrunner 190 - devel package .
The Moonshine desktop application is particularly intriguing because it demonstrates the potential of mixing XUL and Silverlight content .
Another interesting aspect of the Moonshine project is MTK , a very lightweight widget toolkit modeled after GTK + that Bockover assembled to build the user interface for the media player .
It is written in JavaScript and generates XAML code .
Silverlight 2.0 introduces its own widgets , so MTK will not likely be used for the next major iteration of Moonshine , but Bockover believes that MTK could be repurposed and used to build an SVG widget toolkit that might be useful for rich Web application development with JavaScript and SVG .
Moonshine is a very practical and inventive use of Moonlight and it demonstrates the power and versatility of the Moonlight stack .
It 's a big improvement over struggling with embedded Totem and MPlayer plugins .

Conspiracy theories are running rampant in the absence of a clear explanation of why Symantec deleted threads expressing concern about a file called pifts .
exe from its Norton support forums .
Many users running Norton Internet Protection began seeing a popup warning on Monday that a file called PIFTS .
exe on their systems was trying to access the internet .
The location of the file was given as a non-existent folder buried inside the Symantec LiveUpdate folder .
The appearance of a file in a non-existent folder suggests rootkit - like behaviour .
PIFTS .exe attempts to contact a server in Africa , which has been traced to Symantec .
Concerned punters started posting on Norton 's support forums , asking what was going on .
That 's all normal enough , but then discussions on the subject were deleted without explanation from Norton 's community pages .
Follow - up threads mentioning the issue were deleted even more quickly .
Users unable to comment about the issue on Norton 's community pages moved onto ZoneAlarm 's forums instead .
Meanwhile , numerous blog postings ( example here ) referred to the issue , some touting conflicting conspiracy theories .
4 chan 's bulletin board had a field day , and talk of the issue even prompted a popular urban myths site to set up a holding page .
Theories about law enforcement backdoors ran rampant pending a response from Symantec clearing up the issue .
Some solid evidence also emerged .
The PIFTS . exe file has been submitted to VirusTotal numerous times , from which we only learn no vendor has defined it as malign .
Submission to ThreatExpert suggests that the file phones home to Symantec ( specifically stats.norton.com ) .
Symantec UK told us it was looking into the issue .
The reliable Internet Storm Centre reports that Symantec told it the program is part of the Norton update process and is benign .
This fails to explain why support forum postings were deleted , a type of behaviour that might be cited as evidence that Symantec has something to hide .
It also does n't explain why the file reportedly appears in a non-existent folder . ®
Meanwhile , MySpace 's monthly traffic has been moving in a downward trajectory , with usage down 21 per cent compared with December 2007 .
In Britain , the BBC reports , Facebook has 17 million users or three times as many as MySpace .
Globally , ComScore released figures late last month showing 222 million people visited Facebook in December , versus 125 million for MySpace .
Rupert Murdoch , chief executive of News Corp , which owns MySpace , will surely be eating his words now after last year dismissing Facebook as the " flavour of the month " and little more than a directory .
MySpace spokesman Darain Faraz refused to comment on the figures .
In a blog post marking Facebook 's fifth birthday , founder Mark Zuckerberg , 24 , said he was " humbled " that so many people were using the site to " engage and understand the world around them " .
" The culture of the internet has also changed pretty dramatically over the past five years , " he said .
" Before , most people would n't consider sharing their real identities online .
But Facebook has offered a safe and trusted environment for people to interact online , which has made millions of people comfortable expressing more about themselves . "
To say thanks , Facebook , through its Gift Shop , is offering users a free " Thank You " gift card , which can be passed on to friends and appears on their profile page .
Usually , members are able to buy gifts to place on their friends ' profile pages including birthday cakes , drinks and flowers .
Facebook also published a series of images showing the evolution of profile page designs from 2004 to today .
It revealed that the average user had 120 friends on the site and more than 850 million photos were uploaded each month .
Every day , 15 million users update their status to tell their friends what they are up to .
The challenge now for Facebook is to convert that momentum and its 150 million global active users into revenue .
Last year , it generated only an estimated $ US300 million in revenue , while MySpace , which has diversified into more of an entertainment site , was expected to book close to $ US1 billion .
MySpace has loaded the site up with ads while Facebook has taken a more cautious approach out of fear it might annoy users , who are suspicious of marketing messages being placed in between their communications with friends .
Facebook users in particular have been reluctant to accept new forms of highly lucrative , targeted advertising based on personal information provided to the site as this is seen as an invasion of privacy .
Another problem with trying to earn money from social networks is that brands can advertise on the site for free by creating applications , starting up their own pages and running competitions .
For instance , Burger King recently offered a free Whopper to people who deleted 10 friends in what it dubbed a " Whopper sacrifice " promotion , but Facebook did not earn a cent .
02/21/2009 , Governador Valadares , MG , Brazil -
The relatives of Alexandre Figueiras are accusing the police of beating him to death in the emergency wing of the city hospital .
Earlier , he was found injured after trying to jump across the roofs of two houses , falling .
The residents held Alexandre until the police handcuffed and took him to the hospital .
He looked very disturbed , the residents said .
In the January shootings , each side has advocates and detractors .
The account of Mr. Sharma , the police superintendent , is corroborated by police officers involved in the raid and conservative politicians .
Mr. Deva ’s account is corroborated by those who escaped with him , by villagers who say they witnessed police officers wearing fatigues and carrying automatic weapons sweeping through their homes that day , and by parents in the village who described their children being led away .
Dr. Ajay Sahni , director of the Institute for Conflict Management , in New Delhi , listens to these testimonials with a skeptical ear .
The villagers live in an area almost completely under the Maoists ’ thumb , he said , and “ no villager in the area will go willingly against ” the rebel line .
Indeed , villagers familiar with the victims say that at least some had been members of the rebel militia , but were not in the hard - core cadre .
They organized meetings , collected protection money and kept track of who was working with the police .
Turning to the police , Dr. Sahni said the Jan. 8 deaths reflected a hard - line approach to counterterrorism that is “ neither clear , nor hold , nor build . ”
The security forces , he said , “ are trapped in the ‘ Rambo ’ model , thinking that well - trained and well - equipped troops will go in and beat up everyone and solve the problem . ”
The police and politicians , for their part , begin their discussion with an estimate that Naxalites control up to 90 percent of the area for which Mr. Sharma is responsible .
Mr. Sharma says he has lost 60 police officers in the past year fighting Naxalites , and that it is “ absolutely a fake allegation ” that his officers killed defenseless people .
Mr. Sharma was sent from New Delhi and holds a master ’s degree from Jawaharlal Nehru University , but he cannot speak the local language and , more important , is not in an agency that can offer development aid .
So the challenge for him is to work on security , pure and simple .
“ More policemen are dying than Naxalites , ” he said , “ and that has to reverse .
We need to hit them , and hard .
The ideal attrition rate is 4 to 1 .
This is crude , but we are working in a crude situation . ”
Mr. Sharma says he needs at least 1,000 additional trained police officers and stronger laws .
Police stations here operate as if under siege , behind concentric circles of razor wire .
One of the few facts on which the police and villagers agree is that India ’s government has virtually no other presence here .
“ We want development , ” says Karam Malla Patel , the chief of Singaram village .
“ We want electricity but we do n’t know what to do about it .
The people in this village here have never seen the city . ”
NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit drove 22.7 meters ( 74 feet ) toward the southwest on the 1,861st Martian day , or sol , of Spirit 's mission on Mars ( March 28 , 2009 ) .
After the drive , the rover took this image with its front hazard - avoidance camera , looking back at the tracks from the drive .
As usual since losing the use of its right - front wheel in 2006 , Spirit drove backwards .
The immobile right - front wheel churned up a long stripe of bright soil during this drive .
Where Spirit has found such bright soil in the past , subsequent analysis of the composition found concentrations of sulfur or silica that testified to past action of water at the site .
When members of the rover team saw the large quantity of bright soil exposed by the Sol 1861 drive , they quickly laid plans to investigate the composition with Spirit 's alpha particle X - ray spectrometer .
The Sol 1861 drive took the rover past the northwest corner of the low plateau called " Home Plate , " making progress on a route around the western side of Home Plate .
The edge of Home Plate forms the horizon on the right side of this image .
Husband Hill is on the horizon on the left side .
For scale , the parallel rover wheel tracks are about 1 meter ( 40 inches ) apart .
The rover 's hazard - avoidance cameras take " fisheye " wide - angle images .
NASA Dryden Flight Research Center Aerodynamic Vehicle Design and Martek Biosciences Microalgae Food Supplements to be Honored at 25th National Space
Press Release From : Space Foundation
Posted : Thursday , March 12 , 2009
Colorado Springs , Colo . ( March 11 , 2009 )
A more efficient truck cab design and an algae - based food supplement will be inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame ( R ) April 2 at the 25th National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs , Colo .
An aerodynamic fairing concept originally developed for spaceflight was modified by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center to reduce drag on large trucks to improve fuel efficiency and handling .
Microalgae studied for use as a food supply , oxygen source and waste disposal catalyst on long - duration interplanetary space missions is the basis for a life - saving food supplement created by Martek Biosciences that is now found in nearly all U.S. infant formulas and in infant formulas in more than 75 other countries .
The Space Technology Hall of Fame( R ) was created in 1988 by the Space Foundation , in cooperation with NASA , to increase public awareness of the benefits resulting from space exploration programs and to encourage further innovation .
To date , the Space Foundation has inducted 59 technologies as well as honoring the organizations and individuals who transformed space technology into commercial products that improve the quality of life for all humanity .
The two technologies being honored this year were selected by a prestigious panel of judges representing the National Security Space Office , NASA , the state of Colorado , and former Space Technology Hall of Fame inductees .
Dryden and Martek will be recognized at the Space Technology Hall of Fame Dinner , the capstone event of the 25th National Space Symposium .
The premier annual gathering of the global space community , the symposium will take place March 30 - April 2 at The Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs .
About Dryden 's Aerodynamic Vehicle Design
Large objects moving at high speeds ' push ' huge quantities of air out of the way , creating high - pressure zones .
When the compressed air tries to negotiate an abrupt turn at the back of the vehicle , it creates a low - pressure zone , resulting in significant aerodynamic " drag " and decreased fuel efficiency .
Aerospace Engineer Edwin J. Saltzman and his team of engineers at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center applied what they had learned studying this effect on space shuttle and aircraft designs to improving truck design .
They found that rounding the vehicle 's edges , placing a smooth fairing on its roof , and extending the sides back to the trailer could cut drag by more than 50 percent and increase highway fuel economy by more than 20 percent .
Assuming a typical truck drives 100,000 miles annually , these modifications translate to fuel savings of more than 6,000 gallons per year per vehicle .
The modifications they tested at Dryden have now been widely adopted around the world .
About Martek Microalgae Food Supplements
Millions of infants and adults around the world benefit from technology that began in the 1980s with the NASA Ames Research Center exploring the use of microalgae as a nutrition source for long - duration space flights .
Martek Biosciences , a research and development organization that grew out of that early NASA work , discovered that the crypthecodinium cohnii algae produces high levels of DHA omega - 3 fatty acid ( docosahexaenoic acid ) , and a fungus ( Mortierella alpine ) that yields ARA ( arachidonic acid ) , another essential fatty acid .
Important to healthy infant development , these essential fatty acids occur naturally in human breast milk , but were not found in infant formulas at the time .
To address this deficiency , Martek developed Formulaid , an algae - based baby formula supplement that is particularly vital for premature and low - birth - weight infants and is now consumed by more than 33 million babies worldwide .
These vital nutrients are now marketed in the form of life ' sDHA ( TM ) and life ' sARA ( TM ) .
They are available in supplement form and are found in a range of products for people of all ages .
Martek and the National Institutes of Health continue to study the potential benefits of DHA for improved cognitive function and reduced risk of diseases including Alzheimer's .
About the Induction
The Space Foundation is also honoring nine individuals within the inductee organizations whose contributions made these innovative , life - improving technologies a reality .
The Space Technology Hall of Fame ( R ) honorees will be recognized in a private induction ceremony and at the Space Technology Hall of Fame ( R ) dinner , which will feature Bill Nye The Science Guy ( R ) .
A complete list of all Space Technology Hall of Fame inducted technologies , organizations , and individuals can be found online at www.SpaceTechHallofFame.org.

Nevadans wait in line last month in Las Vegas after an amnesty is offered on unpaid traffic tickets .
Cash - strapped states and local governments are trying to lure in overdue fines and taxes by offering scofflaws amnesty and threatening a dose of public humiliation .
At least six states — Connecticut , Massachusetts , Virginia , Alabama , Nevada and Oklahoma — have offered to waive or reduce penalties , interest or fees on delinquent taxes .
Louisiana and New Jersey are considering the idea .
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm , a Democrat , wants to " cyber - shame " tax deadbeats by posting their names on a state website .
She needs legislators ' approval .
Nevada 's state controller , Democrat Kim Wallin , wants an online " wall of shame " and proposes barring tax dodgers from registering cars until they pay up .
The Legislature is considering the plan .
" If everybody pays their fair share , we may not have to raise taxes on those who do pay their taxes , " Wallin says .
Nevada has a $ 981 million shortfall in its current $ 5.8 billion budget , Wallin says .
Amnesty is happening more often because states and cities are desperate to close budget holes , says Verenda Smith of the Federation of Tax Administrators .
Tax collectors do n't like it , she says , because it encourages people not to pay on time and irritates responsible taxpayers who do n't like to see scofflaws get a pass .
Some communities turn to deadbeat drivers for revenue .
Brookhaven , N.Y. , and the Las Vegas Township Justice Court , which covers the Strip and unincorporated areas surrounding Las Vegas , offer amnesty on unpaid tickets .
Bert Waisanen , a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures , says officials like amnesty because it produces quick cash .
This year , he says , they may not collect as much because of the recession .
" If you do n't have it , will you pay it ? " Waisanen asks .
Tax amnesty in Oklahoma from September through November netted $ 115 million , $ 81 million more than expected , says Paula Ross , spokeswoman for the state Tax Commission .
The revenue helped the state avoid a shortfall this year , budget director Brandy Manek says .
The Las Vegas Township Justice Court collected $ 14 million from December through Feb. 13 , which will help Clark County close a $ 54 million shortfall this year , county spokesman Dan Kulin says .
Brookhaven on New York 's Long Island offers a 50 % reduction on outstanding parking tickets until May 15 .
The town expects to collect half of $ 1 million in unpaid tickets , says Councilwoman Jane Bonner , a Republican , who proposed the deal .
" It 's like a half - off sale , " Bonner says .
" We want the dollar , but we 're not getting the dollar .
Fifty cents is better than nothing . "

12 resources for getting a jump on HTML 5
~ 14 January 2009 ~
Recently I ’ve seen a considerable amount of press on blogs and such regarding HTML 5 , “ the 5th major revision of the core language of the World Wide Web ” ( W3C ) .
I have virtually no experience ( yet ) with HTML 5 , so as I jump on the bandwagon and begin familiarizing myself with it , I thought I ’d share some of the resources I ’m reading along the way .
So far from what I ’m learning , the consensus among several of these articles seems to be this :
The world is n’t ready for HTML 5 at large just yet , but we can begin preparing for it by using common , semantic selector names ( header , nav , section , etc. ) — or even new attribute names — derived from HTML 5 within our HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.x documents .
This is by no means an exhaustive list , just a start .
In each of these you ’ll find other resources to help you dig deeper .
Got any other resources ?
Please share .

The last time that we saw this vehicle , it was caught circulating the Nürburgring wearing a lot more camo than this example , and it 's widely believed to be a new crossover from Acura .
So far , Acura has n't actually given any public indication that this machine even exists or is planned .
Nonetheless , it 's wearing all the contemporary Acura styling cues and the Nürburgring pics clearly showed the shield grille through the camo .
This particular example was snapped by an alert AB reader while it was evidently conducting cold weather testing in Winnipeg Manitoba , Canada .
Judging by the reduced amount of camouflage on this unit , it 's probably getting close to a public launch , and we 're guessing that with its pronounced slope - back , it will have BMW 's controversial X6 and Infiniti's FX softroader squarely in its sights .
T hanks to Jeff for the awesome tip !

Editor 's note :
This report has been prepared in collaboration with the investigative journalism organization Propublica.org .
Michael and Michelle O'Neil say they tried to make good on their bad checks but were told it was too late .
DETROIT , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Michelle O'Neil and her husband Michael are young , scrambling to stay afloat financially and , by their own admission , not the best money managers .
Both acknowledge they wrote two bad checks , totaling about $ 200 , as they were moving from Florida to Michigan in late 2007 .
The bad checks , they say , were mistakes .
But nearly a year after they settled in a Detroit suburb , letters and phone calls followed from Florida .
" They told me they were part of the attorney general 's office , " Michelle O'Neil told CNN .
" And that was scary in the sense that I 've never had any legal problems .
I 'm a teacher . "
But the calls were n't coming from a state agency .
They were coming from a company hired by a Florida county prosecutor 's office to collect on bounced checks .
The firm -- American Corrective Counseling Services , or ACCS -- splits the money it collects with the prosecutor 's office .
But it also makes money from financial management courses that people who wrote the checks are required by law to attend at their own expense .
And the company 's contract with the prosecutor 's office states those classes are its " principal business activity . "
The $ 14 check Michael O'Neil wrote to a Florida drugstore ended up costing him $ 285 , including the $ 160 class fee .
O'Neil said he and his wife tried to make good on the checks with the merchants involved and pay any fees required .
But he said the companies told him it was too late -- they had turned the matter over to ACCS .
The couple had been in Michigan for 10 months before they got their first notice from the company , which warned that " the State Attorney will not discharge the report (s ) of criminal activity against you until all program requirements , including attending class , have been met . "
" They make you feel like a criminal , " Michael O'Neil told CNN .
" They try scare tactics , harassment and everything .
And you take a look and ask , ' Seriously , is the attorney general of Florida after me for a $ 14 bounced check ? ' "
The short answer is yes .
Prosecutors are outsourcing some of their bad - check collections to companies like ACCS .
But Jennifer Osborn , a California student who bounced a $ 92 check to her college bookstore , said the company 's money - management class was useless to her .
" It was boring .
It was pointless , " Osborn told CNN .
Congress changed federal law in 2006 to allow district attorneys ' offices to contract out bounced - check collections to private collection firms like ACCS .
Prosecutors hire them as part of pre-trial diversion programs aimed at keeping people like the O'Neils from going to court , and in Florida , educational courses are required parts of those programs .
But the practice has drawn criticism from the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen , which has filed lawsuits in three states to stop it .
Deepak Gupta , the group 's chief attorney in Washington , said companies like ACCS are effectively " renting out the prosecutor 's seal " to collect money on cases prosecutors would not otherwise pursue .
" ACCS does n't really care about these classes , about teaching people how to balance their checkbooks , " Gupta told CNN .
" It 's really about collecting their fees . "
ACCS , based in San Clemente , California , says it has contracts with prosecutors ' offices in 17 states .
In court papers , it says its actions are reviewed and authorized by local prosecutors , and calls its classes " remarkably successful . "
" Less than 2 percent of the persons who complete the course commit repeat bad check offenses , " it states .
In Los Angeles County , the largest prosecutor 's office with an ACCS contract , supervising attorneys say they have had no complaints about the firm .
Assistant District Attorney Sharon Matsumoto told CNN that the contract helped the county collect on 80,000 bad checks , bringing in $ 2 million in 2008 .
" This particular function is one that we can legally outsource to a company experienced in doing this , " Matsumoto said .
But another metropolitan prosecutor said he was wary of private debt collection firms acting on behalf of law enforcement .
" I did not favor the concept of having some office outside of the DA 's office that would make contact with the public , and those folks would not be employees of the district attorney 's office , " said Paul Howard , the district attorney for Fulton County , Georgia , which includes Atlanta .
" I felt that there should be a level of accountability that the program did not present . "
In lawsuits filed in California , Indiana and Florida , Public Citizen accuses ACCS of violating the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act by moving against people without establishing probable cause , as prosecutors would be required to do .
" In fact , in many cases , stores are sending these checks directly to ACCS , and ACCS is sending out collection letters with prosecutor letterhead , and no prosecutor has actually reviewed those cases , " Gupta told CNN .
But ACCS attorney Charles Jenkins said that probable cause " is already established because of what the prosecutor requires of the submitting merchant " -- namely , an affidavit stating that the check bounced , and efforts to obtain its money from either the purchaser or the bank had failed .
When the firm decides to send out its initial mailings , " it is already a matter for the local prosecutor , " Jenkins said .
And according to court records , the form letters have been approved by prosecutors .
The National District Attorneys Association lobbied Congress for the legislation that allowed such contracts , arguing that its members would be able to resolve bad - check cases more efficiently under the new law .
The measure was part of a lengthy 2006 bill overhauling financial regulations , which passed both houses of Congress unanimously .
" The way it had been represented to us is that it was a way to avoid criminal prosecution , " Rep. Barney Frank , now chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee , told CNN .
" So I would be surprised if someone were to be prosecuted for one check for a few dollars . "
Frank , D - Massachusetts , said the complaints raised by people with the collection process were " the first time this has been brought to my attention , " and he told CNN that perhaps the law needs " some looking into . "
ACCS recently filed for bankruptcy protection , a day before a federal judge in Florida was to hand down a ruling in one of the lawsuits filed against it .
In court papers , the company named the law firm it hired to defend itself as one of its largest creditors .
ACCS is still doing business , however .
As for the bad check writers , those interviewed by CNN say they had no criminal intent .
Their sin was poor math or bad money management .
" I am disappointed in the system , " Osborn told CNN .
" It should not have happened at all . "

Update : The Namespace utility function has been made explicit - only with feedback from Mark Seaborn .
Thanks Mark !
Guido van Rossum posted a blog article on Capabilities for Python .
As I 'd instigated this whole thread , I figure I should give everyone an update … ( along with a quick summary of the story so far ) .
The aim has been to enable object - capability in Python .
Python already supports doing the following — a port of the sample in Mark S. Miller 's Capability - based Financial Instruments :
def Mint ( name ) :
sealer , unsealer = makeBrandPair ( name )
def __str__ ( ) :
return " %s 's mint " % name
def Purse ( purse_name , balance ) :
this =
Attr ( balance = balance )
def decr ( amount ) :
if ( this .
balance - amount ) < 0 :
raise ValueError ( " Ca n't decrement balance below 0 . " )
this .
balance -= amount
def __str__ ( ) :
return " %s has %i %s bucks " % ( purse_name , this .
balance , name )
def getBalance ( ) :
return this .
balance
def sprout ( ) :
return Purse ( ' from %s :' % purse_name , 0 )
def getDecr ( ) :
return sealer .
seal ( decr )
def deposit ( amount , src ) :
unsealer .
unseal ( src . getDecr ( ) ) ( amount )
this .
balance += amount
return Namespace (
decr , __str__ , getBalance , sprout , getDecr , deposit
)
return Namespace ( __str__ , Purse )
Two utility functions are used to make life easier for developers :
Namespace returns an object which behaves similarly to “ standard ” class - based objects .
returns an object which behaves similarly to “ standard ” class - based objects .
Attr provides a utility object to get beyond scope limitations pre-Python 3.0
Using this functional approach , we can start our journey towards object capability in Python =)
First , we need to ensure that a user can't get hold of the global state somehow .
Whilst a lot of existing Python libraries use global state , there is nothing in the core language itself that requires this to be the case .
So we needed to identify the attributes of built - in types which “ leak ” global state , e.g .
FunctionType.func_globals
FrameType.f_locals
I issued a security challenge which helped identify a number of these and am following it up by doing a manual audit of the CPython implementation to further verify the “ final ” list of leak attributes .
[ If anyone wants to help , please get in touch — tav@espians.com ]
Assuming we do identify the full list — there are only so many builtin types and attributes in Python after all ! — we can start with a clean slate and do object - capability in Python .
I explain in detail in my earlier blog article on Securing the Python Interpreter .
The short of it is that this can be enabled today in about 100 odd lines of code by removing the “ leak ” variables using Python 's ctypes module — see safelite .py for a simple implementation .
And for contexts like App Engine , where ctypes is n't accessible , I provided a small patch for the interpreter itself .
The next problem is in making as much of the existing standard library accessible .
As Guido rightly points out in his blog article , most people are n't going to use a capability - secure subset of Python if it does n't offer any value !!
And given that no - one is going to volunteer to rewrite the entire standard library , I figured we could take a short cut by using minimal wrappers * wink * .
This would be great , but there 's been one last ( identified ) hurdle : some of Python 's builtins automatically call certain class - based protocols , e.g. __int__ , __iter__ , etc. for type coercion , iteration , etc .
And to make matters worse certain builtins like input evaluate in the calling scope !
But we can bypass this — unless someone tells me otherwise — by putting a type guard in front of our functions .
I 've written a guard decorator in the latest safelite .py to make this easier — let me know if it works for you .
We are using a functional approach anyhow , so the class - based protocols are meaningless .
Thus no real functionality should be lost .
It 'd just make wrapping the existing standard library much much easier .
And with that , the stage is hopefully set to herald a new future .
Here is the implementation of a file reader which wraps Python 's builtin open :
@guard ( filename = str , mode = str , buffering = int )
def FileReader ( filename , mode = ' r ' , buffering = 0 ) :
" " " A secure file reader . " " "
if mode not in [ ' r ' , 'rb ' , ' rU ' ] :
raise ValueError ( " Only read modes are allowed . " )
fileobj = open_file ( filename , mode , buffering )
def __repr__ ( ) :
return '< FileReader : %r >' % filename
def close ( ) :
fileobj . close ()
@guard ( bufsize = int )
def read ( bufsize =- 1 ) :
return fileobj .
read ( bufsize )
@guard ( size = int )
def readlines ( size =- 1 ) :
return fileobj .
readlines ( size )
@guard ( offset = int , whence = int )
def seek ( offset , whence = 0 ) :
fileobj .
seek ( offset , whence )
return Namespace ( __repr__ , close , read , readlines , seek )
Code which has a reference to FileReader would be able to read files but — assuming we 've identified all the leak attributes — never be able to get a reference to the “ real ” file_open which FileReader uses internally .
Code can pass on references to read ( ) to other code without exposing a reference to seek ( ) , etc .
The final key bit missing is a secure import .
For this , I 've been working on something called pimp which will allow for remote loading of code using object capability principles over HTTP in a manner similar to the Web Calculus .
And with that , this update has come to a close .
Do get in touch if any of this interests you and you 'd like to work together !
And , as always , let me know your thoughts in the comments below .
Thanks !
Asked if he thought Iraq was ready for tourists , Mr. Yacoub said , “ No . ” When he was asked if he believed Falluja was safe for tourists , his emphatic “ no ” was echoed by staff members and guests standing within earshot .
But there was no stopping Mr. Marchio .
For an extra $ 40 , the hotel gave him a tour of Baghdad sights , driving him along the riverfront , where he could photograph a statue of Scheherazade , the narrator of “ The Thousand and One Nights , ” and see children playing in a riverside garden .
He proceeded to the artificial lake near Baghdad University and then to the square named after Baghdad ’s founder , Abu Jaafar al - Mansur , on the west bank of the Tigris .
He went on to Zawra ’a Park , a family spot with a small zoo and rides .
He finished his day in the affluent but bomb - scarred shopping district of Karada , where his guide for the day , Ramez Fa’eq , 23 , said , “ When it became dark , he got afraid and wanted to return home to the hotel . ”
The next morning he set out for Falluja despite the hotel staff ’s efforts to dissuade him , insisting on taking a public bus to the city , 40 miles west of Baghdad .
Within hours , the hotel staff received a call from the Falluja police .
“ I was n’t surprised when they called , ” Mr. Yacoub said .
The police told him that they had found Mr. Marchio in a minibus next to a woman who sold fresh milk , yogurt and cream door to door .
“ They were very worried about him , ” Mr. Yacoub said .
For the eager Mr. Marchio , that was the end of his bel viaggio in Iraq .
The police summoned local Iraqi journalists to tell them of the wandering Italian , American marines were called in , the Italian Embassy was notified .
The police concluded that Mr. Marchio was not an Italian jihadist and was a risk to no one but himself .
An American marine working with the police suggested taking him to the city limits and dropping him where Falluja met the main highway .
“ I explained to him that it was not safe to move around , ” said Renato Di Porcia , the deputy chief of mission at the Italian Embassy in Baghdad .
“ He is a little bit naïve . ”
Update : This article was written in 2009 .
Back then , the advice below made sense , since getting a merchant account was necessary to be able to take payments online .
Today , this is no longer the case .
Skip the article below : just use GoCardless or Stripe .
Back to the article …
Getting a merchant account is a necessary step before you can take credit and debit card payments .
That ’s essential for the vast majority of Software - as - a - Service ( SaaS ) start - ups , and for many other kinds of business too .
Unless you ’ll be making all your money from advertising , you ’ll need to be able to take payments , and if you want to be able to do so efficiently , you need a merchant account .
Considering how many businesses there are out there , one would think this process might be smooth and painless by now .
Just apply for a merchant account , sign on the dotted line , and receive your merchant id in the mail a couple of weeks later .
Unfortunately , this is not the case .
Obtaining a merchant account can be a long and complex process , particularly if you ’re a new , small business that ’s going through this process for the first time .
I do n’t claim to be an expert on this process .
However , I ’ve gone through it a few times , and I know people who are very familiar with it , so I put together this guide to obtaining a merchant account , from the cash - strapped start - up ’s point of view .
Why do you need a merchant account ?
If you ’re building a typical SaaS business , you ’ll need a merchant account in order to process credit and debit card payments .
You could use Paypal , but some customers may feel you ’re less credible because you do n’t charge like everyone else .
You could use one of the gateways that do n’t require a merchant account , but typically they take fees of up to 10 % of the transaction amount .
As of the publication of this post , the standard , most cost - effective way to take payments for SaaS products is still merchant accounts , managed by a regular bank , and going through a payment gateway .
1 . When should you start this process ?
Getting a merchant account can take anything from a few days to more than six months ( if you make many mistakes ) .
If you ’re going through it for the first time , you may find yourself stuck at various points in the process .
These sticking points can result in massive delays .
You do n’t want to be sitting there with a business that has users who want to pay you , but ca n’t because you do n’t have a merchant account .
Unforeseen delays in this process can cost you dearly , and if you ’re going through this for the first time , there will probably be unforeseen delays .
On the other hand , there is little to no cost in obtaining a merchant account too early .
Until your first transaction , the account just waits , unused , costing you nothing .
Therefore , you should start this process as soon as possible — today , if you can .
Do n’t underestimate how long this might take .
Banks are often ridiculously slow in processing merchant account applications , when compared to the pace of the internet .
A small addendum to this advice : you need to have some sort of website ( even if it ’s just a placeholder ) up before you start the application process .
The bank will look at it .
But this needs not be the same website that you actually launch with .
2 . Apply to more than one bank
When you apply for a merchant account as a fresh new start - up , you ’re in a position of overwhelming inferiority .
The bank can dictate whatever terms they want to you , ask you for money up - front , impose ridiculous charges , etc .
There ’s a simple way around this : apply to several banks .
It takes more time and effort , but it gives you bargaining power .
Banks do n’t talk to each other much , so you can play them against each other .
If all the banks are demanding an up - front payment , you can tell each one that another bank that you ’ve applied to did n’t demand it .
Banks do want your business , especially if you ’ve conveyed the right impression , and so they ’ll be willing to negotiate terms if it looks like you ’re going to go somewhere else .
If you end up with more than one merchant account , so much the better .
Sometimes banks can act irrationally and freeze your merchant account ( particularly early on when you ’re still relatively tiny ) , at the first hint that maybe there could be fraud going on ( whether there really is or not ) .
Having another merchant account set up gives you the ability to minimise the damage by switching over to your backup account .
And , as I said earlier , unused merchant accounts do n’t cost much .
3. Exaggerate your volumes
When you ’re preparing your internal business plan , you should be conservative with your sales forecasts .
However , when you ’re talking to the bank , you should convince them that you will be a successful business that will bring them significant revenues .
This should n’t be too hard — after all , you are optimistic about your start - up ’s prospects , are n’t you ?
Do n’t lie .
You need to be able to justify those numbers .
However , if your internal , conservative goal is to get 500 sales a month by the end of the year , say you ’re looking at internal projections of 1500 to 2000 sales a month .
Be realistic , but optimistic .
Ideally , you want to convey a turnover that will soon rise above a million dollars , so that your account manager feels that it ’s worthwhile dealing with you and giving you a good deal .
Do n’t tell them that you ’re hoping for those numbers .
Tell them that those are the numbers you expect , based on current usage patterns .
Now is the time for unwarranted confidence and optimism , not for cautious realism .
Your projected volume will also influence how big a cut the bank asks for .
If your volumes are very small , they will want a comparatively large percentage of your transactions .
If you ’re planning to process a lot of transactions , on the other hand , they may be happy with a smaller cut .
Once your rates are negotiated , the bank is extremely unlikely to increase ( or decrease ) them if you fail to reach the volumes you predicted .
So make sure you get good rates from the start by being optimistic .
4 . Know your fraud - stuff
Banks still exist in a universe where “ online businesses ” are a scary new idea .
They often do n’t quite understand it , and they are scared to death of fraud .
Even though you are honest , some of your customers may not be .
Your account manager will need to convince her fraud department that you ’re not a great fraud risk .
In order to do this , you need to convince her that you know all about online fraud , and that your business has covered all the bases to prevent fraudulent activity .
You should make sure you know all about chargebacks , 3D - secure , and AVS / CV2 .
You should also think ahead and figure out how someone might attempt to defraud you .
This is harder because there is not all that much advice about how fraudulent individuals screw over businesses .
Most of the readily available advice focuses on helping consumers avoid fraudulent businesses , but many businesses go broke dealing with fraudulent customers .
It ’s important to think ahead to what you ’re going to do when ( not if ) someone uses a stolen card number on your service .
Do you pay commissions to affiliates ?
You ’re automatically a higher fraud risk .
Do you sell intangibles ( like a web service ) ?
People might call in chargebacks to get refunds .
Sell to businesses ?
You ’re a lower fraud risk , so make sure you highlight that .
Adult industry ?
Multi - level marketing ?
Other “ shady ” businesses ?
Chances are the bank will not even touch you .
It is important for your own business that you think about fraud ahead of time .
And it is extremely important for your merchant account process that you convey that you ’ve thought about fraud and have it covered .
Make the bank feel safe , or they ’ll delay your application forever .
5 . Be serious
The last thing any bank wants , understandably , is someone who ’s going to blunder their way through figuring out how to charge credit cards , making costly mistakes along the way , getting defrauded left and right , and finally going broke and winding down the business because they could n’t handle the complexity of it all .
As part of your discussions and emails with your account manager , you must convince him that you ’re serious , you know what you ’re doing and , ideally , that you have help from someone who ’s done it before , successfully .
If you do n’t have access to such a helper , find one .
Again , this should n’t be too hard — presumably you know other people who have started businesses before and they had to apply for a merchant account too .
Once you ’ve found that person , make sure your account manager is aware that you ’re not helpless .
Be serious about security too .
There are a lot of security regulations tied to internet transaction processing , and you want to be aware of them and convey that you are aware of them .
For example , it ’s probably a good thing to name - drop PCI - DSS in the conversation , and explain how you ’re compliant with it .
Finally , do convey that you ’re a serious business and you ’re going to succeed .
This is not the time to declare that you ’re a fresh new business and you do n’t have formal titles within the company , and do n’t care much for rigid formality .
This is the time to introduce yourself as the managing director and sound exactly like your stodgier competitors might .
6 . Read the fine print and negotiate the charges
Banks will often present you with complex charges that are hard to compare with the offers from other banks .
Unscrupulous ones may even use tricks like high termination fees that hit you when you least expect it .
Others may ask for high up - front fees , suggest they hold your money for 3 months , etc .
All those points are negotiable .
The extent to which you can negotiate is largely driven by how much they value your business ( see point 3 ) and by how many other offers you can choose from ( see point 2 ) .
None of the merchant accounts I ’ve been involved in have ended up having to pay an up - front fee , although the bank always asked for one .
Rates are an obvious one to compare , but do n’t forget to also negotiate how long the bank will hold your money before passing it to you ( many banks hold your payments in a separate account and pay your corporate account at the end of the month ) .
Anything more than 1 month should be considered unacceptable .
You should consider how important that is for your cash flow .
In conclusion …
Getting your first merchant account can be a real nightmare , but it does n’t need to be so .
Following these tips will maximise your chance of looking back at this process and thinking “ Heh , it was n’t so hard after all ” .
Doing the opposite of these tips can practically guarantee you ’ll never get a merchant account .
Here they are again :
Start the process early because it might take much longer than you think it should
because it might take much longer than you think it should Apply to several banks to give yourself leverage in negotiations
to give yourself leverage in negotiations Exaggerate your volumes ( realistically ) to obtain good terms and good attention
to obtain good terms and good attention Know all about fraud to make the bank feel safe about doing business with you
to make the bank feel safe about doing business with you Be serious to ensure the bank feels you ’re a trustworthy business
to ensure the bank feels you ’re a trustworthy business Read the fine print and negotiate the terms , as you may be able to get much better terms than initially offered
I hope these tips help others avoid some unnecessary headaches .

Many people struggle to improve their eating habits .
The Times food writer Mark Bittman , appearing this week on WNYC radio , told listeners about an unusual strategy that has worked for him .
All day long , he eats a vegan diet .
But after about 6 p.m. , anything goes .
In his newest book , “ Food Matters : A Guide to Conscious Eating With More Than 75 Recipes , ” Mark explains how increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and reducing dependence on processed foods will lead to better health not only for your body , but also for the planet .
He explained his “ vegan before dinnertime ” strategy recently on the Leonard Lopate show :
My arrangement with myself is that from the time I wake up until dinner I eat only fruits , vegetables , whole grains and legumes .
I do n’t even eat white bread during the day .
And then starting at dinner , I do .
I have one meal a day when I do pretty much what I want , which is normally quite indulgent .
Mark made the changes after developing high cholesterol , borderline high blood sugar , bad knees and sleep apnea , and realizing he was about 35 pounds overweight .
A doctor suggested he adopt a vegan diet , which means no animal products .
But for a food writer , Mark said , becoming a full - time vegan was both unrealistic and undesirable .
Instead , he came up with a compromise :
I decided to do this sort of “ vegan till 6 ” plan .
I did n’t have huge thoughts or plans about it .
I just thought it was worth a try .
Within three or four months , I lost 35 pounds , my blood sugar was normal , cholesterol levels were again normal … and my sleep apnea indeed went away .
All these good things happened , and it was n’t as if I was suffering so I stayed with it ….
I have not eliminated anything completely from my diet .
I have n’t had a Coke in a while , but I did n’t drink that much Coke to begin with .
Mark says he ’s not trying to promote a particular diet , but does want people to realize that a simple evaluation of your diet can lead to meaningful changes .
I want to make things as simple as possible .
This is consistent with everything I ’ve ever done .
I ’m the guy who says , “ Do n’t sweat it . ”
I ’m trying to once again say , “ Let ’s figure out how to do this cleanly and easily . ”
I would just encourage everyone to examine the portion in their own diet between processed foods and animal food and junk food on the one hand and plants on the other .
To the extent the first group is much heavier than the second group , I say make some adaptations to change that .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Housing might be in worse shape than we think .
There is probably even more excess housing inventory gumming up the market than current statistics indicate , thanks to a wave of foreclosures that has yet to hit the market .
The problem : Many foreclosed homes and other distressed properties that are now owned by banks have yet to be listed for sale .
The volume of this so - called ' ghost inventory ' could be substantial enough to depress already steeply falling prices when it does go on the market .
" That 's not good news , " said Pat Newport , an analyst with IHS Global Insight .
" [ Excess ] inventory is the biggest problem in housing these days , and it leads to lower housing prices , which leads to more foreclosures . "
RealtyTrac , the online marketer of foreclosed properties , recently discovered that it has far more foreclosed properties listed in its database , which the company compiles using courthouse records , than there are listed in the multiple listing services ( MLS ) maintained by real estate agents .
RealtyTrac looked at listings in four states , California , Maryland , Florida and Wisconsin , and found that they contained only a third of the foreclosures it has in its database .
The scope of the problem is n't clear , but it could be huge considering that RealtyTrac has a total of 1.5 million bank - owned properties on its site .
" Many properties that should be listed on the MLS are not listed on the MLS , " said Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) .
Underestimating inventory
The National Association of Realtors calculates official housing inventory statistics using data from the multiple listing services .
By that measure , there were 4.2 million existing homes for sale in November , an 11.2 - month supply at the current sales pace , up from a 10.3 - month supply in October .
But now it seems quite possible that these figures , which are already at record highs , are underestimating the situation .
And if that 's the case , it could take much longer for the housing market recovery than analysts currently expect .
Until supply can be brought down to a more normalized level of six to seven months , home prices will continue to come under pressure , according to Yun .
" It could be a worse problem than we think , " he said .
L.J. Jennings , a real estate broker with Pyramid Real Estate and Investments in Oakland , Calif. , sees plenty of evidence that it is .
" There are a number of properties in my area that have actually been taken back by the banks , but have not hit the market yet , " he said .
" Once a bank repossesses a property , in some cases , it can take more than six months to hit the market . "
He cites a handful of examples offhand , including a single - family home in Richmond seized in early October , a condo in San Ramon taken back the same month and a four - family building in Oakland that was repossessed in July .
" Either lenders are overwhelmed and can't get these properties back on sale quickly " said Realty Trac spokesman Rick Sharga , " or they 're deliberately slowing down . "
Why there 's a delay
The chief problem is probably system overload : Lenders are just not prepared to handle the sheer numbers of foreclosures that they have on their books .
Banks took back about 860,000 in 2008 - more than twice the number in 2007 - according to RealtyTrac .
Before the housing crisis hit , it took only about a month to get a bank - owned foreclosure on the market .
Lenders still insist they try to act as swiftly as possible .
According to Tom Kelly , a spokesman for Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) Mortgage , their goal is to cut their losses on these homes , which are expensive to maintain , as fast as possible .
But banks might hold back listings in areas where they already have lots of homes for sale in order to avoid flooding the market , according to Michael Youngblood , a financial analyst and founder of Five Bridges Capital , an asset management company .
" If lenders have a significant number of properties in a limited area , they may want to stagger putting them back on the market , " he said .
Eve Alexander , a real estate broker with Buyers Broker of Florida in Orlando , attributes the delays to the general malaise that 's overtaken the lending industry as it's imploded .
" I think banks are dragging their rears about doing just about everything , " she said .
" They have so much going on , and there 's so much red tape and the people do n't care , nothing gets done . "
There are also batches of bank - owned homes that do n't appear on the multiple listing services because lenders are trying to sell them via bulk and auction sales to investors as well as individuals , according to John Mechem , public affairs director for the Mortgage Bankers Association .
He adds that it 's also taking much longer to get many foreclosed homes in decent enough shape to put on the market .
( see This home for sale stinks . )
Bank - owned properties are in worse condition than ever because the foreclosure process is taking longer than ever .
As much as a year can pass between the time a borrower first misses a payment and the final auction sale , according to Youngblood .
During that time , houses often deteriorate because owners have neither the money nor the incentive to maintain them .
Some disgruntled homeowners may even deliberately damage homes before they leave .
" According to our servicing folks , it 's taking more time for lenders to get properties in saleable condition , " said Mechem .
The phenomenon of a growing ghost inventory does n't promise to get better anytime soon , as long as the rate of foreclosures continues to ravage the market .
There were more than 3.1 million foreclosure filings in 2008 , according to RealtyTrac .
Said Sharga : " I do n't see how we can avoid another 3 million in 2009 . "
Bob Chapman | February 25 , 2009
Since 1997 , real inflation , as opposed to ridiculously understated official inflation , has raged at a minimum of 8 % annually , and has soared as high as 14 - 16 % .
This means that you have lost a minimum of two thirds of your 1997 purchasing power .
So , if you invested $ 10,000 in the Dow components in 1997 , not only would you have no gain whatsoever , you would have losses on the stocks which were dropped from the index due to poor performance and , in addition , to add insult to injury , your purchasing power has been reduced from $ 10,000 to approximately $ 3,000 in terms of 1997 dollars .
In other words , that $ 10,000 you invested in 1997 will today only buy what $ 3,000 would have bought in 1997 .
Effectively , anyone playing the general stock markets has been wiped out by this combination of lost capital gains and reduced purchasing power .
Those who began investing after 1997 have done even worse because they have suffered major capital losses in addition to having suffered reduced purchasing power .
So much for the much touted 10 % average annual gains for stocks .
By contrast , you could have bought gold in 1997 for about $ 300 per ounce and more than tripled your money at today 's prices .
Your $ 10,000 would have become $ 30,000 + , however , due to inflation caused by the Fed 's profligate increase in the money supply , which the Fed intentionally orchestrated in order to impoverish you and bring you to your knees so you will accept world government , your purchasing power would only be about $ 10,000 in 1997 dollars .
So you would at least be even in terms of purchasing power .
Certainly , $ 10,000 in purchasing power is a whole lot better than $ 3,000 .
This example is a classic illustration of how gold preserves your wealth .
As you can see , failure to invest in gold , silver and their related shares is tantamount to committing financial suicide .
The bankruptcy courts will soon be full of the tens of millions of US citizens who ultimately will ignore gold and silver as a safe haven , or who will simply lack the capital to invest in gold and silver in any case because they are in hock up to their ears , or because they have become unemployed , or both .
Pension plans , often heavily invested in stocks and real estate , asset classes which have seen tens of trillions of dollars disappear in a matter of months , are now so far behind in funding due to their ludicrous underlying assumptions about ROI ( return on investment ) that they are effectively bankrupt and will have to be bailed by the grievously under - funded PBGC ( Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ) , which of course can only provide pennies on the dollar unless another bailout is orchestrated to save middle class pensions , which is not going to happen , and these losses do not even take into account loss of purchasing power due to inflation , which is understated officially to screw retirees out of their social security benefits .
Instead of a PBGC bailout , we more likely will see the US follow in the footsteps of Argentina by nationalizing private pension money , mixing it with government entitlements .
If you were wondering where the elitists plan to park a large portion of those new treasuries being issued to fund all the bailouts , look no further than your IRA 's , 401 ( k ) 's and your company pensions , which will be forced to purchase these treasuries as part of the process by which the elitists will nationalize your pensions .
Also , as part of this process , the types of assets you are allowed to invest in will be greatly limited , and your pension will be overseen by your corrupt , bungling government , insuring a complete financial clusterf - - k .
That way , you get the unspeakable privilege of owning dollar - denominated paper assets that will be vaporized along with Federal Reserve notes ( aka toilet paper , aka " worthless paper " ) when foreign owners of dollar forex all head for the exits to see who can dump their dollars the fastest as they try to purchase as many tangible , real assets as they can find in the US .
You wo n't know , of course , because statistics about foreign ownership in the US are , conveniently , no longer published by the FTC .
However , you will find out soon enough as you are Zimbabwe 'd and Weimar -ized .
And that only addresses problems due to devaluation of the dollar .
Wait until the interest rates skyrocket as hyperinflation takes hold and risk reaches new heights .
This will collapse the treasury market , and the value of all your pension plan assets , which the government will have forced you to invest in treasuries , will go down in flames with it .
Also , many pension - sponsoring companies are going to go under because they are being systematically starved of necessary capital by the big , so - called " legacy banks , " who are using the financial debacle to eliminate their competition and that of their fellow elitist business corporations , especially transnational conglomerates .
When these victims of the financial holocaust go under , the pension funds they sponsor will go under with them and there will be precious little in the way of bailouts to make up for these losses .
Rest assured that the elitist companies will get their equity injections , toxic waste buyouts and loss assumptions , while everyone else gets the shaft .
This is what the Pelosi Political Pork / Plunder Payoff Plan is all about , as well as the multi-trillion Obama bank bailout , which supposedly will help Main Street in addition to Wall Street , based on the tiresome platitudes offered in Tuesday 's presidential speech .
If you believe that , then we still have that bridge in Brooklyn for sale at pennies on the dollar , at least until one of the dollar surplus nations uses its hundreds of billions in dollar forex to gobble it up .
Note that all the new tax laws concerning pensions encourage you to put more money in , and to keep it there longer .
The scum in our government and on Wall Street want to encourage you to place your money into accounts to which they have strings attached with onerous tax law penalties .
They want to make sure you put as much of your hard - earned savings in such accounts as possible , and to keep it there as long as possible , so they have sufficient time and opportunity to steal it from you via inflation , dollar devaluation , insider trading , investment fraud , depreciation of asset values through deflation , direct taxation , foreclosure sales , bankruptcy auctions and outright confiscation .
That is with the assistance of the SEC and CFTC .
There is no end in sight for the real estate market , which will not bottom for several years .
Once interest rates go into double digits , option ARM 's implode and unemployed government employees bring the overall unemployment rate up to 30 % or even higher , we could be looking at a roll - back to 1981 home prices .
Once these three factors are in full swing , you wo n't be able to give a house away .
No one wants to buy a home that is plummeting in value , few will be able to afford it even if they did want to buy it , and the few remaining who wanted to buy it and were still able to afford it will not have the credit or down payment money that is necessary to obtain a loan to buy it .
Bank sales of foreclosed property will dominate the markets at all levels , and in all geographic areas .
Few areas in the US will be spared from drastically declining home values .
Also , once deflation takes over during the next one to three years , those who are liable under those big mortgages they took out based on inflated real estate prices will be unable to sell in any case , because they will be underwater and unable to clear their liens .
If we get cram - down authority for our bankruptcy judges , where loan balances can be reduced to levels commensurate with value , there will be few if any homeowners who are drastically underwater who will not take advantage of this bankruptcy protection whether or not they can swing the mortgage payments .
No one wants to pay more for a home than it is worth .
That means that virtually all real estate derivatives could become worthless regardless of quality .
That also means that all the large banks are hopelessly insolvent even if we set aside the Quadrillion Dollar Derivative Death Star waiting to implode as ongoing business failures set off counter - party liability on credit default swaps ( CDS's ) , and as double digit interest rates fry those on the wrong side of interest rate swaps ( IRS's ) .
Therefore , all money thrown at these zombie financial institutions is not only being wasted , but is also stoking further hyperinflation without generating any offsetting benefits whatsoever in return .
In addition , any common stock , preferred stock or bonds given to taxpayers by any of these walking dead elitist banks and financial institutions is absolutely worthless .
These walking dead must be shot in the head with a silver bullet or have wooden stakes driven through their hearts to put them out of their misery , and all their existing accounts should be given to the successful regional banks whose executives had the foresight to stay clear of all the financial carnage .
Many of the current and former executives of these zombie institutions and of the Clinton Administration , which set up this nightmare scenario , are now advising the Obama Administration on what to do about the depression we are in .
So we are now asking drunk drivers and reckless speeders to give us lessons about highway safety .
Only in America .
The bailout for mortgage borrowers is rife with moral hazard , as is the bailout of zombie banks and financial institutions .
We keep hearing Barack " Nero Fiddled While Rome Burned " Obama and Sheila " We Just Can't Let This Happen " Bair , the head of the FDIC , tell us that we have to bail out bankster gangsters and borrower felons , and that we just can't allow these banksters and borrowers to go under , nor can we allow the overall financial situation to deteriorate further .
Not only can we , but we absolutely should allow these borrowers and bankster gangsters to go under .
The situation is going to deteriorate further no matter what they do , and they are in fact exacerbating the ongoing debacles by creating money out of nothing and then throwing it at people and institutions that are already dead , financially speaking .
Tim Geithner , the Fed 's hatchet - man and tax cheater who is now acting as our Treasury Secretary , wants to apply stress tests to these banks like some sort of bank doctor , when he should be acting as the official bank coroner .
Instead of trying to see how banks will react to various financial stresses , which tests should have been conducted years ago by our bogus regulators who looked the other way while collecting their pay , he should simply be determining the cause of death and listing it on the banks ' death certificates .
Had these stress tests been conducted in a timely fashion , it would not have mattered anyway , because as our subscribers know , these deaths were by suicide , and not by natural causes .
These institutions have self - destructed on orders from the Puppet Masters to collapse the world financial system to make way for a new one - world system in place of the nation - state system .
People who acted wisely and stayed on the sidelines while everyone else want on a felonious spending and lending binge in the real estate markets , which felonious activity occurred with the full encouragement of our government who practically arm - twisted many lenders into giving loans , under threat of discrimination lawsuits , to anyone who could fog a mirror , and which felonious activity and loan malfeasance the Fed actively encouraged via Mr. Bubbles , Alan Greenspan , who was the former Fed Chairman before Buck - Busting Ben took over , still cannot get into the real estate market because the prices are being kept artificially high by all the bailouts .
They watch in silent anger and consternation as those who committed felonies by taking out " liar loans " get their mortgage principal reduced and payments lowered to avoid generating foreclosures which would take real estate prices down to a more realistic level that honest , qualified buyers could afford .
They watch in stupefied horror and frustration as those banks which engaged in derivative and loan fraud and over - leveraged speculation get hundreds of billions of taxpayer largesse doled out to them so they can continue to defraud the public and make nonsensical loans to keep the daisy chain of fraud going while they collect their commissions and spreads on new issuance of toxic waste using money that has been borrowed interest - free , while charging usurious rates , relative to their borrowing costs , to anyone else who needs to borrow money .
These bankster gangsters then have the gall to say they are not accountable to taxpayers as to how the money is used , while glomming salaries , bonuses and dividends out of money that has been handed to them which they did nothing to earn , and some of this money is even used as takeover money to hostilely acquire the honest , healthy banks in order to eliminate competition while simultaneously hoarding the gifted bailout money to force the rest of their competition to fail and go under because they can't borrow to meet their capital requirements .
Obama 's bogus promises that these horrendous and fiendish practices will not be allowed to occur with respect to future bailout funds is just window - dressing and inane platitudes for the ignorant masses .
Business will go on as usual in Washington and on Wall Street -- as corrupt as ever .
Right has become wrong , and wrong has become right , just as the Bible warned .
Surely , we are in the End Times .

18 Awesome Aircraft Landings
Sometimes when we ’re sitting comfortably on an airplane , we fail to fully comprehend the sheer amounts of skill and determination it takes to be the pilot of those very planes we so casually use day in and day out .
This is a tribute to some of the best ( and some of the worst ) landings performed by pilots in recent years .
Kai Tak airport – Hong Kong
Kai Tak airport ( also known as the Hong Kong International Airport ) was the main international airport of Hong Kong for over 70 years until its closure in 1998 .
The only runway it had stretched out into the harbour , with a high density of buildings and mountains in close proximity , combined with tricky crosswinds , landing at Kai Tak was infamously difficult , as demonstrated by these videos .
Princess Juliana Airport – St Maarten ( Dutch Antilles ) is the main airport for the Dutch part of St Martin ( St Maarten ) , a tropical island in the northeast Caribbean which is divided between the Dutch and the French .
The airport is infamous for its incredibly short runway , which requires pilots to fly extremely low over the heads of tourists on the nearby beach when on their final approach to the runway .
The landings were so spectacular , that many have argued over the authenticity of videos and photos taken of planes landing there .

These two are both faked landings .
The first was allegedly an experiment into the dissemination of information throughout the internet ( i.e. the creators wanted to see how quickly it would spread ) , whilst the second was for a television commercial .
They still look quite awesome , though .
Both of these next pilots think that it ’d be a great idea to see who could bounce the most upon landing on the runway .

At a first glance this car might look like a garbage truck from outside but it is in fact designed as a sort of a cross between a mobile home and an off - road vehicle .
It ’s a Terra Cross " Home on Wheels " manufactured by UNICAT .
This " Home on Wheels " has everything you need , an office , beds , bathroom , kitchen and storage space plus today you can live on the beach , and tommorow in the middle of a city ( of course if you can park ) .
The particular model displayed here is the EX63HDI MAN TGA 6×6 , and if you want to see other models you can check UNICAT website .
In conclusion this " home on wheels " would be a perfect choice for someone who decide to travel around the world , or who just like to travel .
Now let ’s take a look and admire the inside of this " house on wheels " .
The Mission One EV electric sports bike got a proper unveiling at this week 's Technology , Entertainment , Design ( TED ) conference , and boy does this baby exude power .
Mission Motors says the motorcycle 's got an 150 MPH top speed and 100 foot - pounds of torque at any point between 0 and 6,500 RPM .
That 's a good deal faster than the Electric Motorsport GPR - S , which tops out at a now - paltry 100 MPH .
The lithium - ion battery keeps it running for 150 miles , and charge time is targeted for under 2 Hours at 240V ( 8 Hours at 120V ) .
Its stylish form factor comes from famed industrial designer Yves Behar .
Yeah , we 're excited , too , but here 's the part where you flinch : the deathly silent super - scooter will first show up in 2010 with a 50 - unit limited edition run costing $ 68,995 apiece .
A more affordable model will be announced sometime this summer .
If you 've got a need for this much muted speed , be prepared to mortgage a house or two .

Summary
This list contains 2395 webpages or site variations derived from the those secretly banned by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) and used by a government approved censorship software maker in its " ACMA only " censorship mode .
The last update to the ACMA list is August 6 , 2008 .
While Wikileaks is used to exposing secret government censorship in developing countries , we now find Australia acting like a democratic backwater .
Apparently without irony , ACMA threatens fines of upto $ 11,000 a day for linking to sites on its secret , unreviewable , censorship blacklist -- a list the government hopes to expand into a giant national censorship machine .
History shows that secret censorship systems , whatever their original intent , are invariably corrupted into anti-democratic behavior .
This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring Wikileaks .
We were not notified by ACMA .
In December last year we released the secret Internet censorship list for Thailand .
Of the sites censored in 2008 , 1,203 sites were classified as " lese majeste " -- criticizing the Royal family .
Like Australia , the Thai censorship system was originally pushed to be a mechanism to prevent the child pornography .
Research shows that while such blacklists are dangerous to " above ground " activities such as political discourse , they have little effect on the production of child pornography , and by diverting resources and attention from traditional policing actions , may even be counter - productive .
For a fascinating insider 's account , see My life in child porn .
In January 2009 , the Thai system was used to censor Australian reportage about the imprisonment of Harry Nicolaides , an Australian writer , who wrote a novel containing a single paragraph deemed to be critical of the Thai Monarchy .
Most of the sites on the Australian list have no obvious connection to child pornography .
Some have changed owners while others were clearly always about other subjects .
Australian democracy must not be permitted to sleep with this loaded gun .
If Australia 's " Senator for Censorship " , Steven Conroy , has his way , Australia will be the first Western country to have a mandatory Internet censorship regime .
When human rights activists push for transparent government and a life free from censorship , the retort from developing world governments will rightly be " haha ... what about Australia ? " .
The full blacklist follows in hyperlink form .
Note that entries 1.52 and 1.53 are somewhat unusual ; while confirmed to be part of the ACMA blacklist in censorship software it is possible that these are contamination of some sort from another list .
It is also possible that they are entries previously wrongly excluded from the ACMA because they were on another ( non - ACMA ) list .
Regardless , the complete list is the one that is being used in by the censorship software maker , when placed into " adult - unfiltered " ( ACMA ) mode .

Fox News ' Sean Hannity does n't let his religion get in the way for his support of a controversial anti-terror tactic .
Hannity invited Meghan McCain on his show to talk about a court filing by 9/11 defendants detained at Guantanamo Bay .
The group of detainees had admitted that they were " terrorists to the bone . "
" They declared war on us and we 're fighting a war and we know there is about 60 - some odd detainees that have gone back to the battlefield .
Why for the first time ever would we give rights to enemy combatants ? " asked Hannity .
Meghan McCain seemed to agree .
" What competent person thinks this is a good idea ?
Literally when I think of my brother and his people and his platoon , the people I know over there fighting for this so we can let them go so they can attack us again ?
It 's insane , " she said .
Hannity then moved to the subject of torture .
" Do you disagree with your dad at all about enhanced interrogations ? " asked Hannity .
John McCain has been vocal about his opposition to torture .
" My attitude is that if we capture an enemy combatant in the battlefield -- or we can use Osama bin Laden -- who may have information about a pending attack .
You know what , I do n't have any problem taking his head sticking it underwater and scaring the living daylights out of him and making him think we 're drowning him and I'm a Christian , " declared Hannity .
McCain disagreed .
" I think it 's what separates us from the terrorists .
My father could never lift me up as a child because he can't move his arm .
He can't ride a bike because he can't bend his knee because he was tortured .
I think he knows better , " she said .
Have the Sulzbergers , the family who has owned and controlled the New York Times for more than 100 years , been cleaned out by the stock 's collapse ?
No .
At least not yet .
But unless they 've stashed heaps of money in assets other than the New York Times Company ( NYT ) , they 're a lot less wealthly than they used to be .
The Sulzbergers -- a group that , for the purposes of this post , we 'll define as the four children of Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger , the daughter of Adolph Ochs , who bought the paper in 1896 - - together control approximately 19 % of the New York Times Company 's stock .
Five years ago , when the New York Times Company 's stock was trading at $ 45 and the equity was worth about $ 6.5 billion , the Sulzbergers ' stake was worth about $ 1.2 billion , or $ 300 million each .
In addition , the company was paying about $ 120 million a year in dividends , approximately $ 23 million of which accrued to the Sulzbergers - - or $ 6 million each .
( Nice ! )
Alas , times have changed .
Now , with the New York Times Company 's stock trading at $ 3.50 , the company 's equity is worth $ 500 million , which leaves the Sulzbergers with about $ 95 million , or about $ 25 million apiece .
In addition , the company has just eliminated its dividend .
So the Sulzbergers do not appear to be broke -- although is always possible that , like Sumner Redstone and millions of others , they levered up .
( This would actually make sense , given that most of the family stock is held in trust .
And when your stock holdings are worth $ 300 million , it would seem reasonable to borrow , say , $ 25 million ) .
We do imagine , however , that , late in the evenings , perhaps after a drink or two , the Sulzbergers occasionally think about what might have been .
Specifically , we imagine they think with envy of three of the country 's other great newspaper families , the Chandlers , the Bancrofts , and the Grahams , who find themselves in a distinctly different situation .
The Grahams ( WaPo ) turned their newspaper company into an education company ... and must be thanking heaven they did .
The Chandlers ( Times Mirror / Tribune ) and Bancrofts ( Dow Jones ) , meanwhile , had their papers pried from their hands by huge bids from acquisitive moguls at the peak of the stock - market boom .
At the time , many people felt sorry for them , as though they had somehow fought a good fight ... and lost .
But the Chanders and Bancrofts do not seem like losers anymore .
On the contrary : They seem brilliant .
They seem as though they got out of a once - fantastically profitable 200 - year old industry just in the nick of time , sticking Messrs .
Murdoch and Zell with the wreckage .
The Sulzbergers are distinctly not broke , at least not yet .
But barring a miraculous industry recovery , it does not appear that they will follow the Chandlers , Bancrofts , and Grahams into the golden post - newspaper - owning sunset .
Epicurism is the life ’s philosophy which explains how humans do not need anything else to be happy except the absence of pain .
Further to that , it points out that this absence of pain ( or ‘ ataraxia ’ as it was state was named ) can be achieved with three very easy to have resources .
Food , Shelter and Friendship .
This is not a wild concept but is based on rational thinking about the way humans work .
In order of importance any human will first seek to secure his sustenance , then his shelter and finally his social needs before anything else .
These things are as undeniable as gravity and based on our evolution .
Epicurism then builds from that and points out that anyone can be perfectly happy without anything more than these three fulfilled .
The very fact that a human required these three before they can be happy is what constitutes them as needs .
This does not mean that someone cannot have other things that make them happy but what it does mean is that those things do not constitute a need but rather a luxury .
This has the very obvious implication that when your luxuries conflict with your needs , it is the former that needs to be sacrificed or you risk being in a state of pain .
That humans do not wish to be in a state of physical or emotional pain I believe goes without saying .
As humans we only have only one life and as such what we wish more than anything is to have this life be as pleasurable as possible .
Ultimately , that is the main goal any of us has and we differ only in the ways we try to achieve it .
Epicurism then simply says that the way to achieve this is to be in ataraxia as much as possible , for being in pain makes life less pleasurable for the duration .
But what happens if the absence of a particular luxury brings us pain ?
What if we ’ve grown to “ need ” it ?
In those cases the easiest solution is generally to condition ourselves not to require it any more .
From an evolutionary perspective it is certainly not necessary , so our need of it is obviously the result of our social environment ; something we ’ve just grown used to .
As such , it is also something we can eventually discard .
But why would we want to ?
Why not get our needs and our luxuries ?
The answer is that everything , from needs to luxuries requires a degree of “ pain ” , in the sense that before we can secure food , shelter or any luxury we need to ( usually ) do something unpleasant , usually work .
Fortunately food and shelter , being items that everyone needs , are generally affordable no matter your finances .
On the other hand , the cost of luxuries increases exponentially .
So the best action for us is to simply compare the intensity and duration of the pain we have to endure to get anything , to the duration of ataraxia we ’re going to have through it or the pain we ’re going to suffer without it .
In the case of food and shelter , the cost is very low ( friend are free ) , if not trivial while the pain of not having either is immense .
In the case of luxuries however , we quickly discover that they have diminishing returns .
The more expensive the luxury , the less the extra pleasure we receive from it .
On the other hand , it might very well be the case that the pain we have by trying to achieve the luxury we ’ve turned into a “ need ” , is bigger than the duration of the ataraxia we will receive .
The best practice any of us have make is to discard any “ need ” for luxuries .
By doing this it means that when times are good , we can enjoy them without any extra cost , while when times are bad , their absence does not create any further pain .
We maximize the time we spend in ataraxia and on average our life is lived in a happier state .
This may be a quite long explanation but the concept is quite simple and surprisingly effective .
Being materialistic , it is absolutely compatible with modern science ( as it is not based on any metaphysical bullshit ) as well as with any other philosophy which does not force you into a contradiction to your needs .
As a matter of fact , using Epicurism as a philosophical base reinforces other concepts .
From Atheism to Humanism , to Anarchism .
What Epicurism is n’t
Epicurism , like all philosophies and ideologies which are threatening to the status quo ( I will post why another time ) has been the target of severe and concentrated slander .
So much in fact that the contemporary definition of it , has ended up meaning the exact opposite of the original concept .
Mainly that an Epicurean tries to live as luxuriour a life as possible or that it is someone who selects a particular hedony and tries to get as much of it as possible .
It is telling that those who most enthusiastically engaged in this tactic of slander have been the monotheists , starting with the Jewish people for whom the name itself remains as a curse in their vocabulary .
As an extension this hatred was inherited by the Christians of whom the Roman emperors were quite eager to extinguish this threatening thinking .
There were others of course , such as the Stoics who were staunch supporters of Aristocracy .
The trend is clear .
Unfortunately this misconception has persisted since the modern age but hopefully , slowly , this will change .
I hope this post will help a bit towards that goal .
Why Epicurism ?
If you know me even a little , you ’d be aware that I do n’t like labels particularly , especially labels based on a historical name as that sounds dogmatic , in the sense that I believe the words of a dead guy are perfect and he could do no mistake .
You may be asking yourself why I choose to describe myself firstly as an Epicurean .
The answer is quite simple really .
As a general philosophy , this is the only name that exists to define it .

People who have been reading my blog for a while may remember Reinteract .
I have n’t written anything about it here for a while , but I ’ve still been working on it ; usually in a spurts of a few weeks of evening hacking at a time .
I ’m going to be talking about Reinteract at Pycon this weekend , which inspired me to go ahead and finish up something worth calling a release .
Reinteract 0.5.0 : Source , installers for Windows and OS X .
One big change over the last year is the notebook user interface .
Any decent size project is going to have multiple worksheets along with the Python libraries and data files that they use .
The Reinteract main window now represents a notebook – an entire project – instead of a single worksheet .
Another major effort was porting Reinteract to Windows and OS X. Since Python and GTK + already worked on these platforms , it was mostly a question of putting together existing pieces .
But there was quite a bit of work to get things installed properly , and to create slick installers that combine Reinteract with the libraries and Python modules it depends upon .
On OS X , I also wrote some native code to get a proper global menu .
With the new version , the work of computing a Reinteract worksheet occurs in a separate thread ; this allows the user interface to stay responsive during long running operations .
And allows you to interrupt running operations , which is a very handy thing to have if you accidentally write an infinite loop , or start some calculation that ’s going to take a year to finish .
And of course , there are lots of bug fixes and small features as well .
I ’ve had useful suggestions , bug reports , and patches from a great number of people .
I ’d like to thank Kai Willadsen and Jon Kuhn in particular for their active contributions .
Among other things , Kai recently landed a change that makes the replot module considerably more useful : instead of being restricted to a single plot command , you can use all the methods of the matplotlib Axes object .

AllergiCare Relief Centers are a chain of franchises started by a man called David Tucker who is not listed as having an MD or any other title .
They offer diagnosis of allergies by biofeedback and treatment of allergies by laser acupuncture .
They admit that the method is not backed by any science , and they claim that what they are doing is not medical treatment .
Responsible journalism might have investigated this as quackery or practicing medicine without a license .
Instead , irresponsible journalism has helped promote these centers and has given them invaluable free advertising .
From one news story :
Tucker said the device works based on biofeedback .
The allergy sufferer wears a sensing clip on his finger for testing , and the computer simulates the bio-frequency for 10,000 known allergens .
As the body responds to those stimuli , the computer lists which substances are irritants .
“ This digitized allergen actually matches the harmonic frequency of the actual allergen , making the body believe it is in contact with the real substance , ” Tucker said .
“ The body will react if it is allergic to the particular substance . ” ….
Once the allergens are identified , a laser stimulates biomeridian points on the body — the same points used in acupuncture and acupressure .
Tucker said the idea is to strengthen organs to act properly the next time they encounter the allergen — that is , to treat them as harmless …
So far , there is no science to prove the devices work , but Tucker claims a 70 percent positive response rate .
They asked a representative of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to comment .
He wimped out , saying , “ AAFA is not familiar with this treatment option and therefore cannot comment . ”
An allergy specialist , Dr. Goldsobel , was a little more forthcoming .
He called the AllergiCare business “ a media campaign with specious claims . ”
The reporter compared the new treatment to conventional allergy treatment and in the process , managed to cast doubt on conventional allergy treatments .
The company website says “ The BAX3000 is the first and only FDA cleared , US patented system for eliminating allergies . ”
That ’s not exactly true .
The BAX3000 is a biofeedback machine , approved ONLY for biofeedback by the FDA .
The only thing the company has patented is the digital conductance meter .
The BAX3000 is just another in a long line of quack electronic diagnostic and treatment devices that started with electroacupuncture according to Voll ( EAV ) in the 1950s .
They basically measure galvanic skin conductance .
There are various versions making different claims .
In this version they claim to be measuring what a patient is allergic to ; then they return the same frequencies back to the acupuncture points as treatment .
Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch does n’t mince words : he says
I believe that EAV devices should be confiscated and that practitioners who use them are either delusional , dishonest , or both .
They treat runny nose , sinus congestion , watery eyes , itchy skin , hives , asthma , wheezing , stomach upset , eczema , lower GI problems .
Fatigue , lack of energy , almost anything could be a sign of allergies .
They do n’t claim to treat anaphylaxis .
I wonder why .
You can go to their website and use their allergy symptom checker to enter your own symptoms and get a preliminary idea where your problem lies .
I had fun checking various combinations of symptoms .
Entering “ headache , yearly , evening , and indoors ” produced glutamates , gliadin , yogurt , gluten and iron .
Checking “ IBS , after meals , and indoors ” yielded inactive digestive enzymes , inorganic salts , H - C - L [ sic ] , histamines and iron .
Checking “ bloating and cramps in the morning ” yielded histamines , salicylates , coffee , mucigen and mucin .
Checking EVERY symptom on the list yielded “ Mucus Membranes , Mucus , Mucin , Mucigen and Glutamates . ”
It would n’t give an answer if I checked nothing , but when I checked only “ morning ” it yielded Coffee , Epithelial Cells , Mucus Membranes , Dust Components , and Leukotrienes .
I knew I was allergic to mornings , but I thought coffee was the treatment , not the allergen .
How could anyone be allergic to mucus membranes ?
Or iron ?
Or in the case of a patient mentioned on the website , vitamin B12 ?
I phoned the company to ask some questions .
I got a confused rigmarole of pseudoscientific hogwash .
The machine is a biofeedback device that acts as an ohm meter , with impedance indicating the acupuncture meridians .
There are some kind of mysterious skin receptor molecules that receive the information and then send signals to the rest of the body .
They refer to named acupuncture points and meridians that they assume are real .
They use a laser to reprogram specific acupuncture meridians , apparently teaching the body not to respond to the allergen .
He kept trying to tell me that there was some kind of neurologic response to immune stimuli but could n’t explain it coherently .
I asked how they determined the unique frequency of each allergen in the first place .
He said they did it with an oscilloscope .
I asked how they managed to accomplish that and he could n’t explain .
I asked if the measurements were repeated and validated ( apparently not ) .
I asked how they could verify that they had the correct frequency .
He answered ,
When the wellness of the patient takes place .
I had great difficulty maintaining my composure at that point in the conversation .
He admitted there were no studies yet , and that it required a leap of faith .
But he could give me lots of testimonials and recommendations from lots of chiropractors .
He was really sure it worked because he ’d seen the results .
I do n’t doubt it .
If you are diagnosed as being allergic to something you ’re not allergic to , then you can be exposed to it without getting any symptoms , and that counts as success .
If you have any vague symptom that goes away on its own or responds to suggestion , that counts as success .
If you really are allergic to something and the symptoms vary over time ( as they almost always do ) , that counts as success too .
After the phone call I e-mailed the company again and asked if their technical experts could tell me the frequency of ragweed pollen .
They never answered .
They are charging patients several hundreds of dollars for this nonsense .
And they have happy customers .
They claim a high success rate : “ proven by over a decade of consistent results with solid success with tens of thousands of people who have had their allergies / sensitivities completely eliminated . ”
They have a disclaimer : “ The treatments we perform are not medical treatments .
It has been developed from an entirely different field of therapeutics using the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine , the study of human physiology and an in - depth knowledge of allergens . ”
The reporter did n’t do his homework .
He could easily have found out that using a biofeedback machine ( with or without lasers ) to diagnose and treat allergies not only does n’t work but is illegal .
The FDA confiscates these machines whenever it learns about them and has the time and manpower to act .
In a recent series in the Seattle Times , reporters Mike Berens and Christine Willmsen did a thorough expose of related “ energy medicine ” devices , an expose that led to prosecutions and regulatory actions .
This reporter missed the chance to do something equally useful .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British couple have been rescued from their 13 - meter yacht in the Atlantic Ocean after they drifted for weeks with a broken rudder .
The pair , Stuart Armstrong , 51 , and his partner Andrea Davison , 48 , was understood to be running out of food and water when they were winched to safety from their boat Sara by crew on board the 183 - meter - long oil tanker , Indian Point on February 18 .
Having planned to cross the Atlantic from Cape Verde to Antigua , the couple 's problems began on January 9 , about half - way through their journey , when the rudder of their boat jammed on starboard and sent them drifting in circles .
Armstrong alerted the U.S. Coastguard of their problems , however , the Coastguard told the couple they were too far out to be rescued .
The couple was then battered by several storms , and as they began to run short of food and a power cut disabled their desalination unit ( which provides drinking water ) , the Coastguard alerted the Indian Point , which took a five - hour diversion to save them in heavy seas .
They managed to secure both sailors by lowering harnesses down to the yacht .
The pair was now expected to arrive in Amsterdam on March 1 with the Indian Point .
Speaking after the rescue , Armstrong said , " At first we were not too bothered , as we had a good supply of dry provisions , the usual things you have on a boat - pasta , kidney beans , biscuits , rice and soya , " British newspaper The Guardian reported .
" We kept getting hit by storms , but we managed to get out of them with no real problems .
" But I knew we were riding our luck and we would n't be able to go on for much longer , " Davison added .
A spokesman for the oil tanker said the pair was " scared and wet and happy . "
CHINHOYI , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was celebrating his 85th birthday with a lavish all - day party Saturday despite the fact that the country is gripped by an economic and health crisis .
President Robert Mugabe and his wife , Grace , attend a cake - cutting ceremony for his birthday Saturday .
Mugabe 's ZANU - PF party said it raised at least $ 250,000 to hold the party in Mugabe 's hometown of Chinhoyi , about 120 kilometers ( 75 miles ) outside of the capital , Harare .
Critics of the president say the country is desperate for that amount of money to be spent instead on its citizens , who are suffering from a cholera outbreak , food shortages , and spiraling hyperinflation .
On Friday , Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai visited a hospital 's closed intensive care unit that he said needed $ 30,000 to resume operating .
During the celebrations , Mugabe announced that his controversial land reform would not be reversed .
The program is designed to have white - owned farms given to blacks , and there have been violent seizures of such farms since the program began in 2000 .
Watch Mugabe 's birthday bash »
He emphasized that the country 's " indigenization program " -- which forces all major foreign companies operating in Zimbabwe to have at least 51 percent black ownership -- will be carried out .
It began last year and has n't been implemented yet .
Mugabe 's birthday falls on February 21 but his party loyalists postponed the celebrations as they were raising money for the event .
" I think it is going to be a great day for the legend and icon whose birthday we are celebrating today here , " said Mugabe 's nephew Patrick Zhuwawo , one of the fund - raisers for the birthday .
" The country might be having problems , but we need to have a day to honor the sacrifices the president has made for this country . "
What do you think about the celebrations ?
Zhuwawo said about 100 beasts would be slaughtered for the birthday bash .

What do you think about Mugabe 's lavish party ?
Mugabe also invited schoolchildren from around the country to attend the party , being held at Chinhoyi University .
The farming town of Chinhoyi is usually quiet , but Saturday 's event has changed everything .
Cars with Mugabe 's supporters could be seen hooting and some ZANU - PF supporters sang Mugabe 's praises .
A banner in Chinhoyi read , " Age ai n't nothing but a number . "
Mugabe invited Tsvangirai , his new partner in a power - sharing government , but a Tsvangirai spokesman said the opposition party leader turned it down .
He said it is political party function , with most of the attendees being ZANU - PF elite .
As the prime minister , Tsvangirai is not obligated to attend , the spokesman said .
The spokesman would not acknowledge whether Tsvangirai had initially agreed to attend , but it was widely reported in Zimbabwean media that he had agreed to do so .
" Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments , as far as I know , " said Nelson Chamisa , a spokesman for Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change .
Tsvangirai last year said Mugabe 's birthday party was " a gathering of the satisfied few . "
But at that point , he and the president were preparing to face off in a hotly contested presidential election .
As Saturday 's celebrations began in a carnival atmosphere , just less than a kilometer ( 0.62 miles ) away stood a deserted Chinhoyi government hospital -- a reflection of the country 's dire health situation .
A few nurses are attending to patients .
" There are no medicines .
These patients have no option but to come here , but there is nothing we can do , " said one nurse at the hospital .
On Friday Tsvangirai visited Harare Hospital , one of the country 's biggest , and said its intensive care unit will need $ 30,000 in order to start operating again after a funding shortage .
Once a darling of Zimbabwe , Mugabe is blamed for driving the country into a meltdown .
A cholera epidemic that broke out in August has since hit every corner of the country , killing 3,731 people and infecting nearly 80,000 , according to the World Health Organization , which quoted Zimbabwe 's Ministry of Health .
The preventable disease has spread through Zimbabwe 's 10 provinces through lack of access to clean water , faulty sewage systems , and uncollected refuse , according to Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) , which released a report this month on the outbreak .
The problems , MSF said , are " clear symptoms of the breakdown in infrastructure resulting from Zimbabwe 's political and economic meltdown . "
On Sunday , Tsvangirai appealed to the international community to help Zimbabwe 's crippled economy , saying it would take $ 5 billion to stabilize the country .
The cholera outbreak has worsened Zimbabwe 's economic crisis .
Failed government policies and an acute food shortage because of years of poor agricultural production and widespread corruption have ravaged the currency of Zimbabwe , which has the world 's highest inflation rate .
CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report .

The Executive Coup
I ’m going to discuss the administration ’s plan to take toxic assets off the banks , then talk about what this and other moves this week ( such as the FED announcing $ 1.15 trillion in new spending ) tells us about the administrations plans for the financial sector and the economy , and how I believe they ’re going to play out , as well as what the political power realities now are .
There are three parts to the plan to take toxic assets off the banks ’ hands , of which we have mostly the details of the first part , in which the FDIC will form “ private / public ” partnerships to buy up assets .
The plan has the FDIC loaning up to 85 % of the cost of purchase as a non-recourse loan which is backed up only by the value of the loan .
Of the remaining 15 % , the treasury will lend up to 80 % .
The remaining 3 % money must be put up by the private partners .
The government will share in any profits or losses of the underlying security , though we do n’t know what percentage goes to the private investor or the public .
Think of the investment split in simple terms .
If I want to invest in securities , why would I want a 3 % partner with whom I have to split the return ?
If the government is investing 97 % of the money , why are they even bothering with private partners ?
Why not just pony up another 3 % ?
Oh sure , there may be some occasions on which the private partners put up more , but if the government thought they could get more , why are they offering 97 % financing , with 85 % being a complete write - off if the asset goes down rather than up ?
There are two possible answers I can see .
The first answer is that they want “ price discovery ” .
They need some market set prices for the toxic waste .
Of course , such prices could exist tomorrow .
As the Times notes , private investors are willing to pay 30 % of face for these assets .
Banks want 60 % .
Banks can’t afford to allow a 30 % valuation , because then most of them would be forced to revalue their books and that would make them formally bankrupt .
However if purchasing is highly subsidized and largely no risk “ heads the taxpayer takes most of the loss , tails the private investors make money ” , then prices will probably be higher than 30 % because investors wo n’t be taking the majority of the risk , and will be required to put almost no money down .
( Only 3 % , which is about 33 to 1 leverage , insane in and of itself . )
Now if the government just put up 100 % of the money , it would n’t really be considered “ price discovery ” , it would just be a government purchase at inflated prices .
But if there are “ private investors ” involved , the administration may figure that it ’s legitimate price discovery .
And if they get some good prices , they can then have the banks use those values for price discovery , and voila – they are n’t bankrupt .
( Or at least not as bankrupt .
Degrees do matter . )
The second answer is about passing bad debt onto taxpayers .
The involvement of a small amount of private money is a fig leaf allowing the government to get as much toxic waste off the banks ’ books as possible , with the majority of the risk and cost being born by the taxpayers , with a good part of the profit potential being given to private investors .
In this scenario , this is just a cynical move to take private losses from the banks and put them into public hands with a good chunk of the upside still being in private hands .
Privatize the profits , socialize the losses .
What ’s fascinating to me is less about what they ’re doing ( we knew the general details earlier ) than about the fact that they ’re completely bypassing Congress ( as both myself and Taibbi have noted ) , and yet spending huge amounts of money .
Bear in mind that there is only about $ 350 billion or so of Paulson ’s TARP money left .
The treasury portion of the FDIC plan , assuming full loaning , is about $ 120 billion .
The rest of the money will be used for parts 2 and 3 of the plan — a dollar for dollar match with a few securities firm to buy up trash , and the remainder to be used in combination with the Fed to expand lending on some types of securities .
What this means is that $ 850 billion is coming from the FDIC .
The FDIC has n’t been given $ 850 billion in new money by Congress , last I heard .
And this week the Fed announced that it would spend $ 1.15 trillion : $ 300 billion to buy treasuries , $ 750 billion to buy mortgage backed securities guaranteed by Freddie and Fannie , and $ 100 billion of Freddie and Fannie debt .
This amounts to $ 2 trillion of new spending , none of it approved of by Congress .
One might argue that the Fed has the right to print as much money as it feels like ; and that Congress gave it that right in the past ; and that the FDIC , since it can set premiums on members , can spend its money how it chooses ; but there is no question that at the end of the day the government of the US is on the hook for $ 2 trillion more of spending , loans and guarantees and there is no question that Congress was n’t asked .
This week we heard that the deficit was up to 1.8 trillion , and there was much squealing and rending of hair as a result .
But that number is totally fictional .
The Fed , Treasury and FDIC , over the last year or so have spent , loaned , guaranteed and issued trillions of dollars more .
( We ’re not sure how many trillions at this point .
Probably in excess of $ 10 trillion . )
Not to put too fine a point on it , but that ’s a lot of money .
The underlying assumption , as Krugman noted today , is that nothing is fundamentally wrong with the economy ( something I ’ve pointed out myself , in the past ) .
The thinking is : get past this crisis , the values of all the toxic waste will go back up to bubble valuations , and the government will be able to unwind all its positions , and while there will be a cost , it wo n’t be that big .
Now , if you think that there are things fundamentally wrong with the economy , and that fundamental changes are needed to fix said economy , then you are n’t going to like what the administration is doing , because it ’s not clear to you that the values of these assets are going to recover enough , and it is clear to you than the US economy needs a fundamental restructuring .
And the administration is not doing that .
There is no move to reinstate a full fledged renewed Glass - Steagall Act .
There is no move to break up too - large - to - fail banks and to forbid investment banks , brokerages , and commercial banks from being under the same roof .
There is no fundamental restructuring of the tax system to reign in compensation everywhere so that executives do n’t have incentives to burn down their companies for ready profits which can be turned into multi-million dollar bonuses .
It ’s not just recipients of funds which need a 90 % tax rate , it ’s everyone ( though I ’d start the rate at a million dollars , not 250K ) .
And so on — the full list of changes is much longer .
Meanwhile attempts to solve the problem by simply throwing money at it are going to start running up against macroeconomic reality .
Inflation is not everywhere and is always a function of money supply , but if you print enough money ( and the Fed has ) it ’s going to show up somewhere .
In the case of the US it is going to show up in the dollar starting to decline , and in riptide inflation — deflation in some areas will continue , but in other areas inflation will start to take off ( for example , in energy prices ) .
In the end what we have is an administration which has side - stepped Congress to do what it wants to do and spend money without specific Congressional authorization .
Their plans appear to mostly consist of throwing money at the problem and taking bad assets off the hands of the private sector , while making sure that if there are any profits , the private sector gets a good chunk of them , despite only putting up a tiny amount of money .
In other words , they ’re trying to create a secondary bubble .
If they can do so they figure they can pay back enough of the money due to improved asset prices .
If they fail , the US will be as close to bankrupt as a sovereign country can get , though since everyone else will be bankrupt too ( everyone ’s throwing money at the problem ) we can all just pretend that no one ’s bankrupt , I suppose .
But one way or the other , the rich will have had much or most of their bad debts taken off of them and put onto the backs of taxpayers .
Mission accomplished , I suppose .
Privatize the profits , socialize the losses .
Plus ca change …

" How do you spot a liar ?
You ask him the same question three different ways and see if his answers are consistent . "
Allen Stanford , Forbes Magazine .
Allen Stanford was born in Mexia , Texas in 1950 .
He always had an eye for an opportunity .
When he was 13 , he made himself $ 400 by offering to clear a piece of land for a real estate developer on the condition that he could keep the felled trees to sell as firewood .
In 1970 he enrolled at Baylor University , the oldest college in Texas .
Stanford studied finance and , according to his class - mate James Davis , " while the rest of us were beating our brains out , he was making himself a lot of money teaching scuba diving " .
Two years after his graduation Stanford joined his family firm as an entry - level salesman and bookkeeper .
Stanford Financial had been founded by his grandfather , Lodis , in 1932 .
Lodis had been a barber but he spotted an opportunity in the insurance industry during the Great Depression and swapped trades .
His son , Allen 's father , took over the business when the time came .
When Allen Stanford joined the company in 1975 it was a mid-size insurance and real estate concern , with 10,000 customers in Texas .
Over the next 35 years Allen Stanford drove that firm into a multi-billion dollar company , overseeing , according to their own PR , $ 51bn in investments at its peak .
" I could not stay in a small town and be content , " Stanford would later say .
His break came when the Texas oil bubble burst in 1983 .
House prices in Houston declined by 22 % over a four - year period .
Stanford Financial started buying real estate from banks in need of liquidity .
Stanford would later recall : " For 28 months we were probably the only people in Harris County [ Houston ] buying real estate . "
The firm purchased dozens of properties on the cheap .
As the economy recovered over the next 10 years Stanford and his father made several hundred million dollars .
That money provided the capital to kick - start the wealth management firm that would rise and fall so spectacularly over the next 15 years .
Stanford immediately embarked on a push into the Latin American market , purchasing assets in Mexico , Venezuela and Ecuador .
The off - shore banking division of the firm was established in 1985 in Montserrat .
In 1991 , for reasons that have never publicly been made clear , the local government revoked Stanford Financial 's banking licence and the firm packed up shop .
They found the government of Lester Bird in Antigua to be more accommodating and relocated there .
Bird succeeded his father , Vere , as prime minister in 1993 .
In the same year Stanford took over control of his firm from his father .
The two men formed a fruitful partnership .
At that point Stanford Financial had assets worth $ 350 m .
By 2008 Stanford 's personal fortune was $ 2.1bn , enough for Forbes to rank him the 605th richest man in the world .
If the firm 's departure from Montserrat was the first real red flag , there were many more over the years to come .
In 1999 Stanford Financial tried to take over the Antiguan International Business Corps , who regulated offshore companies on the Island .
Cables sent from the US Embassy to the State Department at the time described a " power grab " and added that " the high - powered legal and investigative hired guns from the US are likely being tasked with cleansing the files to make sure there is nothing in them that could damage or implicate the American offshore banker " .
Shortly afterwards the State Department issued an official warning to all domestic financial institutions in the US to be suspicious of transactions with Antiguan banks .
The Bird regime took steps to improve its banking laws .
In Stanford 's own words they " asked him to serve in an advisory capacity to the government " and he hired " a top - notch team of former US legal and regulatory professionals " to reform the banking laws .
In 2001 the warning was lifted and , after that , Stanford 's business in the US surged spectacularly .
In 2003 Stanford Financial 's US branch reported $ 17 m in new deposits .
In 2004 that figure rose to $ 150m .
As the profits grew , Stanford Financial expanded its lobbying activity in Washington .
Between 2000 and 2006 the firm and its employees donated £ 2 m to US political parties and candidates .
The firm made significant contributions to the defence funds of two lawmakers – House members Bob Ney and Tom DeLay – who would later resign from office because of serious financial allegations .
In 2004 Ney , who ultimately served 17 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud , received $ 12,000 in contributions from Stanford Group employees .
At the time Ney was a member of the Financial Services Committee , a body regulating off - shore banking .
In 2005 he had even praised Stanford on the Congressional record , " honouring and congratulating Allen R Stanford for his outstanding achievements " .
Stanford also attracted adverse criticism in the US for repeatedly using an airline under the control of his company – Caribbean Sun – to fly members of the House Caribbean Caucus to the West Indies for meetings and holidays .
There were also other , more trivial warnings of his nature .
Stanford had always claimed to be related to Leland Stanford , the founder of Stanford University .
He even funded the restoration of Leland Stanford 's mansion in Sacramento , in an effort , he said " to help to preserve an important piece of Stanford family history " .
The only trouble was that the family connection did not exist : " We are not aware of any genealogical relationship between Allen Stanford and Leland Stanford , " said a university spokesperson at the time .
Stanford hired his own genealogists to prove , most tenuously , that he was a sixth cousin , twice removed of Leland .
He was a man with a highly developed appreciation of the value of his own public image .
He put his name to polo and tennis tournaments in the US and branded his client Vijay Singh 's golf bag with the company 's eagle logo .
He had also built a groundswell of popular support in Antigua .
As the largest single private employer on the island and a badly needed source of wealth and investment , he was phenomenally popular with the public there .
His cricket tournament , the domestic version of which was first held in 2006 , was the natural extension of those two priorities .
It raised his brand profile in the right demographic and it increased his popularity and status in the Caribbean .
Stanford was already providing the bread and here was the circus .
Many Antiguans would sooner have said a bad word against their government than criticise him .
It helped , of course , that he owned the Antigua Sun newspaper , not to mention the National bank .
His house was actually in St Croix , in the US Virgin Islands .
In Antigua Stanford spent his time on his private yacht , moored off the coast .
He claimed an intense kinship with the people of Antigua , based on the bizarre story of his encounter with a stigmatic priest from the island .
In 1993 Stanford lent his private plane to fly the priest to New York for medical treatment .
The priest had " scars on his hands and feet and oil gushing from his wounds , " he said .
Stanford also described meeting the man as giving a " life - changing " surge of religious faith .
Stanford lent vast sums of money , around $ 65 m according to conservative estimates , to Lester Bird 's government .
It is difficult to be precise – the Bird regime consistently failed to file audited accounts to parliament .
Stanford underwrote the construction of a new hospital and new executive offices for the government and the Stanford cricket ground complex itself .
" There is a misconception that I 'm in bed with Lester Bird , " Stanford would say .
One man who thought the opposite was Baldwin Spencer , leader of the United Progressive Party , who replaced Bird as prime minister in 2004 .
" This man has a lien on our whole country , " Spencer pronounced when he was in opposition .
When Stanford was knighted in 2006 , Spencer refused to stand during the ceremony .
He would later damn Stanford in print as " haughty , arrogant and obnoxious " and deploring his " threats , innuendos and now downright political interference in our nation 's affairs " .
By now , on Jumby Bay , an island - haven for retired financiers just off Antigua 's cost , the table talk of high society was all about where Stanford 's money was coming from .
There are some shrewd business minds on Jumby Bay and Allen Stanford 's sums did not seem to add up .
" He is either one of the world 's greatest philanthropists or one of its biggest crooks , " one Jumby resident said .
But even now there is no question that he did many marvellous things for Antigua , such as the hospital and the slickly run cricket tournaments .
The Securities & Exchange Commission had doubts .
The spark that set the investigation alight was supplied by two former Stanford Financial employees – Charles Rawl and Mark Tidwell – who resigned from the firm in 2008 on the grounds that they had been presented with a " Hobson 's choice " situation , in which they were forced to resign rather than engage in illegal conduct .
On 4 July 2008 it was announced that the SEC had issued both Rawl and Tidwell with subpoenas as part of an ongoing investigation into Stanford Financial .
The plug had been pulled and the dirty water was slowly starting to drain from the bath .
Publicly Stanford was more confident than ever about his firm 's fortunes .
He described his business as recession - proof .
" We have n't been caught up in all that sub - prime mortgage fiasco , " he said in February 2007 .
Indeed he actually believed that the recession would enable him to help his firm grow , saying : " We 're very bullish on making a lot of money in the next 20 years . "
Ultimately his venture into international cricket was an attempt to help him do that while also consolidating his profile and power in the Caribbean .
Like all good con-men he is intensely charismatic .
He has bulging eyes , a booming voice and a handshake that could crush rocks .
He swept people along in his slipstream with his fervour and quick intimacy .
He had a policy of shaking every employee he met by the hand and a habit of thumping people on their backs with unfortunate force .
All his employees wore the Stanford Eagle badge on their lapels and many were kitted out in Stanford - branded polo shirts .
His company was run by Stanford family values , a set of old - time Texan notions .
" Hard work , clear vision , value for the client " ran the company motto .
It was bluster .
Stanford placed himself at the very centre of his business .
Everything orbited around his six - foot - four bulk .
And then , as the gyre widened , things fell apart .
The Madoff scandal had thrust the issue of financial fraud to the front of the agenda and the case against Stanford , after long churning , had hardened into something concrete .
The catastrophic fall - out has begun .

Print This Email This The Central Intelligence Agency disclosed Friday that it has 3,000 summaries , transcripts , reconstructions and memoranda relating to 92 interrogation videotapes that were destroyed by the agency , the American Civil Liberties Union revealed Friday evening .
The agency , however , says they wo n't make them public or provide them to the civil rights group .
The disclosure came as part of a lawsuit .
The CIA says they incinerated the tapes to protect the identities of agents involved in the interrogations .
Their destruction came at the same time a federal judge was seeking information from Bush administration lawyers about the interrogation of alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah .
The CIA also refused to publicly disclose any witnesses who may have viewed the destroyed tapes or had custody of them prior to their destruction .
 The government is still needlessly withholding information about these tapes from the public , despite the fact that the CIA 's use of torture is well known ,  Amrit Singh , staff attorney with the ACLU , said in a release .
 Full disclosure of the CIA 's illegal interrogation methods is long overdue and the agency must be held accountable for flouting the rule of law . 
The CIA could not be reached for comment .
Perhaps not surprisingly , the information came to light late Friday and was sent out by the ACLU in a release at 6:44 PM ET .
Organizations and agencies often release unfavorable information on Friday evenings , because American newspapers have the lowest circulation on Saturdays .
More from the ACLU 's release issued Friday follows .
In December 2007 , the ACLU filed a motion to hold the CIA in contempt for its destruction of the tapes in violation of a court order requiring the agency to produce or identify all records requested by the ACLU .
That motion is still pending .
The agencys latest submission came in response to an August 20 , 2008 court order issued in the context of the contempt motion .
That order required the agency to produce a list of any summaries , transcripts , or memoranda regarding the [ destroyed tapes ] and of any reconstruction of the records  contents  as well as a list of witnesses who may have viewed the videotapes or retained custody of the videotapes before their destruction .
The CIA will provide these lists to the court for in camera review on March 26 , 2009 .
Earlier this month , the CIA acknowledged it destroyed 92 tapes of interrogations .
The tapes , some of which show CIA operatives subjecting suspects to extremely harsh interrogation methods , should have been identified and processed for the ACLU in response to its Freedom of Information Act request demanding information on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody .
The tapes were also withheld from the 9/11 Commission , appointed by former President Bush and Congress , which had formally requested that the CIA hand over transcripts and recordings documenting the interrogation of CIA prisoners .
The governments letter to U.S. District Court Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York is available online here .
The ACLU 's contempt motion and related legal documents are available online here .
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
The social computing phenomenon continues to spread , with news now emerging that Pentagon warboffins are commencing work on a military project entitled " Technologies for the Applications of Social Computing ( TASC ) " - meant to " support leadership decision making at the strategic , operational , and tactical levels " .
But this is not Facebook - style social computing : it 's more like gas dynamics for human beings .
The attempt to harness the awesome power of networked social interactions for the benefit of the US war machine comes , of course , from DARPA - the military research bureau so far beyond the bleeding edge it serves moon - on - a - stick as canapés .
The US warboffins seem to use the phrase " social computing " more to indicate a simulation or model than in the online - chumship sense .
According to a request for whitepapers issued this week , the agency wants nothing less than a sort of automated , rigorous science of people - en - masse :
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , Information Processing Techniques Office ( IPTO ) , invites ... the development of new technologies to rapidly create theoretically - informed , data - driven models of complex human , social , cultural , and behavioral dynamics that are instantiated in near - realtime simulations ... technologies of interest include the formalization and semantic representation of social science theories , the semantic integration of disparate types of social science data , techniques for analyzing these data , and efficient computational techniques for rapid data processing .
DARPA anticipates all these technologies would be integrated to develop a flexible , modular social simulation system that integrates sound social science theory with real world data , that facilitates a wide spectrum of military and intelligence applications , and that supports reliable , real - world decisions ...
They really should have called it Computer Psychohistory , it seems to us , rather than " social computing " - but perhaps nobody at IPTO has read Isaac Asimov 's Foundation novels , unlikely as that seems .
Meanwhile the regular US Army has also made a similar effort this week , handing out $ 2 m to research engineers in Arizona .
Professor Jerzy Rozenblit of Arizona Uni and his team will use this cash to develop software with similar Psychohistory - esque capabilities to those of the proposed TASC .
" I call it CPR , which in this case stands for conflict prediction and resolution , " says Rozenblit .
" Ultimately , these mathematical tools are intended to generate solutions that give us equilibrium , or status quo solutions . "
According to the university 's PR department :
It is compelling to imagine what the world look like today had such software been available during historical asymmetric conflicts , such as between the Greeks and Persians at Thermopylae , or the Rebels and British during the Revolutionary War ... this project is entering the realm of science fiction ... [ the software 's ] potential spreads far beyond the limits of defense ... into the financial world , for example ...
Or indeed into establishing political hegemony over the entire human race .
Fortunately projects like this seldom really work .
Pesky free will or Heisenberg or something gumming up the works , maybe . ®
Wikipedia is put together entirely with the help of its volunteer experts
The Encyclopaedia Britannica has unveiled a plan to let readers help keep the reference work up to date .
Under the plan , readers and contributing experts will help expand and maintain entries online .
Experts will also be enrolled in a reward scheme and given help to promote their command of a subject .
However , Britannica said it would not follow Wikipedia in letting a wide range of people make contributions to its encyclopaedia .
User choice " We are not abdicating our responsibility as publishers or burying it under the now - fashionable ' wisdom of the crowds ' , " wrote Jorge Cauz , president of Encyclopaedia Britannica in a blog entry about the changes .
He added : " We believe that the creation and documentation of knowledge is a collaborative process but not a democratic one . "
Britannica plans to do more with the experts that have already made contributions .
They will be encouraged to keep articles up to date and be given a chance to promote their own expertise .
Selected readers will also be invited to contribute and many readers will be able to use Britannica materials to create their own works that will be featured on the site .
However , it warned these would sit alongside the encyclopaedia entries and the official material would carry a " Britannica Checked " stamp , to distinguish it from the user - generated content .
Alongside the move towards more openness , will be a re-design of the Britannica site and the creation of the web - based tools that visitors can use to put together their own reference materials .
Britannica has unveiled a beta , or trial , version of what will become the finished Britannica Online website .

Brace yourself for a storm of foodie delights , with the Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs trailer .
Featuring Flint ( new character ) , and his invention that makes the skies rain treats , plus Mr. T's in it .
Flint , a failed scientist , finally gets it right with an invention that makes food pour out of the skies .
Until things go disastrously wrong , and the food starts pummeling pedestrians , with donuts and worse .

There are so many things they got right about this adaptation ( which I 'd feared the worst for , because it 's my favorite bedtime tale ) .
First off , they got Bill Hader to voice the main character , which means I 'm going to see the movie no matter what .
But it 's also got the vocal talents of Bruce Campbell , Anna Faris , James Caan , Tracy Morgan , and Mr. T .
So you know this movie means business .
Next on the list of great things about this movie is the fact that the CG ( which is executed in a cute style ) is quite similar to the awesome illustrations from the original book by Ron Barrett , as you can see from the trailer , plus the image below .
Also , the scene where the spaghetti splats on the open - air restaurant - goers — and of course , the scenes of the pancake atop the school — are all included in the original work , as written by Judi Barrett .

And finally , the adapted story is really adorable : just look at Hader 's running TV set .
Also , this is one of the first films that I feel actually deserves its 3D production , because who does n't want to stand under a storm of mashed potatoes ?
Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs will be in theaters September 18th .

By now , you 've probably seen Watchmen and come to your own conclusions .
If you came away wondering what comics you should be reading next , we 're here to help with more than just the usual suspects .

If You Loved The Denseness Of Watchmen :
From Hell
To my mind , this is Alan Moore 's masterpiece ( and one we 've already recommended - 500 + pages that look behind ( and beyond ) the legend of Jack the Ripper to offer a dissertation on murder , majesty and London , ably ( and atmospherically ) illustrated by Eddie Campbell .
As full and as deep as Watchmen at its best , but with more subtlety and patience , From Hell offers a rich experience that may not offer as many people in costumes , but may be all the more rewarding for that .

If You Loved The Way The Book Played With The Comic Medium :
Or Else
On the face of it , Kevin Huizenga 's work is almost the very opposite of Watchmen ; in many cases autobiographical and entirely devoid of superheroes or apocalyptic scenarios .
But Huizenga shares a fascination - and desire to experiment - with the language of comics that goes beyond what Moore and Gibbons did in Watchmen , moving into abstract images and wordlessness that takes the medium in directions that Dr. Manhattan would be proud of .
The best example - and the place to start - would be Or Else # 2 , " Gloriana , " where a sunset turns into something altogether more unusual and magical .

If You Loved The Adult Approach To Superheroes :
Sleeper
Ed Brubaker and Sean Philips ' story of a superpowered secret agent who goes undercover in a criminal organization only to get in way over his head - emotionally and strategically - offers up both the nods to comics ' past ( Especially in the twisted secret origins that pepper the series ) and the " real people who just happen to have superpowers " aspects of Watchmen , but take the latter much further ; the characters here are n't the iconic archetypes and stereotypes of Moore and Gibbons ' book , but much more genuine , believable , and recognizable as us .
Brubaker and Philips ' Incognito , which just launched a couple of months ago , is in a similar vein and well worth checking out as well .

If You Loved Dr. Manhattan 's Cosmic Perspective :
The Invisibles
Much longer , chaotic and disorganized than Watchmen , Grant Morrison 's long - running story of the 1990s
The Invisibles crosses time , dimensions and questions the very nature of reality on a regular basis .
Ripped off by The Matrix , The Invisibles is a much more individual work ( although stealing from multiple sources itself , shamelessly ) that wants to change the way you look at the world , if you let it .

If You Loved The Near - Future Setting Of Watchmen :
100 %
I 've recommended Paul Pope 's work here enough to make it clear that I 'm a massive fanboy , but that does n't change the fact that 100 % is the ideal follow - on if you liked the small details that made Watchmen 's world so similar - but - different to our own .
Focusing on the characters allows him to sneak in all manner of alternate - world SFisms without you noticing until it's too late , but this is a beautiful and necessary book that , come to think of it , should be made into a movie of its own .
Just keep Zack Snyder away from it .

If You Loved The Cold War World - building of Watchmen :
American Flagg
Howard Chaykin's American Flagg - a 1980s contemporary of Watchmen - takes the Cold War paranoia of Moore and Gibbons in a whole new , satirical , direction and to the world of 2031 , where America 's government has moved to Mars , turned corporate and taken on a particularly Russian approach to some subjects , allowing former television star and new " Plexus Ranger " Reuben Flagg to try and keep the peace in a future Chicago .
Sharing a similar dark humor to Watchmen , it 's as much a product of its time , but well worth checking out .

If You Want Cold War World - Building In A Near - Future Setting Complete With An Adult Approach To Superheroes , But Without That High - Brow Shit :
The Dark Knight Returns
Okay , there 's really no avoiding this one although , chances are , if you 've read Watchmen , you 've also read this ; Dark Knight , created around the same time as Watchmen , and the book that made Frank Miller into the superstar megalomaniac that he is today , still stands as a singular achievement and the book that Batman stories are still measured against today .
And why not ?
Whether it's the satire of Reagan 's appearances , the cynical re-view on Superman or the dystopia of Gotham taken to the Nth degree , there 's a lot to admire about this book even twenty years ( and countless rip - offs ) later .

If You Want To See Where It All Started :
Miracleman
Moore 's first series of note - now , sadly , out of print and lost in a legal mess over rights issues - was n't just the start of his career , but also the the first major deconstructionist superhero work in mainstream American comics .
Taking a cloned version of Captain Marvel and pushing him into a more realistic world without entirely undoing everything that came before , Moore rehearsed many of the ideas in Watchmen here , but in a less formal , more human way .
One day , this series will hopefully return to bookstores and everyone will see the connections ; for now , spend your time in back issue bins and on eBay looking for the original issues or collected editions .

If You Want A More Optimistic Period Piece About Superheroes :
DC : The New Frontier
In many ways , the polar opposite of Watchmen ( The cynicism and despair of that book being replaced with a boldness , optimism and strong belief in the inherent goodness of its characters ) , New Frontier is no less an achievement .
Darwyn Cooke 's beautiful take on the origins of DC's Silver Age characters ( focusing mostly on Green Lantern , but taking in so many more along the way ) is , in its own ways , as much a love letter to comics and superheroes as Watchmen is , but simply one that chooses to focus on the happier side of things .
And , with Cooke 's amazing artwork ( presented in a three - panel format for the entire book , in much the same way that Watchmen adheres to a nine - panel format throughout ) , I have to commit potential heresy and admit that New Frontier looks much , much better than Watchmen .

And when the aide left to start his lobbying firm in 1989 , he helped Mr. Murtha recruit major military contractors to attend a new annual trade fair in Johnstown that became the cornerstone of the lawmaker ’s effort to steer business to the area .
Mr. Magliocchetti set up shop at the busy intersection between political fund - raising and taxpayer spending , directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarked contracts back to his clients .
Since 1998 , for example , employees of the firm and its clients have contributed more than $ 40 million to lawmakers , including more than $ 7.8 million to members on the House defense spending panel and $ 2.4 million to Mr. Murtha , its chairman .
The same lawmakers , meanwhile , have helped finance hundreds of pet projects sought by PMA clients , including earmarks for more than $ 300 million in the military spending bill passed last year alone .
And PMA , still owned by Mr. Magliocchetti until its collapse , grew into a K Street powerhouse with more than $ 15 million a year in lobbying fees .
Questionable contributions linked to PMA employees appear to be one subject of the federal investigation , which came to light with reports that teams of F.B.I. agents had searched Mr. Magliocchetti’s home and the offices of PMA in Northern Virginia in November .
For example , lawmakers have reported more than $ 150,000 in tandem contributions over the last four years from the sommelier , John Pugliese , and the golf club marketing director , Jon Walker , both of whom live near Mr. Magliocchetti’s Florida vacation home and are sometimes listed as PMA employees .
Campaign finance reports include another $ 1.5 million since 2000 from Mr. Magliocchetti’s family .
And about $ 95,000 over the last three years was credited to Julie Giardina , a 30 - year - old lobbyist who joined PMA after a stint as a Defense Department employee working for Mr. Murtha ’s staff .
None of the reported donors returned repeated telephone calls .
Accepting such contributions , however , poses relatively little risk for lawmakers unless prosecutors can prove knowing complicity in the scheme , ethics lawyers say .
Enjoying Mr. Magliocchetti’s personal hospitality , on the other hand , could bring an ethics rebuke or more serious accusations of favor - trading .
Friends and veteran military industry lobbyists say Mr. Magliocchetti acquired his taste for the high life as a Congressional staff member wined and dined by lobbyists in the era before strict ethics rules .
In addition to his habit of ordering tables of food from the Alpine kitchen  a lobbyist would pick up the tab  Mr. Magliocchetti picked up a taste for gumbo on visits to shipbuilders around New Orleans , and a fondness for cowboy boots from former Representative Charlie Wilson of Texas ( the “ good - time Charlie ” whose energetic nightlife was the subject of the recent film “ Charlie Wilson ’s War ” ) .
The background of a December 2001 article in Vanity Fair about the social life of a young Congressional aide captured a snapshot of Mr. Magliocchetti in his element .
Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks , he and a PMA colleague , Daniel Cunningham , were hosting a rowdy table of lawmakers at dinner in a private room in the Capital Grille that included Representatives Mike Doyle , Tim Holden and Robert A. Brady of Pennsylvania ; Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. of New Jersey ; Representative Michael E. Capuano of Massachusetts ; Representative John B. Larson of Connecticut ; and former Representative John Baldacci of Maine , now governor .
( Mr. Larson reportedly led the group in a sing - a- long of Beatles , Frank Sinatra and Rolling Stones songs . )
All were members of an informal group that followed Mr. Murtha ’s lead .
Asked recently about the night , representatives of the lawmakers declined to comment ..
Suppose you want to write to a Google Spreadsheet from a Python script .
Here ’s an example spreadsheet that you might want to update from a script :
I did some searching and found this page , which quickly led me to the Python Developer ’s Guide for the Google Spreadsheet API .
There ’s a simple “ Getting started with Gdata and Python ” page .
The upshot is 1 ) make sure you have a recent version of Python ( e.g. 2.5 or higher ) , then 2 ) install the Google Data Library .
The commands I used were pretty much
mkdir ~/gdata
( download the latest Google data Python library into the ~ / gdata directory )
unzip gdata.py - 1.2.4.zip ( or whatever version you downloaded )
sudo ./setup.py install
That ’s it .
You can test that everything installed fine by running “ ./tests/run_data_tests.py ” to verify that the tests all pass .
The program “./samples/docs/docs_example.py ” lets you list all of your Google Spreadsheets , for example .
An extremely useful program that lets you insert rows right into a spreadsheet is “./samples/spreadsheets/spreadsheetExample.py ” and someone has also got a really nice example of uploading a machine ’s dynamic IP address to a spreadsheet .
The most painful thing is that InsertRow ( ) must be called with a spreadsheet key and a worksheet key .
If you find out those values , you could hardcode them into the script and probably cut the size of the script in half .
Or you could just look in the url to see the key value .
That ’s what I did .
So here ’s an miniature example script to write to a Google Spreadsheet from a Python script :
#!/usr/bin/python
import time
import gdata.spreadsheet.service
email = 'youraccount@gmail.com '
password = ' yourpassword '
weight = ' 180 '
# Find this value in the url with ' key =XXX ' and copy XXX below
spreadsheet_key = ' pRoiw3us3wh1FyEip46wYtW '
# All spreadsheets have worksheets .
I think worksheet # 1 by default always
# has a value of ' od6 '
worksheet_id = ' od6 '
spr_client = gdata.spreadsheet.service.SpreadsheetsService ()
spr_client.email = email
spr_client .
password = password
spr_client.source = ' Example Spreadsheet Writing Application '
spr_client.ProgrammaticLogin ()
# Prepare the dictionary to write
dict = {}
dict [ ' date ' ] = time.strftime ('%m/%d/%Y ')
dict [ ' time ' ] = time.strftime (' %H:%M:%S ')
dict [ ' weight ' ] = weight
print dict
entry = spr_client .
InsertRow ( dict , spreadsheet_key , worksheet_id )
if isinstance ( entry , gdata.spreadsheet.SpreadsheetsList ) :
print " Insert row succeeded . "
else :
print " Insert row failed . "
That ’s it .
Run the script to append a new row to the current spreadsheet .
By the way , if you make a chart from the spreadsheet data , you can right - click on the chart , select “ Publish chart … ” from the menu , and get a snippet of HTML to copy / paste that will embed the chart on a web page .
It will look like this :
That ’s a live image served up by Google , and when the spreadsheet gets new data , the image should update too .
In my last post on higher dimensions , I alluded to the fact that I do n’t agree completely with certain notions about higher dimensions .
Specifically , I disagree with the idea that the intuition that you take for granted in low dimensions is necessarily ill - equipped to serve you in higher dimensions .
Low - dimensional intuition is ill - equipped for many problems , and like most other topics in math , it ’s usually most sensible to do the calculations anyway .
Hyperspheres often get brought up with the subject of weirdness in higher dimensions , mostly because they ’re easy to understand , and it ’s easy to demonstrate the weirdness very quickly .
But are they completely weird ?
Are the examples really fair , or are hyperspheres getting a bad rap ?
First , let ’s get some notation out of the way .
We often like to call a hypersphere an n-sphere , because it ’s an n-dimensional manifold .
Technically , one of these can exist in any metric space with more than n dimensions ( because I ’m talking about intuition , I ’m assuming it ’s Euclidean space ) .
For simplicity , though , we ’ll say that it lives in n+1 space , so that we can define it easily :
That ’s not all that I want to talk about , though .
I also want to talk about the volume of the n-sphere , and in that case , we often talk about a ball , which is just the interior of a sphere .
The interior of an n-sphere is an ( n+1 ) - ball , because if the sphere is an n-dimensional manifold , its interior is an ( n+1 ) - dimensional manifold :
Or more simply :
The volume of this object has a somewhat simple formula :
Where Γ( x ) represents the Gamma function ( which is a tad more complicated ) .
So where ’s the counter - intuition ?
Say that we took the unit ball for all n > 0 and graphed its volume :
This does seem a little odd .
The volume goes up , hits a peak at 5 , and then drops , and eventually bottoms out .
In fact , with high enough dimension , you wo n’t see an n- ball have any volume at all .
The limit of the volume of any n-ball as n goes to infinity is 0 .
That is weird .
That ’s not necessarily something that you ’d expect .
It also seems weird that the volume starts dropping after a while .
But is all this really that strange ?
What if we fixed the radius at , say , 1/sqrt ( π ) ?
The volume vs. dimension is then just a decreasing function , even at low dimensions .
Not surprising when you consider that radii less than 1 should make the volume diminish rapidly .
So what about radii greater than 1 ?
What if we fix r at say , 3 ?
The volume peaks out at n = 56 , and the volume is about 143 billion … somethings .
After that , the volume diminishes back to zero again .
All that we ’re really saying here is that the geometry of the sphere dominates rn , but rn has enough power to dominate at low dimensions until the geometry cuts over .
What ’s so special about rn though ?
Why is this the gold standard by which we judge the hypersphere ?
It ’s just the hypercube with sides of length r.
In fact , the unit sphere is inscribed in a cube with sides of length 2r .
What if we considered a hypercube of circumradius r instead of inradius r?
That means that a sphere of radius r contains it .
If that ’s the case , then it has volume strictly less than the sphere ’s volume .
In fact , its volume is :
which diminishes even faster than the sphere ’s volume .
So it ca n’t be the geometry of a cube that makes it keep its volumetric power .
So what ’s my point ?
This is all sounding very counterintuitive .
My point is that when you talk about counter - intuition in higher dimensions , it ’s helpful to talk about what ’s actually going on , instead of maligning poor innocent constructs like the hypersphere .
What ’s actually going on ?
More about that later .
But for now , consider this : no matter how many dimensions a sphere has , it ’s always perfectly round , and perfectly isotropic .
That ’s intuition that is n’t lost in higher dimensions .

Adam Smith argued that all it took to move a country from the lowest form of barbarism to the highest opulence was peace , easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice .
Now a lot of core institutions and public policies are embedded in a regime of peace , easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice that we as scholars of political economy need to tease out and explain clearly .
But it is not like Smith and Hume , or Hayek and Buchanan are silent on what that recipe for economic growth and prosperity is in terms of core institutions and public policy .
One of my fellow graduate students from the early 1980s Dan Mitchell does an excellent job in this video explaining the sources of economic prosperity .
Dan has several videos online which are excellent tools for communicating basic economic policy .
To my mind , Russ Roberts found his niche with podcasts , and Dan may have found his niche with these short video presentations .
Perhaps President Obama can put down the blackberry for a minute and go to I - tunes and subscribe to EconTalk , or check out You Tube and watch the videos from the Center for Freedom and Prosperity .
It would be time well spent .
Teens spend average of 87 hours a year looking at porn online
The average teenager spends one hour and 40 minutes a week browsing sites for pornography , according to new research .
That equates to 87 hours a year spent surfing for porn .
A further hour and 35 minutes is spent looking at dieting and weight loss websites .
The study of 1,000 youngsters found the average teenager was online 31 hours each week looking at soft pornography , plastic surgery , dieting , family planning and emotional support .
Teenagers are spending more than eight hours a week browsing the internet for soft porn , plastic surgery and family planning websites
Another hour and eight minutes is dedicated to exploring cosmetic surgery websites , to learn about breast surgery , bum lifts and collagen implants .
The research was conducted by CyberSentinel.co.uk , a computer software that enables parents to block websites and monitor use of the internet .
Ellie Puddle , Marketing Director of CyberSentinel , said : ' The alarming thing about this research is that it shows that teenagers are obviously exploring all sorts of topics as a result of modern - day pressures .
' For instance , pressure to emulate celebrity standards of beauty is resulting in teens spending a significant amount of time researching cosmetic surgery .
The research has also found that they 're viewing information on contraceptives and pregnancy and sex as well as weight loss .
' And for some reason they find it easier to go online to conduct their research than asking mum and dad for advice .
' Using the internet to research topics which are difficult to talk about is fine , but parents should agree and set boundaries to protect their children from accessing inappropriate material . '
The poll revealed teenagers spend at least three hours and 10 minutes a week researching topics for their homework , and another one hour and 40 minutes downloading or listening to music .
A further two hours and two minutes is spent looking at clips on YouTube , whilst an hour and 22 minutes is spent scouring NHS direct or other health websites for information about illnesses , puberty and growing pains .
Chat rooms , forums , MSN , and social networking sites such as Facebook also play an important role in the average life of a teenager , who can spend up to nine hours a week chatting to friends and new acquaintances .
One in four teenagers admit they regularly talk to strangers online , and think it is completely harmless .
Ms Puddle added : ' Talking to friends on social networking websites can be completely risk - free good fun for teenagers .
' But there is also the danger of meeting strangers in these forums who are n't browsing the sites to " make friends " .
' In many cases these " online predators " are scouring the web for impressionable friendly young people to talk to , and in time , meet face to face .
' Teenagers and parents need to realise the dangers of talking to strangers online but parents must not over - react by denying access to the internet .
The internet is a fantastic resource for learning and development . '
The most common venue for teenagers to surf the web is the bedroom ( 33 per cent ) , followed by their parent 's study or living room ( 27 per cent ) .
But 13 to 19 year - olds readily admit they are left alone with the computer for up to two hours a day , that 's 14 hours a week .
An hour of this time is spent looking at emotional support sites such as The Samaritans ; another hour and 15 minutes is spent on dating websites and a further hour and a half on auction websites .
And for an hour and 55 minutes teenagers are creating online personas on virtual world sites such as Second Life .
Two thirds of teenagers say their parents have spoken with them about what they should and should n't look at online .
And 45 per cent will talk to their parents if they are worried about anything they have accidentally accessed - such as self harming , drugs , knife crime or sex .
But a third have also admitted to hiding some of the websites they have been visiting from their parents .
The Supreme Court brushed past flimsy arguments by the gun lobby this week to uphold an important restriction on gun ownership that protects public safety .
The 7 - to - 2 decision upheld a broad reading of a 1996 federal law written by Senator Frank Lautenberg , Democrat of New Jersey , that bars people convicted of crimes involving domestic violence from owning guns .
A narrow interpretation of the law , excluding domestic abusers convicted of a generic charge of battery , would have rearmed thousands of dangerous people .
The ruling was the court ’s first on guns since last year ’s landmark decision striking down the District of Columbia ’s ban on possessing handguns in the home .
It was an encouraging sign that the court sees no blanket constitutional barrier to common - sense regulation of firearms .
It is notable that not even the two dissenters in the case  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia  asserted that depriving domestic abusers of guns raises a Second Amendment issue .
Unfortunately , the same good sense on gun violence did not prevail in Congress .
On Thursday , the Senate voted , 61 - to - 37 , to end a longstanding affront to democracy by giving residents of Washington a voting representative in Congress .
In a classic bit of political horse trading , the measure would actually enlarge the House by two seats : one for the overwhelmingly Democratic District of Columbia , and one for Utah , whose population growth justifies a seat that would likely go to the Republicans .

( CNN ) --
As President Obama reversed the Bush administration 's limits on embryonic stem - cell research , he said scientific decisions must be " based on facts , not ideology . "
President Obama lifted a ban that limited federally funded embryonic stem cell research .
The president on Monday signaled a clear shift in tone from the Bush administration on a broad range of scientific issues .
Obama overturned an order signed by President Bush in 2001 that barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time .
Bush twice vetoed legislation that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research .
Those siding with Bush say scientific advances allow researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos .
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told The Washington Post he thought Obama 's policy reversal on stem - cell research was an " ideological sideshow . "
" It is dangerous for the Obama administration to pick a wide series of fights , " Gingrich told the newspaper .
" Each of these fights simply drains energy away and increases the coalition which decides it has a collective interest in stopping everything . "
Obama also signed a memorandum that directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy " to develop a strategy for restoring scientific integrity to government decision - making . "
Obama 's action is part of a broader effort to separate science and politics , White House domestic policy adviser Melody Barnes said Sunday .
Watch Rep. Chris Smith say Obama is " behind the times " »
But it 's not just on the issue of stem cells where science and politics collide .
In his first weeks in office , Obama has taken ambitious steps to untangle what has been an intertwined relationship .
The Bush administration came under frequent criticism from environmentalists who warned the president was n't doing enough to lessen what they saw as the damaging impact the United States has on the globe .
Within a week of taking office , Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review a California application to regulate greenhouse gases and told his Department of Transportation to begin implementing fuel efficiency standards passed last year but not implemented by the Bush administration .
If the EPA grants a waiver allowing California to set its own emissions standards , the nation 's most populous state will be allowed to require automakers to produce trucks and cars that get better mileage than what is required under the current national standard .
Thirteen other states could take similar action .
The Bush administration rejected California 's application , agreeing with automakers that the creation of another set of rules regarding pollution standards for some states would be confusing and unenforceable .
In Obama 's recent speech to Congress , the president said the United States will double its supply of renewable energy in three years .
To do so , he 's calling on a new class of workers to be trained in environmental fields .
Green jobs training programs will get $ 500 million from his stimulus package .
By 2025 , the Obama administration hopes one - fourth of the nation 's energy will come from renewable sources .
Over the long term , the president hopes to create millions of new jobs by investing $ 150 billion in taxpayer money to help private companies develop new sources of clean energy , such as wind , solar and geothermal power .
While environmentalists are encouraged by Obama 's focus on renewable energy and stricter emissions standards , some economists are skeptical he can pull the country out of the recession while cleaning up the planet .
Read about Obama 's balancing act
" Government can push new policies , but it has to prove to be economically competitive or else it will not happen , " said Bill Chameides , dean of the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University .
In another break from the Bush administration , Obama last week overturned a regulation that many environmentalists claim weakened the Endangered Species Act .
The regulation , issued a few weeks before Bush left office , made it easier for federal agencies to skip consultations with government scientists before launching projects that could affect endangered wildlife .
By overturning the regulation , Obama said he had restored " the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the Endangered Species Act , a process undermined by past administrations . "
Obama has n't shied away from talking about climate change .
He campaigned on promises to eliminate oil imports from the Middle East , reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent and create a green energy economy .
Bush , a onetime oil executive , was widely criticized for refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol , which aimed to limit greenhouse gas concentrations .
When Bush delivered a speech on climate change that set up guidelines to slow growth of greenhouse gas emissions in April 2008 , Democrats wrote it off as too little , too late .
Bush also came under fire after the White House acknowledged in 2003 that it asked for revisions in a report by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Critics said the revisions were made to play down the threat of global warming to humans as well as the ecology , but the Bush administration insisted that it was taking climate change seriously .
But even Sen. John McCain , the former Republican presidential nominee , tried to highlight his differences with Bush on environmental issues .
He had a campaign ad emphasizing times he " stood up to the president " and " sounded the alarm on global warming . "
Obama on Monday said his goal is " for America to lead the world in the discoveries it one day may yield . "
While some have questioned his investments in science and energy , Obama has expressed confidence in his plan for " advancing the cause of science in America . "
" By doing this , we will ensure America 's continued global leadership in scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs , " he said .
" And that is essential , not only for our economic prosperity , but for the progress of all humanity . "

Obama offers olive branch to Iranians in new video RAW STORY
Published : Friday March 20 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US President Barack Obama launched an historic direct appeal to the Iranian people on Friday , urging an end to decades of animosity and offering " honest " engagement with the Islamic Republic .
A top advisor to Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad welcomed Obama 's olive branch , but urged Washington to recognize and repair " past mistakes . "
Obama said in a video message marking the Iranian New Year , Nowruz , that his administration " is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States , Iran and the international community . "
In a new decisive break with his predecessor , President George W. Bush , Obama called the celebrations a time of " new beginnings . "
He said he wanted a new era of " engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect . "
Obama said he wanted " constructive ties " with Iran , which could take its " rightful place " in the world if it renounced terror and embraced peace .
" For nearly three decades relations between our nations have been strained , " he said .
" But at this holiday we are reminded of the common humanity that binds us together . "
The two nations have had no diplomatic ties since 1980 , following Iran 's Islamic revolution and the taking of US diplomats as hostages for more than a year .
Bush lumped Iran in his " Axis of Evil " with North Korea and Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , then led international accusations that Iran is seeking to build a nuclear bomb .
Iranian officials regularly refer to Washington as the " Great Satan . "
" We welcome the wish of the president of the United States to put away past differences , " the Iranian president 's press advisor Ali Akbar Javanfekr told AFP in Tehran .
But he added : " The American administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . "
" If Obama shows willingness to take action , the Iranian government will not show its back to him , " Javanfekr said , while condemning what he called the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the American government . "
Iran 's Energy Minister Parviz Fattah said : " Absolutely this message is positive ... although it might also have negative points in itself as well . "
Iran 's leaders " will precisely assess this message .
We believe that we need that in addition to messages we need positive action from Mr. Obama as well as from his government , " the minister said in Islamabad .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana described the Obama video as " a very constructive message " that could " open a new chapter " in international relations with Tehran .
" I hope very much that the Iranians will take good attention " to Obama 's message , he told reporters in Brussels .
Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov also welcomed the statement .
" The start of substantive dialogue will facilitate the revival of trust in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran 's nuclear program , " he said .
Without restating accusations of Iran 's support for terrorism or its nuclear program , Obama said " the United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . "
" You have that right -- but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place cannot be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the Iranian people and civilization .
" And the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . "
Obama highlighted the potential for " greater opportunities for partnership and commerce .
" It 's a future where the old divisions are overcome , where you and all of your neighbors and the wider world can live in greater security and greater peace . "
Obama 's address signals his administration 's recognition of Iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though he has declined to rule out military action to stop Iran obtaining nuclear weapons .
Obama pledged during his election campaign last year to engage with Washington 's adversaries .
During his January 20 inaugural address he promised the Muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . "
The Iranian president then encouraged Obama to " put an end to the expansionist policies " of the United States .
Iran could be a key player in the United States exit from Iraq , tackling the Taliban in Afghanistan , and progress on the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors .
The White House said a version of the video with Farsi subtitles was distributed to news outlets in the region Friday .
There is also an online version .
A full transcript is available in English and Persian .

He has written more than 200,000 - yes , 200,000 - books to date , but today marked a first for Professor Philip M Parker , who picked up the Diagram prize for the Oddest Book Title of the Year for his enticing The 2009 - 2014 World Outlook for 60 - Milligram Containers of Fromage Frais .
The book is a worthy winner , beating off competition from Baboon Metaphysics , Curbside Consultation of the Colon and The Large Sieve and its Applications to take the prize , but Parker , who has described himself as " the most published author in the history of the planet " , might just as easily have been nominated for his vast library of other books .
If they had the necessary disposable income , who could resist the niche appeal of The 2007 - 2012 Outlook for Lemon - Flavoured Bottled Water in Japan , a snip at $ 495 , or The 2007 Import and Export Market for Household Refrigerators in Czech Republic ( just $ 112 ) ?
Parker , a professor of management science at French business school Insead , achieves his prolific authorship thanks to his invention - and patenting - of a machine which writes books , creating them from internet and database searches in order to eliminate or substantially reduce " the costs associated with human labour , such as authors , editors , graphic artists , data analysts , translators , distributors and marketing personnel " .
The Bookseller magazine , which runs the Diagram prize , said that Parker had not , as yet , responded to its attempts to contact him to inform him of his triumph .
" It 's an undoubtedly odd title , " said Philip Stone , charts editor and awards administrator at the Bookseller .
" I think it 's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer , but given the number of celebrity memoirs out there that are ghostwritten , I do n't think it 's too strange . "
The book highlights , he said , " an area that perhaps we are all guilty of ignoring as we push our trolleys down supermarket aisles .
What does the future hold for these items ?
Well , given that fromage frais normally comes in 60 - gram containers , not 60 - milligram , one would assume that the world outlook for 0.06 - gram containers of fromage frais is pretty bleak .
But I 'm not willing to pay $ 795 to find out . "
Parker 's title garnered 32 % of the total public vote for the prize , well ahead of the second - placed Baboon Metaphysics , which took 22 % .
The other contenders were Strip and Knit with Style , and Techniques for Corrosion Monitoring .
Fromage Frais ... joins a selection of previous winners to have gloried in obscurity , including The Theory of Lengthwise Rolling , and The Book of Marmalade : Its Antecedents , Its History and Its Role in the World Today .
Many winners of the prize , established in 1978 as a way to avoid boredom at the Frankfurt book fair , have tended towards the suggestive , such as 1993 's classic American Bottom Archaeology , and High Performance Stiffened Structures , which won in 2000 .
Last year Greek Rural Postmen and their Cancellation Numbers was voted the oddest title of the last 30 years by the public .
" I want to make it very clear , " said Stone , " that I 'm not suggesting the books are odd , just the titles . "
Medicii americani au ajuns la concluzia au ajuns ca prea putin somn in fiecare noapte duce la depunerea calciului in interiorul arterelor , un fenoment comparabil cu depunerea colesterolului
pe peretii arterelor .
Aceste depuneri ingusteaza calibrul arterelor pana la blocarea vaselor de sange , iar tesuturile din jur se distrug .
Astfel apar infarctul miocardic acut sau accidental cerebral .
Studiile au aratat ca persoanele care dorm cu o ora mai putin decat programul normal de odihna sunt cu 16 % mai mult expuse riscului depunerii calciului pe artere .
Iata un argument in plus a respecta ca la carte odihna .

This next image of exactly the same area is from Microsoft Live Maps , and far from simply being a much older image taken before the facility was built , this was actually captured in 2007 …
Thanks to widespread coverage , many people are now familiar with the idea that “ sensitive ” areas of our planet are being hidden from view in the images that online mapping services display .
It ’s also commonly understood that the images are usually altered by the company who originally took them ( rather than Google , Microsoft , Yahoo , or any other buyer ) , allowing them to remain in line with their local laws and regulations .
Such areas include military installations , government buildings , and airports – but the point is usually simply to prevent people from viewing the exact details of the site , rather than attempting to deny their very existence .
Last year we saw some imagery in the Netherlands had been altered in a more dramatic way – drawing the ridicule of the Photoshop Disasters blog in the process – which in turn led to even wider recognition of the attempted cover up .
Well , it seems that the companies engaged in these activities have been paying attention , because closer examination of the supposed location of NAS Sigonella reveals that while there are clearly artificial repetitions of parts of the image , the overall result is by far the best Photoshop job we ’ve seen on either MS Live or Google Maps .
Unfortunately , to the west of the site we can still see part of a runway that our inexperienced Photoshopper neglected to cover up – so there ’s definitely still room for improvement .

So is this the start of a new trend ?
Will satellite and aerial photography companies now need to employ full time digital artists to hide things the governments do n’t want you to see ?
Or is this just another example of Microsoft attempting to up the ante against Google ?

I just finished reading Cormac McCarthy ’s The Road .
Just now , not five minutes ago .
By the time this finally gets posted , I ’m sure I ’ll revise most of what is about to spew forth from my fingers , but for now I ’ll just let it all come out .
I know we are a movie site , not a book site , and this article will eventually get around to talking about the adaptation of McCarthy ’s post - apocalyptic ( in every way ) novel .
I want to look at the problems the filmmakers must have had in adapting it .
I want to look at the themes , the characters , and the cinematic value ( or lack thereof ) .
Right now , though , all I can do is sit back and say “ Damn .
That was a powerful ending . ”
Reader be warned ; spoilers await .
If you want to remain pure , this is not your article .
With that in mind , though , know that the novel has very few twists , turns , or surprises .
Like its title suggests , the plot trudges ever onward , our “ heroes ” on a journey whose end is telegraphed and clear .
As I read the book , I did n’t like it very much .
Nothing really happened .
It was bleak and clear and obvious , and eventful moments did n’t amount to much .
Every small episode meant little in the grand scheme … this was truly a novel about staying alive , surviving , and seeing if you had the strength to do it all again tomorrow .
About the time I reached the part where the father and son stumble on a fully - stocked bunker , though , I started to get it .
I smiled as they partook in the small joys of canned fruit and a warm bed .
But it was all bittersweet .
Any comfort could not last , and resignation to death might be the only kindness offered in McCarthy ’s bleak world .
So when our characters stumble on a means to survive , to continue in this hell indefinitely , is it really a blessing ?
That ’s what the book is about .
Carrying the fire – that ’s what the boy calls it .
And there is a huge price to pay for doing so .
I finished this book off in a book store .
Big mistake .
I sipped my Tazo ( registered trademark ) tea and tried to shield my welling tears from a concerned - looking barista .
The book ends the only way it could have .
And even though you see this death ( and hope ) coming down the road a mile away , it ’s still wildly emotionally ( and dare I say spiritually ? ) affecting .
Here ’s what it comes down to : it ’s really fucking easy to make a novel about “ hope ” and pretend it ’s profound .
Put characters through some terrible shit , and just when they ca n’t take it anymore you rescue them from their predicament .
Or , in the end , they find inner-piece through some other - worldly enlightenment .
It ’s trite , it ’s easy , and it ’s cheap .
This story , though , does n’t do that .
There is no great enlightenment .
There is nothing at the end of this novel that was n’t there when it started .
It ’s just “ the breath of God ” and , more importantly , “ maps of the world and its becoming . ”
The final paragraph of the book tells you what this story is .
And you know why this story is good ?
Because its theme ca n’t be summed up in a simple sentence like “ Hope is good . ”
Hell , it ca n’t be summed up in a paragraph , a page , or even en entire analytical novel .
The meaning exists in the poetry of the way the story unfolds –the way it says what ca n’t be easily put into words .
That ’s the mark of a great work of art .
Needless to say , this does not bode well for the film adaptation , directed by John Hillcoat .
Its release date has already been pushed back twice , and early rumblings on the film were that it was not good .
I can see where it might go wrong .
There are a thousand places to misstep .
For one , the novel really has no story to speak of .
There is no “ three act structure ” with obstacles to be overcome in order to reach a goal .
The goal is nebulous , and the obstacles are fleeting and incidental .
The characters conquer one threat after another , only to find themselves in exactly the same predicament and in the same emotionally hopeless state .
This does not usually make for good cinema .
There are two ways to handle this problem–a good way and a bad way .
The bad way would be to inflate a few of the book ’s encounters .
To make them wildly affecting to the two main characters , life - changing even , and to artificially string a plot around these that has no business being there .
The movie becomes hopeless for no reason , and the plot injects meaning that has no purpose .
The whole film , then , is just another man - against - the - world apocalypse movie .
The good way is to let the movie feel episodic .
Let the audience squirm in their seats .
Develop this AS A THEME , and do everything you can to bring it out ( short of having the actors ham - handedly muse about it ) .
The monotony of these characters ’ circumstances is as important as anything else in the book .
That ’s the central question the novel raises … when do you give up ?
When is it not worth it anymore ?
When is dying better than living ?
This answer cannot be raised in an action - packed film .
When a man is fighting for survival all the time , he is too busy to ask these questions .
When he performs horrendous acts and finds himself back where he started , making his way down a long road with time to think , that ’s when these ideas really start to take shape .
I have not seen the movie yet , so this is all random musings and pure speculation .
I hope John Hillcoat gets it .
Based on his previous work , I think he might .
The subtlety in The Proposition was breathtaking , and its ability to illustrate themes without overtly stating them is what makes that movie affecting .
The other key to adapting the novel comes from a very specific passage near the end of the book .
“ This has been a long time coming .
Now it ’s here . ”
When we meet the man and his son , the man should know how this whole story is going to end .
He should know his fate .
Whether he is sick or not , he knows it ’s only a matter of weeks , months , days , until he ca n’t continue .
But he has to continue .
“ Existential ” is a buzz word , but if there ever was a novel that fit the term , this is it .
The book is about continuing on in the face of God ’s absence , the face of human suffering , the face of absurdity , and the face of your own certain doom .
Continuing on simply because you choose to .
If the movie is n’t 100 % about that , I will not like it .
The filmmakers can change anything they want , but if that theme is not central and apparent and well - developed , then this movie should not have been made .
Many have said the book is inherently cinematic .
If you mean that it clearly defines situations and locations and movement , then yes .
If you mean it flows like a movie , feels like a movie , or reads like a movie , you ’re dead wrong .
This one is a challenge , and I pray the filmmakers are up to it .
Because it could be classic cinema .
Then again it could become just another bleak , dark , and well - made movie without anything important to say .
That ’s how the book felt when I started it , but I was dead wrong .
﻿ Tor or not Tor : How to tell if someone is coming from a Tor exit node , in PHP Tor or not Tor : How to tell if someone is coming from a Tor exit node , in PHP Awhile back I was thinking it would be cool to make my page look different for people that are using the Tor anonymizing network .
Also , I though it might useful to some administrators to be able to block Tor users from certain functions on their sites .
I 'm not in favor of censorship , but for certain practical reasons it can be useful to detect
Tor exit nodes and keep them from accessing certain resources .
I found some example code in Python , but I wanted to code it in PHP for my site .
I looked at the documentation on TorDNSEL and came up with the following code .
The results of this simple image swapping script can be seen on the left , and my code for telling if someone is using Tor can be found below .
Most of the script is just there as an example , the two functions in red ( IsTorExitPoint and ReverseIPOctets ) are the important ones to copy into your own script .
IsTorExitPoint returns a boolean value of true if it thinks the user is coming from a Tor exit point .
While it 's not 100 % assured the remote host is using Tor , the script is pretty accurate .
Hope someone finds these functions useful .

A mother of two from Brisbane has put her house and $ 300,000 on the line to take on corporate behemoth Disney with a new social networking site for pre-teens .
Karen Orford , 40 , has just launched ekidnaworld .com after an 18 - month slog that , in her own words , nearly killed her .
Brisbane mum Karen Orford .
She came up with the idea after her two daughters , aged 7 and 9 , reached an age at which they were itching to chat online but Orford could n't find a site that she was comfortable would be safe enough .
So she contracted a Brisbane technology company to build Ekidnaworld .
She says it sets itself apart from Disney 's Club Penguin by being " quintessentially Australian " and includes a built - in safety mechanism whereby parents have to enter a password before their child can add each " friend " on the site .

Donnie was sick of waiting .
Dolled - up like a Southern beauty queen , she wore Barbie - blond hair and a pink collagen pout as she sat in the parking lot of a Miramar condo .
The five - foot - ten 32 - year - old eyed the clock from the passenger seat of a rented green Chevy van just after 7 p.m. March 20 , 2001 .
With her pert double - D breasts and slow , saccharine drawl , she could have passed for a South Florida trophy wife — if she had n't been born with a penis .
Donnie was male by birth but living as a woman thanks to weekly doses of estrogen .
She had long ago shed the boyish figure , chin stubble , and deep voice .
Her boyfriend , Mark Hawkins , a fit house cleaner with a tidy goatee , fiddled anxiously with his cell phone in the driver 's seat .
Crickets chirped in the fading evening light .
In gold letters , a nearby sign read , " The Enclave Luxury Condominiums . "
What 's taking this queen so long ?
Donnie thought .
Then Mark 's phone rang and an effeminate voice instructed them to go upstairs .
So the couple climbed to the third floor of a building with red Spanish - style roofing and a man -made lake vista .
They knocked twice on the green door of unit 306 , and a curvy transsexual named Corey " Cookie " Williams greeted them in a skin - tight dress .
The wand of plastic surgery had morphed her face from that of a young black man into a Jessica Rabbit look - alike .
Soon , three other guests arrived .
One was Vera Lawrence , a buxom 53 - year - old Carol City secretary and gospel singer .
Though the 227 - pound grandmother wore thick makeup , three - inch red fingernails , and stylish clothes , she stood out in the younger , mostly gay male crowd .
After some small talk , the guests migrated to a spacious bedroom decorated with Egyptian trinkets .
Vera lifted the hem of her short - sleeve leopard - print dress to uncover clusters of pin-prick - size scars that led from her thighs to her buttocks .
Hard , gravel - like bumps peppered her bulging hips .
The skin was nearly translucent .
Something was wrong .
Donnie flinched at the sight and scribbled the figure $ 1,000 onto a notebook .
Vera let her dress drop back into place , took a deep breath , and lay face down on the bed .
According to investigators , Donnie used a marker to draw points on Vera 's left thigh and , with Mark 's help , filled a thick syringe with a clear fluid .
Then they injected Vera 's left buttock and upper thigh .
Afterward , Donnie used cotton balls to swab the puncture marks with rubbing alcohol .
The injection was n't drugs .
Vera 's vice was silicone .
She hoped to round and smooth her aging body .
After a few minutes , she excused herself and headed to the bathroom .
She returned wheezing and began to mumble incoherently .
Blood mixed with the thick , oily liquid oozed from her upper left thigh .
Eventually , she lay back down on the bed , gasping for air .
Cookie , the host , nervously called 911 .
" She 's breathing real , real hard , and it 's like she 's sweating ...
She 's limp . "
Miramar Fire Rescue arrived in minutes and rushed her to Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines .
It was too late — she stopped breathing before they arrived .
Doctors pronounced her dead in the emergency room at 11:30 p.m. due to a massive embolism in a lung .
The cause : silicone leakage into the bloodstream .
Twenty - two days later , police arrested Mark Hawkins and charged him with third - degree murder , manslaughter , and practicing medicine without a license .
They nabbed Donnie Hendrix on the same charges .
In 2003 , separate juries convicted Donnie of illegal practice of medicine and Mark of third - degree murder .
She was given the maximum sentence of five years .
Mark was sent up for only six ; prosecutors struck a deal after the judge threw out the testimony of a key witness and ordered a retrial .
But the tale did n't end there .
Though Donnie was taking prescription female hormones and had been living as a woman for more than ten years , she was sent to a male cellblock — where unconscionable horrors would unfold .
Donnie is now out of jail and living in North Florida .
She has given up estrogen and is caught in gender limbo .
Her description of the booming world of do - it - yourself cosmetic enhancement , and abuse by fellow prisoners , shows this : Gender confusion and vanity take lives , bruise psyches , and baffle law enforcement .
In South Florida , Vera Lawrence 's death has n't stopped people from taking insane health risks in the name of beauty .
Says Donnie : " I still get calls from people wanting to get pumped .
It blows my fucking mind . "

Joanie , a willowy brunette with a teeny dress and a winning smile , lip - syncs the final line to Kelly Clarkson 's " You Thought Wrong . "
When a new song begins , she hops off the stage and playfully smacks herself on the rear in front of a portly older patron at a packed bar .
Her face says , I look good , and I know it .
The postoperative transgender former stripper describes the recipe for her soft , womanly figure during a break at Trixie 's drag club on South Dixie Highway in Hollywood .
About a year ago , she says , she paid an unlicensed " nurse " $ 500 to widen her hips with silicone at a North Miami Holiday Inn .
She calls it " filling in the boy dents . "
Afterward , she was sore for two days and had to sleep on her stomach .
Joanie has been lucky ; she 's had no health complications so far .
" I 'm just trying to make my body correct , " she says , shrugging .
" But a lot of the girls are addicted .
They want to be prettier and prettier . "
South Florida is the bargain basement of plastic surgery .
For hundreds of local transsexuals — many of whom are low - income and yearn to feminize their features — living at the epicenter of an illicit , real - life Nip / Tuck culture is both convenient and dangerous .
Florida authorities first learned about street silicone shots after the FDA in 1997 approved the synthetic liquid for medical use , according to the state 's health department .
The next year , the department set up the Unlicensed Activity Office .
It was — and still is — the only of its kind in the United States .
The goal : to prevent medical fraud , including cosmetic surgery .
Back then , fake doctors set up makeshift operating rooms in hotels , beauty parlors , and offices .
Some had legit medical licenses in Central or South America .
Others were entrepreneurial quacks , learning through trial and error .
As silicone injections gained popularity , health department reports show increasing numbers of victims reported they 'd been mangled .
There were claims of nerve damage , cysts , and disfigurement .
An example : In 1999 , Miami Beach Police issued an arrest warrant for Reinaldo Silvestre , a 58 - year - old phony surgeon who would come to be known as " The Butcher of South Beach . "
One of his many unhappy clients was a Mexican bodybuilder who requested pectoral implants and awoke with a female boob job .
Silvestre eventually pleaded guilty to practicing medicine without a license , aggravated battery , and administering narcotics .
He got seven and a half years .
The following year , arrests nearly doubled .
Even legitimate Miami surgeons noticed more botched beauty treatments .
" People would come in and have no idea what they had been injected with , " says University of Miami plastic surgeon Dr. Seth R. Thaller .
" It was an epidemic . "
Vera Lawrence 's death changed that — at least temporarily .
As news of the bizarre crime uncoiled , investigators became more aggressive .
A week after the tragedy came word of " Operation Dr. Frankenstein , " in which detectives arrested 45 - year - old David Blanco , a soft - spoken , dark - eyed Venezuelan from Coral Gables , who police say specialized in illegally pumping the liquid into the emaciated faces of transsexuals infected with HIV .
He took home as much as $ 30,000 per surgery .
In winter 2002 — before he even entered a plea — he vanished .
" The guys doing this are like cockroaches , " then - chief investigator Enrique Torres told London 's Observer .
" When the light is on them , they scatter and disappear .
But when the light goes off again , they always scuttle back . "
Indeed , pumping circles have begun resurfacing .
Last June 19 , Miami - Dade cops busted 22 - year - old Anthony Donnell Solomon for injecting silicone into the buttocks of women at a hotel on NW 87th Avenue .
A month and a half later , they collared 49 - year - old Juan Aguirrechu for shooting clients with Botox in his Coral Gables garage .
Since 1998 , the Florida Department of Health has nailed more than 600 unlicensed practitioners .
Injections , which run $ 100 to $ 5,000 depending on the body part , are generally supplemented with estrogen shots .
For transgender women , the idea is to get what nature denied them — to highlight cheekbones , inflate breasts , and curve butt cheeks .
Predatory " doctors " now market gay and transgender clients online , says Coral Gables attorney Spencer Marc Aronfeld , one of the nation 's most prominent plastic surgery litigators .
Phonies sense the desperation and look at it with dollar - sign eyes .
" Florida is a petri dish for these types of Frankensteinian procedures , " he says .
Aronfeld is representing a Fort Lauderdale man who hired licensed surgeon Jason Frost to help him deal with a disorder that causes him to grow breasts .
The patient , Thomas Glasson , is suing for punitive damages after he was left with a sunken , indented chest .
" I was hoping that with all of the attention cosmetic crime gets , it would be happening less , " Aronfeld explains .
" But it seems to have had the opposite effect ; my phone rings off the hook . "
*****
Donnie remembers it vividly : Just a 13 - year - old boy , he was seated in an old - time auditorium across from a strikingly sensuous blond woman onstage .
The theater evoked the Lincoln assassination — with balcony seating and long curtains tumbling into folds — but even as a shy young man , he was more interested in the lady .
She was petite , but her presence demanded attention .
As she stepped toward him , wisps of fog rose in front of her .
The nearer she got , the harder she became to see .
And just as she sashayed close enough to touch — whoosh — her figure rippled away .
It was always like that .
When the dream concluded , he would sit up in bed , angry .
Like a playground bully , his subconscious was taunting him .
He did n't want to sleep with the woman ; he wanted to be her .
Donnie Hendrix was born February 18 , 1969 , in the tiny Baptist town of Walhalla , South Carolina .
The younger of two kids , he " worshipped " his mother , Brenda , who " aspired to be a Southern Martha Stewart . "
His father , Edward , was an emotionally distant pavement contractor who wore his brown hair slicked back like a greaser and encouraged Donnie to pursue math .
" He would drink , " Donnie says .
" Honestly , I just remember him fighting with my mom . "
They divorced when he was 6 .
Donnie did n't like being home , so he would escape into Sumter National Forest on a gold and black 12 - speed bike .
" He was real mischievous , " Edward says .
" That kid was always trying to get out of work .
He had to be the top dog . "
Brenda wo n't talk about Donnie 's childhood .
Nor will she comment about her son .
" [ Donnie ] ai n't got nothin ' to do with me , " is all she would say when New Times phoned her .
Then she hung up .
In fall 1982 , while Donnie played football with his cousins on a field next to a gas station , an above - ground gas tank exploded .
It scalded about 60 percent of his body — mostly his legs — sending the 13 - year - old to the emergency room with third - degree burns .
Not long afterward , he began having the dream more frequently .
" I felt like a girl with a birth defect , " Donnie says .
" Mine just happened to be my penis . "
Nevertheless , he was popular with girls at Walhalla Middle School .
He had muscular legs from biking and bright blue eyes .
" Me ? Oh , I was a hottie , " Donnie remembers with a sassy tilt of the head .
" Honey , I would have asked me out . "
When Donnie was a high - schooler , he sulked into the kitchen one night as his mom washed dishes .
Brenda noticed her son's mood and asked the 16 - year - old if he was pining over someone .
Donnie replied he had gotten into a fight with his best friend , a handsome fishing buddy .
" You 're in love with him , " she said matter - of - factly .
Donnie remained quiet .
By that time , Brenda had married a construction worker named Buddy .
His name was tattooed across the outside of his left wrist , and he used the word faggot to describe the guys in town he did n't like .
Donnie did n't yet understand his sexuality .
He took an older girl named Kim to prom , and she seduced him on a friend 's living room floor after a couple of Ecstasy pills .
She became pregnant and had a baby girl .
" I just remember flashes of her on top , " Donnie says in a hushed voice .
" I was intimidated . "
Six months later , Donnie began buying female hormones from a family friend .
He persuaded his older sister , Debbie , to shoot one milliliter of estrogen into his arm once a week .
When his pecs swelled into small , pointy breasts , Donnie says , he " freaked ... because [ his ] male anatomy fell asleep . "
Around that time , Donnie began making regular trips to The Castle , a gay club in Greenville that blasted techno music and featured drag queen performances .
At the bar on a Friday in 1987 , he met Mark Hawkins , who had a five - o' clock shadow , a helmet of thick brown locks , and a knack for arranging flowers .
They bonded over a shared interest in gardening and began to date .
Mark 's parents , unlike Donnie's , accepted that their son liked to date men .
" We were a stylish gay couple , " Mark , now out of prison , remembers in a soft Southern accent .
" Donnie was a surfer - looking dude , really tan and clean - cut , but he always felt there was something missing . "
Soon the couple moved into a brownstone apartment in downtown Greenville .
Mark had a cleaning business , and Donnie played the housewife .
After befriending transsexuals at The Castle , Donnie finally made the decision :
He would become female for good : " I wanted everybody to forget Donnie . "
So he became " Viva . "
After several months of estrogen , Donnie 's skin became softer and his features less angular .
Body hair thinned and the Adam 's apple shriveled .
He grew a long , wavy blond mane and flipped his hair - sprayed bangs into a wave .
The transition made his " brain change , " and he felt awkward , so he did n't leave home much .
Mark was n't thrilled .
" Those hormones make you irritable , " he remembers .
" He went from being rowdy to soft .
She 'd see a Hallmark commercial and cry her eyes out .
Our gay friends did n't get it .
They thought ,
You 're gay .
Why the hell are you with a girl ? "
A few years later , Donnie was out and about as a woman — and getting into a bit of trouble .
In August 1993 , she was arrested in a Simpsonville , South Carolina nursery for stealing plants , records show .
The charge was shoplifting .
A small fine was paid .
( Donnie insists she did it to please Mark . )
The couple soon moved into a well - kept gray house with a pool in a modest Greenville neighborhood .
Neighbors believed they were straight and married .
Donnie had one close friend at the time : Julie , an assertive middle - age transsexual who had learned from a doctor / boyfriend how to pump " body shots " of silicone .
" It was the only way on this planet I could change my body , " Donnie says .
Soon she got professional breast implants , a lip job , and a nose job .
Donnie nervously paid Julie $ 500 for the first set of injections after asking " a thousand questions . "
There was a slight pinch when the three - inch needle entered her hips .
" It only goes halfway in , " Donnie says .
" All the transies did it .
It was so fucking stupid . "
If you believe South Florida prosecutors , who would later indict Donnie , she learned how to administer the shots in 1997 .
Once a month , she and Mark would pack up a jar of industrial - grade silicone and syringes and travel to Jacksonville , Orlando , Miami , or Homestead .
They likely garnered tens of thousands of dollars per trip .
Clients lined up at the homes of " handlers " — like Cookie — where the procedure was priced per shot .
Hosts would get a percentage .
Miramar Police documents contend the couple " told perspective clients that they had medical training and expertise in this type of cosmetic augmentation . "
They " wore lab coats " and advised clients to " soak in a warm bath " afterward .
( Both Donnie and Mark deny the allegations . )
The couple 's last trip to Florida began the morning of March 19 , 2001 .
They drove a rented green van from Greenville to a budget hotel in Hallandale Beach and arrived at Cookie 's condo the next day .
Once inside , they were introduced to Vera .
Cookie knew the grandmother through her late son , who had died of AIDS five years before .
Vera agreed to pay the couple $ 1,000 cash , according to prosecution , to inject her with silicone .
When paramedics arrived , none of the party guests offered any information about the shots .
Miramar Police noted , " It is believed this information could have been useful in treating [ Vera ] . "
At Memorial Hospital West — even hours after Vera Lawrence 's death — the oily liquid continued to seep from dozens of tiny needle holes .
Doctors took note of the mysterious fluid and called Miramar Police .
What medical examiners found next must have floored them :
In her body was a half - gallon of medical - and industrial - grade silicone .
Some of it had been in her buttocks for years .
*****
On the morning of March 21 , the day after the death , a heavyset man with thinning hair and neat dress clothes knocked on Cookie 's green apartment door .
He introduced himself as Miramar Police Det. Michael Rinaldi , sat Cookie down , and asked what had happened the night before .
Then he began to search the cluttered condo .
Two minutes into the search , according to the police report , Rinaldi came upon a syringe and alcohol wipes in a trash can .
" You have the right to remain silent , " he began .
" Anything you say ... "
" What the fuck , " Cookie responded .
" I may as well tell you the truth . "
Cookie explained that Donnie and Mark had performed about 90 percent of her many cosmetic treatments .
" Once , " she said , " they even punctured my lung . "
She went on to explain the couple was responsible for Vera 's death .
Rinaldi soon learned more about the party .
Another guest , Rodney Taylor — a transsexual whom the couple had injected in the chest — gave a sworn statement explaining she had gone to the condo to be pumped with silicone .
She " declined to be treated after seeing what had taken place . "
A few days later , Rinaldi received a phone call .
A woman named Denise Jones explained she was a former client of Donnie and Mark's and that the couple 's treatment caused her to " feel very , very weird " and to " breathe funny . "
Rinaldi kept digging and soon learned Mark was a regular customer of Silicone Inc. in High Point , North Carolina .
He sometimes had the chemical delivered to hotels in Miami .
So the detective headed north , and just after 4 p.m. on April 11 , with Greenville County cops in tow , he arrived at Mark and Donnie 's small gray home and pounded on the door .
Donnie was outside by the pool with a friend setting up for a cocktail party .
The officers presented a search warrant and began ripping into couches and digging through cardboard boxes in search of evidence .
Rinaldi found " discarded syringes and medical supplies , " including rubber gloves and a stethoscope , along with notes that read , " Breasts $ 400 , Hips $ 300 . "
Names of other body parts were written on a calendar and circled .
The detective next spotted business cards .
In a bold red font , they read , " Body Sculpting by Viva . "
Detectives arrested Mark and then questioned the couple 's roommate , Michael Henson , who explained the two had " been acting as a team " and " had given silicone injections on the night in question . "
" It was the strangest case we 've ever worked , " says Lt. Shea Smith , a Greenville detective who was there for the arrest .
" They were certainly putting a lot of people in danger . "
A week later , just after lunchtime on April 18 , Donnie was taken to Greenville County Jail and locked up with men .
She was transported to Florida by jail bus two weeks later .
For the first half of the ride , she was allowed to sit in the front of the bus , away from male prisoners .
But then she was sent to the back .
Many of the men had n't seen a woman in months .
" They were very aggressive , " Donnie says .
" There were hoots and hollers and ' Hey , baby's . ''
After Donnie arrived at the Broward County Jail , authorities permitted her to shower alone .
There was no hiding the breasts and long blond hair .
Says her lawyer , George Reres : " Everything about her suggested she was female .
If you saw this woman at a club , you would certainly want to go out with her ...
She was essentially walking around waiting for an attack to occur . "
About a month later , Donnie told guards that another inmate — a former crack addict who had been sentenced to life after being convicted of aggravated battery , robbery , and other crimes — had exposed himself and demanded oral sex .
Donnie refused and he threatened to kill her with a shank , she says .
Guards then moved Donnie to an eight - by - ten - foot solitary room on the eighth floor .
It was necessary , they noted in jail records , because she was an " effeminate male . "
Two months later , on July 19 , the same inmate nearly killed Donnie .
An incident report notes he " entered [ Donnie 's cell ] and punched [ her ] twice in the face " and then " threatened to cause more bodily harm . "
During the assault , Donnie says , the attacker and three others sodomized her and tore her breast implants .
They cracked her ribs and busted her lip .
" They came racing in and just had their way with me for 40 minutes ...
There was a tremendous amount of blood . "
Though Broward County records show battery charges were filed against the attacker and then dropped , prison reports confirm " several other inmates corroborated " the story .
In the months that followed , Donnie went on medication for pain and depression .
" They had me doped up like a rhino , " she says .
After complaining about her torn breast , she was taken to the infirmary and examined by medical staff .
There a nurse numbed her chest and put a wall of paper in front of Donnie 's face .
" They took out a pair of stainless - steel scissors , " she says , blinking away tears .
" And they just cut . "
Adds Attorney Reres , who documented the effects of the surgery with a camera : " It was as if the nurse took a perverse pleasure in disfiguring her .
It was absolutely horrific . "
Donnie 's female body slowly became more male .
" You hear your voice change .
Your beard comes back .
Your penis starts to function again , " she says .
" All of those things had been asleep for years . "
In April 2003 , Reres filed a motion " to allow the defendant to dress as a woman and wear makeup . "
It was necessary so Donnie would " not appear freakish " in a way that would " prejudice [ her ] in front of a jury , " Reres wrote .
Broward County Circuit Court Judge Peter Weinstein granted the request .
Donnie and Mark were tried in front of separate juries a month later .
Six witnesses — five of whom were transsexual — claimed the couple had injected them with silicone .
One was South Carolinian male - to - female Jeremy Middleton , who testified he fell into a two - month coma after the pair shot him in the buttocks .
" I thought [ Donnie ] was a real nurse , " she said .
" I thought [ she ] was legit . "
( Adds Mark 's attorney , Eric Schwartzreich : " It was a circus , and the prosecution was leading the show . )
But Ronald Wright , the bow - tied , bespectacled Broward County chief medical examiner , then poked holes in the state 's case .
He testified that silicone pumped the night of Vera 's death could not have moved quickly enough to her lungs to leave her dead .
" It 's the cumulative effect of ... months or years of injections , " he said .
In his closing statement , Attorney Schwartzreich asked an attentive all - female jury : " Do you know who killed Vera Lawrence ?
Unfortunately , Vera Lawrence killed Vera Lawrence . "
The verdicts shocked everybody .
Based on the same set of facts , one jury acquitted Donnie of murder , but the other convicted Mark .
Donnie mouthed the words thank you to her attorney before Weinstein sentenced her to five years .
Three years later , the Fourth District Court of Appeal overturned Mark 's conviction , ruling prosecution witness and Broward associate medical examiner Dr. Erston Price gave inadequate testimony .
On December 7 , 2006 , Mark agreed to a plea deal and got six years .
Corey " Cookie " Williams , the handler , received four years ' probation in exchange for her testimony against the couple .
In September 2003 , Donnie was transported to Tomoka Correctional Institution , an all - male prison on the outskirts of Daytona Beach with about 1,300 inmates .
Guards watched out for her .
" I was so well - looked - after , " she says .
" I was n't treated like a freaky piece of trash . "
Her time there might have been more complex than that .
In July 2005 , she was caught " attempting to conspire , " according to prison disciplinary reports .
Investigators found a fellow inmate had sent a $ 2,015 check to Donnie 's sister in exchange for Donnie " providing protection . "
( She contends the inmate — who was also transsexual — made up the story so she could be moved to another unit . )
When Donnie was released a couple of days before Thanksgiving 2005 , she contemplated living as a woman .
She was torn .
" That girl that I lived as ? " she says .
" They killed her . "
*****
Dog walkers shuffle past the quaint seaside diners along Flagler Beach on a recent blustery afternoon as Donnie sits on a splintery picnic table .
At first glance , her face seems to show the lasting effects of cosmetic surgery : plump pink lips and a delicate button nose .
Then the midday sun illuminates her jaw , and stubborn bristles become visible .
When Donnie lifts her wide - frame Chanel sunglasses to peer at the ocean , she catches a mustached middle - age tourist in a jean jacket staring with his mouth agape .
" This guy 's breaking his neck trying to look at me , " she mumbles .
She stares right back and gives him a defiant wave .
" Hi there ! " she shouts .
Busted , he quickly turns his head and scampers off .
Donnie pulls her sunglasses back down over her eyes , as if to hide , and lights a Marlboro .
" Sometimes I wonder if I 'm gonna be this crazy freak forever , " she says , her shiny blond hair whipping into a spiral .
" But I 'm not trying to have a pity party . "
She speaks in a tender maternal tone , but her voice is too deep to pass for a woman's .
Her shoulders are broad , her legs thick .
After being released from Tomoka Prison , Donnie decided to give up hormones .
Starting again would be too much emotionally .
After the rape , being female made her feel vulnerable .
Living as a male , though , was like admitting she was the same species as her attackers .
So she exists somewhere in between — in a sort of gender purgatory .
" People ask me if I 'm a boy or a girl , " she says .
" And I tell them I 'm neither . "
During the first days after her release , she quickly realized her family would n't return phone calls .
" Donnie 's mom is very controlled by her husband , " Mark explains .
" She wo n't have a relationship with her son until [ his stepfather ] passes . "
Some friends had died of AIDS while she was in prison , and others had labeled her " a murdering fag , " Donnie says .
Mark had not yet been released .
So , alone and broke , she checked into a Christian recovery center in Sanford called Teen Challenge .
Soon she landed a job programming computers .
These days , Donnie lives in a two - story khaki - colored house with a red door and a well - groomed front yard in Palm Coast , outside Daytona Beach .
She rarely leaves the house and regularly sees a psychologist .
The doctor diagnosed her with posttraumatic stress disorder and agoraphobia .
" She 's having a hard time trusting people , " says neighbor Mary Howard , who alternates between pronouns when describing Donnie .
" He comes over and just cries and cries . "
Ask Donnie about Mark , and the tears roll .
Though he left prison a year and a half ago , the two no longer speak .
He fell in love with another man in jail , she says .
Mark is now living in Greenville with his 78 - year - old mother .
" She 's my first priority , " he says .
" We 're trying to avoid drama . "
Both Donnie and Mark deny they ever gave a single injection .
They claim the silicone was used for Mark 's cleaning business , and the notes mentioning body parts referred to foam padding for transgender pageant contestants .
Donnie insists Vera was simply seeking advice after leaving a pumping session somewhere else .
Vera Lawrence 's family still struggles without her .
For years after the crime , her daughter , Tangela Sears , spoke often about her belief that the couple was not punished harshly enough : " This is n't justice .
I feel like I 've been banged against the wall . "
Lately , Donnie can't shake the feeling someone is sneaking up behind her .
At restaurants , she catches waitstaff pointing .
She tenses up when men touch her .
This past January 11 , MSNBC aired Lethal Beauty , a series about the crime .
When Donnie got home from work , her voicemail was full .
Some were from transsexual men who had seen the program .
" Who 's pumping now ? " they wanted to know .
" How much is it ?
Do you still do it ? "
Donnie later called one of them back .
" No , " she answered .
" Honey , are you crazy ? "
There are a billion reviews of this movie , and there were a billion articles in advance of it .
The demographic I fall into is well - represented already as far as online criticism goes .
( What , a white thirty - something wannabe writer who read the comic as a boy is talking about the film ?!
That ’s a perspective I had n’t considered !
Link me ! ) .
I write this without any conceit of a unique perspective , but as a record of my personal experience in order to compare it to that of others .
I ’m in my mid-thirties .
I have always known Watchmen as a collected work , so my “ cred ” does n’t go all the way back to the individual issues .
I did n’t find it by “ accident , ” ( even less cred ! )
It was first recommended to me by a comic store employee in the late ’ 80s , and since that time I have probably read it all the way through ( including the text documents ) three or four times .
I have flipped through it to revisit the art or favorite scenes many many times , but the last time I read it cover to cover was probably ten years ago .
I wanted to re-read it in advance of the movie , but my thought was seeing it without being hyper - aware of each panel would enhance my ability to judge it as a film .
Like , if I knew everything that was going to happen , it would cheapen the experience .
Some things are unavoidable , some plot elements you do n’t forget .
I know who the bad guy is .
In the early scene where Nite - Owl goes to warn Veidt someone might be trying to kill him , Veidt receives this news with his back to Nite - Owl , and we see a little smirk , a tiny tug at the corner of his mouth .
Knowing he ’s the villain makes it difficult for me to see that as anything other than either , “ Hee , the fool is warning me that I might be trying to kill me ! ” or “ As the paragon of human genius , I predicted you would come here , and I take a small pleasure in seeing it happen . ”
Someone unfamiliar with the story might think the smirk meant , “ Me , in danger ?
Laughable ! ” I ca n’t know .
I have read some amazingly - detailed reviews of the movie from people who are obsessed with the book , and you get things like , “ The scene in the lounge where Dr. Manhattan explodes Moloch ’s henchmen is a betrayal of the novel !
All it shows is gore !
In the comic we see Moloch ’s horrified face .
It ’s supposed to indicate his realization that the human era is ending !
Here it ’s just a cheap effects scene to wake up the back row .
FAIL ! ” I think that ’s interesting , for sure , but my brain does n’t work that way .
I do n’t have a deep - enough understanding of the novel to generate a thought like that .
So , what I wanted to do was experience it in as much of a vacuum as possible .
To try and see it like someone who had read some Jane Austen in middle - school would enjoy seeing Pride and Prejudice on tv many years later .
I remember Dr. Manhattan ends up with Mr. Darcy , but how ?
So , I held out for an IMAX screening .
The opening scene is fair enough at first .
An old guy flipping channels is a cute way to start establishing the universe .
It ’s an alternate ’ 80s , but not terribly different , ok .
He likes girls !
He stopped on a channel with a girl on it .
Celebrities are just like us !
“ Unforgettable ” had a little comeback back then .
I remember that , and hey , it ’s Crouching Tiger / Hidden Dragon all of a sudden .
Terrible , off - putting slow motion scenes and completely unrealistic fight scenes .
Hey , the television got shot , but the music is still playing .
Lame !
Oh , wait , there ’s the cover of the graphic novel , the sloppy smiley face .
I ’ve seen that on posters !
Oh , the crash through the window is fucking cool and just like the comic .
I ’m back in .
Then what proves to be the movie ’s ultimate achievement , the historical montage .
A fucking masterful blend of music , image , color and narrative .
It entertains and conveys information perfectly , seemlessly building a foundation for a story without intrusive voiceover and thrilling with crazy alt - history collages .
The Times Square victory kiss between the super - chick and the nurse is a triumph of modern cinema .
Perfectly paced and executed .
Just brilliant .
Then it gets less focused as we meet all the principals and it tries to get going .
The way it jumps around makes it difficult to craft this review in a purely straight - forward way , so I ’m going to have to match the movie ’s capricious scattery !
Rorschach is fantastic .
They nailed it with the casting , and the effects on his mask are mesmerizing .
It ’s been really interesting to see how movies deal with covered mouths .
Like , the Green Goblin in the first Spider - Man is terrible , just terrible Japanese opera bullshit .
Long , boring scenes where he shakes his fist and a frozen mask bobs .
In the Fantastic Four , they hide Dr. Doom in the shadows or under his hood as much as possible to minimize talking without moving lips .
In Iron Man , they nail it by taking us inside the mask , and here they give us something awesome to look at .
The dripping , changing blots are cool and eerie and fun and make you forget the voice - acting was done months later and miles away .
His scenes are fun and cool , his being savage and driven “ sells , ” though I was put way off by his seeming super - powers .
He ’s able to jump really high , and he has the same kind of Asian - magic fighting technique and ability the others have .
I think the concept is supposed to be that the only one with any kind of “ power ” at all is the godlike Dr. Manhattan .
Everyone else relies on gadgets and weapons ( Nite - Owl / The Comedian ) , ferocity ( Rorschach ) , distracting sex - appeal ( Silk Spectre ) or rigorous mental and physical preparation ( Veidt ) .
By giving everyone , including a pot - bellied has - been and an eighty - pound chick , mystical ninja properties it takes away from Veidt ’s superiority and makes the final fight confusing .
The casting ranges from “ excellent ” to “ she ’s hot ” with the critical exception of Veidt , who , they have to know , they completely shit the bed with .
He ’s unconvincing as anything , really , and it ’s not clear at all that he ’s supposed to be both the world ’s smartest man and the peak of human perfection .
He just comes off as “ rich guy who can magically beat everyone up when he feels like it . ”
The movie drags .
It ’s a bunch of talking and characters that seem important and never come back ( original Night Owl ? ) and some more talking and now it ’s this guy ’s origin , and now it ’s this guy ’s origin , and here ’s another origin , and these guys do n’t get origins , sorry .
Also , more talking .
It really only consistantly holds interest with Rorschach ’s scenes .
His prison scenes are cool , his battle with the cops is cool .
There are loooong shots holding on insignificant images and perverse short - cutting on seemingly important scenes .
Why do they hold soooo long on that stone angel in the cemetary with a slow pull out ?
Why do they show every fucking card fall out of the guy ’s briefcase ?
But , Silky is in an explosion and then suddenly safe on Archimedes again .
Why a jump in time there ?
Random !
The music is really distracting and misses the mark more often than not .
Often terribly distracting .
What function does 99 Luftballoons serve in that particular place ?
All Along the Watchtower was necessary , but not without matching the action to the lyrics .
Ball dropped .
Much of it was way too loud .
Hallelujah was cringe - worthy .
The end credit music was like , “ Fuck you , leave ! ”
It was like they were happy with Dylan in that opening montage and then stopped trying .
The score was cool , like in the prison riot and stuff .
The incidental stuff was fine , and the muzak version of Everybody Wants to Rule the World during Veidt ’s convo with the businessmen was clever and fun , but on the whole the music diminished the experience .
Very poor decision - making skills were employed in its selection and application .
The ability to recreate specific panels from the comics is a stellar achievement .
The attention to detail is remarkable , and I ca n’t wait to pause the DVD , just as I ca n’t wait to fast - forward through most of the film .
It occurs to me the best way to experience the movie is to have the powers of Dr. Manhattan , the ability to ignore the linear nature of time .
Maybe we should consider the wait until the DVD ’s release as a distracting stream of tachyons .
He was not as terrible as I was worried about .
The trailers make him seem like a blue Jar Jar Binks , and while it was n’t really the top of the line effects - wise , they made him interesting to look at , and the performance was fine .
I liked him , and thought he did a reasonable job of conveying a character who has lost his humanity trying to remember how humans behave .
Like , he did n’t degenerate into Data or anything .
Captain , What .
Is. Love ?
He ’s circumcised in the movie , and I do n’t remember if he is in the book .
It was amusing to think about him being “ uncut ” before the accident but reforming himself “ cut . ”
One thing the movie did well , I think by accident , was make me think about the similarities and differences between Veidt and Dr. Manhattan .
Like , Dr. M is n’t human anymore , but he takes the appearance of a natural man ( well , a natural blue man ) and Veidt is human , the human - est of humans , but he wears retarded armor to appear less human .
Dr. M does n’t care about people ( the structure of a corpse is the same as the structure of a living person ) but he does n’t slaughter them .
Veidt “ loves ” humanity , and he kills millions of people .
I liked Nite - Owl very much .
He could have been dorkier , but that might have overplayed it .
They could have done a little more to suggest he was out of shape .
His function was to be the relatable one , and he served it .
They push that a little much at the end by having him suddenly be witness to all the important scenes and getting to punch Veidt ( which I ’m sure does not happen in the source material , and nothing in the movie has suggested is possible ) .
I thought it took a lot away from his character to be allowed to see Rorschach ’s murder .
He does n’t see it in the book and that gives him a kind of plausible deniability .
Like , why is it ok ?
Oh , well , he kind of smelled and might have told the truth .
I ’m down with it , Blue .
Hurry up and zap him so I can get back to fucking your ex .
Having Rorschach ’s blood - smear be a Rorschach blot was fucking genius .
The hat drifting down was dumb .
Silk Spectre was attractive , very attractive , but she in particular highlighted some of the weird dialogue choices in the movie .
Like , I do n’t think she was a bad actress , because there ’s no way to say some of the lines they lifted directly from the comic as speech .
In general , I thought they could have done flash - images to the costume instead of having her describe the costume over lunch with Nite - Owl .
Like , I ’m sure he ’s seen it .
She does n’t need to tell him what it looks like .
In the movie – They are eating lunch .
Boring shot through window .
Pointless , random ’ 80s tune fades out .
Silky speaks : “ Remember my costume , the leather one with the yellow stripes and the thigh - high boots .
The merry - widow sort of lingerie strap things on there and those shiny gloves ?
I used to wear it .
It had a zipper . ”
What should have been :
Silky – Remember that costume ?
flash to costume
Nite - Owl – yes .
yes , I do .
There are four elements of the film that look like they were in a situation like , “ Oh , shit , this is due tomorrow , and I ’ve been busy image - sculpting Dr. Manhattan ’s cock . ”
They were –
1 ) The casting of Veidt – “ Get me Jude Law . ”
“ He ’s not available . ” “ Ok , if I ca n’t have my first choice , I ’ll settle for someone who totally sucks .
” “ I ’m on it , boss ! ” “ Wait , I do n’t want a guy who just sucks a little bit . ”
“ Got it , chief , maximum suckage . ”
“ Do n’t disappoint me .
He ’s got to really , really suck . ”
Mission accomplished !
2 ) The “ old - people ” makeup .
Bargain basement .
3 ) The late ’ 70s Dr. Who model that filled in for Veidt ’s arctic compound .
Fucking amateur hour there .
Would have been better off not showing it .
Worst establishing shot ever .
4 ) Bubastis .
Why did they even bother ?
The pleasures of watching a movie in a theater and reading a book in a chair are very different .
They are as dissimilar as eating a fruit salad and having your mother tell you a recipe for fruit salad .
In the theater , a film is static and linear .
It goes without your control .
You ca n’t stop it , you ca n’t slow down if you miss something , you ca n’t flip back to remind yourself who someone is or why an object is important .
You ca n’t skip to the end , and you ca n’t lower the volume if , for example , they ’re blasting a Leonard Cohen song at an inappropriate moment .
You read a book alone .
It ’s a personal experience .
When you see a movie in a theater , you are there to share the energy of others .
The theater during my screening , though full of people , was mostly dead energy .
Bored folks .
Girls dragged there and dudes fulfilling an obligation to their teenage selves .
I think director Zack Snyder is a guy with a lot of vision , and in a short time he ’s put some really memorable images into the public consciousness , but I think an unwillingness to compromise on changing the movie around has doomed it to big opening / massive drop off status .
The big story changes made sense and showed an understanding of how narratives work .
The new ending is probably better than the squid .
Cramming in a million details from the novel without knowing what they mean was an exercise in nothingness , though .
It ’s a movie , a product designed to entertain and make money .
It ’s not supposed to be a frame by page recreation of your favorite book .
It makes no sense to retain all of the conversations about being human , and then make everybody super - human .
The book The Return of the King is three hundred pages of Frodo and Sam climbing a mountain .
They had the good sense to push it around and make an entertaining movie out of it .
The first three Harry Potter movies are slavish to the books , because they were scared of alienating a super - informed audience .
They suck .
The last few HP movies made compromises in order to serve the format of a movie , and they are entertaining .
It makes no sense to make a huge change in one area and then drag an audience around in others .
You have shown a willingness to change something and shown good judgement in your choices , keep it up .
It was almost like he was trying to win a bet , like an ego thing .
I can make the “ unfilmable movie . ”
And why , if you love the Watchmen , do you want a movie of it ?
The only reason would seem to be a craving for acceptance .
It legitimizes my taste in reading if Hollywood notices it .
I count !
I have a voice !
I need something else to buy .
Sell me something !
They captured some great images , and the movie made me consider and revisit a lot of the themes of the novel with an older , more - experienced mind .
I am grateful to it for that .
I was moved several times by memories of reading it as a boy , because they captured the scene exactly or used the exact dialogue , but …Watchmen the novel is a brilliant , nuanced and significant work of literature .
It is flawed , but it is powerful and intelligent , and it tried and succeeded in saying something new .
Watchmen the movie is a noisy piece of mimicry that tried and succeeded in advertising a forthcoming DVD .
I really do n’t anticipate anything good coming out of it .
It was n’t bad enough to sink comic movies completely but it was n’t meaningful enough to jump - start a series of original , smart or fun movies either .
There is n’t enough understanding in it to justify the boring parts in - between the exciting parts .
Nobunagas Ambition II
Nobunaga 's Ambition 2 is a brilliant strategy game placed in ancient Japan .
Oda Nobunaga was a daymio with a single goal ; to unite Japan under his rule .
Something he almost managed to do as well , but now KOEI has given you the chance to do what one of the most powerful warlords throughout history never accomplished .
I think this is my favourite of all the old strategy games made by KOEI , there is just so much that you can do in this game .
First of all you get to choose between 38 different daymio's , each one with a different starting position and power .
Then you have the rich political aspect to the game , from recruiting more soldiers to bribe enemy generals .
If you do n't treat your loyal soldiers good , they might suddenly prove to be not so loyal anymore .
Your enemies are constantly trying to buy your generals , and are also spreading negative propaganda about you , making it harder for you to hire new ones .
Of course , you are allowed to do the same by sending spies into foreign regions and tear them down from within .
Then we have the actual fighting .
The best way to fight is to use the numpad in combination with numeric commands , and to use large amounts of strategy , of course .
When attacking a region , you will first try to break down the defences outside of a city , then move on to infiltrating the castle and kill or capture the enemy generals .
If you are so lucky to capture any generals , you have different things you can do to them .
You may either behead them ( to set an example to your enemies ) , employ them as generals under your command ( easy and cheap labour ) , or you can let them go .
All in all Nobunaga 's Ambition 2 is a well - balanced strategy game that is fairly easy to learn , and a game that can be played again and again .
You have n't really completed the game before you have completed it with each of the 38 different daymio's , and that is a long time into the future .
Truly recommended .
The game supports multiplayer up to 4 players .

This text by Catherine Austin Fitts is a response to an article entitled “ The Fed Did n’t Cause the Housing Bubble ” by Alan Greenspan , former Chairman of the Federal Reserve , published in the Wall Street Journal
Alan Greenspan is a liar .
The Federal Reserve and its long standing partner , the US Treasury , engineered the housing bubble , including the fraudulent inducement of America as part of a financial coup d’etat .
In his article on your opinion page , “ The Fed Did n’t Cause the Housing Bubble , ” Alan Greenspan attributes the housing bubble to lower interest rates between 2002 and 2005 .
That ’s amazing to me .
My company served as lead financial advisor to the Federal Housing Administration between 1994 and 1997 .
I watched both the Administration and the Federal Reserve aggressively implement the policies that engineered the housing bubble .
These are described at my website and in my on - line book , Dillon Read & the Aristocracy of Stock Profits ( http://www.dunwalke.com).
One story , for example , is the following :
“ In 1995 , a senior Clinton Administration official shared with me the Administration ’s targets for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage volumes in low - and moderate - income communities .
We had recently reviewed the Administration ’s plans to increase government mortgage guarantees — most of these mortgages would also be pooled and sold as securities to investors .
Even in 1995 , I could see that these plans would create unserviceable debt loads in communities struggling with the falling incomes expected from globalization .
Homeowners would default on mortgages while losses on mortgage - backed securities would drain retirement savings from 401 ( k ) s and pension plans .
Taxpayers would ultimately be hit with a large bill . . . but insiders would make a bundle .
I looked at the official and said that the Administration was planning on issuing more mortgages than there were houses or residents .
“ Shut up , this is none of your business , ” the official snapped back . ”
From : “ Sub - Prime Mortgage Woes Are No Accident ” ( http://solari.com/news/announcements/08-07-07/)
[ efoods ]
One of the dirty little secrets behind the housing bubble is the long standing partnership of narcotics trafficking and mortgage fraud and the use of the two in combination to target and destroy minority and poor communities with highly profitable economic warfare .
This model is global .
It is operating in counties throughout the world as well as in US communities .
Of all the actions that the Federal Reserve took to engineer this housing bubble , the one that I would note is Mr. Greenspan ’s efforts to pacify Congresswoman Waters regarding allegations of government sponsored narcotics trafficking at a time when open Congressional hearings would have contributed to an important discussion of the operations engaging in mortgage fraud in minority communities .
See , “ Financial Coup d’Etat , ” Chapter 16 , Dillon Read & the Aristocracy of Stock Profits which was written in 2005 and published in April 2006 , drawing from an article I first published in May 1999 .
“ On December 18 , 1997 , the CIA Inspector General delivered Volume I of their report to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding charges that the CIA was complicit in narcotics trafficking in South Central Los Angeles .
Washington , D.C. ’s response was compatible with attracting the continued flow of an estimated $ 500 billion – $ 1 trillion a year of money laundering into the U.S. financial system .
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in January 1998 visited Los Angeles with Congresswoman Maxine Waters — who had been a vocal critic of the government ’s involvement in narcotics trafficking — with news reports that he had pledged billions to come to her district .
In February Al Gore announced that Water ’s district in Los Angeles had been awarded Empowerment Zone status by HUD ( under Secretary Cuomo ’s leadership ) and made eligible for $ 300 million in federal grants and tax benefits . ”
Alan Greenspan is a liar .
The Federal Reserve and its long standing partner , the US Treasury , engineered the housing bubble , including the fraudulent inducement of America as part of a financial coup d’etat .
Our bankruptcy was not an accident .
It was engineered at the highest levels .
Your publication of Greenspan ’s breezy and bogus history of the housing bubble insults your readership .

Antarctic Fox
The log of Rachel and Kevin Fox 's trip to the Antarctic Peninsula in the Summer of 2008 -9
Introduction : Telling the Story
The preface to our Antarctic adventure
We were given the amazing opportunity to join ten of our family and friends and go on a twelve day private expedition cruise in the Antarctic Peninsula on the Hanse Explorer .
Over the course of the adventure Rachel and I took over 16,000 photos while having some of the most amazing and unexpected experiences of our lives .
Having just returned from our trip , we 're now going to tell the story in pictures and words , excursion - by - excursion , over the next several weeks .
We invite you to join us as we venture further south than the ship had ever gone , witness firsthand the Antarctic circle of life and death , and explore the penguin culture .
Fair warning though : one - by - one , the penguins will steal your sanity !

Meanwhile , the narrow highway that links the enclave to Russia is plagued by avalanches and impassable for much of the winter .
Even in good weather , shipments coming from the north are vulnerable to theft and diversion .
Charles King , an expert on the region , said South Ossetia long served as a “ gigantic magnet for contraband ” passing between Russia and Georgia , economically dependent on informal taxes levied on shipments .
“ If someone is trying to send physical aid to South Ossetia , it ’s very likely that it ’s going to go missing , ” said Mr. King , author of “ The Ghost of Freedom : A History of the Caucasus . ”
Whatever the reasons , progress has been slow .
A report released in December by Russia ’s federal auditing agency found that of about $ 55 million in priority aid pledged by Russia , only about $ 15 million had been delivered and only $ 1.4 million spent .
It also found that of 111 structures scheduled for renovation by the end of 2008 , 8 had been completed and 38 had not yet been touched .
Image Some projects are under way in Tskhinvali , but the pace has been slowed by many problems , the enclaves president said .
Credit ... James Hill for The New York Times
The same month , a former South Ossetian defense minister who is a political rival of Mr. Kokoity ’s , Anatoly Barankevich , told the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant that local officials had diverted 3,200 tons of cement and nearly 200,000 square feet of glass intended to repair citizens ’ homes before winter .
Mr. Kokoity denied the report , telling the newspaper that “ certain pro-Georgian forces are trying to discredit South Ossetia in the eyes of Russia and Russians . ”
The delays have become a headache for Mr. Kokoity , who was met with roars of adulation last summer when Moscow formally recognized his government .
Meeting with foreign journalists in Tskhinvali , he said the process had been slowed by dishonest subcontractors chosen after the war by the Russian Ministry of Regional Development .
Authorities say that they have spent only $ 42 million of the roughly $ 280 million in pledged Russian money and that the pace will speed up now that a more effective system of financial controls is in place .
“ We are responsible to every citizen of the Russian Federation to ensure that this money is used in a full manner , ” Mr. Kokoity said .
“ Better let it stay in the Ministry of Finance than let sleazy people get their hands on it . ”
An Anarchist analysis of the revolt against neo-liberalism in Argentina , with suggestions on how it could be turned into a genuine social revolution rather than a mere revolt .
From Riot to Revolution
" We have seen how the Revolution began with popular risings ever since the first months of 1789 .
To make a revolution it is not , however , enough that there should be such risings -- more or less successful .
It is necessary that after the risings there should be left something new in the institutions , would permit new forms of life to be elaborated and established . "
Kropotkin , The Great French Revolution
Anarchism is often portrayed by historians and others as somewhat utopian , having no real idea of how to get from capitalism to a free society .
Lenin , for example , asserted that anarchists " while advocating the destruction of the state machine , have absolutely no idea of what the proletariat will put in its place . "
The truth is , of course , different .
Anarchists see the initial framework of an anarchist society as being created under statism and capitalism when working class people organise themselves to resist oppression and exploitation .
In summary , the very process of collective class struggle would create the basis of anarchism .
Therefore , anarchists do not abstractly compare a free society with the current one .
Rather , we see an organic connection between what is and what could be .
An anarchist society would be based on the working class 's own combat organisations , as created in their struggles within , but against , capitalism and the state .
In this sense , anarchy is not some distant goal but rather an aspect of current struggles against domination , oppression and exploitation ( i.e. the class struggle ) .
Anarchism draws upon the autonomous self - activity and spontaneity of working class people in struggle to inform both its political theory and its vision of a free society .
Means and ends are linked , with direct action being the means of generating combative working class organisations and preparing people to directly manage their own personal and collective interests .
The struggle against hierarchy is the school of anarchy .
It teaches us not only how to be anarchists but also gives us a glimpse of what an anarchist society would be like , what its initial framework could be and the experience of managing our own activities which is required for such a society to function successfully .
Anarchy in Action ?
The events in Argentina speak for themselves .
Popular risings there have been in abundance .
After two - and - half - decades of IMF - backed free - market reforms , more than 40 % of the 38 m population live below the poverty line and 100 children die daily from hunger and disease .
People have had enough .
Millions of people have challenged the state of siege .
People are fighting on the streets , standing up to those who express and exploit them .
In Cordoba , a car - making centre north - west of Buenos Aires , workers protesting at government plans to reduce wages and apply other austerity measures , occupied the town hall , and then set fire to it .
Various governments have collapsed but in the lives of the working class , nothing changed -- except for feelings of victory .
In the streets the confrontations continued .
The power they express , the power of mass direct action , inspires and will not be easily forgotten .
The question is , what comes next ?
Will riot become revolution ?
The answer to this question depends on what forms of popular self - organisation are being created .
Luckily , such forms of working class power are being created .
The most exciting thing is the largely spontaneous appearance of " popular assemblies " after the insurrection last year .
These self - managed assemblies are neighbourhood based on and run by huge mass meetings of thousands .
There are currently 30 assemblies in Buenos Aires and many others all over the country .
According to the anarchists of the Argentine Libertarian Federation , the assemblies " meetings are open and anyone who wishes can participate , " and common to all assemblies is the " non-delegation of power , self - management , [ and a ] horizontal structure . "
In the French Revolution , the people of Paris formed the directly democratic community assemblies called " sections . "
Kropotkin pointed to these as examples of both the popular institutions required to make a revolution ( " the districts of Paris laid the foundations of a new , free , social organisation " ) and " the principles of anarchism . "
It was by means of these popular assemblies that " the masses , accustoming themselves to act without receiving orders from the national representatives , were practising what was to be described later as Direct Self - Government . "
A similar process is at work in Argentina .
As one assembly moderator put it , " here , no one is in charge , we are going to take turns . "
Other forms of popular power are developing .
The unemployed workers movement has played a key role in many of the revolts .
It has been building for the last five years and in the last year it has helped force the government to introduce policies to aid the unemployed .
Its tactics are to paralyse transportation by blocking off major highways in order to make their demands .
They are called piqueteros ( " the picketers " ) .
Any agreements made are discussed by the participants directly .
They do not delegate leaders to negotiate with the government .
They make it come to the blockades and the people there discuss what they should demand and what they should accept .
They have the same healthy " distrust of all executive power " which Kropotkin praised the Parisian Sections for !
There are attempts by workers to organise themselves .
Throughout Argentina strikes have occurred .
Committees of struggle and to co-ordinate the protests have been created .
Occupations have started .
In Río Turbio , the mine workers have occupied the mines .
In Neuquén , the workers have occupied ceramics factory of Zanón , where a workers congress was held in December .
This congress saw almost 400 ceramics workers , teachers , unemployed workers and students meet to discuss the current events .
The main organisers were the ceramics workers union ( SOENC ) , the teachers ' union of Río Negro ( UNTER ) , a militant unemployed workers ' organisation ( MTD ) and the teachers of ATEN Centenario .
Members and delegations of several other organisations of the region also participated .
After intense discussion on a multitude of issues , including the next measures to be taken in their struggle and the need for co-ordination of current struggles , a declaration was agreed .
This stated that the ceramics workers of Zanón " struggle for the nationalisation and the reopening of the plant under worker control " and are " mobilising together with the unemployed workers of Neuquén . . . and with the teachers and government employees . "
They aim to intensify " the co-ordination and unity between struggles with the aim of setting up a Regional Co-ordination " as a step towards the unification of " the struggles on a national level " .
They called made " an urgent call for an immediate congregation of the National Assembly of Employed and Unemployed Workers with a 1 in 20 representation , just as was voted in the last Picketers ' Assembly in La Matanza . "
This would seek to unite all those " that are struggling through democratically elected representatives voted in Assemblies within the workplace . "
On Saturday , February 16 , such an assembly was created when thousands of workers , unemployed and members of the popular assemblies , met in the Plaza de Mayo square in Buenos Aires .
Clearly , Bakunin 's prediction that the " future social organisation must be made solely from the bottom up , by the free association or federation of workers , firstly in their unions , then in the communes , regions , nations and finally in a great federation , international and universal " is taking shape .
The ideas of anarchism are being applied by those in struggle .
This is to be expected , as those ideas are just generalisations derived from past working class struggles !
Anarchists in Action
The anarchist group Organizacion Socialista Libertaria ( OSL ) , the strongest current of organised anarchism in Argentina , is playing an important role in the struggles .
According to one of their messages , " anarchist militants have been battling the police since the morning in the Plaza de Mayo " while the OSL have joined in marches to Plaza de Mayo together with other social organisations .
The OSL are encouraging the process of working class community self - organisation , with " each militant discussing in his or her neighbourhood the best way to establish a minimal territorial organisation with the goal of defeating the state of siege . "
While " governmental secret services are continuing to spread fear , paranoia and battles between one neighbourhood and another , " the OSL have " decided to start an ideological debate with others in those neighbourhoods where self - managed peoples ' organisations are present .
It is in these areas where we will call on the other organisations to study what has happened and to develop a way of acting which will allow us to reorganise against the terror of the State and to organise self - management , or at least , the seeds towards it . "
They are also involved in the unions , attending meetings called by the CTA trade union federation to decide on its actions .
They are aware that the Trade Union leadership " did not want to go out and agitate as they were afraid the situation could get out of their hands . "
The key will be to encourage any attempts by workers to organise independently of their leaders .
The importance of anarchists getting involved in the struggle is clear .
As they put it :
" We must throw ourselves fully towards building people 's organisation , because if we the people are not capable of giving ourselves the society which we want and need , ex-President Menem is there waiting to be called , as a replacement part so that nothing changes . "
The need for anarchists to argue for their ideas is important .
A process of revolutionary self - education is occurring in Argentina , as in any revolution ( as Kropotkin stressed , " by degrees , the revolutionary education of the people was being accomplished by the revolution itself " ) .
For example , one Palermo neighbourhood assembly participant notes that she was " very surprised because there are people participating who otherwise never left their homes .
My 70 - year - old neighbour had never taken part in anything , but now she has such an extremist stance that it is truly astonishing . "
However , self - education and self - liberation through struggle is a process , a process that anarchists can aid .
As can be seen from many demonstrations , the protests have a nationalist tinge to them .
This is to be expected , as the current crisis is the result of foreign domination ( aided and abetted by the local ruling class , of course ) .
It would be a tragedy is this working class revolt gets sidelined into boosting Argentinean capital within the national market .
Equally , many of the protestors will be demanding that capitalism works correctly rather than seeking its end .
Anarchists must clearly argue that crisis is inevitable under this system and , equally as important , that local ruling elites as just as bad as foreign ones and so nationalism is no solution .
Anarchists must do all they can to argue that only working class self - management can create a decent society and encourage the struggle towards that end .
This struggle gives those involved a sense of their own power ( both as individuals and as a class ) .
It also gives them experience of managing their own lives and of organising their own struggles .
This is a good foundation for building a strong anarchist movement in Argentina .
In case we forget , one hundred years ago anarchism played the leading role in the labour movement there .
The current events are producing organisations with a distinctly libertarian nature .
Could these be the basis of a regenerated working class anarchist movement like the old FORA anarcho - syndicalist union federation ?
If so , it will not happen automatically , it will require the anarchists to take an active part in working class struggle and organisation .
As can be seen , the OSL is doing precisely that .
Towards revolution ?
As anarchists have long argued , the class struggle creates the framework of a free society .
This process is at work in Argentina .
How can the transformation of riot into revolution be helped ?
While this task can only be the work of those who take part in it , a few words of general advice can be drawn from history -- the first steps have already been taken !
The practical basis of an alternative are already falling into place .
The embryo of popular power , of a free society , is being created in the community and workplace assemblies .
Self - management must be encouraged within them and any attempts to delegate power resisted .
These organs must be strengthened and federated .
As in every struggle , co-ordination and solidarity must be ensured .
Many neighbourhoods are organising popular general assemblies to decide how to carry the struggle forward .
Their federation is essential .
As Kropotkin argued , the French popular assemblies " sought for unity of action , not in subjection to a Central Committee , but in a federative union . "
This was " made from below upward , by the federation of the district organisations ; it spring up in a revolutionary way , from popular initiative . "
The Argentinean ones have started to do the same , with some assemblies already choosing delegates who participate in weekly inter-neighbourhood plenary sessions ( some of which draw some 4,000 people ) .
Only by federating together the popular organs of self - management can the state be abolished .
Consumer goods have been expropriated by the people .
The next stage is the expropriation of the means of production -- the fields , factories and workshops -- by workplace assemblies .
They must be placed under workers ' self - management and federations of workers ' assemblies created ( to co-ordinate struggle and self - managed production ) .
Any attempt to nationalise them ( as the Leninists propose ) must be opposed in favour of socialisation -- replacing private capitalism with state capitalism is no solution .
Only socialisation under workers ' self - management will see capitalism ended .
An awareness of this need is developing .
At the Zanón congress , a 22 year old worker from the plant stated that the each centimetre of the plant , each tile that was piled within the long corridors stood for " the millions that we produced , and everything that the province gave to Zanón , and now that Zanón does n't want to be responsible for it , it 's going to be ours . "
That perspective has to be generalised and turned from a defensive strategy to an offensive one .
The building of federations between the community and workplace assemblies is essential .
This is for three reasons .
Firstly , to build working class power to resist and finally overthrow the current system by combining economic and social self - organisation .
The assemblies and their federations must have the real power to ensure they become expressions of the will of the working class and to provide a framework by which collective decisions , direct action , solidarity and self - defence can be organised .
Secondly , to aid the creation and distribution of goods .
A step in this direction would be the community assemblies setting up consumer co-operatives to facilitate the distribution of goods and their encouragement and support of workers expropriating their workplaces .
Thirdly , to create a possible framework in which to socialise the means of life and place them under true common ownership and control .
In a nutshell : All power to the community and workplace assemblies !
The call for and subsequent creation of a " National Assembly of Employed and Unemployed Workers " is a positive one , as long as it is made up of mandated and recallable delegates and is complemented by local and regional federations of assemblies .
Without constructive building from the bottom - up , any national assembly will be artificial , simply a mouthpiece for various would - be politicians and new bosses .
Nor can it be a grouping of existing unions and party committees as this would simply be a top - down joining of various bureaucratic committees and not a real expression of popular self - rule .
Any National Assembly must be an organ for working class struggle , simply co-ordinating and executing the decisions of the base assemblies .
Only this can make the popular slogan " all the politicians out " a reality .
Any attempt to centralise power must be resisted as it will disempower the grass - root assemblies and kill the revolt .
The seemingly widespread call for a " Constituent Assembly " is basically a call for a left wing bourgeois government and for the popular assemblies to be put under its control .
It must be opposed as it is the death of grassroots self - management .
The ruling class may try to recuperate the current struggle by means of elections to such a body , side - tracking the revolt into parliamentary channels .
The left , by standing " revolutionary " candidates , will aid this process of transferring the focus of the struggle away from mass self - activity and self - organisation onto " leaders " working within capitalist institutions .
This will undermine the autonomy and power of the grassroots organisations .
Equally , the left 's calls for a " workers ' government " must also be opposed as this will simply replace working class power and self - management with party power .
To delegate power into the hands of a few party leaders will not and cannot solve the current crisis or create socialism , which can be created only from below by the people themselves .
There is a need to co-ordinate struggle , but this must be based on bottom - up , federal , organisations .
A call for a " People 's Assembly , " based on mandated delegates from the community and workplace assemblies is paramount -- as is the awareness that popular organisations must not surrender their self - rule and become mere ciphers , stepping stones for a political party to take power .
Any working class assemblies ( and their councils ) must be autonomous , free from the control of any political party or organisation ( including anarchist ! ) .
All power to the assemblies must not become transformed into " all power to the Party through the assemblies . "
Decisions must reflect the debate in the assemblies , not in the small , restricted , leadership of a political party !
Only self - organisation and direct action from below will ensure that this mass protest does not simply result in a new gang of thieves being placed in power .
Only when the working class has organised itself from below upwards will it be in a position to dispense once and for all with bosses and politicians .
The struggle against capitalism is building the framework of the free society that will replace it .
The job of anarchists is to encourage these processes and show how they can form an alternative to capitalism .
As in every revolution , the " principles of anarchism " are being born from the class struggle , the deeds of working class people fighting for a better life .
Argentina is no exception and as can be seen , the embryos of popular self - management as being created .
We have a lot to learn from these experiences .
The current protests not only reinforces the validity of anarchist ideas , it also allows us to improve these ideas just as anarchists learned from past working class revolts .
The role of the unemployed workers movement is important , suggesting that anarchists should seriously look at creating similar groups here .
Equally , the importance of the community assemblies is obvious .
Anarchists have long argued for this and we should apply this principle in " community unionism . "
These would be similar to the anti-poll tax unions and such groups as Haringey Solidarity Group and the Govanhill Pool protests in Glasgow .
Equally , the need for a libertarian presence in the workplace is essential .
This may involve pronged strategy of rank and file groups within existing unions plus dual unions to link up activists across industries .
Lastly , the anarchist movement needs to discuss strategy and tactics in an open forum as in the conferences at Bradford , Glasgow and London .
The events in Argentina also shows the direction the anti-globalisation movement must take -- it must apply its principles of direct action , solidarity , self - managed self - organisation within everyday life and struggles .
While mass demonstrations like those of Genoa are essential , they cannot replace the need to build strong roots in our communities and workplaces .
Without this grassroots activity , the anti-globalisation movement will wither , just as a flower cut off from its roots .
Demonstrations by themselves will not end capitalism or its imposed , top - down , globalisation .
Only when the bulk of the population take direct action , organise themselves and fight for their freedom will real change occur .
As Argentina shows .
The power of the working class in revolt is clear -- it has managed to bring down numerous politicians .
The question is , will it be able to bring down all governments and all bosses ?
That remains to be seen .
The possible framework of a free society can be seen , will the Argentinean anarchists be able to encourage these first steps and help them become organs of working class power ?
Hopefully .
As the OSL say :
" we will be there with our conviction that a different way of living is possible and that is what we are fighting for ! "
Gov. Sarah Palin believes that the media deliberately tried to bring her down .
Palin : Media sought to seek , destroy
Gov. Sarah Palin ( R - Alaska ) believes that the media deliberately tried to bring her down during her vice presidential run .
As part of an interview with conservative filmmaker John Ziegler for his new film out this week , Palin said she believes the media made a decision that “ we ’re going to seek and we ’re going to destroy this candidacy of Sarah Palin ’s because of what it is that she represents . ”

“ Obviously something big took place in the media , ” she added .
It is “ very frightening , I think , what the media was able to get away with , this go around . ”
Palin suggested that unbalanced media coverage posed a threat to democracy .
“ This is for the sake of our democracy that there is fairness in this other branch of government , if you will , called the media , ” she said .
“ It is foreign to me the way some in the mainstream media are thinking . ”
“ There have been lies told , there have been reputations trashed , there have been children that have been harmed , ” she continued .
Looking back on her interview with ABC News ’ Charles Gibson , in which Palin seemed unsure of how to define the Bush doctrine , the Alaska governor said she was disrespected in a way that another candidate would not have been .
“ I ’d have to say there would be much more respect shown to the subject , yes , ” she said .
This hits kinda close to home .
A student at Johnsburg High School in northwestern McHenry County , IL wants to start an atheist group at her school , but she ’s facing a few challenges .
Here ’s what reporter Diana Sroka writes :
Savannah Lanz does n’t believe in God , follow religion , or look to any higher powers , and she ’s hoping to form a student group at Johnsburg High School that echoes those beliefs .
“ The goal of the group is just to prove people can lead ethical and moral lives without religion , and you do n’t have to believe in God , ” said Lanz , 16 .
“ It ’s basically a group for people who consider themselves free - thinkers , atheists , agnostics or humanists . ”
However , she ’s meeting obstacles as dispute brews over the group ’s purpose , potential activities , and whether it ’s been approved by school administrators .
Assuming this is student - led , there should n’t be any problem here .
So long as students can surround the flagpole or discuss the Bible , atheists can gather , too .
And according to Savannah , there is indeed a Christian group at the school .
( Assuming this is really her ) she writes in a comment following the article :
We already have an official , [ sponsored ] group at our school called the Fellowship of Christian [ S ] tudents .
Why can’t I have my group as well ?
Also , most of our meetings will be just consist of discussing different philosophies and issues .
Here ’s an excerpt from the article that really gets to me :
Meanwhile , Lanz said she was under the impression that the group — named the Johnsburg Freethinkers Society — had been approved by an assistant principal at the school , and simply would n’t be allowed to advertise with fliers in the building .
Again , the school is crossing into illegal waters .
As long as the fliers are school - appropriate , the group must be allowed to advertise .
You ca n’t deny their advertising simply because it ’s for an atheist club .
Plus , I ’m sure everyone would want to know about the first meeting .
It sounds awesome :
Group members already are planning their first event , a night when members dress up as pirates and eat spaghetti in honor of the “ Flying Spaghetti Monster . ”
I ’ve tried reaching out to Savannah — the Secular Student Alliance has plenty of experience with students facing challenges when starting atheist groups — and I hope to hear back from her .
It ’s really exciting and inspiring that any high school student would have the courage to begin a group like this — especially in a fairly conservative area .
Good luck to her in getting the group started !

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Human beings are a predictable bunch and we tend to wait until things get to a painful crisis mode before taking drastic action .
My question is why does it always have to get to that point ?
Take the most recent run-up of oil prices , when crude hit $ 147 a barrel and gasoline was trading around $ 5 .
As prices reached nosebleed levels , the general public was in a great deal of pain and they acted accordingly .
There was an outcry for more alternatives , more refineries , conservation , infrastructure investment etc .
Everything from clean - coal technology to nuclear was on the table .
Fast forward to today , with crude prices at around $ 38 and gas back below $ 2 , and it 's a very different picture .
No pain means no gain in solving the problem .
Let me be clear , though .
That problem has n't gone anywhere .
$ 300 crude not far off
While the global recession and credit crunch have severely impacted global demand for energy , it 's only temporary .
The problems propelling oil prices to $ 147 have n't gone away .
The patient is , at best , in temporary remission .
Traders are seasick from the oil markets lately ; the volatility has been so extreme .
Aside from the obvious macro- factors , what else is driving the abnormally large swings in crude oil ?
It 's called " contango . "
Contango occurs when futures prices are higher than current prices .
The scenarios are not uncommon , but the recent spread widths are extreme by any measure .
For example : the April 2009 crude oil contract is around $ 38.10 -- while the April 2010 crude contract , crude for delivery a year from now , is trading at $ 50.26 .
That 's a $ 12.16 spread .
That means major oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A , - 1.68 % , Exxon Mobil XOM , - 2.91 % and BP BP , - 2.80 % can store oil on tankers and then sell the April 2010 contract at $ 50.26 .
Even factoring in the cost of storage , they come out better selling forward than selling at current market prices .
This maneuvering causes additional volatility throughout the oil curve , as physical oil companies position themselves in the futures markets to take advantage .
Contract rolls
Another strategy we see consistently in the energy market is contract rolls at major hedge funds , commodity - trading advisers and exchange - traded funds .
One ETF is the U.S. Oil Fund LP USO , - 3.45 % , the world 's largest oil fund , said to account for 22 % of the outstanding front - month contracts each month .
When the front - month contract approaches expiration , this gigantic ETF must sell its position in the expiring month and buy it back for the coming month .
Also , long - term trends following CTAs and hedge funds have been short on the front months .
When a contract expiration approaches , the fund has to roll its short position into the next month 's contract , since most CTAs and hedge funds have neither the ability nor the interest to take physical delivery of oil .
The volatility in energy is due to the gigantic tug of war going on around key days of the month where funds , ETFs and oil companies are adjusting for the roll .
Old problems are new again
So what were the major factors that drove oil to record levels the last two years ?
There are many .
Global demand is among the biggest .
Pent - up demand is exploding in growth areas like China and India .
Once that global manufacturing engine begins firing again , you can count on energy prices ramping up .
Here in the U.S. , demand is down dramatically , but as the economy recovers , it will pick up swiftly .
Any economic recovery results in higher energy prices -- it 's elementary .
That means $ 300 crude oil could be one year away or three years away , but certainly not much more .
There 's been almost no progress on the march to alternatives .
The global investment engine has ground to a halt .
With oil prices at these levels and the market in tatters , the last place investors want to put their money is in the alternative energy space .
Every sector from uranium miners and clean - coal technology to bio-fuels and oil drillers has seen investment and share prices dry up .
The call for building of new refineries and pipelines has all but gone silent .
But OPEC has cut production across the board .
We already are seeing supplies start to taper off .
Eventually , demand will catch up with supply and we 'll be right back in the same boat we were in a year ago .
The realities are chilling .
The largest oil field in Mexico Cantarell is still in major decline and when it does run out civil unrest in that nation could explode .
These types of chokepoints , both political and physical , still exist with several major oil exporting nations .
Adult do - over
You know when you made a mistake as a kid you 'd want a " do - over " ?
If only managing a portfolio were so easy .
In a way , though , it can be .
With oil prices and commodity prices retreating , we have opportunities to take advantage of pricing we thought we 'd never see again .
Many of the solid energy , refining , drilling and exploration companies that performed exceptionally during the last surge in prices likely will do well again .
Also , several of the more established alternative energy plays should rebound along with crude oil , and they 're at just a fraction of their year - ago levels .
Investors need to be wary of volatility .
But it 's prudent to have some exposure .
Shares of many key oil stocks took a plunge , and now they 're offering some great entry points .
A few ways to play the coming rally in oil is to simply buy the December 2009 crude oil call options .
If you prefer to play the equity side , Exxon Mobil is a good bet for the majors while Halliburton HAL , - 5.40 % is one for the drilling side .
Many others are attractive .
It 's disappointing that during this lull in energy prices , more immediate action is n't being taken to stave off the rapid return of even higher energy prices .
But as investors , we need to take action and responsibility to hedge our own portfolios .
High energy prices will be back soon for those that do n't prepare .
So will the pain , unfortunately .

NEW ORLEANS 
They are the men still rebuilding New Orleans more than three years after Hurricane Katrina , the head - down laborers from Honduras , Mexico and Guatemala who work on the blazing hot roofs and inside the fetid homes for a wad of cash at the end of the day .
But on the street , these laborers are known as “ walking A.T.M.’s. ”
Their pockets stuffed with bills , the laborers are vulnerable because of language problems and their status as illegal immigrants .
And as Hispanics have become the prey of choice in crumbling neighborhoods here in one of America ’s most crime - ridden cities , racial friction between the newcomers and longtime black residents has moved close to the surface .
Geovanny Billado , a worker from Honduras , spoke of one incident in which “ they waited to punch me , ” and “ one of them stabs me with a knife . ”
It was four against one , Mr. Billado said , and he lost the $ 350 he had earned ; another time , it was seven against one .
“ You do n’t get a chance to say anything , ” he said .
“ They just fall on top of you .
It ’s better to just give the money up front .
If you do n’t give it to them , they ’ll beat you and take it anyway . ”

To some , foie gras represents the ultimate in luxury food .
In reality , it is one of the most extreme forms of cruelty still permitted today , and yet it appears on the menus of many of Vancouver ’s finest restaurants .
Foie gras is the liver of ducks who have been force - fed with a mechanical pump almost to the point of death .
The purpose of this process is to swell the liver up to 10 times its normal size , so that it becomes fatty and extremely rich .
Canadian foie gras comes from Quebec , where 500,000 ducks are killed annually for foie gras .
The majority comes from three producers , each of which slaughters in excess of 2,000 ducks each week .
In these factory farms , ducks are raised in large , enclosed sheds .
Some farms have small , crowded pens in which a few ducks are kept ; others restrain each duck in an individual cage .
Two to three times each day , a farm worker goes down the line , grabs each bird , and forces a metal pipe down his throat .
A machine pumps a corn-meal mixture directly into the duck ’s stomach in only a few seconds .
Each duck is force - fed up to one - third of his body weight in food each day .
After two weeks , they are slaughtered .
The process of force - feeding enlarges the liver so dramatically that other organs are pushed to the side , making breathing difficult .
The ducks must struggle to stand and can barely walk ; they have been observed attempting to push themselves forward with their wings when their legs can no longer support their swollen bodies .
During the force - feeding process , bills are cracked , tongues are torn , and necks are punctured by the metal feeding tubes .
The Global Action Network ’s undercover investigations at Quebec ’s foie gras farms have shown ducks vomiting bright - red , bloodstained food from their damaged throats .
Necropsied foie gras birds frequently reveal signs of trauma — scarring , lacerations , and bacterial and fungal infections .
Not surprisingly , the B.C. SPCA opposes foie gras , describing force - feeding as an “ intrusive , stressful and painful experience ” .
Why would anybody defend this wholly unnecessary “ delicacy ” ?
Sixteen countries have outlawed the practice of force - feeding .
Israel , once the world ’s fourth - largest producer , banned it in 2005 because of animal welfare concerns .
California has passed a law that will ban the production and sale of foie gras by 2012 .
Chicago passed a nearly unanimous ban on the sale of foie gras which was repealed two years later through some sneaky political maneuvering .
How would such a ban fare in Vancouver ?
Are our politicians willing to take a stand and stick to it like California , or would they wimp out like Chicago ?
The NPA - heavy council voted to ban rodeos in Vancouver .
Is the current Vision Vancouver - led council going to be more or less progressive on animal welfare issues ?
At Liberation B.C. , we are hopeful that positive change will come about in Vancouver under Mayor Gregor Robertson ’s leadership .
We have been engaging the public and collecting petition signatures in favour of a ban on the sale of foie gras , and the support we ’ve received has been overwhelming .
Becci Gindin - Clarke is a director of Liberation B.C .
The previous section of frame was so rusted through it was dangerous to drive on .
It contained huge holes and both the shock mounts and rear leaf spring hangers had either rusted free or would do so on the next large bump .
I was advised to find another toyota frame and weld on a new rear section , but between not feeling confident in my welding and not wanting an additional ty truck in my driveway , I took a less conventional approach .
Up at my local public works shop I found an abundance of scrap sign post ( galvanized ! ) from when they cut posts to length ( instead of purchasing 8 foot posts they purchase 10 foot posts and lob off 2 feet - thats government work for you ) .
They came in two different widths , and one width was the EXACT interior dimension of the truck frame .
From there I hammered post down the tube , shimmed it in place with wedges I made from taking a wall off of a sign post , and bolted it onto the frame .
From this I was able to stagger sign post into the same curvature of the previous frame .
I bolted the sign posts metal to metal on the insides of the tubes on interval , and when finished , through bolted top to bottom on interval .
No nut went on w/ out a lock washer .
I also plated the inside w/ scrap aluminum to keep the pieces from shifting .
For the cross bracing I used pressure treated wood .
I felt this was alright since it would primarily be subjected to horizontal stress and not have to support any weight , it also allowed for ease of lag screwing on a gas tank hanger .
The front leaf spring hanger bolted easily onto the sign post .
My old rear leaf spring hangers were rusted useless so I made new ones out of a shot of sign post , a bolt , and some self lubricating board .
The brake lines I never actually disconnected throughout the whole project and worked around them , and screwed the box back to the frame when I was finished .
I had to do some work with the fuel sending unit , but I wo n't go into detail on that w/ out supporting pictures .
Once I took it off blocks I was working on , I could not believe how strong it felt .
Ten times better than the old frame , and just as good as any ordinary frame .
Pluto politics hits Springfield
SPRINGFIELD - Like some sort of rulers of the universe , state lawmakers are considering restoring little Pluto 's planetary status , casting aside the scientific community 's 2006 decision downgrading the distant ice ball .
An Illinois Senate committee on Thursday unanimously supported planet Pluto and declaring March 13 " Pluto Day . "
The idea now moves to the full Senate for a vote .
The push for a state decree on Pluto comes from state Sen.
Gary Dahl , a Republican whose downstate district includes Streator , birthplace of Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh .
Dahl told colleagues Pluto is important to the local community , which considers the vote to downgrade Pluto to " dwarf " planet was unfair as it involved only 4 percent of the International Astronomical Union 's 10,000 scientists .
Dahl noted that Tombaugh is the only American ever to discover a planet .
Tombaugh first detected Pluto in 1930 at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona .
Dahl called Thursday 's committee vote a key step forward , not only for Pluto and Streator , but also for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate .
He said previous Democratic leadership sat on the proposal last year but new Senate President John Cullerton let it advance .
Cullerton cast a humorous light on the vote in view of the recent partisan turmoil over political appointments and special elections in the state .
" I supported Senator Dahl 's effort even though I was kind of surprised that apparently Pluto was decommissioned as a planet by a vote of scientists .
But he claimed the vote was a very small percentage of the scientists , " Cullerton said .
" So he ... chose to have us basically appoint Pluto to be a planet rather than have a special election among the scientists . "
All U.S. waters north of the Bering Strait may soon be closed to commercial fishing .
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council — the government body charged with administering Alaskan waters — voted unanimously in Seattle today to close 196,000 square miles ( 507,600 square kilometers ) of ocean to any fishing .
" This will close the Arctic to all commercial fishing , " says Jim Ayers , vice president for Pacific and Arctic affairs at ocean conservation organization Oceana , based in Juneau , who testified before the vote .
" This is the beginning of a concept of large protected marine areas . "
These seas — U.S. territorial waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas — are not currently fished , but sea ice melt and the northward migration of certain fish species , such as salmon , raises the possibility that they would be in the not too distant future .
This vote precludes that possibility unless scientific studies showed that such fishing would not harm Arctic ecosystems or the traditional lifestyle of indigenous populations .
" There is at present too little known about how marine ecosystems function in the Arctic , let alone how they will respond to the dramatic changes in progress , to prescribe safe harvest levels for living marine resources in the U.S. Arctic , " 43 marine scientists said in a letter to the Council chair .
" Until the rate and likely duration of sea ice losses as well as the ensuing ecosystem responses are better understood , closing the U.S. Arctic to commercial fishing is a prudent measure . "
The vote requires the National Marine Fisheries Service , part of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , to issue a report and the Secretary of Commerce is expected to officially seal the deal as early as this fall .
The U.S. Department of State noted at the meeting that this kind of decision provided the needed guidance to formulate a national policy for the Arctic .
" This gives [ the State Department ] what they need to engage in conversations with Russia and Canada , " Ayers says .
And the Marine Conservation Alliance , a Juneau - based fishing industry group , agrees that the area should be closed .
Although this is good news for fish , it does not mean that the Arctic is free from industrial threats .
The Bush administration sold leases for oil and gas exploration in the Chukchi Sea to Shell , and global warming is wreaking havoc by melting sea ice , softening permafrost and even eroding villages and towns .
That prompted towns in Alaska like Shishmaref to file a lawsuit requiring a reduction in greenhouse gases to preserve their traditional way of life .
Other nations , such as Norway , have already begun fishing in newly opened Arctic waters — meaning the U.S. - controlled zone could be a very small refuge unless the government can persuade the seven other nations with Arctic Ocean claims to follow suit .
But it does represent the first time that a fishery has been protected before it has nearly disappeared .
" [ Fishing ] laws in the U.S. are set up to just go and fish and then deal with the collapse , like what happened in New England , " Ayers says .
" This is a chance for the U.S. and other nations to actually stop and think about the Arctic Ocean as different than the Mediterranean , Atlantic or Pacific , where we 've decimated fisheries and only afterwards worried about saving them . "

Reducing costs and improving health care quality through comprehensive reform can make the struggling Detroit 3 auto industry more competitive with foreign companies , said several speakers Thursday at a White House health care reform forum in Dearborn .
Health care costs add $ 1,200 to $ 1,600 to the price of every car made in Detroit , making reform a competitive necessity , said Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm , who helped moderate the two - hour forum held at the Ford Conference and Event Center .
The forum -- the first of five to be held nationally over the next month -- was also led by Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle and Melody Barnes , director of the White House Domestic Policy Council .
 We spend far more in the U.S. for health care than any other country and we have lower outcomes ,  Granholm said .
 Health care is an issue that we must address if we want to compete globally . 
More than 25 attendees spoke about their own experiences with the health care system or to express suggestions on how to improve the health care delivery system .
Absent from the discussion , however , was how to pay for expanding access and making health care insurance more affordable .
Barnes said savings can come from adopting electronic medical records , reducing costly chronic diseases through early detection with prevention and wellness programs , and using evidence - based medical treatments .
Congressmen John Dingell Jr. , D - Dearborn , and John Conyers , D - Detroit , agreed reforming the health care industry is long overdue .
Conyers , who has introduced single - payer legislation , H.R. 676 , said improving access to care is complex ,  but not as hard as people may think . 
Dingell , who said his father introduced the nations first health care reform plan in 1948 , said health care is a right , not a privilege . 
Dr. Jim Michner , an emergency physician from Clawson who supports a single - payer system , said health care insurance should not be linked to a job that can be lost or taken away .
 I see people every day who have lost their job and have no insurance .
It makes no sense .
You lose a job and they dont take away your life or auto insurance policy ,  Michner said .
 I have lost complete faith in the private insurance industry . 
Under single - payer , private insurance companies would be abolished and health care would be financed through the government .
The private delivery system of hospitals , doctors and other providers would be maintained .
Addressing the half dozen people who also spoke out in favor of a single - payer system , Barnes said President Barack Obama wants to reach a pragmatic solution to health care reform , one that can be achieved this year .
 The president believes we need to be building on our current health care system ( that maintains the current private health insurance industry ) ,  Barnes said .
 It is the most expeditious way to go . 
But Barnes said if Obama could create a health care system from scratch , the president would go with a single - payer system .
 We believe in the employer - based system , but we need a public - private partnership ,  said Dan Loepp , CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan .
Unlike 15 years ago when the insurance industry strongly opposed President Clintons effort to reform health care , Loepp said the industry now favors reform .
 We support guarantee issue with an individual mandate ( to be covered with health insurance ) ,  Loepp said .
But illustrating one of the flaws in the current health insurance system , Adrian Campbell - Montgomery , a mother of two , described how Blue Cross in 2004 denied payment to a Southeast Michigan hospital where she was treated for cancer .
 I was 22 - years - old and needed surgery .
I got a bill for $ 8,000 that I couldnt pay ,  Campbell - Montgomery said .
 Blue Cross denied payment because there were recommendations you needed to be 26 years or older for that kind of surgery .
Two weeks ago , Campbell - Montgomery received more bad news .
She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer .
 I already owe $ 10,000 for that .
I am trying to get Medicaid .
Where does this end ?
You have to stop denying people ,  she said .
Sister Mary Ellen Howard , executive director of the Cabrini Clinic in Detroit , asked who in the audience is going to help Campbell - Montgomery .
Cabrini is the nations oldest free clinic .
 I am mad .
Who is going to help her ?
Mr. Loepp ?
Howard said .
 People are dying .
We need to do something about it .
Before Loepp could respond , however , Mike Duggan , CEO of Detroit Medical Center , offered to take care of Campbell - Montgomery .
 We will take care of you at DMC ,  said Duggan , noting that up to 25 percent of the Medicaid recipients in Michigan receive some care at DMC .
 The system is crazy .
Hospitals close in the city .
It is more profitable to go elsewhere ,  he said .
 A lot of things need to be done to ( reduce ) costs . 
Ricardo Guzman , CEO of Community Health and Social Services Center in Detroit , said the five federally qualified health centers in Detroit need funds to rebuild their aging facilities .
CHASS has three clinic locations .
 Our mission is to provide services to the uninsured and under - insured ,  Guzman said .
 We keep people out of the emergency department and we save insurers money .
We need money for infrastructure .
Our buildings are falling apart .
Nurses should be at the table when the health care reform legislation is drafted , said Teresa Cervantez Thompson , dean of nursing and health at Madonna University in Livonia .
 Nursing should be the foundation of reform ,  she said .
 We need more coordination and case management of care . 

Last week I talked about the single - player Warhammer quests , but this week I 'd like to chat aboutI think there 's something we need to clarify in the Tier 2 Mourkain Temple scenario , the instance map where both teams are attempting to grab the same objective .
I 'm not singling out the Order , necessarily .
I 've been on either end of this particular circumstance .
But I think we need to step back for a second and clarify the high - level strategy ...
With more than 2,500,000 U.S. personnel serving across the planet and military bases spread across each continent , it 's time to face up to the fact that our American democracy has spawned a global empire .
The following is excerpted from Chalmers Johnson 's new book , " Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic " ( Metropolitan Books ) .
Once upon a time , you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting up colonies .
America 's version of the colony is the military base ; and by following the changing politics of global basing , one can learn much about our ever more all - encompassing imperial " footprint " and the militarism that grows with it .
It is not easy , however , to assess the size or exact value of our empire of bases .
Official records available to the public on these subjects are misleading , although instructive .
According to the Defense Department 's annual inventories from 2002 to 2005 of real property it owns around the world , the Base Structure Report , there has been an immense churning in the numbers of installations .
The total of America 's military bases in other people 's countries in 2005 , according to official sources , was 737 .
Reflecting massive deployments to Iraq and the pursuit of President Bush 's strategy of preemptive war , the trend line for numbers of overseas bases continues to go up .
U.S. troop in Iraq
Interestingly enough , the thirty - eight large and medium - sized American facilities spread around the globe in 2005 -- mostly air and naval bases for our bombers and fleets -- almost exactly equals Britain 's thirty - six naval bases and army garrisons at its imperial zenith in 1898 .
The Roman Empire at its height in 117 AD required thirty - seven major bases to police its realm from Britannia to Egypt , from Hispania to Armenia .
Perhaps the optimum number of major citadels and fortresses for an imperialist aspiring to dominate the world is somewhere between thirty - five and forty .
Using data from fiscal year 2005 , the Pentagon bureaucrats calculated that its overseas bases were worth at least $ 127 billion -- surely far too low a figure but still larger than the gross domestic products of most countries -- and an estimated $ 658.1 billion for all of them , foreign and domestic ( a base 's " worth " is based on a Department of Defense estimate of what it would cost to replace it ) .
During fiscal 2005 , the military high command deployed to our overseas bases some 196,975 uniformed personnel as well as an equal number of dependents and Department of Defense civilian officials , and employed an additional 81,425 locally hired foreigners .
The worldwide total of U.S. military personnel in 2005 , including those based domestically , was 1,840,062 supported by an additional 473,306 Defense Department civil service employees and 203,328 local hires .
Its overseas bases , according to the Pentagon , contained 32,327 barracks , hangars , hospitals , and other buildings , which it owns , and 16,527 more that it leased .
The size of these holdings was recorded in the inventory as covering 687,347 acres overseas and 29,819,492 acres worldwide , making the Pentagon easily one of the world 's largest landlords .
These numbers , although staggeringly big , do not begin to cover all the actual bases we occupy globally .
The 2005 Base Structure Report fails , for instance , to mention any garrisons in Kosovo ( or Serbia , of which Kosovo is still officially a province ) -- even though it is the site of the huge Camp Bondsteel built in 1999 and maintained ever since by the KBR corporation ( formerly known as Kellogg Brown & Root ) , a subsidiary of the Halliburton Corporation of Houston .
Halliburton Corporation 's Houston offices
The report similarly omits bases in Afghanistan , Iraq ( 106 garrisons as of May 2005 ) , Israel , Kyrgyzstan , Qatar , and Uzbekistan , even though the U.S. military has established colossal base structures in the Persian Gulf and Central Asian areas since 9/11 .
By way of excuse , a note in the preface says that " facilities provided by other nations at foreign locations " are not included , although this is not strictly true .
The report does include twenty sites in Turkey , all owned by the Turkish government and used jointly with the Americans .
The Pentagon continues to omit from its accounts most of the $ 5 billion worth of military and espionage installations in Britain , which have long been conveniently disguised as Royal Air Force bases .
If there were an honest count , the actual size of our military empire would probably top 1,000 different bases overseas , but no one -- possibly not even the Pentagon -- knows the exact number for sure .
In some cases , foreign countries themselves have tried to keep their U.S. bases secret , fearing embarrassment if their collusion with American imperialism were revealed .
In other instances , the Pentagon seems to want to play down the building of facilities aimed at dominating energy sources , or , in a related situation , retaining a network of bases that would keep Iraq under our hegemony regardless of the wishes of any future Iraqi government .
The U.S. government tries not to divulge any information about the bases we use to eavesdrop on global communications , or our nuclear deployments , which , as William Arkin , an authority on the subject , writes , " [ have ] violated its treaty obligations .
The U.S. was lying to many of its closest allies , even in NATO , about its nuclear designs .
Tens of thousands of nuclear weapons , hundreds of bases , and dozens of ships and submarines existed in a special secret world of their own with no rational military or even ' deterrence ' justification . "
In Jordan , to take but one example , we have secretly deployed up to five thousand troops in bases on the Iraqi and Syrian borders .
( Jordan has also cooperated with the CIA in torturing prisoners we deliver to them for " interrogation . " )
Nonetheless , Jordan continues to stress that it has no special arrangements with the United States , no bases , and no American military presence .
The country is formally sovereign but actually a satellite of the United States and has been so for at least the past ten years .
Similarly , before our withdrawal from Saudi Arabia in 2003 , we habitually denied that we maintained a fleet of enormous and easily observed B - 52 bombers in Jeddah because that was what the Saudi government demanded .
So long as military bureaucrats can continue to enforce a culture of secrecy to protect themselves , no one will know the true size of our baseworld , least of all the elected representatives of the American people .
In 2005 , deployments at home and abroad were in a state of considerable flux .
This was said to be caused both by a long overdue change in the strategy for maintaining our global dominance and by the closing of surplus bases at home .
In reality , many of the changes seemed to be determined largely by the Bush administration 's urge to punish nations and domestic states that had not supported its efforts in Iraq and to reward those that had .
Thus , within the United States , bases were being relocated to the South , to states with cultures , as the Christian Science Monitor put it , " more tied to martial traditions " than the Northeast , the northern Middle West , or the Pacific Coast .
According to a North Carolina businessman gloating over his new customers , " The military is going where it is wanted and valued most . "

In part , the realignment revolved around the Pentagon 's decision to bring home by 2007 or 2008 two army divisions from Germany -- the First Armored Division and the First Infantry Division -- and one brigade ( 3,500 men ) of the Second Infantry Division from South Korea ( which , in 2005 , was officially rehoused at Fort Carson , Colorado ) .
So long as the Iraq insurgency continues , the forces involved are mostly overseas and the facilities at home are not ready for them ( nor is there enough money budgeted to get them ready ) .
Nonetheless , sooner or later , up to 70,000 troops and 100,000 family members will have to be accommodated within the United States .
The attendant 2005 " base closings " in the United States are actually a base consolidation and enlargement program with tremendous infusions of money and customers going to a few selected hub areas .
At the same time , what sounds like a retrenchment in the empire abroad is really proving to be an exponential growth in new types of bases -- without dependents and the amenities they would require -- in very remote areas where the U.S. military has never been before .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , it was obvious to anyone who thought about it that the huge concentrations of American military might in Germany , Italy , Japan , and South Korea were no longer needed to meet possible military threats .
There were not going to be future wars with the Soviet Union or any country connected to any of those places .
In 1991 , the first Bush administration should have begun decommissioning or redeploying redundant forces ; and , in fact , the Clinton administration did close some bases in Germany , such as those protecting the Fulda Gap , once envisioned as the likeliest route for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe .
But nothing was really done in those years to plan for the strategic repositioning of the American military outside the United States .
By the end of the 1990s , the neoconservatives were developing their grandiose theories to promote overt imperialism by the " lone superpower " -- including preventive and preemptive unilateral military action , spreading democracy abroad at the point of a gun , obstructing the rise of any " near - peer " country or bloc of countries that might challenge U.S. military supremacy , and a vision of a " democratic " Middle East that would supply us with all the oil we wanted .
A component of their grand design was a redeployment and streamlining of the military .
The initial rationale was for a program of transformation that would turn the armed forces into a lighter , more agile , more high - tech military , which , it was imagined , would free up funds that could be invested in imperial policing .
What came to be known as " defense transformation " first began to be publicly bandied about during the 2000 presidential election campaign .
Then 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq intervened .
In August 2002 , when the whole neocon program began to be put into action , it centered above all on a quick , easy war to incorporate Iraq into the empire .
By this time , civilian leaders in the Pentagon had become dangerously overconfident because of what they perceived as America 's military brilliance and invincibility as demonstrated in its 2001 campaign against the Taliban and al - Qaeda -- a strategy that involved reigniting the Afghan civil war through huge payoffs to Afghanistan 's Northern Alliance warlords and the massive use of American airpower to support their advance on Kabul .
World Trade Center under attack on 9-11
In August 2002 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld unveiled his " 1 - 4 - 2 - 1 defense strategy " to replace the Clinton era 's plan for having a military capable of fighting two wars -- in the Middle East and Northeast Asia -- simultaneously .
Now , war planners were to prepare to defend the United States while building and assembling forces capable of " deterring aggression and coercion " in four " critical regions " : Europe , Northeast Asia ( South Korea and Japan ) , East Asia ( the Taiwan Strait ) , and the Middle East , be able to defeat aggression in two of these regions simultaneously , and " win decisively " ( in the sense of " regime change " and occupation ) in one of those conflicts " at a time and place of our choosing .
" As the military analyst William M. Arkin commented , " [ With ] American military forces ... already stretched to the limit , the new strategy goes far beyond preparing for reactive contingencies and reads more like a plan for picking fights in new parts of the world . "
A seemingly easy three - week victory over Saddam Hussein 's forces in the spring of 2003 only reconfirmed these plans .
The U.S. military was now thought to be so magnificent that it could accomplish any task assigned to it .
The collapse of the Baathist regime in Baghdad also emboldened Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to use " transformation " to penalize nations that had been , at best , lukewarm about America 's unilateralism -- Germany , Saudi Arabia , South Korea , and Turkey -- and to reward those whose leaders had welcomed Operation Iraqi Freedom , including such old allies as Japan and Italy but also former communist countries such as Poland , Romania , and Bulgaria .
The result was the Department of Defense 's Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy , known informally as the " Global Posture Review . "
President Bush first mentioned it in a statement on November 21 , 2003 , in which he pledged to " realign the global posture " of the United States .
He reiterated the phrase and elaborated on it on August 16 , 2004 , in a speech to the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Cincinnati .
Because Bush 's Cincinnati address was part of the 2004 presidential election campaign , his comments were not taken very seriously at the time .
While he did say that the United States would reduce its troop strength in Europe and Asia by 60,000 to 70,000 , he assured his listeners that this would take a decade to accomplish -- well beyond his term in office -- and made a series of promises that sounded more like a reenlistment pitch than a statement of strategy .
" Over the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home .
We 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations , so they can surge quickly to deal with unexpected threats .
...
It will reduce the stress on our troops and our military families .
...
See , our service members will have more time on the home front , and more predictability and fewer moves over a career .
Our military spouses will have fewer job changes , greater stability , more time for their kids and to spend with their families at home . "
On September 23 , 2004 , however , Secretary Rumsfeld disclosed the first concrete details of the plan to the Senate Armed Services Committee .
With characteristic grandiosity , he described it as " the biggest re-structuring of America 's global forces since 1945 . "
Quoting then undersecretary Douglas Feith , he added , " During the Cold War we had a strong sense that we knew where the major risks and fights were going to be , so we could deploy people right there .
We 're operating now [ with ] an entirely different concept .
We need to be able to do [ the ] whole range of military operations , from combat to peacekeeping , anywhere in the world pretty quickly . "
Though this may sound plausible enough , in basing terms it opens up a vast landscape of diplomatic and bureaucratic minefields that Rumsfeld 's militarists surely underestimated .
In order to expand into new areas , the Departments of State and Defense must negotiate with the host countries such things as Status of Forces Agreements , or SOFAs , which are discussed in detail in the next chapter .
In addition , they must conclude many other required protocols , such as access rights for our aircraft and ships into foreign territory and airspace , and Article 98 Agreements .
The latter refer to article 98 of the International Criminal Court 's Rome Statute , which allows countries to exempt U.S. citizens on their territory from the ICC 's jurisdiction .
Such immunity agreements were congressionally mandated by the American Service - Members ' Protection Act of 2002 , even though the European Union holds that they are illegal .
Still other necessary accords are acquisitions and cross-servicing agreements or ACSAs , which concern the supply and storage of jet fuel , ammunition , and so forth ; terms of leases on real property ; levels of bilateral political and economic aid to the United States ( so - called host - nation support ) ; training and exercise arrangements ( Are night landings allowed ?
Live firing drills ? ) ; and environmental pollution liabilities .
When the United States is not present in a country as its conqueror or military savior , as it was in Germany , Japan , and Italy after World War II and in South Korea after the 1953 Korean War armistice , it is much more difficult to secure the kinds of agreements that allow the Pentagon to do anything it wants and that cause a host nation to pick up a large part of the costs of doing so .
When not based on conquest , the structure of the American empire of bases comes to look exceedingly fragile .

That recommendation did not go unheeded as reviewers in the CRN Test Center set out to find the most efficient and easiest way to get Windows 7 deployed on XP clients .
But after a series of tests on older and newer hardware , a number of noteworthy issues emerged : Microsoft 's statement that if hardware works with Windows Vista it will work with Windows 7 appears to be , at best , misleading ; hardware that is older , but not near the end of most business life cycles , could be impossible to upgrade ; and the addition of an extra step in the upgrade process does add complexity and more time not needed in previous upgrade cycles .
The Test Center came to this conclusion after an attempt at a simulated enterprise upgrade and other evaluations of the process on different pieces of PC hardware .
The initial plan : Create a master image on a PC running Windows XP , then upgrade that PC from XP to Vista Service Pack 1 to Windows 7 beta .
Then use an imaging utility like Acronis ' Snap Deploy to push the image out to other XP clients ( all on the same hardware as the imaged machine ) and overwrite the XP operating system on them with the Windows 7 image .
While we were prepared to run into some problems with creating a Windows 7 image and pushing it out over a network , we did not foresee the headaches involved in upgrading a single PC from XP to Vista to Windows 7 .
And believe us , there were headaches .
Using a three - and - a - half - year - old ThinkPad T43 as the master image , the first step in the process — the transition from XP to Vista — was relatively smooth with just two notable issues :
After the required reboot once Vista Service Pack 1 was installed , most of the pre-existing data and applications were intact .
However , the AVG antimalware client installed would not fire up .
Also , Windows Update would not run .
We put those issues to the side and continued on .
The next step was to get Windows 7 installed .
Since Vista upgraded with minimal issues , the anticipation was that the Windows 7 beta upgrade would be similar .
No such luck .
The installation , in and of itself , took place without incident .
Before the actual installation began , running the compatibility report warned of issues with Infrared and Synaptic pointing devices on the ThinkPad .
There also was a caution about two , third - party VPN clients that were installed .
No biggie , right ?
Wrong .
After installation , the laptop would not fully boot into Windows 7 .
It booted fine in Safe Mode , yet the offending driver , file or service that caused the screen to go back , and caused the hard - drive activity to wind down to a barely discernible pulse , could not be identified after almost two days of troubleshooting .
Yes , this is an older , though not ancient , system we were trying to upgrade .
Yet , it boggles the mind that the laptop upgraded fairly easy to Vista Service Pack 1 and then flat - lined with Windows 7 .
So much for the Microsoft mantra " If it works in Vista , it will work in Windows 7 . "
A second attempt to create a master image was made on another T43 laptop ( to rule out any hardware issues ) .
This time , Vista was upgraded to Service Pack 2 beta , and all drivers that had newer versions were upgraded .
After Windows 7 was installed , Windows forced the system back to Vista , citing that the version of Windows trying to be installed was not supported .
At least we were spared the work of rolling back .
A testing of XP to Vista to Windows 7 on a custom - built desktop , with newer components including an AMD quad - core Athlon and motherboard , went smoothly .
Yet , how many businesses have the option in these economic times to purchase spanking - new hardware ?
Why could we upgrade to Vista and not to Windows 7 ?
Further examination will continue .
Yes , the software is in beta .
However , support for XP is ending soon .
It 's clear that VARs and IT professionals will need to do a considerable amount of planning and testing before tackling an upgrade to Windows 7 .
You know , most folks think we ’re pretty expensive as places to get a telephone line go .
The thing is , they ’re wrong .
Turns out we ’re the most expensive .
Of any country in the world .
Great thing to say about a country where the internet is fairly critical for the economy …

The credit default swap market is a modern Delphic Oracle .
It speaks loudly and profoundly – these days at regular intervals – albeit using somewhat arcane terminology .
And after major statements such as yesterday ( or perhaps this week in general ) , it ’s worth pausing to reflect on , and argue about , what it really means .
Thursday ’s statement , to me , was about US banks ( graph ) .
The risk of default for US banks , according to this market , is rising back towards levels not seen since mid-October .
That is striking enough – but remember what has changed since then : ( 1 ) the G7 promised not to let any more systemic banks fail , ( 2 ) Treasury has provided repeated recapitalization funds on generous terms , and ( 3 ) the Fed offers massive , nontransparent funding to anyone in distress .
How can it be that the credit market still or again feels the risk of default rising so sharply and to such high levels ?
The most plausible interpretation – and here I ’m willing to debate what the Oracle meant exactly – is that people expect the government will force the conversion of junior bank debt into equity .
The treatment of private preferred shareholders at Citigroup , last week , is seen as the harbinger of further losses for investors .
In a comprehensive systemic clean - up approach and complete recapitalization approach , debt - equity swaps could potentially play a sensible role , particularly in countries without the fiscal capacity to sustain guarantees of all bank liabilities .
But if they are done in chaotic crisis mode – as the government appears to be signalling – the additional damage to confidence around the world will be huge .
The events of mid-September 2008 were traumatic and awful to behold .
I saw that trailer and I do n’t want to see the movie .
But it is exactly into that scary future that we now head .
It ’s never too late to change policy , to make a difference , and to turn things around .
But it is already very late .
The Information Commissioner has given the Metropolitan Police a good ticking - off for attempting to bring about the blanket introduction of CCTV in pubs .
Their stance on the issue " raised serious privacy issues " , which is data protection speak for " could possibly be unlawful " .
In response , the Met ’s initial reaction – a declaration that their policy will carry on regardless - appeared to be a shining example of how to react when authority tells us we may be acting illegally .
To be fair , that is what their spokesperson was quoted as saying yesterday : this morning , The Reg spoke with the Met , who insisted that their spokeswoman may have been misinterpreted – and that there was no longer a blanket policy .
Police will in future consider all licensing requests on their individual merits .
However , this is but one of a number of recent instances where the Police – and particularly the Met – have developed " policy " in respect of maintaining law and order that looks suspiciously like creating new law , and it is giving lawyers and politicians cause for concern .
Evidence of the blanket ban emerged when Nick Gibson took over the Draper 's Arms in Barnsbury Street , Islington from its previous owners , and then sought to relicense it .
Although the pub had no previous record of trouble , and CCTV had not been a condition of licensing , the Met nonetheless asked licensing authorities to make it a condition now .
Further inquiries revealed that in certain parts of London , the Met has a blanket policy of requiring that licensed premises install CCTV , in direct contravention of guidelines ( pdf ) from the Information Commissioner on the subject .
The Office of the Information Commissioner suggests that installation of CCTV is a major step , and in each case , should be considered on its individual merits .
The ICO has also expressed concerns that the Policing Bill , now before parliament , may make it easier for the police and local authorities to impose blanket requirements in future .
Yesterday , lawyers , MPs and activists met in Portcullis House , Westminster , to hear about a report into alleged systemic misconduct during the policing of the Kingsnorth Climate Camp in August 2008 .
The report alleges that police used S1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 as a blanket search power to stop people and disrupt the otherwise lawful activity of the protesters attempting to attend the camp .
According to the report ’s author , solicitor Frances Wright , this is not what the letter of the law says , which is that there must be a reason to suspect the individual concerned , and that stereotyping all individuals who attend a particular event is unlawful .
Comedian and political activist Mark Thomas recently took a complaint over a similar incident – in which two policemen stopped him on the grounds that he " looked over - confident " - to the Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) .
That case , too , revolved around interpretation of PACE – and the IPCC agreed that the police had over - stepped their powers .
Similar issues may arise when the police decide to set up on - street scanning facilities in order to check passers - by for the possibility that they might be carrying knives .
Police have been reported as arguing that although they have no powers to compel an individual to be scanned , a refusal to accede to a police request in this respect may itself be suspicious , thereby allowing the stop and search to go ahead anyway .
However , more recent checks in this regard have tended to rely on S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 , which allows an officer of the rank of inspector or above to authorise blanket searches where he " reasonably believes that incidents involving serious violence are imminent " .
The problem with incidents of this kind , according to Norman Baker MP , who addressed the meeting on the Climate Camp protest yesterday is that they look suspiciously like police - made law and go hand in hand with the politicisation of the police .
He said : " The IPCC exist to investigate allegations of individual misconduct by Police Officers .
They are not there to investigate systemic abuses of power , which is what seem to be going on in cases such as the Climate Camp .
" I am a strong supporter of the Police .
But there looks increasingly to be a need for additional oversight into the ways in which they interpret the law . " ®

WASHINGTON ( DC ) – In an agreement reached today between the former Bush administration and Congressman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers will testify before the House Judiciary Committee in transcribed depositions under penalty of perjury .
The committee has also reserved the right to have public testimony from Rove and Miers .
It was agreed that invocations of official privileges would be significantly limited .
In addition , if the committee uncovers information necessitating his testimony , the committee will also have the right to depose William Kelley , a former White House lawyer who played a role in the U.S. attorney firings .
The committee will also receive Bush White House documents relevant to this inquiry .
Under the agreement , the landmark ruling by Judge John Bates rejecting key Bush White House claims of executive immunity and privilege will be preserved .
If the agreement is breached , the committee can resume the litigation .
Chairman Conyers issued the following statement :
“ I have long said that I would see this matter through to the end and am encouraged that we have finally broken through the Bush administration ’s claims of absolute immunity .
This is a victory for the separation of powers and congressional oversight .
It is also a vindication of the search for truth .
I am determined to have it known whether U.S. attorneys in the Department of Justice were fired for political reasons , and if so , by whom . ”

Pro Tip
Meet The New " GX2 "
Rumors of a GT200 - based dual - GPU solution from Nvidia quickly began circulating after AMD ’s Radeon HD 4870 X2 knocked the GeForce GTX 280 from its performance throne .
Nvidia certainly had the design experience , with its GeForce 7950 GX2 and GeForce 9800 GX2 paving the way for further improvements in its multiple - GPU product line .
However , those rumors were quickly quashed by the logic that two full GTX 280 processors at 65nm would require too much power and create too much heat to be combined in a single package .
A recent die - process shrink from 65nm to 55nm helped to reduce both heat and power consumption , allowing Nvidia to pursue its two - cards - in - a - brick GX2 design using the most recent variation of its high - end graphics processor .
As with previous GX2 products , Nvidia further reduced heat and power consumption by slightly downgrading its twin graphics processors .
The new board uses the memory interface and clock speeds of its GeForceGTX 260 , but with the full 240 stream processors its GeForce GTX 280 is known for .
Given Nvidia ’s propensity for recycling the names of former high - end parts , one might have expected the company to call its new product the “ GTX 280 GX2 ” or “ GTX 380 GX2 ” .
Instead , it chose a middle road , removing the GX2 designation to title this product the GeForce GTX 295 .
We saw excellent performance in our GeForce GTX 295 preview , but wondered what advancements improved drivers could bring .
Also in the backs of our minds were SLI scaling issues that had plagued 7950 GX2 and 9800 GX2 Quad - SLI configurations , causing these to fall behind SLI pairs of single - GPU 7900 GTX and 8800 GTX cards at ultra- high graphics settings .
With these questions in mind , we set about procuring a second GTX 295 unit and two HD 4870 X2 cards for comparing Quad SLI to CrossFireX performance , plus three GTX 280 cards to compare Nvidia ’s highest - end 3 - way SLI to its current Quad - SLI solution .
Karl Bishop , who stabbed to death the Harry Potter actor Rob Knox , was today sentenced at the Old Bailey to life in prison .
Bishop , 22 , was told he must serve a minimum term of 20 years .
He was given three other life sentences for wounding Knox 's friends in the attack .
Bishop had been found guilty yesterday of murdering Knox , 18 , who was stabbed five times outside a club in his home town of Sidcup , south - east London , last May .
He injured four of Knox 's friends , most seriously Dean Saunders , 23 , who was left with permanent spinal damage after being stabbed in the neck , and Andrew Dormer , 17 , who was stabbed in the chest as he tried to disarm Bishop .
Knox completed filming on Harry Potter And The Half - Blood Prince , in which he played the part of Marcus Belby , a few days before his death .
Bishop lashed out in revenge following an earlier incident .
He had a previous conviction for a knife attack on two men and habitually carried knives .
Knox had gone out of the club to protect his younger brother Jamie , 17 , after hearing that Bishop had threatened him .
It later emerged that Bishop was under police investigation for a robbery and burglary but had not been arrested .
The Metropolitan police has disciplined two officers and changed its procedures as a result .
Bishop did not return to court to hear the other verdicts and impact statements from Knox 's parents , Colin and Sally , after he was convicted of murder .
Colin Knox , 55 , told GMTV today that his son had " paid the price for his bravery " .
He said his son would have been trying to " tackle this guy , bring him down and wait for the police to come " .
" Seeing the guy in court all week , his body language was disgusting .
When it comes to the crunch and he 's found guilty , he disappears into a hole and he can't face the parents , the friends of Robert and those people he attacked .
" It just shows the guy 's values , he 's got no morals , no values . "
Knox 's mother , Sally , 51 , said Bishop should have been made to go into court .
" Personally , once he's got his sentence and he 's gone , I will not waste my time thinking about him , " she said .
" I just think maybe somebody like him may have some kind of disturbed mind , which may not be due to the life he 's had , it just may be something in him .
I do n't know . "
They said they wanted to do something in their son's memory , such as setting up a youth centre or a sponsorship scheme for actors .
More than 150,000 people are being shelled daily and are running short of water and medicine in a Sri Lankan - government declared " No Fire Zone " , according to witness reports and United Nations briefing documents obtained by the Guardian .
Tens of thousands of people are caught between the last 1,500 fighters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and the advancing troops of the Sri Lankan army .
The civilians are trapped on a thin strip of land - estimated at 13.5 square miles ( 35 square kilometers ) - on Sri Lanka 's north - east coast .
The UN warns that if people stay they risk being killed by government shells and if they try to leave they will be in danger of being shot by the Tigers .
Diplomats say there is a real danger that a bloody denouement to the 25 - year - old civil war could result in an " all - out humanitarian catastrophe " .
Senior UN officials in Sri Lanka have shied away from publicly criticising the government in its hour of victory .
In private , many argue that outspoken criticism may backfire and see foreign aid agencies expelled at the time of greatest civilian need .
Sri Lanka has ignored calls for a ceasefire , saying that the Tigers want mass civilian deaths to spark pressure for a truce .
Diplomats in Colombo say the Tigers ' plan is to provoke a bloodbath and call for international intervention .
UN figures show there are more than 60 deaths a day due to army bombardment and more than 3,000 lives have been lost since the end of January .
The doctor in charge of the makeshift hospitals in the No Fire Zone , T Sathiyamoorthy , told the Guardian that civilians were being " repeatedly shelled for no reason " .
The army 's bombardment had seen bodies pile up in the safe zone - and local staff of aid agencies working in the government safe zone were among the dead .
" We have been hit this morning ... 52 people were injured , there were also deaths .
Five , six people [ die ] at one time .
I have seen hundreds of dead people , " said Dr Sathiyamoorthy , who is a regional director of health services .
" We are living in bunkers .
My home was bombed early in the morning . "
Patients were sleeping on mats on the floor of the hospital building .
" There 's a severe shortage of medicines .
We only have 10 % of what we need .
The government are not ready to send medicines to the area .
Contaminated water is a big problem here . "
The Sri Lankan government said Dr Sathiyamoorthy was likely to have been pressurised into giving interviews that support the " terrorist position " .
He denied he was speaking under duress .
There are only three rudimentary medical facilities now operating in the No Fire Zone , and the UN says they are dealing with 5,000 patients a day .
In an operational note to aid agencies , the UN said supplies of food , clean water and medicines were running perilously short .
It calculates the population urgently needs another 2,500 tonnes of food in the next month and an extra 1.5 m litres a day of water .
The government says it has been providing food and aid by land and sea for displaced people in the north , and the military is making every effort to avoid civilian casualties .
It disputes the UN figures and says that information from pilotless drones reveals only 70,000 people living in the No Fire Zone .
Ministers have been angered by the UN claims about the number of deaths and at claims by the UN high commissioner for human rights , Navi Pillay , that the actions by the warring parties " may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law " .
Palitha Kohona , the country 's foreign secretary and a former UN diplomat , said the international community should " acknowledge that this humanitarian crisis was created by the LTTE [ which has ] herded thousands of people and places heavy guns among the people .
If the LTTE lets the people go there will be no humanitarian crisis .
We have enough firepower to lay waste from one end to another in one night .
We have not done so . "
He said that international law does permit a " proportionate response " when forces come under fire from Tamil Tiger positions .
" This is not a situation comparable to Darfur or the western Congo .
This is a terrorist organisation holding its own people as hostages . "
There is little doubt that these are desperate times for the LTTE , which has been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east of Sri Lanka for the past quarter of a century .
The LTTE has been declared a terrorist organisation by the United States , the European Union and India .
[ Haskell ] [ ANN ] Safe Lazy IO in Haskell
Hi folks ,
We have good news ( nevertheless we hope ) for all the lazy guys standing there .
Since their birth , lazy IOs have been a great way to modularly leverage all the good things we have with * pure* , * lazy * , * Haskell * functions to the real world of files .
We are happy to present the safe - lazy - io package [ 1 ] that does exactly this and is going to be explained and motivated in the rest of this post .
===
The context === Although these times were hard with the Lazy / IO technique , some people continue to defend them arguing that all discovered problems about it was not that harmful and that taking care was sufficient .
Indeed some issues have been discovered about Lazy / IOs , some have been fixed in the underlying machinery , some have just been hidden and some others are still around .
==
An alternative == An alternative design has been proposed -- and is still evolving -- , it is called " Iteratee " [ 2 ] and has been designed by Oleg Kiselyov .
This new design has tons of advantages over standard imperative IOs , and shares some of the goals of Lazy / IOs .
Iteratee provides a way to do incremental processing in a high - level style .
Indeed both processed data ( via enumerators ) and processing code ( called iteratee ) can be modularly composed .
The handling of file - system resources is precise and safe .
Catching errors can be done precisely and can be interleaved with the processing .
In spite of all this , there is an important drawback : a lot of code has to be re-written and thought in another way .
Processing becomes explicitly chunked which is not always needed and , even worse , exceptions handling also becomes very explicit .
While this makes sense in a wide range of applications it makes things less natural than the general case of pure functions .
We think that Iteratee have too be studied more , and we recommend them when you have incrementally react to IO errors .
== Issues of Standard Lazy / IO ==
We think that we can save Lazy / IO cheaply , but before explaining the way we solve such and such issue , let 's first expose Lazy / IO and its issues .
One of the main Lazy / IO functions is ' read File ' : it takes a file path opens it and returns the list of characters until the end of the file is reached .
The characteristic of ' read File ' is that only the opening is done strictly , while the reading is performed lazily as much as the output list is processed .
Cousins of ' read File ' are ' hGetContents ' that takes a file handle and ' getContents ' that reads on the standard input .
This technique enables to process a file as if the file was completely stored in memory .
Because it is read lazily one knows that only the required part of the file will be read .
Even better , if the input is consumed to produce a small output or the output is emitted incrementally , then the processing can be done in constant memory space .
Examples : --
Prints the number of words read on stdin > countWords = print .
length .
words =<< getContents --
Prints the length of the longest line > maxLineLen = print .
maximum . map length .
lines =<< getContents --
Prints in lower case the text read on stdin > lowerText = interact ( map toLower ) -- Alternatively > lowerText = putStr . map toLower =<< getContents
All these examples are pretty idiomatic Haskell code and make a simple use of Lazy / IOs .
Each of them runs in constant memory space even if they are declared as if the whole contents were available at once .
By using stream fusion or ' ByteString ' 's one can get even faster code while keeping the code almost the same .
Here we will stay with the default list of ' Char ' 's data type .
However one goal of our approach is to be trivially adaptable to those data types .
Using our library will be rougly a matter of namespace switch plus a running function : > lowerText = LI.run ' ( SIO.putStr . map toLower < $> LI.getContents )
However we will introducing this library as one goes along .
Here is another example where the Lazy / IO are still easy to use but no longer scales well .
This program counts the lines of all the files given in arguments : > countLines = print .
length .
lines .
concat =<< mapM readFile =<< getArgs
Here the problem is the limitation of simultaneous opened files .
Indeed , all the files are opened at the beginning therefore reaching the limit easily .
It 's time to recall when the files are closed .
With standard Lazy / IOs the handle is closed when you reach the end of the file , and so when you 've explored the whole list returned by ' read File ' .
Note also that if you manually open the file and get a handle , then you can manually close the file , however if by misfortune you close the file and then still consume the lazy list you will get a truncated list , observing how much of the file has been read .
This last point is due to the fact that ' read File ' considers the reading error as the end of the file .
In particular one can fix this program , by simply counting the number of lines of each file separately and then compute the sum to get the final result .
> countLines = print .
sum =<< mapM ( fmap ( length . lines ) . readFile ) =<< getArgs
However once again this program exhausts the handle resources .
Trying to close the files will not save us either , one just risks getting truncated files .
Indeed the list of intermediate results is produced eagerly but each intermediate result is lazy and then each file is opened but not immediately closed since the computation is delayed .
Hopefully adding a bit of strictness cures the problem : > countLines = print .
sum =<< mapM ( ( return ' . length .
lines =<<) . readFile ) =<< getArgs > where return ' x = x `seq` return x
Until there , we have disclosed three problems : * while reading is lazy , opening is strict , which leads to a less natural processing of multiple files * the closing of files is hard to predict * the errors during reading are silently discarded
The last one is a bit trickier and has recently been exposed by Oleg Kiselyov [ 3 ] .
The problem appears when one gets twice the contents of the same stream --- or some kind of inter-dependent streams .
Because reading is implicitly driven by the consumer , the interleaving of reading may then depend on the reduction strategy employed .
This is the case even if the consumer is a pure function .
Basically in this example one can observe different values when using one of these functions : > f1 x y = x `seq` y `seq` x - y > f2 x y = y `seq` x `seq` x - y
In this example one reads stdin twice and relies on the error handling to end one stream while keeping the other opened .
Moreover there are other ways to achieve this like the use of unix fifo files , or using ' getChanContents ' from the " Control. Concurrent .
Chan " module .
===
Our solution ===
Here we will present another design , based on a very simple idea .
Our goal is to provide IO processing in a style very similar to standard Lazy / IO with the following differences : - preservation of the determinism ; - a simple control exceptions ; - and a precise management of resources .
Our solution is made of three key ingredients : a bit of strictness , some predefined schemas to interleave inputs , some scopes and abstract types to delimit lazy input operations from strict IO operations .
== Dealing with a single input == Let 's present the first ingredient alone through a first example : > mapHandleContents :: NFData sa => Handle -> ( String -> sa ) -> IO sa > mapHandleContents h f = do > s <- hGetContents h > return ' ( f s ) `finally` hClose h > return ' :: ( Monad m , NFData sa ) => sa -> m sa > return ' x = rnf x `seq` return x
It implements some combination of ' fmap ' and ' hGetContents ' .
Actually some of our examples fit nicely in that model : > countWords = print =<< mapHandleContents stdin ( length . words ) > maxLineLen = print =<< mapHandleContents stdin ( maximum . map length . lines ) > lowerText = putStr =<< mapHandleContents stdin ( map toLower )
However while the two first examples work well in this setting , the third one tries to allocate the whole result in memory before printing it .
Here the ingredient that is used is strictness : the purpose in forcing the result is to be sure that all the needed input is read , before the file is closed .
So here we rely on ' NFData ' instances to really perform deep forcing --- this kind of assumption is a bit like ' Typeable ' instances .
In particular functions must not be an instance of ' NFData ' : indeed , we have no way to force lazy values that are stored in the closure of a function .
The same remark applies to the ' IO ' monad for at least three reasons : ' IO ' if often represented by functions ; lazy ' IORef ' 's could be used to hide one input for later use ; exceptions with a lazy contents could also be used to make a lazy value escape .
Let 's now add some more strictness into the meal : the ' SIO ' monad ! ==
The ' SIO ' monad == The ' SIO ' monad is a thin layer over the ' IO ' monad , populated only by strict ' IO ' operations .
In particular these operations are strict in the output , which means that once the output is produced then we know that the given arguments cannot be further evaluated / forced .
Here is an example of strict IO using the ' SIO ' monad : > import qualified System .IO .
Strict as SIO > import System .IO.
Strict ( SIO ) > countWords = SIO.run ( SIO .
print .
length .
words =<< SIO.getContents )
Of course this function does not scale well since it reads the whole contents in memory before processing it .
For now the strict - io [ 4 ] package contains wrappers for functions in " System . IO " , and strict ' IORef ' 's .
One can now introduce a function in lines of ' mapHandleContents ' : > withHandleContents :: NFData sa => Handle -> ( String -> SIO sa ) -> IO sa > withHandleContents h f = do > s <- hGetContents h > SIO.run ( f s ) `finally` hClose h One can then rewrite ' lowerText ' as follow : > lowerText = withHandleContents stdin ( SIO.putStr . map toLower )
Until there one can deal quite nicely with single input , many outputs processing .
Currently the only requirement is to delimit a scope where the resource will be used to return a strict value .
Dealing with multiple inputs will lead us to our final design of lazy inputs .
== Introducing ' LI ' , Lazy Inputs ==
We first introduce a type for these lazy inputs namely ' LI ' .
This type is abstract and we will progressively introduce functions to build , combine and run them .
The ' LI ' type is a pointed functor , but not necessarily a monad nor an applicative functor .
Therefore one exports the ' pure ' function as ' pureLI ' .
Building primitives allow to read files or handles : > LI.pureLI :: a -> LI a > LI.hGetContents :: Handle -> LI String > LI.getContents :: LI String > LI.readFile :: FilePath -> LI String > LI.getChanContents :: Chan a -> LI [ a ]
Being a functor is important : it allows to wholly transform the underlying input lazily using standard functions about lists for instance : > length <$> LI.readFile " foo " > words <$> LI.readFile " foo " Extracting a final value of a lazy input ( ' LI ' type ) is a matter of using : > LI.run :: ( NFData sa ) => LI sa -> IO sa Or > LI.run ' :: ( NFData sa ) => LI ( SIO a ) ->
IO sa One can therefore re-write our examples using lazy inputs : > -- embedded printing > countWords = LI.run ' ( SIO .
print .
length .
words < $> LI.getContents ) > -- external printing > maxLineLen = print =<< LI.run ( maximum . map length .
lines < $> LI.getContents ) > lowerText = LI.run ' ( SIO.putStr . map toLower < $> LI.getContents ) == Combining inputs == Finally we come to managing multiple inputs .
To get both laziness and precise resource management we will provide dedicated combinators .
The first one is as simple as appending .
> LI.append :: NFData sa => LI [ sa ] -> LI [ sa ] -> LI [ sa ]
This one produces a single stream out that sequences the two given streams .
It also sequences the usage of resources : the first resource is closed and then the second one is opened .
Note that this combinator is still quite general since one can process each input beforehand : > -- one can drop parts of the inputs > ( take 100 < $> i1 ) ` LI.append` ( drop 100 <$ > i 2 ) > -- one can tag each input to know where they come from > Left < $> i1 `LI.append` Right <$> i2
The second one is ' LI. zipWith ' which opens the two resources and joins the items into a single stream .
Again , since ' LI ' is a functor one can join not only characters but also words , lines , chunks ...
A problem with zipping is that it stops on the shorter input ( loosing a part of the other ) , hopefully one can prolongate them : > zipMaybesWith :: ( NFData sa , NFData sb ) -> ( Maybe sa -> Maybe sb -> c ) -> LI [ sa ] -> LI [ sb ] -> LI [ c ] > zipMaybesWith f xs ys = > map ( uncurry f ) .

The last one is ' LI.interleave ' : > LI.interleave :: ( NFData sa ) -> LI [ sa ] -> LI [ sa ] -> LI [ sa ]
This function is currently left biased , moreover each resource is closed as soon as we reach its end .
However since the inputs are mixed up together one generally prefers a tagged version trivially build upon this one : > interleaveEither :: ( NFData sa , NFData sb ) => LI [ sa ] -> LI [ sb ] -> LI [ Either sa sb ] > interleaveEither a b = interleave ( map Left < $> a ) ( map Right < $> b)
Here are some final programs that scale well with the number of files .
> -- number of words in the given files > main = print =<< LI.run . fmap ( length . words ) .
LI.concat . map LI.readFile =<< getArgs > -- almost the same thing but counts words independently in each file > main = print > =<< LI.run . fmap sum .
LI. sequence . map ( fmap ( length . words ) .
LI.readFile ) > =<< getArgs > -- prints to stdout swap - cased concatenation of all input files > main = LI.run ' . ( fmap ( SIO.putStr . fmap swapCase ) .
LI.concat . map LI.readFile ) =<< getArgs > where swapCase c | isUpper c = toLower c > | otherwise = toUpper c > -- sums character code points of inputs > main = print =<< LI.run . fmap ( sum . map ( toInteger . ord ) ) .
LI.concat . map LI.readFile =<< getArgs

Paul Harvey on gun control
Are you considering backing gun control laws ?
Do you think that because you may not own a gun , the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment do n't matter ?
CONSIDER THESE STATISTICS !!!!!!!!...................
In 1929 the Soviet Union established gun control .
From 1929 to 1953 , approximately 20 million dissidents , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
In 1911 , Turkey established gun control .
From 1915 - 1917 , 1.5 million Armenians , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945 , 13 million Jews , gypsies , homosexuals , the mentally ill , and others , who were unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
China established gun control in 1935 .
From 1948 to 1952 , 20 million political dissidents , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
Guatemala established gun control in 1964 .
From 1964 to 1981 , 100,000 MayanIndians , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
Uganda established gun control in 1970 .
From 1971 to 1979 , 300,000 Christians , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
Cambodia established gun control in 1956 .
From 1975 to 1977 , one million " educated " people , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
That places total victims who lost their lives because of gun control at approximately 56 million in the last century .
Since we should learn from the mistakes of history , the next time someone talks in favor of gun control , find out which group of citizens they wish to have exterminated .
It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed , a program costing the government more than $ 500 million dollars .
The results Australia - wide ; Homicides are up 3.2 % , Assaults are up 8 % , and Armed robberies are up 44 % .
In that country 's state of Victoria , homicides with firearms are up 300 % .
Over the previous 25 years , figures show a steady decrease in armed robberies and Australian politicians are on the spot and at a loss to explain how no improvement in " safety " has been observed after such monumental effort and expense was successfully expended in " ridding society of guns . "
It 's time to state it plainly ;
Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and , yes , gun-control laws only affect the law - abiding citizens .
Take action before it 's too late , write or call your delegation .

Taxpayers will lose if toxic assets deals fail

The Treasury Department 's plan to form public - private partnerships to buy illiquid assets from banks looks like a much better deal for private investors than public ones .
Under one example provided by the Treasury , the public ( i.e. taxpayers ) and private investors will buy these assets , hold onto them and hope their value goes up .
If they do , the public and private investors will share profits 50 - 50 .
If they do n't , the public will bear a much bigger share of the losses because the government is guaranteeing a large portion of the money used to buy the assets .
Whether the plan works depends on whether the partnerships and the banks can agree to a price for these so - called legacy assets and whether participating banks will use the money they get to make new loans .
Banks are n't required to plow the funds back into new loans , but they most likely will because that 's how banks make money , a Treasury spokesman says .
Although investors clearly welcomed the plan , sending Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points Monday , its success is far from certain .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The Treasury announced two types of public - private partnerships Tuesday , one for loans and one for securities backed by mortgages .
Here 's how the loan plan works :
Suppose a bank wants to sell a pool of mortgages originally worth $ 100 .
The bank approaches the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
It decides that for every dollar a partnership puts into this pool , the FDIC will guarantee $ 6 in debt issued by the partnership .
The FDIC then auctions off the pool to a group of private - sector investors such as hedge funds , private equity firms and pension funds .
The highest bid is $ 84 .
Treasury forms a partnership with the high bidder , and each side puts up half of the partnership 's capital .
Of the $ 84 purchase price , Treasury puts in $ 6 , the investor puts in $ 6 and the partnership sells $ 72 in debt guaranteed by the FDIC .
The investor manages the pool .
If the value of the loan pool goes up , the Treasury and the private investor split the profits and the debt gets repaid .
If the value goes down , the Treasury and the private investors could lose up to - but no more than - their original investment .
After that , the FDIC bears the losses .
In practice , every partnership could be different .
The government could put in as much as 80 percent of a partnership 's capital and the FDIC might finance a much smaller part of the purchase .
The plan for securities is a bit different and involves financing from the Federal Reserve , not the FDIC .
Treasury hopes the plans will end the stalemate between banks that think their loans are worth more than current market prices and investors who think they are worth less .
Guy Benstead , manager of the Forward Long - Short Credit Analysis fund , says Treasury is hoping that the low - cost financing will encourage investors to pay more than they otherwise would .
" It 's unclear to me whether it is going to work , " he says .
Some big investors say they would be interested if the terms are right .
Andrew McCormick , head of securitized products for T. Rowe Price , says the risk / reward proposition looks good for investors and his firm will consider participating .
" Most likely , we would work in partnership with some of our larger institutional investors and if we could find a way to make the product viable for retail investors , we would explore that as well , " he says .
Ricardo Duran , a spokesman for the California State Teachers ' Retirement System , says the system is " ideally situated to take advantage of these types of opportunities . "
On March 5 , its board allocated $ 1 billion to buy " solid securities from distressed sellers , " such as those that offered under the Treasury program .
That number could go as high as $ 6 billion , Duran adds .
Bond giant BlackRock plans to participate in the partnerships .
Six weeks ago , it raised $ 308 million from well - heeled clients for a private , closed - end fund that will invest " in these exact same assets , by and large , " says Curtis Arledge , the firm 's co-head of fixed income .
BlackRock could not put a lot of these assets in its publicly traded , open - end funds because they can only hold a limited amount of illiquid assets .
But its Total Return funds , which own some of these assets , could benefit if the Treasury plan increases their value .

The blogosphere , normally full of hot air , succumbed to an Arctic front of chilly disapproval when Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced 16 new Conservative senators this morning .
At Keeping it Real , retired journalist Harvey Oberfeld was quick to denounce the appointments :
Liars !
Deceitful charlatans !
There has been only one elected , and then officially appointed Senator … Stan Waters of Alberta .
That was it .
All for show , quite clearly now not representing any ongoing real substance .
Because now , the Prime Minister has publicly and unashamedly reverted to the same cynical sewer - level pork barrel politics he used to so loudly condemn .
Remember the Triple E principles for the Senate ?
Equal , Elected and Effective .
Gone , caput , trampled to death by a Prime Minister who had already shown us he is willing to use the political jack - boot to retain power … shutting down Parliament to prevent it voting against him .
And now he has abandoned Triple “ E ” opting instead for a Triple “ P ” Senate : Pork - appointed Partisan Prostitutes .
In an earlier post , Oberfeld predicted a short political future for Harper , based on the Senate appointments and a number of other miscalculations .
The Shotgun , a right - wing blog , offered a left - handed compliment to Nancy Greene Rain : “ She possesses a fairly sharp political mind , one that tilts decidedly to the right . ”
No comment on the policy implications of deserting the concept of the triple - E Senate .
Bill Tieleman erupted : “ Senate ’s Red Chamber becomes Porkers ’ Hall of Shame ” :
The real Christmas message is more clear from today ’s pork - fest though : “ We will say anything and do anything to stay in power and reward our friends and insiders - principles be damned ! ”
The Left Coast concurred : “ Nice way to show the country that he has learned from his recent brush with defeat and has chosen to be more conciliatory .
Not . ”
And the commenters on North Vancouver Politics offered , at best , tepid support for the appointments .
Most right - wing blogs have so far said little about the Senate picks , but The Hook will link to any that do comment on them .

Dear EarthTalk :
If you have an electric or plug - in hybrid car , you ’re paying for electricity rather than gasoline all or most of the time .
How does that cost compare to a gas - powered car ’s cost - per -mile ?
And since the electricity may be generated from some other polluting source , does it really work out to be better for the environment ?
-- Kevin DeMarco , Milford , Connecticut
When you compare battery to gasoline power , electricity wins hands down .
A 2007 study by the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) calculated that powering a plug - in hybrid electric vehicle ( PHEV ) would cost the equivalent of roughly 75 cents per gallon of gasoline — a price not seen at the pump for 30 years .
The calculation was made using an average cost of electricity of 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour and the estimated distance the car would travel on one charge , versus a car that gets 25 miles per gallon and is powered by $ 3 per gallon gasoline .
Change any of those variables and the relative costs change .
For example , substituting a car that gets 50 miles per gallon doubles the comparative electrical cost ( though it still works out much cheaper than gasoline ) .
On the other hand , in some areas where wind or hydropower is wasted at night — just when the PHEV would be charging — the utility might drop the kilowatt hour cost to two to three cents , making the charge much less costly .
And do n’t worry that we ’ll run out of electrical power : A 2005 study by the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory estimated that three - quarters of the country ’s current small vehicle fleet could be charged by our existing electrical grid without building new power plants .
( And if all those cars were replaced by PHEVs , it would eliminate the need for 6.5 billion barrels of oil per day , or 52 percent of current U.S. oil imports . )
Regarding environmental impact , charging up your car with electricity from the grid also wins handily over filling up at the gas station .
In the most comprehensive PHEV study to date , released in 2007 by EPRI and the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , results predict that all greenhouse gases will be reduced as PHEVs begin to penetrate the car market .
Estimated cumulative greenhouse gas reductions from 2010 to 2050 , depending upon how fast PHEVs take hold , range from 3.4 to 10.3 billion tons .
More than one half of our national energy grid is powered by coal , and in areas where PHEVs are charged through coal - provided electricity , says NRDC , there is the possibility of increased levels of soot and mercury emissions .
However , charging up can be much less of a guilt - ridden affair where cleaner electrical sources like wind and solar are available .
The website HybridCars.com points out that as more power plants are required to develop green power and emit fewer greenhouse gases , the environmental and health benefits will further increase .

As the dismal economy spawns desperate measures , some Americans are resorting to a hazardous practice : stealing electricity .
Many utilities say energy theft has risen sharply during the economic downturn .
Culprits include residential customers whose power is turned off when they fall behind on their bills and small businesses struggling to keep their doors open .
They 're using a wide array of tactics .
Some run wires from utility lines directly into a circuit - breaker panel , bypassing the electric meter .
Others attach cables on either side of a meter , swipe meters from vacant houses when theirs are removed or tamper with meters to lower their electric bills .
" We 're finding more and more people are … stealing electricity because of the poor economy , " says John Hammerberg , investigations supervisor for Tampa Electric in Florida .
American Electric
Power has investigated 3,196 cases of theft in January and February , a 27 % jump over the year - ago period , says AEP spokesman Pat Hemlepp .
The company serves Rust Belt states hit hard by layoffs , such as Michigan , Indiana and Ohio .
In Philadelphia , of 14,000 customers whose service was turned off in early 2008 , 30 % were illegally using electricity late last year , utility PECO says .
Customers have stolen power for decades , costing utilities 1 % to 3 % of revenue — or about $ 6 billion industrywide — each year , according to Electric Light & Power magazine .
Losses are borne by other customers .
Many thieves operate home - based marijuana farms that use lots of lights .
But the problem is mushrooming .
In Pennsylvania , utility PPL says thefts rose 16 % last year , with fewer drug - related incidents and more tied to service terminations .
Power shutoffs across the USA doubled last year to 4 % of home accounts , says the National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association .
Meanwhile , consulting firm Detectent has identified a double - digit rise in business thefts the past six months , many by energy - guzzling restaurants .
In Detroit , Donald Brant , 48 , was charged last fall with meter rigging .
DTE
Energy says he helped about 50 downtown businesses cut their gas and electric bills by more than $ 1 million — or 30 % to 50 % each — the past several years .
The practice is dangerous .
Touching a power line can burn or even kill an untrained person .
In Philadelphia this month , an illegal electricity hookup in a row house sparked a fire that killed a 30 - year - old woman and her 8 - year - old daughter .
Utilities often learn of thefts from meter readers , neighbors or abnormal use patterns .
They expect to detect fraud earlier as they roll out smart meters that can remotely monitor electricity use .

Turing 's Euclidean Stroke of Genius
Blog » Turing 's Euclidean Stroke of Genius
Posted on
Everybody knows Alan Turing was the father of the computer .
What is less appreciated is that Turing stands right next to Euclid in the pantheon of creative geniuses .
What is almost never mentioned is why Turing deserves so lofty a ranking .
I 'm an autodidact , so I do n't know how the computer science curriculum is usually organized , but I would guess that students learn about Turing machines relatively early in their education , once they have mastered a few programming languages .
I 've been through a half dozen or so texts on theoretical computer science that cover this ground .
They all have one thing in common : they utterly ignore Turing 's fundamental insight !
Such texts teach the machine ; one learns that a Turing machine involves a " tape " that slides about , with a read / write head , etc .
So the student memorizes , works exercises , and comes away with a nice , formal notion of computation in terms of an abstract machine .
That 's the way I learned it , any way , and it seems to be the way most textbooks teach it .
Now that 's a fine thing , and it explains how computers work , and how some things are " computable " and some not , and so forth .
It 's all very clever , but it 's also entirely formal .
I did n't come away from it thinking that Turing was anything but a very clever mathematical engineer .
In fact the lambda calculus seems much more elegant and simple than all this business of tapes , machine states , and so forth .
Turing seemed to me to be a little like Henry Ford or Thomas Edison : an inventor of a useful machine .
An ingenious inventor , but still just an inventor .
Studying Turing machines never gave me the feeling that I was in the presence of genius ; I would have ranked many mathematicians far ahead of Turing .
Then I came across Robert Soare 's paper Computability and Recursion and realized that I was getting only half the story .
I 'm not competent to judge the paper 's technical merits , but I can confidently recommend that it should be required reading for anybody studying either Turing machines or the lambda calculus , if only for its excellent account of the history of the concepts of computability and recursion .
It 's really more an essay in the history of ideas than a technical paper .
The key point Soare makes , although he does n't express it in quite this way , is this : it 's all about intuition , and intuition is all about lived , human experience .
The formalism of the machine comes after the leap of imagination that allowed Turing to crystalize intuitions about human experience in formal terms .
Soare points out that Godel was unconvinced by Church 's recursive model of computation precisely because it was unconnected to intuitions derived from lived experience .
It turns out that the key section of Turing 's landmark 1936 paper , On computable numbers , with an application to the entscheidungsproblem , is section 9 , wherein he grounds his formalism in an attempt " to show that the ' computable ' numbers include all numbers which would naturally be regarded as computable " .
The next sentence strikes at the heart of the matter : " All arguments which can be given are bound to be , fundamentally , appeals to intuition , and for this reason rather unsatisfactory mathematically . "
In other words , we have certain real - world experiences calculating numbers , and based on that experience , we have an intuition that some numbers are just " naturally " computable .
Now the previous eight sections of his paper described his Turing machine ; his observation here amounts to an admission that there is a fundamental rift between our intuitive notion of naturally computable and the numbers computable by his machine formalism .
On the one hand , it 's not enough to just have a warm fuzzy feeling that the machine can compute everything we think is naturally computable ; on the other hand , we can never prove that it can , since intuitions based on experience are not mathematical objects .
Turing 's stroke of genius was to do for the experience of calculating what Euclid did for the experience of extensionality in space : he found a way to think about that experience in terms of an ideal , formal imaginative structure whose faithfulness to intuitive experience is indisputable .
Euclid came up with notions like a point with no height or width and a line with width but no height ; such ideas can never be proven to represent real space , but the intuition that they do is so compelling that it must be accepted .
Turing did exactly the same thing for the experience of calculating , literally with pencil and paper .
Most of section 9 of his paper is devoted to describing the work of a human " computer " .
As Soare points out , in the mid-thirties the term " computer " meant a human engaged in calculation .
Turing analyzed the process involved in such calculating .
Post - Turing , it 's easy to underappreciate what an imaginative leap this was .
Calculation by a human , with pencil and paper , is essentially an analog process .
If it does n't look like that to you today , it 's only because of the revolution in thought brought about by Turing .
( Evidence : Godel could n't come up with it . )
He looked at the process of calculating by writing stuff down on a piece of paper divided into squares " like a child 's arithmetic book " , and essentially realized that we can model that analog process as a finite discrete process , a sequence of " ' simple operations ' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided . "
He furthermore realized that we can model the human computer 's " state of mind " in finite , discrete terms .
With a few other simple constraints we end up with a formal imaginative model of the work of the human computer that can be directly " mathematicalized " ; we can " construct a machine to do the work of this computer " , and that machine will correspond naturally , intuitively , and directly to the lived experience of performing a calculation .
Turing 's machine is to the experience of calculation as Euclid 's one dimensional line is to the edge of a straightedge .
The sad thing is that section 9 , although it is the heart of Turing 's argument , is very simple ; but I 've yet to come across a text on theoretical computer science that even mentions it .
You do n't really even need mathematics to understand it , and yet it is the foundation of a massive revolution in human thinking .
If a number is computable by a Turing machine , and a Turing machine is a formalization of intuition , then what does " number " mean ?
For Euclid , number was synonymous with length ( which is why the Greeks could not stomach zero as a number ) ; post - Turing , ( computable ) number is synonymous with the process of computation .
For Euclid , numbers say something about extension in space ; post - Turing , numbers say something about thinking - Turing 's machine models the process of human computation ; human computation is a thought process ; therefore Turing machine is synonymous with mind .
Etc. etc .
In the popular mind this sort of stuff often comes up as the question of whether or not computers can think , which most people probably think of as whether or not computers can simulate human behavior .
But the real question is the other way around : is thinking essentially computational ?
Not so different from asking whether space is essentially geometric .

Haute - Provence Star Trails
Credit & Copyright : Alexandre Santerne / OHP-CNRS
Explanation :
Fix your camera to a tripod and you can record the graceful trails traced by the stars as planet Earth rotates on its axis .
For example , this dramatic 5 hour long exposure was made on February 24 from Haute - Provence Observatory ( OHP ) in southeastern France .
Actually a composite of 300 consecutive 1 - minute exposures , the image nicely shows stars near the celestial equator tracing nearly straight lines in projection , while stars north and south of the equator , respectively , appear to circle the north and south celestial poles .
Domes at the bottom left and right house the OHP telescopes .
Brilliant planet Venus makes the short bright trail at the lower right , while trails of stars in the constellation Orion end near the lower right observatory dome .
Sirius , alpha star of Canis Major , traces the bright arc over the dome at the left .
Astronomer Alexandre Santerne also briefly illuminated a foreground oak tree during the exposure sequence .
They also claimed that , because files are broken up into tiny " packets " before being sent over BitTorrent , this may not be enough to suggest a " substantial portion " of a copyrighted file was distributed .
The movie studios ' lawyers argued that this is irrelevant to their case as all they need to prove is that iiNet users illegally obtained the files and then made them available for others to download over BitTorrent .
Admitting this is dangerous for iiNet because it would then make the ISP potentially liable and exposed to a multimillion - dollar damages claim .
The studios hired online investigators DtecNet to intercept BitTorrent traffic and record all instances of iiNet users transmitting copyrighted movies illegally .
They claim the evidence is iron - clad and barrister Tony Bannon , SC , was visibly frustrated that iiNet would not accept it .
" How you ca n't admit that [ iiNet users download movies illegally ] ... is quite frankly beyond us , " he said .
" They do n't stop customers doing what they 're doing and they keep asserting that they have insufficient information . "
The studios claim iiNet in effect " authorised " customers ' copyright infringement by failing to disconnect them when notified of the infringements by the movie studios .
iiNet 's barrister , Richard Cobden , SC , said the ISP was not required to act on a " mere allegation of copyright infringement " and used comments from former attorney - general Philip Ruddock that apparently back up this claim .
iiNet has previously said that the case was " like suing the electricity company for things people do with their electricity " .
The studios say DtecNet 's evidence is enough for iiNet to definitively determine whether a customer is trading movies illegally by comparing it with their own server logs .
Much of today 's hearing was devoted to bringing Justice Dennis Cowdroy up to speed with technical concepts such as IP addresses and the workings of BitTorrent .
The studios ' lawyers admitted that DtecNet 's evidence could only tell them that an iiNet user was illegally downloading , but could not identify the individual customer .
However , they pointed to previous judgments in the cases against the Kazaa file sharing service and MP3s4 free.
net owner Stephen Cooper , which found it was " not necessary to know the identify of each individual user " .
As part of their statement of claim , the studios also said iiNet was responsible for customers downloading movies illegally and then burning them to DVD to sell or share with friends .
Justice Cowdroy in court today questioned whether they had any evidence that this was occurring , to which the studios ' lawyers replied : " This is a notorious practice . "
Justice Cowdroy also asked whether , upon receiving an infringement notice from the movie studios , it was possible for iiNet to go back and confirm that the user was downloading a specific movie at a particular time .
Bannon said he could n't " say yes or no " at that time .
The case is set for a formal hearing about October .
The landmark case will determine the lengths to which an internet provider must go to prevent illegal downloading on its network .
A loss for the movie industry could leave it no choice but to go after individual downloaders , as has occurred in the US .
However , if iiNet loses , all ISPs could be forced to disconnect customers identified by the movie studios as illegal downloaders .

So it should be of little surprise that a growing number of corporations are beefing up scrutiny and disclosure of their own political activities to shareholders .
The Center for Political Accountability , an organization that works with shareholders to get companies to open their political books , is set to announce Tuesday that seven additional firms have agreed to do so : Alcoa Inc. , Dow Chemical Co. , Cummins Engine , U.S. Bancorp , El Paso Corp. , Baxter International Inc. and Dominion Resources .
Overall , that means that 40 of the nation ’s 100 largest corporations have begun to provide more details about their political operations and donations in their annual reports .
In some cases , that information goes beyond what is available in public disclosure reports .
For instance , the center and its shareholder partners have been prodding corporations to release contributions made to trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and PhRMA .
Those donations are typically not available to the public because trade groups are n’t covered by campaign finance laws .
And that dearth of information can make it difficult for the public and lawmakers to know who ’s really behind some lobbying campaigns .
It ’s an end - run that has become well worn in Washington as businesses seek to avoid offending their bipartisan customer or client bases or picking fights with Congress that might come back to haunt them .
But keeping secrets from partisan opponents or campaign watchdogs is a lot easier than withholding data from shareholders , once the disclosure decision has been made .
Baxter International , for instance , has steadily increased the amount of data it discloses each year , said spokeswoman Deborah Spak .
And Alcoa agreed this year to release the portion of its Chamber dues that ’s applied to the trade group ’s overall lobbying efforts , said firm Vice President Donna Dabney .
“ It ’s not a large amount , and some of our shareholders are interested in this information , ” she said .
“ Our policy has always been to be transparent . ”
. Insurance giant Aetna is now a veteran in the shareholder disclosure field , with its 2007 annual disclosure report that illustrated the wealth of political giving that ’s not required to be disclosed by law .
Beyond the $ 506,500 it gave to state and federal candidates , the firm spent $ 3.2 million on dues and other payments to a variety of state and federal trade associations , the report noted .
Eleven of those contributions were more than $ 50,000 , triggering an in - house corporate policy of disclosure .
Among them : $ 950,000 to American Health Insurance Plans , $ 750,000 to the Coalition for Affordable Quality Healthcare , $ 235,000 to the Business Roundtable and $ 50,000 to the Coalition to Advance Healthcare Reform .
All of the groups are expected to be very active in the health care reform debate likely on Capitol Hill this summer .
And , on occasion , Aetna might even find itself on both sides of a fight as those trade groups take differing positions .
The drug maker Pfizer also extensively lists its political activity .
Its report keeps track of its winners and losers and puts a symbol by the name of lawmakers who received contributions and have Pfizer facilities in their districts .
Pfizer executives also disclosed that the firm donated $ 50,000 to PhRMA , the major pharmaceutical trade group in Washington , which is n’t required to disclose that type of information .
The Center for Political Accountability ’s executive director , Bruce Feed , has been pressing the case for shareholder disclosure for three years , and he senses that the corporate world is coming around .
“ We ’re finding in discussions with companies that they are paying much more attention to the recipients of their political spending .
They have much tighter vetting procedures , ” he said .
Corporate executives increasingly are vetting candidates with an eye toward ensuring that an association wo n’t “ come back and bite them in the tush , ” he added .
As the corporate proxy season opens , Freed and his partners have filed 56 shareholder resolutions urging firms to provide greater details about their political activities in annual reports .
Perhaps not surprisingly , a hard target in the shareholder sunshine campaign has been the financial sector .
American Express , Capitol One , Prudential and U.S. Bankcorp are among the financial houses providing shareholders with more information .
Citigroup is expected to release a report in March , so it ’s not yet clear how detailed it will be .
Resolutions urging disclosure are on file at Charles Schwab , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Regions Financial and Wells Fargo .
Bank of America , a major recipient of billions of dollars in federal bailout funds , rejected a shareholder resolution for technical reasons .
But , of course , it now has a new shareholder with a fair amount of clout to find out anything it wants : Congress
The risk to the UK from falling oil production in coming years is greater than the threat posed by terrorism , according to an industry taskforce report published today .
The report , from the Peak Oil group , warns that the problem of declining availability of oil will hit the UK earlier than generally expected - possibly within the next five years and as early as 2011 .
Oil supply could then rapidly decline , or even collapse , the report warns , with potentially devastating implications for the UK economy .
The report was issued today by the recently established UK industry taskforce on peak oil and energy security , a group of eight companies including transport firms Virgin , Stagecoach and FirstGroup , engineers Arup , architects Foster and Partners , and energy giant Scottish and Southern .
Entitled The Oil Crunch , the report argues that the risk of an early peak in oil production poses a bigger threat to UK society than tightening gas supplies , terrorism or the short - term impacts of climate change .
Oil production
The " peak oil " debate has raged for many years .
Some governments and oil companies believe that crude oil production will meet rising demand for decades to come .
But an increasingly vocal group - including many experts from within the oil industry - claim that a production peak is imminent .
The new report marks the first time a group of businesses has weighed into this debate .
At its core are two newly commissioned assessments of future oil production : one from Chris Skrebowski , consulting editor of Petroleum Review , and one from Shell .
Skrebowski predicts that global oil production will peak in the period 2011 - 2013 and then decline steadily , with non-conventional sources such as tar sands failing to fill the gap in time to avoid a serious energy crunch .
He also warns that supplies could collapse if a handful of huge , long - established oil fields go into terminal decline simultaneously .
Shell , by contrast , foresees oil production rising until 2015 , and then remaining on a plateau until the 2020s , with unconventional sources balancing out a decline in regular crude extraction .
Having examined the evidence , the taskforce considers that Skrebowski's peak - and - fall scenario is the " highly probable " outcome , with the collapse scenario also possible .
This view contrasts starkly with the position of the British government .
A statement from the new Department of Energy and Climate Change reiterates the government 's established view on this issue .
" The government 's assessment is that global proven reserves are larger than the cumulative production needed to meet rising demand until at least 2030 , " the statement says .
" This is consistent with the assessment made by the International Energy Agency in its 2007 World Energy Outlook that lead to the conclusion that global oil resources are adequate for the foreseeable future . "

What kid has n’t lain in bed at night and tried to transport some object to them using just the power of their mind , just to see if maybe that Force thing was actually real ?
I ’ll admit I did .
Of course nothing happened , but a new toy is designed to give players the feeling that they do have the Force flowing through them by harnessing brainwaves to " levitate " a ball .
The Star Wars licensed Force Trainer from Uncle Milton uses a wireless headset that reads alpha and beta waves via electroencephalography ( EEG ) technology .
Alpha and Beta waves are the names given to electrical activity in the brain between 7.5 and 30 Hz - depending on which classification you read - which for the purposes of the game identifies when you are relaxed and concentrated .
When the player achieves this Jedi - like state of inner calm a fan at the bottom of the unit kicks - in and a ball rises up a clear plastic tower giving the player the sense that they are indeed manipulating the Force .
With a little encouragement from Yoda players then move through different levels of difficulty to achieve Jedi Master status .
Given that calmness and relaxation is the winner , this is one game you would let the kids play before bed .
Gizmag ’s resident Jedi Master Loz Blain got a first hand look at the Force Trainer at the Australian Toy Hobby and Nursery Fair and put his Jedi skills to the test .
Check out the vid to see him in action and learn more about how the Force Trainer works from Uncle Milton 's Dodd Harris .

Click to viewThere 's one building in Los Angeles that screams " retro- futuristic gothic , " and it was built in 1893 .
The Bradbury Building featured heavily in Blade Runner , but it 's starred in tons of other stories .
Here 's a list .

We already toured the Bradbury Building back in 2007 , as part of the closing ceremonies of the Jules Verne Festival , and you can see more of our pics from the event here .

The story of the building 's origins is , in itself , bizarre and remarkable : George Wyman was an apprentice to his architect uncle , with no formal degrees , but millionaire Louis Bradbury liked George 's creativity .
Bradbury wanted to hire Wyman , instead of his uncle , to design the building , but Bradbury did n't want to stab his uncle in the back .
So he asked his long - dead brother for advice , using a planchette to contact the spirit world .
" Take the Bradbury Building , " the brother 's ghost advised .
" It will make you famous . "
Wyman was also inspired by Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward , a utopian science fiction book set in the futuristic world of 2000 .
Wyman gave the building an oversized skylight , which Esther McCoy calls " a fairy tale of mathematics . "
The building features lovely bas - reliefs , ornate wooden doors , geometrically patterned staircases , open - caged elevators ( originally steam - powered ! ) , iron grillwork and marble floors .
Writes Kevin Starr in the book Material Dreams :
In an architecture of steel and glass , marble , tile and movement , George Wyman envisioned and presented the material dream of Southern California as a technology flooded by sunlight .
It 's appeared in tons of noir classics , but also in a jillion science fiction stories .
Here 's that list :
Major Appearances :
1. Blade Runner .
It 's probably the most important location in the film , followed by the 2nd Street Tunnel , Union Station and the Ennis - Brown building .

2. The Outer Limits , " Demon with a Glass Hand . "
Most of this Harlan Ellison penned episode , generally considered one of the series 's finest episodes , takes place within the Bradbury .
Ellison originally wanted the episode to involve a cross-country chase , but producers nixed the idea for financial reasons .
So Ellison chose the Bradbury as a single structure that could contain the entire storyline , about a man with a mysterious transparent computer hand , which is missing three fingers .
Here 's a clip :

Remember Samuel T. Cogley , the luddite super - lawyer who gets Kirk out of murder charges in one original Star Trek episode ?
He stars in his own novel , and we discover he works out of the now four - hundred year old Bradbury Building .
That 's some good upkeep .
Writes author Tony Isabella :
Surrounded by a forest of skyscrapers of the newest design and materials , the Bradbury Building stood out because it was none of those things .
Its exterior was neither metal nor transparent aluminum , but a nondescript combination of sandstone and brick .
Its five - story height was dwarfed by the surrounding towers , which reached to the sky as if trying to overcompensate for being next to the Bradbury .
They were , after all , just buildings ; the Bradbury was history .

8. The Indestructible Man . This MST3K classic features Lon Chaney being all indestructible in the Bradbury Building .
Says actor Casey Adams , " the Bradbury Building [ was ] used in the scene where Chaney goes into it to kill one man .

Ahhh , but that is exactly what led us to this recession in the first place , my friend .
In fact , deregulation is the official cause of the crisis according to the IMF .
This is nt anything new , though .
Republicans have espoused this belief for years .
Back in the thirties Treasury Secretary Mellon , a Republican economist , was one of the most adamant supporters of laissez - faire .
So when the Great Depression struck , Hoover had the chance to prove the efficiency of the theory as a way to deal with an economic crisis ( along with some minor monetary policy adjustments ) , and as history shows  it failed horribly .
Of course Hoover got his ass replaced by a socialist 
Democrat who , through the use of fiscal policy ( much like Obama ) , pretty much restored the economy to a healthy state .
Now , letting everyone fail is simply not a realistic option .
Unlike other recessions , this time weve lost the most amount of household wealth ever , mainly in the form of stock prices and home values .
The losses amount to approximately 15 trillion dollars , or 75 % of the GDP , which means that were pretty much out of cash .
If we allow , say , AIG to fail it would be like the current situation times ten worse ( since we DID let Lehmans fail and they were only about 10 % the size of AIG ) .
That s not the worst part .
When a financial institution such as Lehman Brothers or AIG or Citibank fails , theres this thing called the FDIC , which has to step in and pick up the pieces and pay everyone for their losses .
Guess who funds the FDIC ?
Yep , that would be us , and since were out of cash let 's just say it 's not the best time to be paying out trillions of dollars and getting absolutely nothing in return .
I agree with you that the stimulus package was not a good idea , because it was too small !!!
Granted , if Republicans were bitching and moaning about 700 measly billion dollars , and ultimately only three traitors  voted for it , a stimulus package in the trillions would have given them a heart attack ( which is not such a bad idea if you think about it ) .
The stimulus package was only meant to deal with the unemployment , so it certainly wont solve the problem on its own .
But you can rest assured that it was the best stimulus they could have passed given the Republican opposition .
The next step is a well - crafted financial rescue plan by Tim Geithner .
In my view it should be much like the Swedish model which , in broad strokes , privatizes the banks , takes care of the toxic assets , splits them up into smaller self - efficient institutions , and sells them back to the private sector earning taxpayers money on the way .
But of course the plan wont be bold enough because in order to get one or two Republicans to vote for it they will have to water it down to the point where its not effective enough .
And that is why Republicans should be shot .
Michael Jackson was not involved with the current UK stage show
Pop star Michael Jackson is to help develop a US stage musical based on the video to his hit song Thriller , it has been announced .
Producer James Nederlander , whose company owns nine Broadway theatres , said the star would " participate in every aspect of the creative process " .
Jackson 's spokesman said the singer and Mr Nederlander " represent live theatre and musical excellence " .
Jackson was not involved in current West End production Thriller - Live .
' Exclusive '
The show , which is being staged at London 's Lyric
Theatre , opened earlier this month , and its premiere was attended by Jackson 's brother Tito .
Mr Nederlander 's organisation said the Broadway production " will be the exclusive Michael Jackson authorised version of Thriller . "
The Thriller video became an early staple of MTV
The show is expected to be based around the video for Thriller , which was first shown in 1983 and starred Jackson as a werewolf and featured dancing zombies .
No details of the musical have yet been revealed , but it is thought the stage show will also feature songs from Jackson 's 1979 album Off The Wall .
In November , Jackson reached an out of court settlement with an Arab sheikh who claimed the singer had reneged on an entertainment contract worth £ 4.7 m 2005 .
Bahraini royal Sheikh Abdulla Bin Hamad Bin Isa Al - Khalifa told London 's High Court that he had planned to revive the star 's career with productions including albums and a stage play .
He said that no project had ever been finalised .
More Cache Craziness Posted by Louis Brandy on 16 March 2009
I 've written before about the importance of cpu cache efficient algorithms .
This is yet another adventure in that world .
First , however , let 's start with a simple cache quiz : which code is faster ?
/* going vertical / for ( x=0 ; x < width ; x ++ ) for ( y=0 ; y < height ; y ++ ) a[ ywidth+x ] = b[ ywidth+x ] + c[ywidth+x ]
/* going horizontal / for ( y=0 ; y < height ; y ++ ) for ( x=0 ; x < width ; x ++ ) a[ ywidth+x ] = b[ ywidth+x ] + c[ywidth+x ]
The second one .
Right ?
Every programmer knows that the second is faster , and they know why ( I hope ) .
A simple matrix addition is simple enough that we can " reason " our way into which is theoretically faster without actually trying it .
I recently ran a much more complex example of a similar problem .
The problem :
For face recognition , it is often necessary to compute a huge face similarity matrix .
Face X compared with face Y returns a score Z . We place Z at ( X , Y ) .
It 's a fairly straightforward output to a huge comparison between two sets of faces .
The naive method would look very similar to the matrix adds at the top .
You start in the upper left corner , do the entire first row , one by one , and then move onto the second row , etc .
The hypothesis :
If we break the computation into sub - blocks , it will more effectively use cache and thus be faster .
As an example , for a 1000x1000 comparison , the naive method would do all 1000 comparisons in the first row , then 1000 more for the second , and so on .
The block method would break the computation into , for example , 100x100 blocks .
By only using these sub - blocks , it allows you to use the same input faces more frequently and thus , hopefully , more cache efficiently .
So let 's try it
I took the 20 required minutes , randomly picked a block size ( I think it was on the order of 50x50 ) , and lo and behold , it was substantially faster than the naive method .
Alright .
Now , how do I go about finding a good block size ?
Unlike our matrix addition example , this is a tough answer to reason your way towards , so I decided to play around to build up some intuition for the problem .
Does block area matter ?
Yes , it matters .
2x2 blocks are just too small .
There 's too much overhead introduced by breaking the problem into that many blocks ( especially with threading enabled ) .
There needs to be enough " meat " in the blocks to make it worth your while .
Are square blocks best ?
It seemed like a logical question .
It took almost no time for me to figure out that absolutely not , square blocks were not better .
The very first test I ran was something along the lines of 50x50 blocks versus 25x100 blocks .
The 25x100 blocks crushed the 50x50 blocks .
Interesting .
How about the direction of travel ?
Which was faster 10x40 or 40x10 ?
Turns out 10x40 was substantially faster than 40x10 .
This is getting confusing .
I spent another hour playing with numbers and eventually came to the conclusion that putting the smallest dimension in the horizontal direction made it faster .
Inside the inner function , if a block size comes in that does n't follow this rule , I switched them ( so if you asked for a block size of 40x10 , you got 10x40 ) .
Time to stop screwing around
I was about 2 hours into this little adventure when I realized there was absolutely no way I was going to meander to the right answer .
This was n't a simple problem .
The only solution was my old friend science .
Let 's actually run the experiment and see what happens .
I picked 16 different lengths ranging from 2 to 1000 , and ran every permutation of block sizes and graphed the results .
Here 's what it looked like :
This graph is just so cool .
Let me explain what you are looking at .
It 's a 2d plot in a heat - graph format .
The darker the color , the faster the code ran .
The position in the grid represents the block size .
As we travel right along the graph , we are increasing the longer dimension and as we travel upward along the graph , we are increasing the shorter dimension .
The diagonal from bottom - left to top - right , then , is the square block sizes .
The graph is also symmetric because of the rule I put in to ensure the longer dimension is always height ( explained above ) .
This graph has three interesting features :
The extremely " hot " ( slow ) region hugging the bottom and the left axes .
This region is when one ( or both ) dimensions is extremely small .
With extremely small windows , there 's too much overhead ( especially with threading ) and it begins to dominate the actual computation .
The bizarre rectangle in the upper - right .
More on this in a second .
The sweet - spot dark regions that essentially correspond to extremely long and fairly skinny rectangles .
Making Sense of it All
That rectangle in the upper right perplexed me and so I showed it around .
Someone at the office had a conjecture that sounded plausible ( versus my previous theory of plain old black magic ) .
For small widths , the entire horizontal input is able to be cached .
As you grow the width , eventually you reach a point where the horizontal input no longer fits , and by the time you start on the next row of the block , the first input is largely gone .
In other words , my little graph shows quite clearly the moment that our block blows up our cache .
That particular theory meant , then , that the point where the block was " too " wide depended heavily on the machine and the environment the process was running .
Since I did n't want to tune too much to a single machine , I thought it wise to avoid going anywhere near that line .
My final block - size selection algorithm looks something like this :
Use as tall a rectangle as is reasonable , make it as skinny as possible such that you ensure there is enough area to drown out threading overhead .
Measure .
Measure .
Measure .
At the end of the day , you can pretty much " explain " any cache behavior , once you 've seen it .
You can find a plausible reason why certain things make the code run faster .
Maybe in hindsight your explanation will even makes sense .
Its become obvious to me , however , that for any non-trivial problem , you positively need to rigoriously experiment .
In perhaps the most ill - advised branding move since New Coke , NBC 's basic - cable Sci Fi Channel will be renamed the phonetically similar Syfy on July 7 .
The change reportedly comes from a desire to own a trademark on the network 's name .
The term sci-fi is a generic description of a fiction genre ( often featuring futuristic technology ) , while Syfy can be a unique brand .
Bonnie Hammer , president of NBC Universal Cable Entertainment , told The New York Times , " We could n't own Sci Fi ; it 's a genre ... but we can own Syfy . "
The derisive hoots have already begun .
Entertainment industry columnist Nikki Finke points out , " Adding to the idiocy is that there 's already a company called SyFi Global , an information technology ( specialist ) . "
Meanwhile , Gawker says the network 's new tagline , Imagine Greater , " means nothing and is grammatically incoherent . "
They were stealing from the rich to live like the rich .
Police say four fraudsters went on designer shopping sprees at stores such as Gucci , Prada and Louis Vuitton .
They stocked the fridges in their Yorkville condominiums with groceries from some of Toronto 's priciest supermarkets : Whole Foods and Pusateri's Fine Foods .
They even furnished a business of their own , buying everything from wiring and drywall to laptops and furniture .
And they did it all , plowing through close to $ 500,000 , by installing a scanner at the Elmwood Spa , which recorded credit card numbers and personal data from 216 people , mostly women , over the summer .
The victims had no idea they were targeted .
" Nobody remembers all their transactions .
And it 's the last place you 'd think of .
It just goes to show that this can be done anywhere , " said Det. Const .
Todd Hall .
Described on its website as " Canada 's favourite urban oasis , " the Elmwood has been pampering devoted clients at its Elm St. location , near Yonge and Gerrard Sts. , for close to 30 years .
Spa management was also unaware of anything untoward taking place for at least a month after the fraudsters set to work , Elmwood executive manager Marie Picton said yesterday .
" We were appalled to find out .
You feel violated . "
A credit card company contacted the Elmwood in July , Picton said , explaining it had uncovered fraudulent activity .
According to police , the four fraudsters – a husband and wife and another couple – visited the Elmwood in June , close to closing time .
Security footage showed that while three of them distracted employees at the desk , one switched the spa's PIN pad device with a dummy look - alike , police said .
Overnight , a special chip was inserted into the real machine , which recorded credit card numbers and personal data .
The next morning , the four returned and once again swapped the machines .
They returned to the spa about a month and a half later and stole the PIN pad .
It was found , police said , in use at a local pharmacy .
Over the next few months , the financial data stored on the chip was used to create gift cards , credit cards embossed with phony names , even driver 's licences to prove their fraudulent identities , police said .
Once the information was harvested , the massive shopping spree began – $ 484,000 on 1,241 purchases , including electronics , designer clothes and even manicure chairs for a spa business that opened on Danforth Ave. on Feb .
8 .
Late last week , police raided Jung Spa and two Yorkville condominiums , seizing $ 285,000 worth of items , including designer clothes , purses and wallets , massage tables , laptops and a PIN pad overlay .
Police said the case broke by pure happenstance in the summer when a man bought a bike from a downtown store using a fraudulent credit card .
The bike shop owner then turned to Craigslist to find the bike he had sold the man – and arranged to buy it .
Police officers showed up instead and arrested the man .
That investigation lead them to a different group of suspected fraud artists , who in turn were tied to the group accused in the Elmwood case .

( CNN ) -- Conjoined Egyptian twin boys Hassan and Mahmoud , who were successfully separated in Saudi Arabia Saturday , are recovering and are expected to lead normal lives , officials said .
Conjoined twins Hassan , left , and Mahmud rest the day before separation surgery in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
" The twins ' vital signs are good ; they 're doing excellent , " said Sami Al - Shalan , spokesman for the King Abdulaziz Medical City facility in Riyadh where the surgery took place .
" The twins still have about 24 hours before a progress report can be issued .
The anesthesia consultants are happy with the progress of the children . "
The boys are less than a year old and were brought to the kingdom on February 10 .
The delicate surgery took a little more than 15 hours .
" The twins ' parents have visited them in the [ pediatric intensive care unit ] , but they can't stay there long .
They come and go , " Al - Shalan said .
Separating the boys ' urinary system was a major challenge , Dr. Abdullah Al - Rabeeah , the Saudi minister of health , told CNN .
So was separating the siblings ' local veins and arteries , he said .
" We had to identify the arteries and the blood veins between each baby , " Al - Rabeeah said .

The procedure was the 21st of its kind to be performed in the kingdom .
The surgeries are performed free as part of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz 's philanthropic initiative .

All About Saudi Arabia
The White House is set to reverse a key Bush administration policy by allowing some of the 240 remaining Guantánamo Bay inmates to be resettled on American soil .
The US is pushing for Europe to take a share of released inmates , but the Obama administration is reconciled to taking some of them , even though there will be noisy resistance from individual states .
Washington has told European officials that once a review of the Guantánamo cases is completed , the US will almost certainly allow some inmates to resettle on the mainland .
George Bush 's refusal to countenance a resettlement programme on US soil contributed to European reluctance to play host to freed prisoners .
Since Barack Obama 's election victory , Portugal has offered to accept some of them as a means of hastening the camp 's closure , and other governments have indicated they will consider it .
Britain argues that it has already done enough by accepting both nationals and former residents .
Some of those to be released can return to their own homelands , but there are many others who cannot , such as the Chinese Uighurs who would face the risk of a death sentence .
A European diplomat said today the change of course in Washington would make it easier to persuade her government to take part in an international resettlement plan .
" It changes the whole tone , " she said .
The cases of the 240 inmates are being reviewed by a team of experienced US prosecutors to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges .
It remains unresolved what to do if there is a substantial " third category " of detainees who are deemed to pose a security threat , but against whom there is insufficient evidence to file criminal charges either because evidence was obtained under torture or because it is in the form of classified intelligence .
The Obama administration is still contemplating the option of military courts martial , reconstituting the Bush - era military commissions or even instituting some new form of preventive detention .
In a 90 - minute interview on CBS tonight , Obama struck back at the former vice - president Dick Cheney over his charge that the new Guantánamo policy was putting US security at risk .
The president said his predecessor 's policy of indefinite detention was unsustainable and had generated anti-US sentiment without making the country safer .
Obama acknowleged that some detainees released from Guantánamo had returned to terrorist groups but blamed the Bush administration for inadequate screening .
" There is no doubt that we have not done a particularly effective job in sorting through who are truly dangerous individuals‚ to make sure [ they ] are not a threat to us , " he said .
During the interview , the president again came to the defence of his treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , over his handling of the millions in dollars in bonuses paid out to executives of the failing insurance giant AIG .
Were Geithner to tender his resignation , Obama said , he would tell him : " Sorry , buddy , you 've still got the job . "
It is the fourth time in a week that Obama has come to Geithner 's defence .
He said at no point over the last week had the two discussed resignation .
Great Cities of Europe : Barcelona
source : here
The vibrant city of Barcelona has got something for everyone thanks to its fabulous parks , architecture , shops and beaches .
Add to that , countless art galleries and museums and you truly have a city brimming with an exciting mixture of fun and culture !
It is a great destination , summer or winter , and in these credit crunch times , there is accommodation available to suit every pocket .
If you are a fan of art , this is the place to be as , over the centuries , this Catalan city has been home to many famous artists and architects .
The most famous of these is without a doubt Antoni Gaudi , and many of the buildings in Barcelona are monuments to his very distinctive style .
Not to everyone ’s taste , but an absolute must - see for every visitor .
The most famous landmark in the city , the Sagrada Familia Church , is his masterpiece and is a fabulous fairytale building .
It was started in 1852 , and unbelievably , is still being worked on today .
Pablo Picasso lived in Barcelona for many years , and there is a permanent exhibition of his paintings in the Picasso Museum .
There are dozens of other museums and art galleries , but do n’t worry if culture is not your thing .
Head for Las Ramblas , a wide tree lined boulevard that stretches over a kilometre all the way to the waterfront .
It is home to all sorts of shops , cafes and bars , and boasts one of the biggest and best indoor food markets in Europe .
It really has to be seen to be believed .
There are hundreds of stalls selling every kind of food imaginable , and of course , this being Spain , samples for tasting are freely and willingly offered !
Five things you MUST do in Barcelona .
1- Stroll slowly along Las Rambles , Barcelona ’s wonderful shopping boulevard , and enjoy the shops , and street stalls .
Stop for a coffee or a drink at one of the many cafes and bars , and just people - watch !
2- Visit the famous church of La Sagrada Familia , Gaudi ’s famous masterpiece .
This is the city ’s most iconic building , and will feature on any tour of Barcelona .
And no , from the outside , it really does NOT look real !
Truly a fascinating building .
3- Do n’t forget Picasso !
Even if you are not a fan of his style of art , you really must not leave Barcelona without viewing his paintings at the Picasso Museum .
The entrance fees to all the museums and galleries in the city are very reasonable , but do check the opening times , as they can vary quite a lot .
4- Visit Sitges , the historical seaside district , which is just a short train ride from the city centre .
As well as its historic sites , Sitges is well known for its night - life and beaches .
5- Eat Paella !
There are so many different versions of this national dish , with each region claiming theirs is the authentic one !
You will find dozens of restaurants in Barcelona each with their own receipe …. take your pick and enjoy with a glass or two of cava !
Whatever you decide to do in Barcelona , you will find yourself wanting to return again and again to this most colourful of Spanish cities .
Midway is considering selling off the Mortal Kombat franchise , ending a long - running association with the series as it tries to save itself from financial meltdown .
Having debuted in 1992 with the seminal arcade hit , the franchise spawned some 17 games during its time under Midway , the most recent of which , Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe , launched to atowards the end of last year .
Midway , and recently handed publishing duties for forthcoming title The Wheelman over to Ubisoft .
Now Mortal Kombat may be put out to tender , with the successful sale of the franchise seemingly imperative to rescuing the Chicago based developer – as well as acting as a milestone that would tie in with significant bonus payouts for " officers , management - level employees and other non-insider key employees , " as reported on These bonus payouts – amounting to some $ 3,755,000 – would come against the backdrop of laid off staff having promised monies withheld , as reported by
Fake Twitter accounts have been in the news a lot lately .
Last week , the Dalai Lama started tweeting , and then we found out " His Holiness " was actually a fake .
Kanye West dissed Stephen Colbert last year on Twitter .
Then we found out it was n’t Kanye after all .
A White House Twitter account , which had been updated during the Bush years and then switched to Obama right after the inauguration , also turned out to be bogus .
And who can forget last month 's infamous Twitter hacks when pranksters took over the accounts of Barack Obama , Bill O’Reilly , and CNN ’s Rick Sanchez , among others .
The 15 fake Twitter accounts that follow were not hijacked .
Rather , this list of fake Twitter accounts we 've assembled pays homage to or parodies the famous -- no security breaches here .
Phony tweets are a terrific way to get across a laugh , but to be really great , a Phweeter ( phony tweeter ) has to stick with it .
Unfortunately many Phweeters do n’t .
Some fakers who started hot but then drifted away include @osamabinladen , @hasselhoff , and @davidletterman .
After sifting through piles of bad , mediocre , and just plain unfunny impostors , we ’ve come up with the best and most current phweeters worthy of pushing that " follow " button for .
An indie supergroup created by former and current members of Arctic Monkeys , Reverend And The Makers and Babyshambles will make music history tomorrow by becoming the first band to give away their debut album .
The indie hip - hop crossover act Mongrel have teamed up with The Independent to give away a free copy of their first album , Better Than Heavy , with Saturday 's newspaper , two days before the 11 - track CD hits the shops .
The move illustrates how bands are resorting to increasingly innovative methods to distribute music following the collapse of CD sales and outlets .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Artists such as Prince and McFly have previously negotiated distribution deals with newspapers and independent record labels have deployed a host of unusual marketing tactics , often revolving around building new audiences on the Net .
But Mongrel 's album release is thought to be the first time a band has launched itself by giving away their debut album for free with a newspaper .
The band is made up of musicians who wanted to work on a project with a political edge .
Reverend And The Makers ' frontman Jon McClure and the former Arctic Monkey bassist Andy Nicholson founded the group after meeting at a Love Music Hate Racism gig .
Babyshambles guitarist Drew McConnell , McClure 's bandmate Joe Moskow and Lowkey , a rapper of British and Arab descent , also joined the group .
Matt Helders , the Arctic Monkeys drummer , plays on the record .
Many of the band 's songs are heavily politicised .
Both McClure and Lowkey , whose mother is from Iraq , have been vocal anti-war campaigners .
McClure said he wanted to release Better Than Heavy through The Independent because he felt the band 's music would appeal to Independent readers .
" This gives the widest possible platform to artists whose voices would otherwise be ignored .
We are a truly independent band , so it is fitting we are doing this with The Independent newspaper . "
The band had decided to give away the album because little money could be made in recorded music nowadays .
" You have to face facts : kids are going to download and steal music no matter what .
It has never particularly bothered us .
Money can be made through live touring but the most important thing to do is get your music out there . "
David Bianchi , Mongrel 's manager , said he believed more bands may look towards newspapers and other innovative outlets to distribute music if Better Than Heavy 's release is successful .
" Unless you 're a major pop act , meaningful record deals are becoming less and less prevalent so people are willing to look elsewhere , " he said .
He estimated distributing the album through The Independent had saved the band 's record label , Wall of Sound , more than £ 250,000 in marketing costs while taking the music to a wider audience .
Ian Birrell , the deputy editor of The Independent , said the deal underlined the innovative spirit of the newspaper : " What is particularly exciting is that we are releasing a completely new album by a new band , one that is causing great excitement and interest .
" Up to now , most of the CDs given away by papers have been old material or by bands whose careers were in decline .
This is very different . "
Alison Wenham , the chief executive of the Association of Independent Music , said the move showed how record labels were dealing with unprecedented change and how bands were willing to try releasing albums directly to potential fans .
" There is a palpable move away from the old patented behaviour , " she said .

PITTSBURGH — Using rigorous computer calculations , researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington have established evidence that supercooled silicon experiences a liquid - liquid phase transition , where at a certain temperature two different states of liquid silicon exist .
The two states each have unique properties that could be used to develop new silicon - based materials .
Furthermore , the methods developed can be applied to gain a better understanding of other materials .
The findings will be presented Friday , March 20 at the American Physical Society 's March Meeting in Pittsburgh .
The results also were published as an Editor 's Selection in the Feb. 20 issue of Physical Review Letters .
Under normal conditions , phase transitions occur when the structure of a substance changes in response to a change in temperature and / or pressure .
The most commonly thought of phase transitions are between solids , liquids and gases .
However , it was recently discovered that some substances experience phase transitions within the same state , resulting in two different forms with their own individual characteristics .
For example , it 's thought that water has a liquid - liquid transition .
" Water and silicon share many unusual characteristics .
For example , in most materials , their solid states are denser than their liquid states , but in water and silicon the opposite is true .
That 's why ice floats on water and solid silicon floats on liquid silicon , " said Michael Widom , professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon .
" The unusual volume expansion of frozen water and silicon that causes them to float is probably connected to the existence of a liquid - liquid transition . "
Like water , it has been hypothesized that supercooled silicon — liquid silicon that has its temperature lowered to below the freezing point without crystallizing and becoming a solid — experienced a liquid - liquid phase shift .
Computer simulations initially predicted the existence of two liquid phases , but further simulations and experiments failed to produce the necessary evidence to prove their presence .
To resolve the disparity between the prior experiments , Carnegie Mellon 's Widom and Carnegie Institute of Washington post - doc Panchapakesan Ganesh , who began this work as a graduate student in Widom 's lab , used rigorous first - principles calculations based on quantum mechanics to , for the first time , prove the existence of a liquid - liquid transition in silicon .
First - principle calculations start with established laws of physics , and make no assumptions or approximations , leaving little room for question .
Such calculations provide the most accurate predictions for the structural properties at high pressures and temperature , since conducting actual experiments in these conditions is near impossible .
Since the calculations are based on quantum mechanics , they were extremely complex and time - consuming .
It took one month of computing time to complete the calculations needed to determine the molecular dynamics of silicon at one single experimental temperature and volume .
The researchers applied novel methods of parallel tempering and histogram data analysis to look at nine temperatures and 12 volumes .
The calculations required nine CPU years to be completed , but the experiment took only one actual calendar year because the calculations ran in parallel on many computers .
The computations revealed that a liquid - to - liquid phase shift , evidenced by the presence of a van der Waals loop , occurred when silicon was supercooled to 1200 degrees Kelvin ; silicon normally freezes at 1700 degrees Kelvin .
A van der Waals loop occurs when pressure grows as volume increases , marking a thermodynamically unstable situation .
The unstable condition is resolved by transforming into two coexisting states of differing densities — in this case two distinct forms of liquid silicon , each having its own unique and dissimilar properties .
One was high density and highly coordinated with metallic properties , much like normal liquid silicon , and the other was low density , low - coordinated and semi-metallic , with a structure closer to that of solid silicon .
" This study shows that accurate calculations based on quantum mechanics can now answer long - standing questions about familiar and unfamiliar materials , " Widom said .
The simulation methods used by the researchers are a breakthrough on their own .
The computational methods can be applied to achieve a better understanding of a wide range of elements and molecules and how they behave at extremely high temperatures .
Revealing the structure and properties of different elements and compounds at previously untestable conditions could lead to the development of new materials with commercial applications .
Widom , for example , is now using the tools to study metallic glass , a solid metal with the structure of a liquid that contain desirable properties not found in commonly used alloys .

The drone may well have been intended more to monitor Iranian dissidents in Iraq than to eavesdrop on American or Iraqi military operations .
The location where it was shot down is not far from Camp Ashraf , where 3,500 followers of the People ’s Mujahedeen of Iran , an Iranian dissident organization , have taken refuge .
Camp Ashraf is 57 miles northeast of Baghdad .
Iraqi troops have surrounded the camp in the past week and clashed with refugees there .
Iran has long insisted that Iraq close the camp and expel the dissidents , but United States officials have intervened and prevented that .
Since January , when the Iraqi military took over security of the area from the United States , several Iraqi officials have vowed it would soon be closed .
The United States military identified the drone as an Ababil 3 , an aircraft developed by Iran with a 10.5 - foot wingspan , launched from a truck catapult and recovered by parachute .
The name means “ swallow . ”
It is equipped with video camera and transmission equipment , and flown by ground - based pilots .
The United States military also announced that a soldier died Monday of wounds received in a combat operation in Baghdad , the first American death in Iraq since March 7 .
Five American soldiers have died in Iraq so far this month .
If that rate continues , March will have the lowest level of United States deaths since the war began .
Last month , 18 allied soldiers died , according to the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count , a nongovernmental organization that tracks military deaths using Defense Department statistics .
The soldier ’s death on Monday was the first United States military fatality reported in Baghdad this month .
Elsewhere in Iraq , the violence in Mosul continued , for which the blame is largely placed on Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , a homegrown jihadi group believed to have some foreign leadership .
Gout is a type of arthritis
Men who get plenty of vitamin C may boost their resilience to the painful joint disease gout , work suggests .
In the 20 - year study of nearly 47,000 men , daily supplements of the vitamin found in sprouts , peppers and oranges appeared to cut gout risk .
The US researchers believe vitamin C has a dual action - easing inflammation and lowering uric acid levels in the body that go awry in gout .
The findings are published in Archives of Internal Medicine .
Experts warned that the news should not be taken to mean that it was fine to lead an unhealthy lifestyle and pop a vitamin pill to counteract this .
It would be unwise for people to think they can compensate for eating and drinking too much by taking vitamin C with their pint of beer
Rheumatologist Dr Michael Snaith
There are a number of risk factors for gout , including taking certain medications , drinking too much alcohol , being overweight and eating an unhealthy diet high in meat .
Although the condition is more associated with Victorian times , the numbers with gout have been increasing over the last 30 years and currently about 1.5 % of the UK population has the condition .
In the study , 1,317 of the men , who were all health professionals , developed gout .
Compared with men who did not take vitamin C supplements , those who took 1,000 mg to 1,499 mg per day had a 34 % lower risk of gout and those who took 1,500 mg per day had a 45 % lower risk .
This was irrespective of other gout risk factors such as diet and alcohol use .
Lead researcher Dr Hyon Choi , of Boston University School of Medicine , said there were good reasons to believe that vitamin C was having a beneficial effect on the men .
Protective Vitamin C appears to reduce levels of uric acid in the blood - a build up of this naturally occurring compound can form crystal deposits in and around joints , leading to the pain and swelling associated with gout .
It does this by increasing the expulsion of uric acid from the body by the kidneys .
Dr Choi said : " Given the general safety profile associated with vitamin C intake , particularly in the generally consumed ranges as in the present study , vitamin C intake may provide a useful option in the prevention of gout . "
Generally , people should be able to get all the vitamin C they need - 40 mg a day - by eating a varied and balanced diet .
UK experts say taking 1,000 mg or less of vitamin C supplements a day is unlikely to cause any harm .
Gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea have been reported with doses over 1000 mg / day .
Rheumatologist Dr Michael Snaith , also of the UK Gout Society , said : " Vitamin C may reduce the frequency of attacks and provide a degree of protection .
But that does not mean to say that taking whacking great amounts of vitamin C is going to eliminate gout .
" It would be unwise for people to think they can compensate for eating and drinking too much by taking vitamin C with their pint of beer . "

There was plenty of outrage on Capitol Hill last week over the executive bonuses paid out by AIG after getting federal bailout money .
But another money trail could make voters just as angry : the campaign dollars to members of Congress from banks and firms that have received billions via the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
[ efoods ]
While a few big firms , such as Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase , have curtailed their campaign giving , others are quietly doling out cash to select members of Congress , particularly those who serve on committees that oversee TARP .
In recent filings with the Federal Election Commission , the political action committee for Bank of America ( which got $ 15 billion in bailout money ) sent out $ 24,500 in the first two months of 2009 , including $ 1,500 to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and another $ 15,000 to members of the House and Senate banking panels .
Citigroup ( $ 25 billion ) dished out $ 29,620 , including $ 2,500 to House GOPWhip Eric Cantor , who also got $ 10,000 from UBS which , while not a TARP recipient , got $ 5 billion in bailout funds as an AIG " counterparty . "
" This certainly appears to be a case of TARP funds being recycled into campaign contributions , " says Brett Kappell , a D.C. lawyer who tracks donations .
( A spokesman for Cantor did not respond to requests for comment .
A spokeswoman for Hoyer said it ’s his " policy to accept legal contributions . " )

“ More people will come if they think we ’ll have punch and pie ! ”
Many have colloquially known that punch and pie is an effective marketing / publicity tool to incentivize attendance at events , but its precise quantitative effect on attendance has largely been left to conjecture … until now , that is .
Here , we shall use the case study opportunity presented in South Park : Bigger , Longer , Uncut as a basis for extrapolating a general statistical model to demonstrate the effect of offering punch and pie as an attendance incentive .
Let ’s recap the scenario presented in South Park : Bigger , Longer , Uncut :
Kyle , Kenny , Cartman , and Stan are trying to save Terrence and Phillip from execution , but they ca n’t do it alone .
They need to “ round up all the grounded kids in town ” to join their cause , La Resistance .
“ All the grounded kids in town , ” however , is quite a large target audience , so let ’s assume that what the organizers really mean is all the grounded kids at their school in their peer group ( defined as plus or minus one grade level from theirs ) .
Given an estimate of the student body of South Park Elementary at around 250 students , grades K - 6 , and an estimated 75 % grounding rate ( for seeing the Terrence & Phillip Movie ) , that leaves our organizers with a target audience of only about 80 kids .
To reach this target audience , the organizers sent an “ all access email ” announcing their organizational meeting .
Cartman famously suggests that they advertise “ punch and pie ” to boost attendance .
Initial turnout exceeded the organizers ’ expectations :
Twelve kids showed up to the meeting ( in addition to the four organizers ) .
Now we can start to answer the question at hand : what impact did the promise of punch and pie have on attendance ?
How many kids would have attended if punch and pie were not promised ?
The actual absence of punch and pie at the meeting presents us with an interesting scenario .
In this case , two kids immediately get up when they learn there are no such refreshments at the meeting .
One may be tempted to conclude that the punch & pie only accounted for drawing these two freeloaders .
In fact , the lack of punch and pie shows simply that among the twelve that showed up to the meeting , those two were the only ones whose interest in attending the meeting was solely based on punch and pie .
The rest of the twelve ( now ten ) either came solely out of interest in La Resistance or out of a combined interest in La Resistance and punch & pie .
The group whose interest in La Resistance alone was enough to guarantee their attendance would not have been affected by the offer of punch and pie ; they would have come regardless .
This group was undoubtedly a small minority .
Given the typical distribution of committed partisans among any newly formed group , Gregory and Wendy were likely the only ones who fell into this group .
Which means that for the remaining eight , the promise of punch and pie was the deciding factor in their attendance .
Now we have enough information to determine the drawing power of the punch and pie .
Without any sort of incentive , the organizers would have probably only gotten Gregory and Wendy to show up , representing only 2.5 % of the target audience .
With the promise of punch and pie , they were able to get twelve total to show up , or 15 % of the target audience , a 500 % performance improvement over the incentive - less scenario .
After the two freeloaders leave , they still have succeeded in drawing in 12.5 % of the target audience , a 400 % performance improvement .
Let us now apply this rule to determine the effect of offering punch and pie to other attendance scenarios .
In 2008 , the Florida Marlins drew the least number of fans in baseball : 1,335,075 , only 45.9 % of capacity .
Offering punch and pie would have drawn far more fans than stadium capacity would allow : 6,675,375 , or 230 % of capacity .
Barack Obama ’s inauguration drew approximately 1 million spectators .
Offering punch and pie would have drawn 5 million spectators , or 250 % of the Mall ’s capacity .
Last week ’s staged reading of “ Aux Legumes , ” an obscure French literary work , drew 15 people to Revolution Art Space in Brooklyn , New York .
Offering punch and pie would have drawn 100 people , since the effect of the incentive is amplified by the pervasive sense of irony in that part of the country .
Conclusion
More people will come if they are led to believe that punch and pie will be served .

As a presidential candidate , Barrack Obama described the war in Iraq as one that “ should never have been authorised and never been waged . ”
On February 27 , as president , Obama saw it differently .
He told US troops at Camp Lejeune , a Marine Corps base in North Carolina :
You have fought against tyranny and disorder .
You have bled for your best friends and for unknown Iraqis .
And you have borne an enormous burden for your fellow citizens , while extending a precious opportunity to the people of Iraq .
Under tough circumstances , the men and women of the United States military have served with honor , and succeeded beyond any expectation .
This might best be described as Generic Invader Nonsense ( GIN ) .
Much the same has been said by every war leader and general of every invasion in history .
Did Goebbels not argue that Germany was fighting “ tyranny ” on the Eastern front in 1941 ?
Were Indonesian armed forces not offering a “ precious opportunity ” to the impoverished people of East Timor in 1975 ?
Obama next directed his GIN to the people of Iraq :
Our nations have known difficult times together .
But ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed , and countless friendships among our people .
We Americans have offered our most precious resource – our young men and women – to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism ; to root out our common enemies ; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren , and for yours .
The precise moment when the illegal invasion demolishing Iraq — the attack that “ should never have been authorised and never been waged ” — became a selfless act of friendship in pursuit of peace and prosperity was not identified .
Did this happen half - way through 2003 ?
Perhaps early 2004 ?
America and Iraq have indeed known “ difficult times together ” — the US has caused them and Iraq has suffered them .
The US helped install a vicious dictator , Saddam Hussein , supporting him through his worst crimes , which Western governments and media worked hard to bury out of sight .
It then inflicted the devastating 1991 Gulf War and 12 years of genocidal sanctions , which claimed one million Iraqi lives .
The 2003 war and invasion have cost a further million lives , have reduced 4 million people to the status of destitute refugees , and reduced a wrecked country to utter ruin .
But Obama ’s lies matter little to much of the public , anti-war activists among them .
‘ You do n’t understand , ’ they tell us .
’ Obama +has + to say all this stuff — it ’s not what he believes .
He ‘s out to change all this , but he has to say it . ’
This involves a kind of treble - think .
Politicians typically hide their ruthlessness behind compassionate verbiage .
Obama , we are to believe , is hiding his compassion behind ruthless verbiage — Machiavellianism in reverse .
Which is exactly what was said of Clinton and Blair in the 1990s .
Of course it could be the case now .
But should we not aim to be a little more socially scientific in our political analysis ?
We can observe that , in a way that mirrors Newtonian physics , enormous political forces tend to act unimpeded unless challenged by powerful oppositional forces .
We can observe , further , that there is no reason whatever to believe that the greed and violence that have become entrenched in American politics over decades and centuries have simply gone away .
Certainly they have not been countered by mass democratic movements rooted in compassion rather than greed .
There are no new , mass - based parties rooted in progressive values ; no city - stopping protests erupting out of a transformational political process .
If a brand new , benevolent face now fronts the system in which traditionally ruthless forces dominate , rationality demands that we assume it to be a makeover , a brand alteration , an attempt precisely to +reduce + pressure on the system to change .
The Bush - Blair crimes contaminated the American brand with Iraqi and Afghan blood products – we have to assume that the same ferocious system is now in the process of rehabilitating , not revolutionising , that brand .
Greed , ignorance and hatred do not miraculously transform into compassion , wisdom and peacefulness , in individuals or in superpowers .
Call it Newtonian political physics .
Call it Buddhist psychology .
Call it common sense .
Obama then spoke to the US armed forces :
And so I want to be very clear :
We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein ’s regime — and you got the job done .
We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government — and you got the job done .
And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard - earned opportunity to live a better life — that is your achievement ; that is the prospect that you have made possible .
The first sentence is a flat lie .
Bush also was “ very clear ” that the “ single question ” concerned the disarmament of Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction .
When it became impossible to deny their non-existence , Bush resorted to talk of “ regime change ” , although he knew this pretext was illegal under international law .
Even this was not enough — the ‘ coalition ’ insisted the invasion would go ahead whether or not Saddam and his family left Iraq ( as they were urged to do ) because the goal , now , was “ democracy ” .
As Noam Chomsky noted in April 2003 :
“ The one constant is that the US must end up in control of Iraq . ”
Leaving Iraq ?
Obama announced his plans for US forces in Iraq :
As a candidate for president , I made clear my support for a timeline of sixteen months to carry out this drawdown , while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we ’ve made and to protect our troops .
Those consultations are now complete , and I have chosen a time line that will remove our combat brigades over the next eighteen months .
He added :
As I have long said , we will retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions : training , equipping , and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian ; conducting targeted counterterrorism missions ; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq .
Initially , this force will likely be made up of 35,000 to 50,000 US troops .
As commentators have noted , 50,000 is a lot of troops .
The initial US invasion force in 2003 , after all , consisted of 90,000 troops .
And Obama did not comment on whether the US will maintain permanent military bases in Iraq .
He did not discuss the withdrawal of over 100,000 private US military contractors and mercenaries stationed there .
On the face of it , there was a clear contradiction between Obama ’s declared aim to “ remove our combat brigades over the next eighteen months ” and his leaving 30,000 - 50,000 troops to conduct , among other things , “ targeted counterterrorism missions ” — ie , combat missions .
The New York Times helped explain last December 4 :
“ Pentagon planners say that it is possible that Mr. Obama ’s goal could be accomplished at least in part by relabeling some units , so that those currently counted as combat troops could be ‘ re - missioned , ’ their efforts redefined as training and support for the Iraqis . ”
Military occupiers have forever described their combat troops as ‘ military advisors ’ and suchlike — more GIN .
According to the American agreement with Iraq – known as a SOFA ( status of forces agreement ) – US forces must leave Iraq by the end of December 2011 .
But the “ must ” is actually much closer to a “ might . ”
The New York Times noted that SOFA “ remains subject to change , by mutual agreement , and U.S. Army planners acknowledge privately that they are examining projections that could see the number of Americans hovering between 30,000 and 50,000 — and some say as high as 70,000 — for a substantial time even beyond 2011 . ”
“ Privately ” , obviously — why , in a democracy , would the public be told the truth ?
In support of this private reality , Phyllis Bennis cites retired General Barry McCaffrey , who wrote in an internal report for the Pentagon last year :
“ We should assume that the Iraqi government will eventually ask us to stay beyond 2011 with a residual force of trainers , counterterrorist capabilities , logistics , and air power .
( My estimate–perhaps a force of 20,000 to 40,000 troops ) . ”
Because SOFA allows both sides to suggest changes , power politics has free reign .
As Bennis notes , the Iraqi government has , from its beginnings , been “ dependent on and accountable to the U.S. ”
She asks : “ do we really think that that government would refuse a quiet U.S. ‘ request ’ for amending the agreement to push back or even eliminate the ostensibly final deadline for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops ? ”
The Media Response
The above was covered by the corporate press with the same wilful gullibility that is found in its reporting on all key issues – the pattern is systematic and unvarying .
Patrick Cockburn announced dramatically in the Independent :
“ The pullout will bring to an end one of the most divisive wars in US history … ”
No reasonable person could use “ will ” in that sentence .
Honest news reporting would begin : “ It is claimed … ” .
Instead , the Independent predicted :
“ 31 December 2011
“ The date by which all US forces will have left Iraq . ”
Ewen MacAskill wrote in the Guardian :
“ Almost six years after the invasion of Iraq , the end is finally in sight for America ’s involvement in its longest and bloodiest conflict since Vietnam .
Barack Obama yesterday set out a timetable that will see all US combat units out by summer next year and the remainder by the end of 2011 . ”
There is no reason to believe this , but it is the required ‘ liberal ’ view of the new ‘ liberal ’ president ‘s GIN .
Stated with this level of confidence it is potent propaganda .
MacAskill added for good effect :
“ The prospect of 50,000 staying , even if only for another year , produced dismay among the Democratic leadership in Congress . ”
It is an interesting and significant reality of modern press performance that the right - wing media are often more honest about ‘ liberal ’ leaders than the ‘ liberal ’ press .
Compare the Independent and Guardian ’s take on events with Tim Reid ’s in Murdoch ’s Times :
“ President Obama announced the withdrawal yesterday of more than 90,000 US combat troops from Iraq by August next year but his decision to keep a force of up to 50,000 was attacked by leaders of his party as a betrayal of his promise to end the war . ”
MacAskill continued in the Guardian :
“ For Iraq , the death toll is unknown , in the tens of thousands , victims of the war , a nationalist uprising , sectarian in - fighting and jihadists attracted by the US presence . ”
This is truly shameful journalism .
The idea that the death toll is simply “ unknown ” fits well with Chomsky ’s observation :
“ The basic principle , rarely violated , is that what conflicts with the requirements of power and privilege does not exist . ”
Just last month , John Tirman , Executive Director of MIT ’s Center for International Studies , wrote :
“ We are now able to estimate the number of Iraqis who have died in the war instigated by the Bush administration . ” Tirman , ‘ Iraq ’s Shocking Human Toll : About 1 Million Killed , 4.5 Million Displaced , 1 - 2 Million Widows , 5 Million Orphans , ’ The Nation , February 2 , 2009 .
Tirman reported that “ we have , at present , between 800,000 and 1.3 million ‘ excess deaths ’ as we approach the six - year anniversary of this war . ”
He added :
This gruesome figure makes sense when reading of claims by Iraqi officials that there are 1 - 2 million war widows and 5 million orphans .
This constitutes direct empirical evidence of total excess mortality and indirect , though confirming , evidence of the displaced and the bereaved and of general insecurity .
The overall figures are stunning : 4.5 million displaced , 1 - 2 million widows , 5 million orphans , about 1 million dead — in one way or another , affecting nearly one in two Iraqis .
Tirman noted that only 5 per cent of refugees have chosen to return to their homes over the past year .
According to Unicef , many provinces report that less than 40 per cent of households have access to clean water .
More than 40 per cent of children in Basra , and more than 70 per cent in Baghdad , cannot attend school .
It is important to recognise that it is utter catastrophe on this scale that is being so blithely misreported and downplayed by journalists in the Guardian and Independent .
These are genuine crimes of journalism – crimes of complicity and deception perpetrated against the British and Iraqi people .
Even the Guardian ’s own journalists last year found that “ Estimates put the toll at between 100,000 and one million . ”
Why would MacAskill write of casualties “ For Iraq ” ( not just civilian casualties ) in “ the tens of thousands ” when the lowest figure , one year ago , + just + for civilian deaths + just + by violence , was 100,000 ?
Martin Chulov brought further shame on the Guardian , writing :
“ Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed during the insurgency . ”
We wrote to Chulov and his editor , Alan Rusbridger , on March 2 :
I ’ve never seen that formulation before .
This is how the truth is slowly cleansed from the newsprint through repeated brainwashing .
Now the main context for the killing is the insurgency rather than the occupation .
The occupation itself just +is+ — maybe it ’s a natural phenomenon , happened out of a clear blue sky .
The facts — that it was based on a pack of lies , that it was an illegal war of aggression , an oil grab , and has zero legitimacy such that the US has no right to be there at all — somehow just do n’t matter to you .
We received no response .
The Guardian editor has not replied to our emails since December 2005 , such is his commitment to open debate .
The reality , as every thinking mainstream journalist knows , is that free discussion into corporate profit - making does not go .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Top Wall Street executives reacted harshly on Friday to proposed legislation that would punitively tax bonuses awarded to employees at firms receiving federal assistance .
Citigroup Inc. C , +1.47 % Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and Bank of America Corp. BAC , +1.07 % Chief Executive Ken Lewis issued strongly worded internal memos about the proposed tax legislation , according to the online edition of The Wall Street Journal , while J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , +1.10 % Chief Executive Jamie Dimon sought to reassure his top executives that the firm is engaging with lawmakers on the matter .
The legislation , passed by the House on Thursday , would impose a 90 % tax on bonuses for employees making over $ 250,000 a year at companies receiving at least $ 5 billion in federal aid under the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Citi's Pandit criticized the proposed legislation in a memo to employees on Friday , arguing that it could result in the firm losing top talent .
" The work we have all done to try to stabilize the financial system and to get this economy moving again would be significantly set back if we lose our talented people because Congress imposes a special tax on financial - services employees , " he wrote .
" It would affect countless number of people who will find it difficult , if not impossible , to pay back the bonuses that they earned , " Pandit said .
Read the full memo .
Bank of America 's Lewis , for his part , said that he 's written to lawmakers about why the proposed tax legislation " is of such grave concern to us , " adding that it has " the potential to damage the ability of the government to engineer a financial recovery . "
Read memo from Lewis .
The tax legislation emerged in reaction to news earlier this week that employees of insurance giant American International Group Inc. AIG , +1.02 % , which has been propped up by heavy government assistance , received $ 165 million in bonuses .
See story about proposed bonus tax legislation .
The legislation was introduced by House Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel , D - N.Y .
Police deaths give leverage to toughen gun laws On the East Bay
If history repeats itself , the fatal shootings of four Oakland police officers on Saturday afternoon will become the next benchmark in the national debate on a federal law to ban assault weapons .
If there is a grain of hope to be gathered from a loss so tragic , it 's that last weekend 's horrific events will help end the debate on an unresolved policy issue that has resulted in thousands of deaths and helped sustain veritable demilitarized zones in some of our nation 's largest cities .
In Oakland , a city already struggling with high crime and gun violence , the deaths of two officers gunned down with an AK - 47 qualify city officials to lend their voices to any national debate on the issue .
While the tragedy in Oakland lacks the scale of the shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Columbine High School nearly a decade ago , the deaths of four officers in a single incident is a significant event that sends shock waves across the nation .
The use of the deadly weapons - which can fire hundreds of rounds per minute - has become an all - too - familiar feature in the gun violence being played out .
Frank Rose , a community activist who chairs two citizens advisory committees in his East Oakland neighborhood , witnessed the results of such an attack no more than two weeks ago .
Rose watched in utter disbelief as a car drove to the front door of the Oakland Police Department substation at the Eastmont Mall as he sat outside waiting to attend a community meeting .
" The driver jumped out of the car , and the passenger just kinda fell out and crawled around the side of the car , " he said .
The driver pounded on the front door until a police officer answered .
He immediately came out to help the wounded man .
When Rose stepped from his car to take a closer look , he saw a body motionless in the backseat - and matching bullet holes on both sides of the vehicle .
" How in the world did this happen ? "
Rose , 70 , later asked an officer .
" The guns they got on the street now , Frank , you would n't believe it , " the officer replied .
Oakland City Council President Jane Brunner said she will seek support from colleagues to pass a resolution calling for federal assistance in finding ways to remove the deadly weapons that leave officers outgunned .
" We do n't want officers facing guns they cannot protect themselves from , " Brunner said .
Former state Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , who wrote a state law in 1999 that banned sale of the weapons , said President Obama 's case to seek a federal ban on a wide array of automatic weapons is only strengthened when they are misused in such horrific ways .
" Maybe this will be enough to rally the California delegation to ask the federal government for help , " Perata said .
He cautioned that gun control laws remain a hot - button issue in suburban enclaves and rural communities in California and across the nation .
" With a Democratic administration and Congress , there is little political threat , and who knows when we 're going to have an opportunity like this again ? " he said .
For Perata , it 's a question that was asked and answered in his mind more than 20 years ago when he proposed similar legislation as an Alameda supervisor .
" There is a big difference between taking someone 's handgun away and taking away an AK - 47 , " Perata said .
" They did n't want to ban .50 - caliber guns either , but these are weapons of war with no application in civilian life . "
In anticipation of the new White House administration 's tough stance on assault weapons , gun dealers , advocates and manufacturers reported significant sales increases in handguns , rifles and ammunition soon after Obama 's election .
In the Washington office of U.S. Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , a spokesman said the California Democrat had received many calls about the shooting in Oakland .
Feinstein helped craft legislation that banned the sale of assault weapons , but that ban ended in 2004 .
Callers have encouraged Feinstein to sponsor tough new anti-gun laws , said Gil Duran , a press spokesman .
But , he said , Feinstein believes it 's appropriate to honor the families ' mourning period before she proposes new gun legislation .
" Right now she is mourning with them , " Duran said of the officers ' family members .
As we wait to see what Feinstein does , Brunner has taken a good first step in asking her colleagues to help pass a resolution to call for stricter gun laws .
Oakland , its residents and leaders would be remiss if they did not use their voice and experience to pressure federal legislators for more gun regulation .
The best things in life are …actually , yes , they are free .

BitTorrent users are often referred to as pirates , even though there are plenty of legal uses for the most used file sharing protocol .
Even for those who use BitTorrent to download copyrighted content , the motivation to do so varies .
Through this poll we would like to discover why you use BitTorrent .
Technically speaking , it is impossible to steal something when you are using BitTorrent , as the original files always stay intact .
Nevertheless , the entertainment industry likes to label BitTorrent sites as evil places , where thieves gather to steal music and movies .
In reality , however , not all BitTorrent users are the same or so easily labeled , and neither are their motivations to share files .
A recent post by isoHunt founder Gary Fung inspired us to run a poll .
We know that TorrentFreak readers might not be representative of the average file sharer , but we would love to find out why you use BitTorrent .
The following poll has four answer options , based on the four types file - sharer , as described by Lawrence Lessig in his book Free Culture .
The options are as follows .
1 . Because it ’s free
Some use BitTorrent to download music , movies and software so they do n’t have to pay for them .
Instead of purchasing a CD or buying a DVD , they prefer to download it for free on BitTorrent .
2 . To ‘ try before I buy
The second type uses BitTorrent mainly to sample content and try before they buy .
They download music to discover new artists and might end up buying the album if they like it .
Similarly , they try software or download movies but buy them when they live up to their expectations .
3 . Because I ca n’t get it elsewhere
The third group mainly downloads content they ca n’t get elsewhere .
The TV - show that it not on TV in your country yet , or that song you ca n’t buy easily online without having to deal with all kinds of digital restrictions .
4 . To download ‘ legal ’ torrents
The last type of file - sharer mainly downloads content that the creator wants to share for free , often indicated by the misleading term ‘ legal torrents ’ .
Music from Jamendo for example , or films that are ok to share .
So where do you fit in ?
Let us know .

Eleven Most Beautiful Cathedrals in Europe
Europeans took the worship of God very seriously and it ’s demonstrated in the fantastic cathedrals you see wherever you go .
There is at least a small church in every village , and often times you ’ll be surprised by something even bigger .
In larger cities you ’ll definitely find more than one .
There are so many that sometimes it ’s hard to determine which ones to see and which to skip .
Here are a few that should n’t be missed .
Basilica di San Marco in Venice , Italy
This unbelievable cathedral sits just off the Grand Canal in Venice on Piazza San Marco .
The construction of the present church was begun in 1063 and the Byzantine style reflects an East meets
West flair .
In fact , any ships returning from abroad were required to bring back a precious gift for the church .
Across the front of the church is a series of high arches , and the main entrance is covered with intricate Romanesque carvings .
Directly above the entrance you ’ll see four life - sized gilded bronze horses , copies of the originals that were brought from Constantinople in 1204 .
You ’ll find the originals protected inside the museum .
Spires and five huge domes grace the roofline .
Inside , everywhere you look you ’ll find golden mosaics depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments .
The floor is literally covered ( 45,622 sq. ft. ) with colorful mosaic tiles that swirl and intertwine to show incredible pictures of birds and animals .
It ’s truly a gift for your eyes .
Roskilde Cathedral in Zealand , Denmark
Located on a ridge in the center of Roskilde , this cathedral has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1995 .
It was built in the 12th and 13th centuries and has the significance of being the first Gothic style cathedral built out of brick .
The Danish royal family has been buried here since the 15th century .
The inside of the original cathedral was not large enough to accommodate specific altars for saints , so separate chapels have been added on to the original building .
These additions show the interesting development of architecture in Denmark over a period of 800 years .
The cathedral is an active parish church and when services and other ceremonies are occurring , it is closed to tourists .
Cologne Cathedral in Cologne , Germany
This cathedral has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996 , and was added to the “ World Heritage in Danger ” list in 2004 .
It is the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe and from 1880 - 1884 was the tallest building in the world .
During World War II the cathedral was hit by bombs 14 times , and sadly , used as a rifle range by American troops .
It underwent extensive repairs that were completed in 1956 .
Other renovations continue to present day .
The cathedral is a major pilgrimage site for people coming to see its most famous treasure – a large , gilded sarcophagus believed to hold the remains of the three wise men from the biblical story of the birth of Jesus .
Wawel Cathedral in Krakow , Poland
Wawel Cathedral was constructed in the 14th century and remains mostly unchanged today .
Pope John Paul II was a priest and later archbishop of Krakow from this church before becoming Pope .
Inside the church you ’ll find 18 different chapels containing beautiful works of religious art .
In side chapels you ’ll find the tombs of all , except four , of Poland ’s 45 rulers .
You ’ll want to visit Sigismund Chapel , easily identified by its golden dome .
Climb the wooden steps to the top of the tower to see the Zygmunt bell , which is 350 years older than Big Ben in London , and rung only on very solemn state and church occasions .
Stephansdom Cathedral in Vienna , Austria
This cathedral sits in the center of busy Vienna .
It was first constructed in the 12th century , but has undergone major reconstruction and repairs over the years due to various fires and sieges of war .
The exterior design of the church is Gothic , and the roof is a very colorful diamond - pattern constructed out of tiles that were donated by local citizens in 1950 .
If you can do it , climb up the 343 steps to the top of the Alter Steffi tower where you ’ll enjoy incredible views of Vienna .
A bit of trivia : Mozart was both married and had his funeral at this church .
You may want to take a tour to learn other historic bits of information about both the cathedral and the catacombs that lie beneath .
Chartres Cathedral in Chartres , France
About 50 miles southwest of Paris , you ’ll discover this amazing French Gothic cathedral which was built from 1194 - 1260 .
Very little has been done to alter it over the centuries and it stands proudly in its almost original state .
Inside you ’ll be awestruck by the incredible , vibrant jewel tones of the stained glass windows , one of the most complete collections of medieval stained glass in the world ; the nave which is known as the widest in France ; and the stone floor with its labyrinth pathway , dating back to 1200 , used by monks and pilgrims as a form of walking meditation .
Over the centuries this church has been at the center of the town serving as market place , hospital , a place of celebration and of worship .
You can catch a tour to learn more about its history at 12:00 and 2:45 every day except Sunday .
Notre Dame in Paris , France
Notre Dame , which means “ Our Lady ” in French , was constructed from 1163 - 1345 .
It ’s a French Gothic building that had several different main architects work on it throughout the building process .
You can see their different styles reflected in the construction , especially on the front of the church and in the towers of the building .
The cathedral suffered damages during two different periods of history .
The first was in 1793 during the French Revolution when many of the sculptures were destroyed and some of the treasures were stolen .
Then in 1871 there was another uprising and part of the church was set on fire .
Since then the cathedral has been restored .
When you visit make sure to take in the 13th century stained glass windows , including the enormous West Rose Window ; the South Tower and its 28,000 pound bell ; the Grand Gallery where all of the famous gargoyles can be viewed ; and the three portals of the Last Judgment , St. Anne , and the Virgin .
Cadiz Cathedral in Spain
This more recent cathedral was constructed from 1776 - 1892 .
It was originally designed in the High Baroque style , but after passing through the hands of several different architects the finished product reflects the neoclassic style .
The exterior of the church is constructed entirely of stone with a large faux - gold tiled dome .
You can climb up to the top of the dome for a fabulous view of the sea .
Inside you ’ll discover many interesting sculptures and various paintings and relics that have been collected from throughout Spain .
Sagrada Familia in Barcelona , Spain
This incredible church is still a work in progress and hopefully will be completed by 2026 .
The work on the church began in 1882 and from 1883 - 1926 Antoni Gaudi was the main architect .
Since his death many other architects have helped with the project , but they have all honored Gaudi ’s modernist ideas .
The design is steeped in Christian symbolism .
There are 18 bell towers which symbolize Jesus , the Virgin , the four evangelists and the twelve apostles .
The interior symbolizes Jerusalem , various Christian cities and continents of the world , and again the apostles .
Over 2 million people visit the site per year .
If you visit you can go into the crypt where Gaudi is buried , visit a museum that explains the history of the church , and climb up to the top of a tower to enjoy a spectacular view of Barcelona , although this is not recommended for anyone with a fear of heights or claustrophobia .
Sant ’ Antimo near Montalcino , Italy
This abbey is a simple 12th century Romanesque style church that sits in a country valley of olive groves and vineyards .
You wo n’t find gilded - gold domes , vivid stained glass windows , or colorful mosaic tiled floors .
But , you will find an auditory treasure like no other .
Plan your visit around the monks chanting their prayers .
They chant every couple of hours and each chant lasts about 10 minutes .
Sit quietly on the wooden benches with your eyes closed and let the perfect sound of their voices lead you to a peaceful place .
It ’s truly a beautiful experience .
When the monks are done with their prayers they are always happy to talk to visitors .
Ask them questions , wander the grounds , and enjoy a walk up to the bell tower .
Hagia Sophia in Istanbul , Turkey
Hagia Sophia has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985 .
It was built in 537 and for 1,000 years it was the seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the largest cathedral in the world .
In 1453 , the city was conquered by the Ottomans and at that time it was converted into a mosque .
The architecture of the cathedral is Byzantine , with the most prominent exterior feature being the enormous center dome ( 102 feet in diameter . )
At various times in history , earthquakes have caused the dome to crack , and in 558 it totally collapsed and was rebuilt .
In 1935 Hagia Sophia became a museum , inside you ’ll see incredible Christian mosaics that were plastered over during the Ottoman period and are being uncovered and restored ; marble treasures including a large marble door and enormous jars ; and the Sultan ’s Lodge which has a carved marble screen that he was hidden behind .

( Newser ) – The Supreme Court today ruled that evidence obtained in violation of the Constitution is admissible in court , Bloomberg reports , in a 5 - 4 vote along ideological lines .
The court ruled that prosecutors could try an Alabama man who was found to be carrying methamphetamine and a pistol when he was accidentally arrested in 2004 due to a clerical error .
“ In such a case , the criminal should not go free because the constable has blundered , ” wrote John Roberts for the majority .

In dissent , Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the exclusionary rule was the only effective way to prevent negligent police from threatening individual freedom .

Dutch drug policies do not increase marijuana use , first rigorous comparative study finds By Jennifer McNulty
In the first rigorous study comparing marijuana use in the Netherlands and the United States , researchers have found no evidence that decriminalization of marijuana leads to increased drug use .
The results suggest that drug policies may have less impact on marijuana use than is currently thought .
In Amsterdam , coffeeshops can be licensed to sell hashish and marijuana in small quantities for personal consumption by adults .
Photo by Janice Tetlow
The findings appear in the May issue of the American Journal of Public Health .
Craig Reinarman , professor of sociology at UCSC , coauthored the article ,  The Limited Relevance of Drug Policy : Cannabis in Amsterdam and in San Francisco ,  with Peter D. A. Cohen , director of the Centre for Drug Research ( CEDRO ) at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands , and Hendrien L. Kaal , now an instructor at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands .
The study compared the cannabis ( marijuana and hashish ) habits of users in Amsterdam and San Francisco to test the premise that punishment for cannabis use deters use and thereby benefits public health .
 We compared representative samples of experienced marijuana users to see whether the lawful availability of marijuana did , in fact , lead to the problems critics of the Dutch system have claimed ,  said Reinarman .
 We found no evidence that it does .
In fact , we found consistently strong similarities in patterns of marijuana use , despite vastly different national drug policies . 
Highlights of the study include :
 The mean age at onset of use was 16.95 years in Amsterdam and 16.43 years in San Francisco .
 The mean age at which respondents began using marijuana more than once per month was 19.11 years in Amsterdam and 18.81 years in San Francisco .
 In both cities , users began their periods of maximum use about two years after they began regular use : 21.46 years in Amsterdam and 21.98 years in San Francisco .
 About 75 percent in both cities had used cannabis less than once per week or not at all in the year before the interview .
 Majorities of experienced users in both cities never used marijuana daily or in large amounts even during their periods of peak use , and use declined after those peak periods .
The Netherlands effectively decriminalized marijuana use in 1976 , and it is available for purchase in small quantities by adults in licensed coffee shops ; in the United States , marijuana use carries stiff criminal penalties , and more than 720,000 people were arrested for marijuana offenses in 2001 .
The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) and the Dutch Ministry of Health .
In identical questionnaires administered in Amsterdam and San Francisco ( cities chosen for their similarities as politically liberal northern port cities with universities and populations of roughly 700,000 people ) , nearly 500 respondents who had used marijuana at least 25 times were asked detailed questions about their marijuana use .
The questionnaire explored such issues as age at first use , regular and maximum use , frequency and quantity of use over time , intensity and duration of intoxication , career use patterns , and use of other illicit drugs .
 In the United States , marijuana policy is based on the assertion that strict penalties are the best way to inhibit use ,  said Reinarman .
The studys findings cast doubt on that scenario , he said .
Despite widespread lawful availability of cannabis in Amsterdam , there were no differences between the two cities in age at onset of use , age at first regular use , or age at the start of maximum use .
The study found no evidence that lawfully regulated cannabis provides a gateway to other illicit drug use .
In fact , marijuana users in San Francisco were far more likely to have used other illicit drugs -- cocaine , crack , amphetamines , ecstasy , and opiates -- than users in Amsterdam , said Reinarman .
 The results of this study shift the burden of proof now to those who would arrest hundreds of thousands of Americans each year on the grounds that it deters use ,  said Reinarman .

The most important data point .
Ever. Posted by Louis Brandy on 23 February 2009
I am not the first nor will I be the last to report to you perhaps the greatest scientific data point ever found .
I imagine in every generation there is a moment when theory and experiment connect and everything changes .
Usually the data comes first .
Mercury had an abnormal procession of the perihelion .
Newton could n't explain it .
Plug the numbers into Einstein 's equations , and the answer matches reality .
Wow .
It must be an incredible moment to be the first to make such a discovery .
Follow me and I 'll give you a tiny taste .
Let 's cut to the chase .
The most important data point , ever :
First , Louis Pasteur boiled some liquid , and inside nothing grew .
The consequences of this incredibly simple act are tremendous .
There are living things too small to see .
They cause diseases .
It is not caused by vengeful gods , witches , or spontaneous generation .
There is no more need for witch hunts , human , or animal sacirifice to ward off disease .
Some , at the time , understood the implications of the simple experiment , others had to be led there .
Some of you realize what the above data point means , for the rest , carry on .
Trend # 1 : A recent downturn in global temperature
This year ( 2008 ) appears set to be the coolest globally this century .
bbc
This year is set to be the coolest since 2000 , according to a preliminary estimate of global average temperature that is due to be released next week by the Met Office .
The global average for 2008 should come in close to 14.3C , which is 0.14C below the average temperature for 2001 - 07 .

Trend # 2 : A recent surge in maritime piracy
The latest piracy statistics released by the International Maritime Bureau ( IMB ) Piracy Reporting Centre ( PRC ) indicate a dramatic increase in attacks of piracy for the first nine months of 2008 .
Unprecedented rise in piratical attacks
The 2008 figures surpass all figures for hijacked vessels and hostages taken recorded by the PRC since it began its worldwide reporting function .
IMB reports unprecedented rise in maritime hijackings
Piracy on the high seas rose to unprecedented levels in 2008
Maritime watchdog reports unprecedented rise in piracy in 2008
The data
The data is quite clear .
Ever since maritime piracy was eliminated as a major threat in the early 19th century , you will see a major increase in global temperature .
Some might have called it a coincidence .
And now , today , both variables have reversed course at the exact same time .
You might call it yet another coincidence .
Yup , just like the way the discovery of DNA happened to validate both Darwin and Mendel .
Beautiful theories are strengthened by future discoveries .
The theory that explains the data
In the year 2005 , a revelation was made to one of the great minds of our time : Bobby Henderson .
He penned an open letter to the Kansas School Board proclaiming the existence of a supernatural entity .
Unlike most supernatural beings , this particular one manifested itself in a testable manner .
In other words , Bobby Henderson made a falsifiable and testable prediction that could , in principle , prove the existence of his supernatural deity .
I quote for you the most important part :
I ’m sure you now realize how important it is that your students are taught this alternate theory .
It is absolutely imperative that they realize that observable evidence is at the discretion of a Flying Spaghetti Monster .
Furthermore , it is disrespectful to teach our beliefs without wearing
His chosen outfit , which of course is full pirate regalia .
I cannot stress the importance of this enough , and unfortunately cannot describe in detail why this must be done as I fear this letter is already becoming too long .
The concise explanation is that He becomes angry if we do n’t .
You may be interested to know that global warming , earthquakes , hurricanes , and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of Pirates since the 1800s .
For your interest , I have included a graph of the approximate number of pirates versus the average global temperature over the last 200 years .
As you can see , there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between pirates and global temperature .
Bobby Henderson , Open Letter to Kansas School Board ( 2005 )
And so it was predicted , in 2005 , that global warming was a direct reaction to the number of pirates world wide .
In 2008 , just three years later , the number of pirates began dramatically increasing , and with it , temperatures plummeted .
And like a tiny deflection in a single star 's light overturned Newton and enshrined Einstein as the king of physics , so too does this little data point change everything .
A testable prediction has been made , and experimentally verified .
Now the question is whether we have the courage and the strength to admit to ourselves the full implications .
Google has waded into the worldwide debate over disconnecting file - sharers after repeated copyright infringement .
Responding to a New Zealand draft of " graduated response " principles , Google lawyers do n't reject the idea of graduated response , but they do take issue with the proposed penalty of disconnection — " a remedy that is disproportionate to the harm of copyright infringement online . "
Google makes clear in its comments that it supports copyright and the ability of rightsholders to stop infringement , but it has serious concerns about the process , especially when no judge is involved in disconnection proceedings .
" Mere allegations of copyright infringement should not trump users ' rights , " says the filing .
" Copyright law is often complex and context sensitive , and only a court is qualified to adjudicate allegations of copyright infringement .
Indeed , in Google ’s experience , there are serious issues regarding the improper use and inaccuracy of copyright notices by rights holders . "
This last bit seems like a direct shot at New Zealand 's major labels , which said in a filing of their own that " the evidence that the recording industry provides to ISPs is highly reliable , well - tested and has been accepted in countries around the world as the basis of criminal and civil legal actions . "
The process of drafting a code for implementing graduated response is taking place at the Telecommunications Carriers '
Forum , a private forum that is trying to come up with industry - wide rules that will satisfy the requirements of New Zealand 's new copyright law .
Section 92a of that law requires ISPs to disconnect repeat infringers , though it provides no guidance on how and when to do so .
After a public outcry , the government extended the implementation deadline until the end of March , but the comments suggest that wide disagreement on how to do graduated response remains .
One ISP , TelstraClear , has already indicated that it cannot accept the Code , even with revisions , which means that TCF wo n't be able to get the unanimous consent it had been hoping for .
TeltraClear 's comments on the draft Code note that " Internet users ( our customers ) have protested considerably against the Act and its implementation . "
" In TelstraClear 's view , any industry code would simply be an attempt to tidy up poorly drafted legislation , " says the company .
Some groups — including the major music labels , Sky TV , and a New Zealand betting organization — were broadly supportive of the draft and in fact wanted it tightened up .
But many of the comments were negative , including several filed by private citizens .
David Harvey , a judge on a New Zealand district court , offered his personal opinion that the Code might cause problems under New Zealand contract law .
The Code " suggests that an Internet service provider must develop a policy to cancel an existing contract as a result of copyright infringement , " he says , but " the reality of the matter is that the cancellation or termination of the contract arises at the behest , not of the Internet service provider , but of copyright owners .
Without significant justification in normal circumstances this could amount to an interference with economic relations and raises significant issues about the sanctity of contract . "
Dr. Peter Gainsford - Submission , a professor at Victoria University , went much further , calling section 92a " about as draconian and undemocratic a law as any nation could fear to have .
It makes the USA 's policy of having ' free speech zones ' look liberal in comparison . "
Even Radio New Zealand , which is itself a rightsholder , has some real problems with the current proposal .
For instance , it says that only a court should order disconnections ; it says that the Code needs rules for reinstating users ; and it wants " clear warnings to copyright holders " who send misleading or deceptive notices .
The Irish question
The recording industry in Ireland is pushing a similar graduated response plan , but one without an industry drafting process ; instead , the major music labels have essentially threatened ISPs with legal action if they do n't capitulate to label demands .
The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland has issued a strong position statement ( PDF ) on the matter , saying that any legal action against ISPs is " spurious and there is no evidence of wrong - doing by Internet Service Providers . "
If rightsholders want to stop copyright infringement — and they certainly have the right to do so — " Irish copyright law provides an avenue for the pursuit of people breaching copyright through the courts . "
The movie and music industries have been touting graduated response for several years as the answer to their troubles , the best solution to dealing with Internet copyright problems .
It certainly could be a decent solution , one far preferable to mass lawsuits or ISP filtering , but the music business in particular just can't seem to stop itself from a maximalist , confrontational approach to dealing with ISPs around the world .
As the New Zealand and Irish examples show , that sort of treatment is stirring up profound opposition from both ISPs and Internet users , opposition that soon threatens to become a real movement .
If copyright holders truly want this approach to work , they need to acknowledge legitimate worries about court oversight , proportionality , and standards of evidence , or they risk a backlash they might threaten the entire graduated response paradigm .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Victor Guevares rented apartments and saved money for 12 years , hoping eventually to buy a home for his family .
Now , the foreclosure market might make the New York man 's dream come true .
Victor Guavares discusses his plans with his wife , Yajaira , to bid on a foreclosure at an auction Sunday in New York .
Guevares went to Sunday 's USHomeAuction.com 's foreclosure sale at in New York City 's Jacob Javits Convention Center .
Banks and other lenders were unloading foreclosed houses , and they were selling at 50 percent to 60 percent below their highest values .
Guevares figured it was now or never for his family of four .
" I just have a feeling that in six to nine months , we 're going to start to see a resurgence in the market .
So , I think now is the time for us to get into it , if we can , " he told CNN .
About 2,000 potential buyers went to Sunday 's auction , ready to vie for 375 foreclosed properties at what they hoped would be bargain prices .
The auction drew about 1,400 people , twice as large as the crowd last year , when the California - based Real Estate Disposition Corporation held its first foreclosure auction in New York City , according to The New York Times .
Guevares did his homework before the event , checking out three foreclosed houses listed in a catalog .
But he really had his heart set on one of them , which is not far from his father 's home .
" I 'm nervous because I want the house so bad , " Guevares said .
" I really , really want this property . "
Watch CNN 's Susan Candiotti report on the auction »
It 's a two - story , three - bedroom house in the Queens neighborhood of Woodhaven .
Less than a year ago , it was listed at $ 527,000 .
Now , the auction house was asking for an opening bid of $ 89,000 .
Guevares said he'd never considered that someone else 's misfortune may be his ticket to home ownership .
" I could empathize , I could sense the dread it would cause families .
[ But ] you should have seen where we started ... a studio apartment with a mattress on the floor , " he said .
" This [ home up for auction ] would be my dream house . "
It has n't been easy to sock away enough money to get this far .
The Brooklyn native 's college career was interrupted when he was shot the summer after his freshman year .
After recovering , he did n't return to the school , working instead to pay off the loans he 'd received .
Eventually , he went to another school and earned an associate degree in telecommunications .
For the past few years , Guevares has been saving for a down payment while working for a chemical company .
At Sunday 's auction , he tried to keep the knots in his stomach in check .
It was a madhouse at the convention center , where speakers blasted bids throughout the room .
Finally , after more than four hours , Guevares ' dream house came up for bids .
An auctioneer barked out bids and tuxedoed assistants ran up and down the aisle .
Guevares made the opening bid , but in a heartbeat , at least two other competitors jumped in .
The bids climbed .
They went past $ 100,000 , and eventually $ 200,000 .
Guevares looked shell - shocked , but he ended up with the winning bid : $ 230,000 .
Although he put down about $ 12,000 in cash , he 's not the home 's proud owner just yet .
He might have to bring the house up to code before he can apply for a loan .
He has 30 days to seal the deal , and the clock is ticking .
Still , he said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel . "
" It 's just wonderful .
I feel I 'm a part of the American experience now , " Guevares said .
Before the auction , his 8 - year - old son , Devon , had a chance to look over his possible new home and what would be his second floor bedroom and his own back yard .
" It would be nice , " he said .
" You wo n't need to pay rent . "
All About Personal Finance • New York City
A friend emailed the other day to report that she and her family are coming home in the summer after a few years in DC .
She did n't seem overjoyed .
" I love America , " she wistfully wrote .
" Wish I was a US citizen . " .
There was a time when I 'd have snorted and emailed something waspish straight back .
No longer .
All I could think to reply was , " Wish I was too , " and comparing the transatlantic coverage of Gordon Brown 's visit yesterday did nothing to dampen the desire .
Here the media fixated on this crucial trip , albeit the reporting dwelt on the refusal to grant the PM the open-air , double - podium press conference that significant leaders generally enjoy .
The excuse was that the rose garden lawn was covered in snow , this diplomatic version of the coitus - declining headache hinting that the " special relationship " has already progressed , after that quick stop at " special partnership " , to " special marriage " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was n't polite , but who can resent the disdain when to America this visit is n't so much irrelevant as unknown ?
An hour spent scouring the US political websites yesterday unearthed barely a reference to Gordon .
In the Slate digest of major US news that pings daily into the in - box , his name did n't feature at all .
And this on the day of his address to Congress .
More attention would have been paid were he the governor of a medium - sized state in Washington to pay homage and beg for federal funding – and in a less imperfect world that 's precisely what he would be .
For decades every sub -Ben Elton stand - up has counted on an easy laugh by calling Britain the 51st State .
They entirely missed the point .
Becoming the 51st State of the Union would be a colossal promotion .
There would be downsides to yielding what passes for our sovereignty , of course .
The Sovereign would have to go , and most of us would miss her and the amusement her family selflessly provides .
Any residual misplaced sense of superiority would need to be jettisoned as well .
But the upsides would more than dwarf the regrets .
At a stroke we would inherit a written constitution – and what a constitution – guaranteeing such essentials for a functioning democracy as fixed - term government , proper checks and balances to executive power , and freedom of speech .
We'd be defended from the worst ravages of economic collapse by belonging to what will , with the euro facing mounting pressure from the imminent bankruptcy of member countries , remain the world 's premier reserve currency .
We would have a political leader to revere , for eight years at least .
And in the US tradition of slightly out - of - the - way cities holding the honour , we could make Norwich our state capital , with the Union Jack replaced as flag by a pot of Colman 's Mustard .
Almost equally tempting , we would be entitled to vote for and against those who hold our fate in their hands .
Gordon 's recklessness at the Exchequer may have worsened matters , which is why his redirected rural mail will soon have " ex - Chequers " stamped on it .
But as he has been known to point out , the source of the disaster was the Bush White House and US financial institutions .
" No Disintegration Without Representation " should be the rallying cry of our application to join the Union .
Now there will be objections , and not just from royalists .
Some , fretful of our place in the pecking idea , will feel slighted at ranking 32nd in size between Louisiana and Mississippi .
But New
York state 's square mileage is n't much more , so size could n't matter less .
Others may think us too distant to make it practicable .
Yet we 're only a few hundred miles further away from the US mainland than Hawaii – a state with a useful recent record of producing Presidents despite having four electoral college votes to the hundred or so that our population would merit .
Any presidential candidate from Britain would start with a massive edge over the field .
Imagine the thrill of hearing Alice Arnold begin a Radio 4 bulletin : " In a tough , no nonsense counterstrike , President Opik will later today warn Tehran ... "
It is ever more apparent that on its current path , or rather trapped in its current stasis , Britain is absolutely stuffed .
Whatever ersatz prestige devolved from London 's status as global financial services capital has gone , while the tacky veneer of the " young country " of Mr Tony Blair 's lively imagination faded long ago .
Britain is a befuddled geriatric , roughly cared for by a political class without energy , original thought or compassion , its populace too fatigued and apathetic to care about the incessant infringements on personal liberty .
Dribbling and muttering incoherently about the glory days when the map was suffused with pink and the sun never set , clinging to the permanent seat on the Security Council like the second childhood security blanket it is , its wizened face lights up pitiably on rare outings to the vibrant daughter who ran away from home in 1776 , supplanted it as head of the family 60 years ago , and now sticks it in corner with a cup of tea ( not a beverage she ever liked much herself ) , spraying the room with air freshener and glancing impatiently at its watch until the delusional old fool can be packed off back to the care home .
All of which begs the obvious question of what could possibly be in it for the United States to have us live with her in a granny flat 3,000 miles round the corner .
Apart from the strategic value of adding a gigantic air base in western Europe to the control she already exerts over our " independent " nuclear deterrent , the health tourism possibilities might appeal while Obama strives to deliver universal health care .
And , er , as they say in Private Eye , that 's it .
But would it hurt to ask ?
What would it cost to burst into tears and beg when all America can do is say no ?
All right , that would certainly be a humiliation .
But once a US President has cut short a meeting with a British PM , hyped over here as potentially world - saving , for a rival engagement with America 's Boy Scouts , be prepared to admit that it 's a little late to worry about that .
DIGG THIS
In the midst of the imploding US and European financial systems and the resultant bankruptcies , nationalizations and bailouts the People 's Daily , China 's official newspaper , called for a new global currency to replace the US dollar .
Writing in the People 's Daily edition of 17 September 2008 Professor Shi Jianxun of Shanghai 's Tongji University said that " [t ] he world urgently needs to create a diversified currency and financial system and fair and just financial order that is not dependent on the United States . "
This was later followed by a Friday 26 September address by Prime Minister Gordon Brown before the United Nations in which he called for a new " global financial order . "
It is to be based on " transparency , not opacity , rewarding success not excess , responsibility , not impunity , and … is [ to be ] global not national . ”
Brown went on to say “ We must clearly state that the age of irresponsibility must be [ at an ] end . ”
As the G20 nations prepare to meet in Washington this week Mr. Brown has again called for a new global financial order , a Bretton Woods II .
Mr. Brown wants the Middle East oil producers and China to assist in contributing to the bailouts taking place in the United States and Europe .
In calling for such contributions Mr. Brown is effectively admitting the United States and Europe are broke and have exhausted their government ( and central bank ) resources in an effort to cure this massive market correction ( frequently called a recession , deep recession or even depression ) which has been underway since August 2007 .
China has announced its own stimulus program but it is unclear whether included in the 4 trillion Yuan amount are new programs or existing ones or a combination of both ( my Chinese friends who are cynical about China 's government leaders laughingly tell me it probably includes the infrastructure projects for China 's 2008 Olympics as well ) .
Professor Jianxun is right to express concern about the financial leadership of the United States and the United States dollar in light of the events taking place in Washington and in the capitals of Europe .
Estimates by financial analysts of the various bailouts of US financial institutions , the US automobile industry and god knows who all are at $ 2.7 trillion dollars with more bailouts likely to come .
In Australia in addition to bailing out the automotive industry the government is assisting in the rescue of childcare operator ABC Learning Centres with a A $ 22 million dollar injection to keep the company afloat until the end of the year .
The administrator appointed to oversee the company has estimated that 40 % of the company 's childcare centres are unprofitable .
Another example of the management of a company assuming inflation by central banks would continue forever without there being any correction .
Any sane person would have to wonder how the United States taxpayer ( as well as the taxpayers of other countries ) will pay for all of this while at the same time trying to recover and grow the US economy and strengthen the US dollar .
The national debt of the United States is likely to go well above $ 11 trillion when totaling up all the financial risks proposing to be addressed by the US Treasury and the US Federal Reserve ( we can be sure that $ 700 billion is not the final cost of the bill for the bailout ; already AIG has been refinanced with $ 150 billion ) .
For example the total derivative risk covered by CDS ( credit default swaps , private contractual financial instruments insuring against default of debt ) which is what finally sunk Bear Stearns and AIG is estimated to be $ 62 trillion and the exposure by US banks and financial institutions for all derivative products is estimated to be $ 180 trillion .
The US House of Representatives recently agreed to bail out the US automotive industry and is in the process of considering providing additional money for the industry .
With this bailout the line outside the corporate soup kitchen is likely to become very long as the corporate jets start flying into Washington to get a free meal and a free ride at the expense of the American taxpayer
In 1999 the US debt was " only " $ 3.6 trillion ; the government was running a surplus and projecting to pay off the debt by 2015 .
What a difference years of large government intervention have made — expenditures for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other large government expenditures to be paid through inflation by the Federal Reserve with the resultant malinvestments .
It is not surprising then that questions arise about US financial management and the US dollar .
It is time to adopt a global currency for a global economy — a private asset - based currency rather than a fiat currency which is subject to political whim , manipulation and wild swings in value resulting in massive malinvestments and destruction of savings .
It is time to return to gold as the global private currency for our global economy .
Eliminate fiat currency , eliminate fractional reserve banking , eliminate central banks and their government sponsored banking cartel which has brought about this massive destruction of wealth .
The technological and financial revolution which has resulted in a globalized economy and more open markets among nations has dramatically broken down trade and other national barriers among countries of the world .
While far from perfectly efficient ( due to the vast array of national protectionist laws and regulations ) we have a global economy in spite of the attempts by governments to preserve the past with various national barriers .
The least - developed nations can participate in the globalized economy as well as can their larger developed neighbors .
So why do we still have over 150 national currencies in the world today rather than one global currency ?
Why is this nationalistic barrier to trade still standing ?
The currency and monetary system to be used in a modern globalized system of trade and development is simply too important to be left to the numerous central bank bureaucrats and power brokering politicians who have various agendas of a political nature rather than the facilitation of free trade , free markets , economic development and prosperity for the people of the world .
A global currency should be in private hands and not under political control as it is presently .
The establishment of the developed countries must have sensed the train wreck and thus began to question whether or not a private system makes more sense then the current system particularly in light of the financial crisis which began in August 2007 and continues to worsen almost daily .
In an article published in the Financial Post November 8 , 2007 Benn Steil , Director of International Economics for the Council on Foreign Relations , says that private money is a real possibility if the United States does not " return to long - term fiscal discipline " ( raise your hand if you think the United States government will return to long - term fiscal discipline ) .
" As for the United States , it needs to perpetuate the sound money policies of former Federal Reserve chairmen Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan and return to long - term fiscal discipline .
This is the only sure way to keep the United States ’ foreign creditors , with their massive and growing holdings of dollar debt , feeling wealthy and secure .
It is the market that made the dollar into global money — and what the market giveth , the market can taketh away .
If …the dollar fails , the market may privatize money on its own . "
Mr. Steil goes to on to say
" … private gold banks already exist , allowing account holders to make international payments in the form of shares in actual gold bars .
Although clearly a niche business at present , gold banking has grown dramatically in recent years , in tandem with the U.S. dollar ’s decline .
A new gold - based international monetary system surely sounds far - fetched .
But so , in 1900 , did a monetary system without gold .
Modern technology makes a revival of gold money , through private gold banks , possible even without government support . "
While it is arguable ( among non-Austrian economists ) whether or not the monetary policies of Messrs .
Volcker and Greenspan were sound ( many , if not most , point the finger of blame at Greenspan for today 's financial problems ) , it is wishful thinking to believe for one second that governments and the government 's financier , their central banks , will maintain long - term ( or even short - term ) discipline in spending and creating money .
Their track record to date is not good and is becoming worse by the day .
The events since August 2007 and particularly the response by central banks and governments to the meltdown which began during the week of 15 September 2008 and thereafter clearly indicates that the prospects for a " return to long - term fiscal discipline " is poor .
The appetite of politicians , bureaucrats and governments for expansion of power and spending is too great to resist and the bureaucrats at central banks are all too eager to accommodate the demands of the government and the power broker politicians .
It is the reason the world 's economy has been on a course toward economic disaster since the flood gates of fiat currency ( initially paper money and now electronically created money ) were opened in 1913 with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in the United States .
Gordon Brown 's call for more global regulation and hence more government intervention is not the answer .
The creation of money and management of the monetary system should be returned to a free ( free from government intervention ) private marketplace in the United States , Europe and other countries .
As recent events clearly show our property , our wealth and our lives should not be entrusted to government bureaucrats and power - brokering politicians who bow and bend to special political interests rather than satisfy private consumers ' demands as does the private marketplace .
Let the private free market determine and provide what consumers want , what will be money and how the monetary system will function as the private market does with other products and services provided in the private marketplace .
We would not think of the government providing our groceries ( scarcity and long lines are the rule from such a system as we saw in the old Soviet Union and as we see in Zimbabwe today ) so why do we allow the government to provide and manage something as important as our monetary system ?
It is time for a new world financial order of private money and a private monetary system .
Close down government - sponsored central banks in the United States and other countries and end the government monopoly of creating money and managing the monetary system which has brought the world financial system to near collapse .
It is time to return to a private global gold standard for a global economy .

The Best of Jacob Steelman
The number of Yahoo executives jumping ship to Microsoft is steadily growing , with no end in sight .
In the last three months , big names like Scott Moore , Qi Lu , and Sean Suchter have switched over .
According to a report by Bloomberg , the story continues with Larry Heck ( the man on the right ) , a Yahoo search executive who finds Microsoft 's budget for search much more enticing than his former employer's .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has said he does n't want to acquire the entire company anymore , but he 's still open to a search agreement .
If that does n't work out , Microsoft can keep on offering its hand to any Yahoo employee thinking of leaving , despite mass layoffs .
Grabbing employees from
Yahoo still wo n't be enough to let the software giant move on up in the search business if nobody cares that there are alternatives to Google .
The trick is to convince users that Live Search not only exists , but that it is the best search engine out there .
That 's no easy feat , though the company is trying various ways to improve the service , not to mention researching ways to go beyond current solutions .
This is the Vulca S. You probably wo n't ever see one , let alone drive one , because it 's more exclusive than a VIP room at the Pink Elephant and you need an AIG bonus to afford one .
The Vulca S is the first car entirely designed and built by Italian coachbuilders Faralli & Mazzanti .
Just ten - that 's right , ten - will be built , every one of them by hand over the course of 11 months .
During that time , customers will stay at the coachbuilder 's private villa in Tuscany so as to oversee every aspect of construction .
You know a car that rare will have some impressive hardware , and the Vulca - named for the Etruscan sculptor - does not disappoint .
According to F&M , the Vulca gets a 5.8 - liter V10 producing 630 horsepower .
F&M does n't say who 's making the engine , but BMW and Lamborghini make a ten- cylinder , though both displace less than 5.8 liters and so would have to be modified .
Dodge makes one for the Viper , but it 's a massive 8.4 liters .
Motor Authority says the Vulca also could come with a V12 producing between 445 and 630 horsepower , depending upon how big an engine the customer orders .
Acceleration will be blistering , with a zero to 60 time of 3.9 seconds .
F&M promises a top speed somewhere north of 200 mph .
F&M does n't say anything more about the drivetrain , but the car rides on OZ Racing wheels and the interior is covered by a few acres of diamond - tufted leather .
Carbon fiber and Alcantara is an option if you want a racier look .
We do n't see any gauges behind the steering wheel , so all the vital data must be displayed on one of the two LCD screens in the center of the dashboard - unless that 's a heads - up display just to the left of the gargantuan hump in the middle of the dash .
The Tuscan coachbuilder was founded by race car driver Antonio Faralli , who was later joined by Rosello Mazzanti .
The two men have been joined by their sons , and the firm handcrafts every car .
And by that we mean they 're using hammers , wrenches and scissors to build these aluminum cars .
This is true old - world craftsmanship .
F&M started taking orders Wednesday .

* Tor
This is a pretty old " how - to " but I thought I should share this to some of our readers who are new - to - Linux .
This simple guide will enable you to surf the web anonymously while using Firefox on Linux .
But to do this , you will need to install these two important tools :
" Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy , confidential business activities and relationships , and state security known as traffic analysis . "
* Privoxy
" Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy , modifying web page data , managing HTTP cookies , controlling access , and removing ads , banners , pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet junk .
Privoxy has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes .
Privoxy has application for both stand - alone systems and multi-user networks . "
Three Easy Steps to Set - up Anonymous Web Browsing on Linux :
Three Easy Steps to Set - up Anonymous Web Browsing on Linux :
Step - 1. Set - up Tor and Privoxy :
$ sudo apt - get install tor privoxy
Step - 2. Configure Privoxy :
/etc/privoxy / config
$ sudo gedit /etc / privoxy / config
# Generally , this file goes in /etc / privoxy / config
forward - socks4a / 127.0.0.1:9050 .
confdir /etc / privoxy
logdir / var / log / privoxy
actionsfile standard
actionsfile default
actionsfile user

enable - remote - toggle 0
enable - edit- actions 0
enable - remote - http- toggle 0
buffer - limit 4096
$ sudo / etc / init.d / privoxy restart
Step - 3 . Install Firefox Torbutton plugin
" Torbutton provides a button to securely and easily enable or disable the browser 's use of Tor .
It is currently the only addon that will safely manage your
Tor browsing to prevent IP address leakage , cookie leakage , and general privacy attacks . "
Fire up Firefox and install the Torbutton plugin .
After installation , restart Firefox and you are ready to surf the web anonymously !
You can quickly install Tor and Privoxy on Ubuntu with this command : Editfile using your preferred text editor .
For this example , we will use gedit :
Then , overwrite the entire content of /etc / privoxy / config with this configuration file : Next , restart Privoxy with this command :
Missiles fired by an unmanned US drone have killed at least 24 people in Pakistan 's Kurram tribal region near the Afghan border , officials have said .
Local officials said the dead were local Taleban and that the toll may rise .
Thirty others were injured .
Correspondents say this is the fifth drone attack on Pakistani territory since Barack Obama became US president .
Pakistan is critical of the tactic because , it says , civilians are often killed , fuelling support for militants .
The target of the missile attack on Thursday night was a training camp run by a local Taleban commander .
The camp in the Brijo area is located some 20 km from Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan .
Hostages Local officials told the BBC Urdu Service that a drone fired four missiles into the camp , a huge compound with five rooms which served as a weapons store , meeting place and lodging for the local Taleban .
It was being run by Commander Fazal Saeed , who was present , along with 57 others , during the missile attack .
Officials said that the commander escaped unharmed .
Pakistan is critical of the US drone tactic Taleban guards said that some of those in the camp were hostages the Taleban were holding .
Witnesses said people living in the area turned off their lights following the blasts to avoid being targeted by missiles .
They said the entire Taleban compound was set on fire and that announcements were made using mosque loudspeakers in the area urging people not to approach the camp for fear of more drone attacks .
Last month , a missile strike in the same area targeted a suspected Taleban training facility .
Missile strikes by unmanned drone spy aircraft have mostly targeted foreign fighters in the Waziristan region over the past couple of years .
The BBC's Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says the strikes are now also targeting facilities run by local or Afghan Taleban in the lower Kurram region , from where attacks have been launched into the Khost and Paktia provinces of Afghanistan .
The southern parts of the lower Kurram region share borders with Afghanistan 's Khost province , where US and coalition forces have major deployments of forces .
The US does not confirm drone attacks but no other countries have the power to deploy such weapons in the region .

Being paid to play games all day long sounds like a dream job – but for thousands of Chinese ' gold farmers ' , the virtual reality is sheer hard graft
Li Hua makes a living playing computer games .
Working from a cramped office in the heart of Changsha , China , he slays dragons and loots virtual gold in 10 - hour shifts .
Next to him , rows of other young workers do the same .
" It is just like working in a factory , the only difference is that this is the virtual world , " says Li . " The working conditions are hard .
We do n't get weekends off and I only have one day free a month .
But compared to other jobs it is good .
I have no other skills and I enjoy playing sometimes . "
Li is just one of more than 100 workers employed by Wow7gold , an internet - based company that makes more than £ 1 m a year selling in - game advantages to World of Warcraft ( WoW ) players .
Customers may ask for their avatar 's skill level to be increased ( " power levelling " ) , or for a virtual magic sword or precious ore to be obtained .
As one player put it : " Where there 's a demand , China will supply it . "
Division of playbour
For thousands of Chinese workers such as Li , " gold farming " is a way of life .
Workers can expect to earn between £ 80 - £ 120 a month which , given the long hours and night shifts , can amount to as little as 30 p an hour .
After completing his shift , Li is given a basic meal of rice , meat and vegetables and falls into a bunk bed in a room that eight other gold farmers share .
His wages may be low , but food and accommodation are included .
These virtual industries sound surreal , but they are fast entering the mainstream .
According to a report by Richard Heeks at Manchester University , an estimated 400,000 Asian workers are now employed in gold farming in a trade worth up to £ 700 m a year .
With so many gamers now online , these industries are estimated to have a consumer base of five million to 10 million , and numbers are expected to grow with widening internet access .
These figures mean big business .
The gold farming industry may be about playing games , but these companies take their work seriously .
At Wow7gold , a sophisticated division of labour splits workers into different departments , including production , sales , advertising and research .
What 's interesting about this " virtual division of labour " is that traditional concepts of " men 's work " and " women 's work " still apply .
While young , largely unskilled " playbourers " such as Li spend their days toiling in the virtual field , highly skilled female graduates receive higher salaries working as customer service operators .
Eva Yuan is one such operator .
A 26 - year - old graduate who speaks three languages , she has been working in the white - collar departments of Wow7gold for more than a year .
Each day she helps more than 100 customers , placing orders and answering queries .
" Most of our customers are from America but they are people of all ages and careers , " she says .
" The biggest transaction I have seen was one person who bought 100,000 gold , which costs £ 2,000 to £ 3,000 .
For me this is a lot of money but for them it is not . "
After leaving university , Yuan was unable to find employment in the " real " economy .
Now , the £ 250 she makes every month at Wow7gold allows her - with a bit of help from her parents - to support her one - year - old son .
" We face unemployment in some areas and China has a large population so the challenge is severe , " she says .
" These firms provide the employee with a place to live and money to earn .
When I came there were just 100 employees , now there are over 130 .
This is a new and innovating area for the economy " .
I ask Yuan whether she thinks her job is worthwhile .
" Everything that appeals to some people in the world needs some people to produce it .
We are allowing people to buy what they want , and we care about that . "
Precious law
Last year , the Chinese government acknowledged the rising significance of gold farming by introducing a 20 % tax on the industry .
But regulations on working hours , salaries , holidays and medical fees have not been extended with it .
Yuan may be proud of her job , but she admits the long , unregulated hours are taking their toll .
" The government should lay down the law .
I would consider staying if conditions improved , but the game world is not a real career for me , " she says .
With no regulatory oversight , the working conditions in gold farms vary massively .
Yuan is one of the lucky ones .
Anthony Gilmore , an independent filmmaker , has been investigating the industry as part of a documentary he is making , Play Money , which he hopes to release by the end of the year ( playmoneyfilm.com ) .
He has collected footage of firms in the middle of nowhere , where bunk beds sprawl alongside computers in the middle of freezing and dirty offices .
Thousands of miles away , western consumers are driving these industries , pumping hard - earned cash into products and services that exist only in fantasy lands .
I ask Jamie el - Banna , a 24 - year - old gamer from the UK , what makes him spend his money on these sites .
" The reason people buy gold is the same reason they pay people to wash their car - they would rather spend money than do it themselves " he says .
" You could spend time farming gold , say , 20 real - life hours .
Or you could go to work for two hours and earn the money to buy the gold .
If I 'm playing I want to play , not do boring tasks .
Go back some years , and a job involving a computer was a skilled job .
Nowadays , keyboards and mice are the new ploughs and shears . "
But does he ever consider the conditions of the workers supplying these services ?
" I do n't think about the workers .
I think about the product .
I 'm sure the wage that gold farmers are paid is low .
Manual labourers in third - world countries probably earn a similar amount , but I doubt you would ask someone this kind of question if you saw them drinking a cup of coffee . "
At present , the vast majority of gold farming takes place in developing countries , with four - fifths of production estimated to take place in China .
The jury is still out on whether this industry is spawning a new generation of " virtual sweatshops " or whether it is a massive opportunity for countries seeking to develop through the hi-tech economy .
Heeks , an avid gamer himself , believes that " development agencies and governments need to wake up to gold farming " .
" It 's big business - hundreds of thousands of Asian workers ; hundreds of millions of dollars - that has been flying under the radar , " he said .
" We need to start paying attention to these opportunities . "
Gold diggers
There are worries that gold farming will be hit by the financial crisis , but Heeks believes that the industry is likely to grow with rising numbers of online game players .
World of Warcraft 's subscriptions alone went from 10 m to more than 11 m during 2008 , and Wow7gold saw an increase in profits during the same period .
Far from seeing a decrease in the downturn , gold farms may profit as the less well - off turn to the virtual world for escapism and a cheaper alternative to going out .
" Gold farming appears to be anything but a here today , gone tomorrow blip , " says Heeks .
" In fact , gold farming may be a glimpse into a much larger future of international , network - based development where life , work and commerce become ever more immersed in cyberspace .
We could be seeing , in short , the emergence of ' development 2.0 ' . "

I am 100 % sure that these are not the pictures of Pepsi Manufacturing plant .
However , these are the people who are using Pepsi name and making money .
I live in a city in Australia where public transport is fairly cheap , efficient and rather popular .
As a result we get lots of kids taking the train to school .
A little while ago the state government instituted a 50 c fare for all children taking public transport to school .
One of the provisos was that they stand when the train is full .
Long story short , packed train and two kids still sitting in their seats .
It 's not the first time either .
Having a trusty iPhone I thought why not take their picture and email a picture of them sitting down in a packed carriage to the school with a " I 'm quite disappointed in school x .
I was hoping we taught our kids better manners than this . "
I 'm sure some people would applaud me but I 'm a bit of a fraidy cat when it comes to confrontation .
Should I just do it surreptitiously ( my preferred method ) or should I explain myself to them and exactly what I 'm doing ?
Or am I just being an over reactive prick and stop caring about it ?
Should I take pictures of kids who are legally required to stand on public transport and email them to school principals ?
Can I do this ?
Is there any way you think I should approach it ?

A painful reminder for Operation Cast Lead remained evident in Gaza in the form of blatant , racist graffiti left on houses ' walls by IDF soldiers .
Photo : AFP
Residents of the Zeitun neighborhood who returned to their homes once the fighting in the region was over discovered that their walls had been marked with slogans such as " Die you all , " Make war not peace , " " Death to Arabs , " " Arabs must die , " and " One down , 999,999 to go . "
Photo : AFP
Some of the graffiti was written on the ruins of the homes of the al - Samuni family , who lost dozens of its members during the war .
An IDF spokesman said in response to the report : " This is not how IDF soldiers are educated .
This goes against the IDF 's ethical code .
The matter is being investigated and those responsible for it will be severely reprimanded . "
Canadian archer John David Burnes , who placed 63rd in his event at last summer 's Beijing Olympics , was charged with child pornography offences on Thursday .
Burnes , 20 , was arrested as part of an Ontario - wide child pornography sweep last week that resulted in 93 charges against 31 people .
The charges against Burnes , a Toronto native , include one count each of possession of child pornography and one count of making available child pornography .
Joan McDonald , coach of Canada 's archery team , said she learned of the charges from the media .
" They called me and asked me the question , and I called his parents , " said McDonald , who added that the archer 's parents confirmed the charges .
She called the situation a tragedy , adding , " It 's always a tragedy when young people are in trouble . "
To her knowledge , Burnes will continue with archery , McDonald added .
Burnes 's next court appearance is May 5 in Kingston , Ont. , where he attends Queen 's University .
He plans to pursue a career in medicine , according to the Canadian Olympic Committee website .
Michael Chambers , president of the COC , called the charges troubling .
" It 's disturbing when you hear a charge of that nature is laid against anyone , " Chambers said from Whistler , B.C. , where he was attending celebrations to mark the one - year 2010 Winter Olympics countdown .
" If a person has been charged , they are presumed innocent until found guilty … I would not want to make any comment on what they may be facing . "
Bruce Savage , president of Burnes 's archery club , The Archers of Caledon , had no comment when asked about the charges .
Burnes , the youngest member of the Canadian archery squad in Beijing , won an individual bronze medal and team silver medal at the 2007 Canada Winter Games , and won a silver medal in a junior category at the 2006 Canadian Archery Championships .
He has been competing only three years and has little international experience , but shot twice a day in the months leading to the Olympic trials .
Burnes showed little emotion during the tournament until the moment he found out he'd won the third and final position over Hugh MacDonald of Vancouver .
Burnes almost had to pull out of the Olympics two days before the opening ceremony after he was hospitalized with what was first believed to be appendicitis .
His condition was downgraded a day later and he was cleared to compete .
2018 Holiday Shipping : December 20th is last day to order signed albums or tees for Christmas shipping within the US .
Thanks for giving my music / merch !
Also , last month I dropped a new tee in the shop designed by animator Ben Luce .
I love it !!
It 's based on the Quest for The Jam video from Rhodes Deep that Ben Luce created .
Had a good pre-order run on these ( thank you if you 've already got one ! ) and you can still buy one .
$ 20 , ships free in the US . :)
I think I 've done final print runs on all the current designs before possibly outsourcing to shirt professionals ( btw , you can hover over shirt sizes to see if sold out ) .
Teespring teamed up with youtube and integrated merch sales pretty well so I 'm interested in trying that out soon .
Looks really neat and from what I 've gathered , their customer service is good .
Edit : teespring store is up and people are actually finding my tees there already .
YAY
I 'm also working on a new youtubes with a tune that 's really shaping up to be a fun one .
Posted a couple of Instagram clips with bits of it there .
I have a lot of starts of songs for RJCD6 - some of them further along than others .
I 'd love to have a 2019 release if it comes together .
Hope your holidays are safe and awesome !
I 'm running 64 - bit operating systems on every machine I have that is capable .
I 'm running Vista 64 on my quad - proc machine with 8 gigs of RAM , and Windows 7 Beta 64 - bit on my laptop with 4 gigs .
Writing managed code is a pretty good way to not have to worry about any x86 ( 32 - bit ) vs. x64 ( 64 - bit ) details .
Write managed code , compile , and it'll work everywhere .
The most important take away , from MSDN :
" If you have 100 % type safe managed code then you really can just copy it to the 64 - bit platform and run it successfully under the 64 - bit CLR . "
If you do that , you 're golden .
Moving right along .
WARNING : This is obscure and you probably do n't care .
But , that 's this blog .
Back to 32 - bit vs. 64 - bit .NET
Basics
I promote 64 - bit a lot because I personally think my 64 - bit machine is snappier and more stable .
I also have buttloads of RAM which is nice .
The first question developer ask me when I 'm pushing 64 - bit is " Can I still run Visual Studio the same ?
Can I make apps that run everywhere ? "
Yes , totally .
I run VS2008 all day on x64 machines writing ASP.
NET apps , WPF apps , and Console apps and do n't give it a thought .
When I 'm developing I usually do n't sweat any of this .
Visual Studio 2008 installs and runs just fine .
If you care about details , when you install .NET on a 64 - bit machine the package is bigger because you 're getting BOTH 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions of stuff .
Some of the things that are 64 - bit specific are :
Base class libraries ( System . * )
) Just - In - Time compiler
Debugging support
. NET Framework SDK
For example , I have a C : \Windows \Microsoft.NET
\Framework and a C : \Windows \Microsoft.NET
\Framework64 folder .
If I File|New Project and make a console app , and run it , this is what I 'll see in the Task Manager :
Notice that a bunch of processes have * 32 by their names , including devenv.exe ?
Those are all 32 - bit processes .
However , my ConsoleApplication1.exe does n't have that .
It 's a 64 - bit process and it can access a ridiculous amount of memory ( if you 've got it ... like 16TB , although I suspect the GC would be freaking out at that point . )
That 64 - bit process is also having its code JIT compiled to use not the x86 instruction set we 're used to , but the AMD64 instruction set .
This is important to note :
It does n't matter if you have an AMD or an Intel processor , if you 're 64 - bit you are using the AMD64 instruction set .
The short story is - Intel lost .
For us , it does n't really matter .
Now , if I right click on the Properties dialog for this Project in Visual Studio I can select the Platform Target from the Build Tab :
By default , the Platform Target is " Any CPU . "
Remember that our C# or VB compiles to IL , and that IL is basically processor agnostic .
It 's the JIT that makes the decision at the last minute .
In my case , I am running 64 - bit and it was set to Any CPU so it was 64 - bit at runtime .
But , to repeat ( I 'll do it a few times , so forgive me ) the most important take away , from MSDN :
" If you have 100 % type safe managed code then you really can just copy it to the 64 - bit platform and run it successfully under the 64 - bit CLR . "
Let me switch it to x86 and look at Task Manager and we see my app is now 32 - bit .
Cool , so ...
32 - bit vs. 64 - bit - Why Should I Care ?
Everyone once in a while you 'll need to call from managed code into unmanaged and you 'll need to give some thought to 64 - bit vs. 32 - bit .
Unmanaged code cares DEEPLY about bitness , it exists in a processor specific world .
Here 's a great bit from an older MSDN article that explains part of it with emphasis mine :
In 64 - bit Microsoft Windows , this assumption of parity in data type sizes is invalid .
Making all data types 64 bits in length would waste space , because most applications do not need the increased size .
However , applications do need pointers to 64 - bit data , and they need the ability to have 64 - bit data types in selected cases .
These considerations led the Windows team to select an abstract data model called LLP64 ( or P64 ) .
In the LLP64 data model , only pointers expand to 64 bits ; all other basic data types ( integer and long ) remain 32 bits in length .
The .NET CLR for 64 - bit platforms uses the same LLP64 abstract data model .
In .NET there is an integral data type , not widely known , that is specifically designated to hold ' pointer ' information : IntPtr whose size is dependent on the platform ( e.g. , 32 - bit or 64 - bit ) it is running on .
Consider the following code snippet : [ C# ] public void SizeOfIntPtr ( ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " SizeOf IntPtr is : { 0} " , IntPtr. Size ) ; }
When run on a 32 - bit platform you will get the following output on the console : SizeOf IntPtr is : 4
On a 64 - bit platform you will get the following output on the console : SizeOf IntPtr is : 8
Short version :
If you 're using IntPtrs , you care .
If you 're aware of what IntPtrs are , you likely know this already .
If you checked the property System .
IntPtr. Size while running as x86 , it 'll be 4 .
It 'll be 8 while under x64 .
To be clear , if you are running x86 even on an x64 machine , System .
IntPtr. Size will be 4 .
This is n't a way to tell the bitness of your OS , just the bitness of your running CLR process .
Here 's a concrete example .
It 's a pretty specific edgy thing , but a decent example .
Here 's an app that runs fine on x86 .
using System ;
using System .Runtime .InteropServices ;
namespace TestGetSystemInfo
{
public class WinApi
{
[ DllImport ( " kernel32.dll " ) ]
public static extern void GetSystemInfo([ MarshalAs( UnmanagedType.Struct ) ] ref SYSTEM_INFO lpSystemInfo ) ;
[ StructLayout ( LayoutKind .
Sequential ) ]
public struct SYSTEM_INFO
{
internal _PROCESSOR_INFO_UNION uProcessorInfo ;
public uint dwPageSize ;
public IntPtr lpMinimumApplicationAddress ;
public int lpMaximumApplicationAddress ;
public IntPtr dwActiveProcessorMask ;
public uint dwNumberOfProcessors ;
public uint dwProcessorType ;
public uint dwAllocationGranularity ;
public ushort dwProcessorLevel ;
public ushort dwProcessorRevision ;
}
[ StructLayout ( LayoutKind .
Explicit ) ]
public struct _PROCESSOR_INFO_UNION
{
[ FieldOffset ( 0 ) ]
internal uint dwOemId ;
[ FieldOffset ( 0 ) ]
internal ushort wProcessorArchitecture ;
[ FieldOffset ( 2 ) ]
internal ushort wReserved ;
}
}
public class Program
{
public static void Main ( string [ ] args )
{
WinApi.SYSTEM_INFO sysinfo = new WinApi.SYSTEM_INFO ( ) ;
WinApi.GetSystemInfo(ref sysinfo ) ;
Console .
WriteLine(" dwProcessorType ={0} " , sysinfo.dwProcessorType.ToString ( ) ) ;
Console .
WriteLine(" dwPageSize ={0} " , sysinfo.dwPageSize.ToString ( ) ) ;
Console .
WriteLine(" lpMaximumApplicationAddress ={0} " , sysinfo.lpMaximumApplicationAddress.ToString ( ) ) ;
}
}
}
See the mistake ?
It 's not totally obvious .
Here 's what 's printed under x86 ( by changing the project properties ) :
dwProcessorType =586
dwPageSize =4096
lpMaximumApplicationAddress =2147418111
The bug is subtle because it works under x86 .
As said in the P / Invoke Wiki :
The use of int will appear to be fine if you only run the code on a 32 - bit machine , but will likely cause your application / component to crash as soon as it gets on a 64 - bit machine .
In our case , it does n't crash , but it sure is wrong .
Here 's what happens under x64 ( or AnyCPU and running it on my x64 machine ) :
dwProcessorType = 8664
dwPageSize =4096
lpMaximumApplicationAddress =-65537
See that lat number ?
Total crap .
I 've used an int as a pointer to lpMaximumApplicationAddress rather than an IntPtr.
Remember that IntPtr is smart enough to get bigger and point to the right stuff .
When I change it from int to IntPtr :
dwProcessorType = 8664
dwPageSize =4096
lpMaximumApplicationAddress =8796092956671
That 's better .
Remember that IntPtr is platform / processor specific .
You can still use P / Invokes like this and call into unmanaged code if you 're on 64 - bit or if you 're trying to work on both platforms , you just need to be thoughtful about it .
Gotchas : Other Assemblies
You 'll also want to think about the assemblies that your application loads .
It 's possible that when purchasing a vendor 's product in binary form or bringing an Open Source project into your project in binary form , that you might consume an x86 compiled .NET assembly .
That 'll work fine on x86 , but break on x64 when your AnyCPU compiled EXE runs as x64 and tries to load an x86 assembly .
You 'll get a BadImageFormatException as I did in this post .
The MSDN article gets it right when it says :
... it is unrealistic to assume that one can just run 32 - bit code in a 64 - bit environment and have it run without looking at what you are migrating .
As mentioned earlier , if you have 100 % type safe managed code then you really can just copy it to the 64 - bit platform and run it successfully under the 64 - bit CLR .
But more than likely the managed application will be involved with any or all of the following : Invoking platform APIs via p/invoke
Invoking COM objects
Making use of unsafe code
Using marshaling as a mechanism for sharing information
Using serialization as a way of persisting state Regardless of which of these things your application is doing it is going to be important to do your homework and investigate what your code is doing and what dependencies you have .
Once you do this homework you will have to look at your choices to do any or all of the following : Migrate the code with no changes .
Make changes to your code to handle 64 - bit pointers correctly .
Work with other vendors , etc. , to provide 64 - bit versions of their products .
Make changes to your logic to handle marshaling and / or serialization .
There may be cases where you make the decision either not to migrate the managed code to 64 - bit , in which case you have the option to mark your assemblies so that the Windows loader can do the right thing at start up .
Keep in mind that downstream dependencies have a direct impact on the overall application .
I have found that for smaller apps that do n't need the benefits of x64 but need to call into some unmanaged COM components that marking the assemblies as x86 is a reasonable mitigation strategy .
The same rules apply if you 're making a WPF app , a Console App or an ASP .
NET app .
Very likely you 'll not have to deal with this stuff if you 're staying managed , but I wanted to put it out there in case you bump into it .
Regardless , always test on x86 and x64 .

Der NDR will dem Initiator einer Kampagne zur Verbesserung der Fernsehqualität keine Aufträge mehr geben
Letzte Woche startete Holger Kreymeier , der Macher von Fernsehkritik - TV eine Video - Kampagne zur Verbesserung der Programmqualität öffentlich - rechtlicher Sender .
Sie stieß auf reges Interesse in Medien und Foren , wo sichtbar wurde , dass sich bemerkenswert viel Zorn darüber angestaut hat , dass selbst Personen ohne Fernseh - und Radiogerät zur Zwangsfinanzierung von Honoraren für Bill - Gates - PR - Auftritte bei " Wetten Dass … ? " und Schlimmerem herangezogen werden .
Nun stellt sich heraus , dass die Kampagne möglicherweise zu erfolgreich war : Kreymeier arbeitete freiberuflich für den NDR , wo er unter anderem Untertitel für Hörbehinderte anfertigte .
Am Dienstag rief ihn nach eigener Darstellung seine dortige Chefin an und teilte ihm mit , dass das Justiziariat des Senders eine weitere Beschäftigung untersagt habe .
Bereits verabredete Arbeitstermine würden deshalb gestrichen .
In einem öffentlichen Kommentar dazu betonte Kreymeier , dass er mit seiner Kampagne " weder zu einem Gebühren - Boykott aufgerufen noch das öffentlich - rechtliche System in Frage gestellt " habe .
Seine Kritik habe sich vielmehr auf Inhalte konzentriert .

Geothermal energy is increasingly contributing to the power supply where it is affordable and efficient .
Iceland is world - leader in expanding development of geothermal utilization : in recent years the annual power supply there doubled to more than 500 MW in the supply of electricity .
Even in Germany , over 100 MW of heat are currently being provided through geothermal energy .
In the region of Travale , in the pioneering country Italy , a team of european scientists have localizied geothermal reservoirs , holding a potential comparable to the effectiveness of 1,000 wind power plants , said presenters at the international final conference of the project " I - GET " ( Integrated Geophysical Exploration Technologies for deep fractured geothermal systems ) in Potsdam .
The aim of the European Union project , in which seven european nations participated , was the development of cutting - edge geophysical methods with which potential geothermal reservoirs can be safely explored and directly tapped .
The newly developed approaches have been tested at four European geothermal locations with different geological and thermodynamic conditions : high - temperature reservoirs have been examined in Travale / Italien ( metamorphic rocks ) and in Hengill / Island ( volcanic rocks ) , two deposits with medium - temperature in deep sediment rocks are Groß -Schönebeck / Germany and Skierniewice / Poland .
The methodology is based on the measurement of seismic velocities and electrical conductivity in the underground which deliver information on the rock - physical characteristics at depth .
Different methods have , hereby , been combined , in addition to borehole measurements and rock - analysis .

" The new methods deliver important decision - support for the selection of sites for future geothermal projects .
With this we can considerably reduce the risk of expensive misdrills , " explains Dr. Ernst Huenges , Head of Geothermal Research at the host institute GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences .
I-GET experiments have been carried out using a case study in the surrounding of the GFZ research borehole at Groß Schönebeck , nordwest of Berlin .
And here , extensive pre-knowledge from experimental investigations in the in situ geothermal - laboratory in Groß Schönebeck is already available .
The geological conditions prevailing in the North German Basin are representative for further parts of central Europe , and thus the research results are also of high interest beyond Germany ’s borders .
The GFZ , member of the Helmholtz - Association of German Research Centres , had the leading role in I - GET and was able to contribute with is acquired knowledge in the field of low - temperature geothermal reservoirs .
The results of I - GET emanate worldwide : experts from Indonesia , New Zealand , Australia , Japan and the USA were among the 120 scientists and industry representatives from the 20 countries who participated at the meeting .
" Reliable geothermal technologies are in demand worldwide .
Even countries with a long experience in geothermal energy such as Indonesia and New Zealand are interested in the results acquired in I - GET , " says Dr. Ernst Huenges .
Therefore , the GFZ is further developing its geothermal research and is currently setting up an International Centre for Geothermal Research , which will , in particular , carry out application - oriented large - scale projects on a national and international level .
Microsoft Exchange can help businesses manage the e-mail and collaboration services their employees use .
However , Exchange is not the easiest Microsoft app to install and keep in good running order , particularly for a small business without a dedicated IT department .
While I believe Exchange 2007 is a little easier to set up than Exchange 2003 , the newer version is available only as a 64 - bit application ; you may need to upgrade your server hardware to run the new Exchange .
The good news is that you do n't need to install Exchange on your own server to gain its benefits .
You can sidestep all the hassles of hiring an IT pro , buying and installing the software , ensuring 64 - bit hardware compatibility , and tackling maintenance issues if you outsource Exchange provisioning to an online hosting service .
Hosted Microsoft Exchange
It 's worth noting that Exchange is n't nearly as ubiquitous as POP e-mail , and not every Internet host offers Exchange services .
A growing number of hosts have added Exchange to their menu of services , though .
Generally the cost is pretty affordable to a small business : Basic Exchange hosted services range from $ 10 to 15 per month , per employee .
Optional extras , such as additional mailbox storage and message archiving , will bump up the tab .
Selecting a service also involves a few other considerations that depend on your business 's requirements .
For example , antispam service provided at the Exchange server is more efficient than at the Outlook e-mail client level , since users do n't need to waste time downloading unwanted messages .
Do you want to help mobile employees keep in touch easily ?
If so , check out hosted services that also offer e-mail integration with smart phones such as RIM's BlackBerry and Apple 's iPhone .
Do you need collaboration capabilities , such as document sharing ?
Look for a service that also provides hosted Microsoft SharePoint .
Intermedia Exchange Hosting
Few Exchange hosts can match the experience and ancillary offerings of Intermedia .
The company has provided Exchange hosting since 2000 , and it presents a variety of auxiliary services ( some at extra cost ) , including antispam , mobile message integration , and SharePoint .
Intermedia uses HostPilot , a proprietary control panel , to guide you in setting up its services .
I like the way HostPilot keeps you on track for configuring Exchange through step - by - step directions .
Online help , including FAQs and getting - started videos , along with e-mail and telephone support , is readily available .
Completing the online configuration for ten users will probably take a couple of hours for an administrator to perform , though that depends on the options you select .
Though I like Intermedia 's Exchange hosting , you have many alternative providers to choose from .
If you 're satisfied with the service your Web host provides , see if the company also offers Exchange hosting ; at the very least , sticking with your Web host will simplify domain setup .
Hosted Exchange Costs
Intermedia offers a number of hosting plans , along with optional add - ons .
A Small Business Exchange plan for ten users ( including 40 GB total mailbox storage ) is $ 125 per month .
Antivirus , antispam , and SharePoint ( 50 MB storage ) are included in the monthly fee .
Each user receives a free download of Outlook 2007 .
Additional mailboxes with 1GB storage cost $ 12 per month .
Some additional services include mobile support , such as BlackBerry Enterprise Server ( $ 10 per user per month , plus $ 40 setup ) and ActiveSync for iPhone and Windows Mobile devices ( $ 3 per user per month ) .
MessageMirror e-mail archiving costs $ 49 per month for 2 GB storage plus a $ 100 one - time setup charge .
Is Hosted Exchange Right for You ?
If you want to outsource Exchange , you should consider several factors , such as cost , convenience , and flexibility .
For a small business without an IT professional on staff , the all - in cost of outsourcing Exchange can save thousands in comparison with the alternative of purchasing hardware , licensing software , and hiring someone -- even a consultant -- to manage it all .
Moreover , hosting providers can easily upscale your Exchange server as your business grows ( or downsize it if your business shrinks ) without interrupting your service .
Though outsourcing Exchange is convenient , it comes at the potential loss of some flexibility in configuring it and installing add - ons appropriate for your business requirements .
A business with more than 100 users , particularly one with more - complex requirements , may find that providing Exchange services through internal resources makes more sense .

History Buried in the Rubble Cologne Archive Building Collapses
The building housing Cologne 's municipal archive collapsed on Tuesday , bringing parts of some surrounding structures down with it .
At least two people are missing .
Some of the documents housed in the archive date back to the year 922 .
( CNN ) -- Calling it a mission that may fundamentally change humanity 's view of itself , NASA on Friday launched a telescope that will search our corner of the Milky Way galaxy for Earth - like planets .
This image shows part of the Milky Way region of the sky where the Kepler spacecraft will be pointing .
The Kepler spacecraft blasted into space on top of a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
" This is a historical mission .
It 's not just a science mission , " NASA Associate Administrator Ed Weiler said during a prelaunch news conference .
" It really attacks some very basic human questions that have been part of our genetic code since that first man or woman looked up in the sky and asked the question :
Are we alone ? "
Watch iReport video of launch
Kepler contains a special telescope that will stare at 100,000 stars in the Cygnus - Lyra region of the Milky Way for more than three years as it trails Earth 's orbit around the Sun .
The spacecraft will look for tiny dips in a star 's brightness , which can mean an orbiting planet is passing in front of it -- an event called a transit .
Watch how astronomers will try to find ' Earths ' »
The instrument is so precise that it can register changes in brightness of 20 parts per million in stars that are thousands of light years away .
" Being able to make that kind of a sensitive measurement over a very large number of stars was extremely challenging , " Kepler project manager James Fanson said .
" So we 're very proud of the vehicle we have built .
This is a crowning achievement for NASA and a monumental step in our search for other worlds around other stars . "
See what the telescope looks like and which part of the galaxy it will monitor »
Are we alone ?
The $ 600 million mission is named after Johannes Kepler , a 17th - century German astronomer who was the first to correctly explain planetary motion .
His discoveries combined with modern technology may soon help to answer whether we are alone in the universe or whether Earth - like worlds inhabited by some type of life are common .
" We wo n't find E.T. , but we might find E.T. 's home , " said William Borucki , science principal investigator for the Kepler mission .
About 330 " exoplanets " -- those circling sun-like stars outside the solar system -- have been discovered since the first was confirmed in 1995 .
Most are gas giants like Jupiter , but some have been classified as " super earths , " or worlds several times the mass of our planet , said Alan Boss , an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution who serves on the Kepler Science Council .
They are too hot to support life , he added , calling them " steam worlds . "
Europe 's COROT space telescope caused a stir last month when it spotted the smallest terrestrial exoplanet ever found .
With a diameter less than twice that of Earth , the planet orbits very close to its star and has temperatures up to 1,500° Celsius ( more than 2,700° Fahrenheit ) , according to the European Space Agency .
It may be rocky and covered in lava .
Scientists have marveled how strange some of the alien worlds are .
" The density of these planets has been astounding , " Borucki said .
" We 're finding planets that float like a piece of foam on water , [ with ] very , very low densities .
We 're finding some planets where the densities are heavier than that of lead . "
The Kepler telescope , however , is seeking something much more familiar : Earth - like planets with rocky surfaces , orbiting in their stars ' habitable , or " Goldilocks , " zones -- not too hot or too cold , but just right for liquid water to exist .
Watch a NASA scientist explain where life could exist »
Quest for a ' pale blue dot '
Once Kepler spots a planet , scientists will be able to calculate its size , mass , orbital period , distance from star and surface temperature , Boss said .
He called the mission a " step one " that will tell astronomers how hard it is to find nearby habitable worlds .
" Once we know how many there really are ... then NASA will be able to build space telescopes that can actually go out and take a picture of that nearby ' Earth ' and measure the elements and compounds in its atmosphere of the planet and give us some hint as to whether or not it 's got life , " Boss said .
Boss believes that there may be 100 billion Earth - like planets in the Milky Way , or one for every sun - type star in the galaxy .
He said scientists should know by 2013 -- the end of Kepler 's mission -- whether life in the universe could be widespread .
The 20 - year goal is to someday take a picture of a pale blue dot orbiting a nearby star , said Debra Fischer , an astronomy professor at San Francisco State University , during a NASA news conference .
Boss called it a potentially unprecedented time of discovery for scientists .
" Sometimes , people call this the golden age of astronomy .
I think it 's more like the platinum age of astronomy .
It 's beyond gold , " Boss said .

MI cop shot unarmed , 20 - year - old marijuana activist Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 16 , 2009
Print This Email
This A 20 - year - old university student in Michigan is hospitalized and in serious condition after police shot the man Wednesday while serving a drug warrant .
He was unarmed , investigators said .
Coming through an apartment 's back door , an Ottawa County deputy allegedly shined a flashlight into the student 's face , causing him to raise his right hand in front of his eyes .
The officer , whose name was not released , fired a single bullet into Derek Copp 's chest .
The 20 - year - old Grand Valley State University student , who survived the shooting , said he had no idea the man was an officer .
" He never even had a chance to even see who was coming at him , with a bright flashlight in his face , " said Sheryl Copp , Derek 's mother , in a 24 Hour News 8 report .
" He had no clue .
He heard someone knock on his door , and he had no clue . "
Copp 's parents insist their son is not a drug dealer .
However , he appears to be a marijuana activist , stating on his facebook page he likes to " SMOKA DA BOLSKI " ( smoke a ' bowl ' ) and on his YouTube page , in a video titled ' Hippie Lunchtime Hour , ' he makes references to baking marijuana - infused brownies .
In another , he plays the fictional role of an acid dealer whose friend goes on a psychedelic journey through cliché colors .
Copp 's parents were not notified of the shooting by police , reported CelebStoner .
They allegedly found out six hours later .
The officer is on paid administrative leave .
Police have not said whether they found any drugs in Copp 's apartment .
Monday , a group of about 25 protesters gathered outside the Ottawa County Sheriff 's Department holding signs which read , " Do n't shoot , I 'm unarmed " and " Why did you shoot my friend ? "
" I want to know what brought the Enforcement Team to Derek 's apartment and why a firearm was discharged , " wrote University President Thomas Haas in a Monday e-mail sent to police and student activists .
" The fact that this incident took place off - campus diminishes neither my interest nor my concern , " he said in a report by MLive.com .
Jim DeVries with the Police Officers Association of Michigan " said the deputy is required by contract to give a statement in any internal sheriff 's department investigation that could impact his job , but it cannot be used by prosecutors for any criminal charges , " reported MLive.com .
" So far , no internal statement has been requested . "
" DeVries said it is not unusual for a union - represented officer to forgo speaking with investigators in a shooting incident and he does not think it gives an appearance of wrongdoing . "
" Derek Copp 's family , meantime , has hired Grand Rapids Attorney , Fred Dilley , " reported ABC WZZM 13 .
" In a statement , he says , ' We have some very important questions about what appears to be some shocking police activity . '
Dilley says his client is making a satisfactory , but guarded recovery .
The bullet tore through his upper right lung and liver and damaged two ribs .
" As for the protesters , their voices were heard by the Ottawa County Sheriff 's Department .
After a brief meeting , they decided to sit down and discuss the issue as soon as the investigation is complete . "
" Organizers said the next major event planned is a march 1 p.m. Friday in Grand Rapids , " reported Holland Sentinel .
National media has been absent on the case and local media has focused on ' irrelevancies , ' noted Michigan Messenger 's Ed Brayton .
" The Grand Rapids Press took a look at Copps Facebook page and found that it had ' drug references , ' as though that had some bearing on whether he should have been shot or not .
They found out that the student had expressed ' his advocacy and interest in reforming marijuana laws ' and that he had declared himself to be a ' left wing hippie peace - keeping liberal . '
" But wait , there s more .
He had advocated the passage of last falls proposal to legalize medical marijuana in Michigan .
And he liked the movie Drugstore Cowboy , as well as - gasp ! - Martin Scorcese movies .
Worst of all , he had quoted Grateful Dead lyrics .
" This strikes me as the drug war equivalent of asking what a rape victim was wearing . "
Copp reportedly wants to be a filmmaker and said he may produce work based on the shooting .

The first demonstration flight using a biofuel primarily refined from the energy crop camelina was conducted by Japan Airlines ( JAL ) last week .
It was also the first demo flight using a combination of three sustainable biofuel feedstocks — camelina ( 84 % ) , jatropha ( less than 16 % ) , and algae ( less than 1 % ) — as well as the first one using Pratt & Whitney engines .
The one and half - hour demo flight using a JAL - owned Boeing 747-300 aircraft , carrying no passengers or payload , took off from Haneda Airport , Tokyo at 11:50 am .
No modifications to the aircraft or engine were required for biofuel , which is a direct replacement for petroleum - based fuel .
A blend of 50 % biofuel ( synthetic paraffinic kerosene , SPK ) and 50 % traditional Jet - A jet ( kerosene ) fuel was tested in the No.3 engine ( middle right ) , one of the aircraft ’s four Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines .
The cockpit crew checked the engine ’s performance during normal and non-normal flight operations , which included quick accelerations and decelerations , and engine shutdown and restart .
A ground - based preflight test was conducted the day before the flight to ensure that the No. 3 engine functioned normally using the biofuel / traditional Jet - A fuel blend .
Team members from Boeing , Japan Airlines , and Pratt & Whitney will analyze the engine data to determine if equivalent engine performance was seen from the biofuel blend compared to typical Jet A fuel .
The tests are scheduled to take several weeks .
The fuel for the JAL demo flight was successfully converted from plant - based crude oil to SPK , then blended with typical jet fuel by Honeywell ’s UOP , a refining technology developer , using proprietary hydro - processing technology .
Subsequent laboratory testing by Boeing , UOP , and several independent laboratories verified the biofuel met the industry criteria for jet fuel performance .
Sustainable Oils , Inc. sourced the camelina used in the JAL demo flight .
Terasol Energy sourced and provided the jatropha oil , and the algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy .
Nikki Universal , a joint venture of UOP and JGC , supplied the biofuel used in the flight , which had been produced in the US by UOP .
Also known as gold - of - pleasure or false flax , camelina is good candidate for a sustainable biofuel source , given its high oil content and ability to grow in rotation with wheat and other cereal crops .
The crop is mostly grown in more moderate climates such as the northern plains of the US and Canada , and originally hails from northern Europe and Central Asia .
Test plots are also underway in Malaysia , South Korea , Ukraine and Latvia .
NEW DELHI : Inflation for the week ended March 7 fell to an all time low of 0.44 % .
The sharp fall in inflation was due to several factors including easing prices of food articles and fuel items along with a high base effect .
Annual inflation as measured by Wholesale Price Index ( WPI ) was at 2.42 % in the week before and at 7.78 % in the corresponding week last year .
The inflation for food articles eased considerably to 7.34 % .
It had touched a 10 - year high of 11.64 % in the beginning of the year .
Prices of food articles for the week ended March 7 touched the lowest since the beginning of the year .
The sharp fall in annual inflation as measured by fuel index was due to fall in prices of jet fuel and electricity for agriculture each of which fell by 8 % .
The fuel prices are currently witnessing negative inflation to the range of 6 % and are expected to dip further into negative territory .
The higher base effect along with low demand in the economy is expected to keep inflation in negative territory for 5 to 6 months . "
Inflation will turn negative starting from April and will remain so until the end of 2009 , " said Tushar Poddar , an economist with Goldman Sachs Inc. in Mumbai .
" We expect the Reserve Bank to ease liquidity " to support growth .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said this week India should rely more on monetary policy to support the economy as high public debt makes fiscal efforts difficult .
Retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index for industrial workers has moved up to 10.45 % in January , the highest since December 1998 .
The consumer - price index for farm workers increased 11.62 % in January from a year earlier , following an 11.14 % in December .
The central bank said this month consumer prices will decline after a lag , without specifying a time frame .
The commerce ministry today revised the rate for the week to Jan. 10 to 5.46 percent from 5.60 % .

WASHINGTON  President Obama on Saturday described his expansive budget proposal as “ a threat to the status quo in Washington ” and cast himself as a populist crusader willing to do battle with special interests to expand health care , curb pollution and improve education .
“ I did n’t come here to do the same thing we ’ve been doing or to take small steps forward , ” Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address .
“ I came to provide the sweeping change that this country demanded when it went to the polls in November .
That is the change this budget starts to make , and that is the change I ’ll be fighting for in the weeks ahead . ”
The address hinted at the strategy the White House intends to employ to push for the spending plan released last week , a return to a more traditional Democratic approach of positioning the party as fighting against the rich and powerful .
In Mr. Obama ’s telling , he is taking on entrenched interests in the form of banks , insurance companies , large agribusinesses , oil and gas companies and others .
Beyond the $ 3.6 trillion budget for the 2010 fiscal year , the president ’s spending plan outlines an array of ambitious initiatives for the next several years that collectively would transform American society .
He wants to extend health coverage to the more than 40 million uninsured , revamp industry so that it stops producing so many emissions that cause climate change , develop alternative energy sources and invest billions of dollars more in education .
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russia expressed interest in using Cuban airfields during patrol missions of its strategic bombers , Russia 's Interfax news agency reported
" There are four or five airfields in Cuba with 4,000 - meter - long runways , which absolutely suit us , " Maj. Gen. Anatoly Zhikharev told Interfax .
Zhikharev , who is the chief of staff of the Russian Air Force 's long - range aviation , said , " If the two chiefs of state display such a political will , we are ready to fly there . "
Zhikharev also told Interfax that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has offered a military airfield on La Orchila island as a temporary base for Russian strategic bombers .
" If a relevant political decision is made , this is possible , " he said , according to Interfax .
Zhikharev said he visited La Orchila in 2008 and can confirm that with minor reconstruction , the airfield owned by a local naval base can accept fully - loaded Russian strategic bombers .

Nine years later , Linus Torvalds announced to comp.os. minix : " I 'm doing a ( free ) operating system ( just a hobby , wo n't be big and professional like GNU ) for 386 ( 486 ) AT clones . "
The free software movement came into being in September 1983 , although Stallman did n't announce the GNU project on Usenet until January 1984 , with the words : " Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix - compatible software system called GNU ( for Gnu 's Not Unix ) , and give it away free to everyone who can use it .
Contributions of time , money , programs and equipment are greatly needed . "
It is an important distinction , and one that Stallman has always been keen to make .
Free software has a very different set of values to open source .
Yet all free software can be described as " open source " , and most open source software can be described as " free software " - which is why the two movements are often treated as one .
Richard Stallman , the one true begetter of GNU , the free software movement and the General Public License , ( or GPL , the most popular licensing framework for free and open source software ) , once told an audience : " Unlike some of you , I am not an open source developer , I am an activist in the free software movement . "
The Linux kernel , initiated by Torvalds and licensed under the GPL , became the kernel of the GNU operating system , or as Stallman defines it : " There is no operating system called Linux .
The OS called Linux is GNU .
Linux is a program - a kernel .
A kernel is one part of an OS , the lowest level program in the OS that keeps track of other programs running , and apportions memory and processor time among them . "
Free Software , Free Society
In the introduction to ' Free Software , Free Society ' , a collection of Stallman 's essays and lectures , Lawrence Lessig - professor of law at Stanford University , political activist , and co-creator of the concept of Creative Commons - declares : " Every generation has its philosopher - a writer or artist who captures the imagination of a time .
Sometimes these philosophers are recognized as such ; often it takes generations before the connection is made real .
" But recognized or not , a time gets marked by the people who speak its ideals , whether in the whisper of a poem , or the blast of a political movement .
Our generation has a philosopher .
He is not an artist , or a professional writer .
He is a programmer . "
He later adds : " The aim of Stallman 's ' free software movement ' is to make as much code as it can transparent , and subject to change , by rendering it free .
The mechanism of this rendering is an extraordinarily clever device called ' copyleft ' implemented through a license called GPL .
Using the power of copyright law , ' free software ' not only assures that it remains open , and subject to change , but that other software that takes and uses ' free software ' ( and that technically counts as a ' derivative work ' ) must also itself be free .
" If you use and adapt a free software program , and then release that adapted version to the public , the released version must be as free as the version it was adapted from .
It must , or the law of copyright will be violated . "
The meaning and definition of free software was refined over a number of years , culminating in the creation of the second version of the GPL in June 1991 , which represented a synthesis of Stallman 's philosophy .
Free software " refers to four kinds of freedom for the users of the software " , perhaps echoing the four freedoms Franklin D. Roosevelt defined as the requisite for a free society in 1941 .
The four kinds of freedom were :
- The freedom to run the program , for any purpose .
- The freedom to study how the program works , and adapt it to your needs .
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor .
- The freedom to improve the program , and release your improvements ( and modified versions in general ) to the public , so that the whole community benefits . "
Free software became defined as a movement with an ethic and a social purpose , and embodies many of the characteristics that might typify a social or political movement .
WASHINGTON -- A $ 14 trillion economy hangs by a thread composed of ( a ) a comically cynical , pitchfork - wielding Congress , ( b ) a hopelessly understaffed , stumbling Obama administration , and ( c ) $ 165 million .
That 's $ 165 million in bonus money handed out to AIG debt manipulators who may be the only ones who know how to defuse the bomb they themselves built .
Now , in the scheme of things , $ 165 million is a rounding error .
It amounts to less than 1/18,500 of the $ 3.1 trillion federal budget .
It 's less than one - tenth of 1 percent of the bailout money given to AIG alone .
If Bill Gates were to pay these AIG bonuses every year for the next 100 years , he 'd still be left with more than half his personal fortune .
For this we are going to poison the well for any further financial rescues , face the prospect of letting AIG go under ( which would make the Lehman Brothers collapse look trivial ) and risk a run on the entire world financial system ?
And there is such a thing as law .
The way to break a contract legally is Chapter 11 .
Short of that , a contract is a contract .
The AIG bonuses were agreed to before the government takeover and are perfectly legal .
Is the rule now that when public anger is kindled , Congress summarily cancels contracts ?
Even worse are the clever schemes now being cooked up in Congress to retrieve the money by means of some retroactive confiscatory tax .
The common law is pretty clear about the impermissibility of ex post facto legislation and bills of attainder .
They also happen to be specifically prohibited by the Constitution .
We 're going to overturn that for $ 165 million ?
Nor has the president behaved much better .
He too has been out there trying to lead the mob .
But it 's a losing game .
His own congressional Democrats will out - demagogue him and heap the blame on the hapless Timothy Geithner .
Geithner has been particularly maladroit in handling this issue .
But the reason he did n't give the bonuses much attention is because he 's got far better things to do -- namely , work out a rescue plan for a dysfunctional credit system that is holding back any chance of recovery
It is time for the president to state the obvious :
This recession is not caused by excessive executive compensation in government - controlled companies .
The economy has been sinking because of a lack of credit , stemming from a general lack of confidence , stemming from the lack of a plan to detoxify the major lending institutions , mainly the banks , which , to paraphrase Willie Sutton , is where the money used to be .
Obama has been strangely passive about this single greatest threat to the country .
In his address to Congress and his budget , he 's been far more interested in his grand program for reshaping the American social contract in health care , energy and education .
Obama delegates to Geithner plans for a bailout -- and Geithner ( thus far ) delivers nothing .
Obama delegates to Nancy Pelosi and her congressional grandees the writing of all things fiscal -- and gets a $ 787 billion stimulus package that is a wish list of liberal social spending , followed by a $ 410 billion omnibus spending bill festooned with pork and political paybacks .
That bill , we now discover , contains , among other depth charges , a Teamster - supported provision inserted by Sen.
Byron Dorgan that terminates a Bush - era demonstration project to allow some Mexican trucks onto American highways , as required under NAFTA .
If you thought the AIG hysteria was a display of populist cynicism directed at a relative triviality , consider this :
There are more than 6.5 million trucks in the United States .
The program Congress terminated allowed 97 Mexican trucks to roam among them .
Ninety - seven !
Shutting them out not only undermines NAFTA .
It caused Mexico to retaliate with tariffs on 90 goods affecting $ 2.4 billion in U.S. trade coming out of 40 states .
The very last thing we need now is American protectionism .
It is guaranteed to start a world trade war .
A deeply wounded world economy needs two things to recover : ( 1 ) vigorous U.S. government action to loosen credit by detoxifying the zombie banks and insolvent insurers , and ( 2 ) avoidance of a trade war .
Free trade is the one area where the world indisputably turns to Washington for leadership .
What does it see ?
Grandstanding , parochialism , petty payoffs to truckers and a rush to mindless populism .
Over what ?
Over 97 Mexican trucks -- and bonus money that comes to what the Yankees are paying for CC Sabathia 's left arm .

Despite Uhura 's mastery of communications , I have to admit the dialog is somewhat wooden in places -- a flaw of much Star Trek !
I could 've done with a little less vamping from Chase Masterson ( Leeta from DS9 , having a ball playing an Orion slave girl ) .
It 's also more violent than old Trek , warranting a PG - 13 rating , and there are a few instances when the main characters do n't react to redshirt or minor character deaths as much as I 'd expect .
Those glitches aside , the acting is good to excellent .
Alan Ruck reprises his role as the good - hearted , unlucky Captain Harrington , who commanded the Enterprise B in Star Trek : Generations .
( There 's an insider 's joke in Of Gods and Men : he says ruefully that what happened the day Kirk died would probably have happened no matter who was in the captain 's chair .
It 's sad but true , since most of us have forgotten him ! )
Tim Russ ( Tuvok ) is as perfect a Vulcan as ever , and I 'm glad he found time to act as well as direct .
The few non-Trek actors hold their own with the regulars .
Garrett Wang ( Harry Kim ) seems to be taking Sinister 101 lessons from Walter Koenig to shake off his boy scout persona .
J.G. Hertzler plays yet another Klingon with his usual aplomb ( though he seems to be fighting his fangs ) .
Lawrence Montaigne ( Stonn , Spock 's rival in " Amok Time " ) is intriguingly good : I wish he'd had more screentime .
( Yes , T'pring shows up too ) .
There 's touching cameos by Grace Lee Whitney reprising Janice Rand and Cirroc Lofton ( Jake Sisko ) as Uhura 's son -- and the size of a linebacker !
Finally , Ethan Phillips ( Neelix ) helps launch the tale , playing an anonymous nebbish who ought to be wearing a red shirt .
The camera work is steadicam ( an oxymoron ) , which some viewers have complained about .
It 's the technique used in the new Battlestar Galactica series .
I do n't mind it .
The special effects , especially the space sequences , blow away the old series and some of TNG .
I 'm dodging around the most important topic -- the PLOT !
because I 'm trying to avoid spoilers .
But , in short , this Star Trek fanfiction story is a sequel to the classic
Trek episode , " Charlie X . "
Here 's a one - minute trailer for that fan favorite :
Exclusive to STR
March 25 , 2009
Most people are very upset that executives at American International Group ( AIG ) are continuing to receive over a hundred million tax dollars in bonuses .
Taxpayers can't understand why the executives , who are either painfully incompetent or are crooks and cheats , should receive bonuses for running a company into the ground .
Most of these upset people , not the grandstanding politicians who are only trying to win political points by their meaningless rhetoric ( a provision could have been put in the terms of TARP that would have prevented this further raping of the taxpayers , but the politicians dropped it ) , are very unfamiliar with Wall Street and finance .
They probably have only a 401 ( k ) that they thought would take care of them in their retirement .
As they see their relatively small , but from their individual perspective , huge , savings being dramatically reduced , they can't justify rewarding the financial ' experts ' and ' professionals ' who are responsible for their devastating economic losses .
Especially , they can't see rewarding the business crooks with cash that the political crooks took from them through taxation .
And to add insult to injury , it turns out the Barack ' Change You Can Believe In ' Obama administration is responsible for the change in the language of the bill that allowed these grotesque and unwarranted bonuses to be paid !
These Americans who are now the victims of international banking , Wall Street and the government need to be honest with themselves .
They need to ask themselves why they 've tolerated such a corrupt and deadly government for so long .
Why are they content to vote one gang of cheats into office and then replace those cheats in the next election with cheats from a political party of a different name but with the same corrupt content ?
Instead of playing the game sanctioned by the powers that be of voting Democrat or Republican , Americans should be uniting to protect what is left of their rights and to secure new ones .
This apathy on the part of the average American was addressed by Thomas Jefferson when he wrote concerning Americans , ' They will forget ' ( about their rights ) ' themselves but in the sole faculty of making money , and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights . '
Unfortunately , it looks like Jefferson was correct .
Americans have put income and career far above freedom and liberty and are now paying the price .
Claude - Anne Lopez , a historian and expert on Benjamin Franklin and the editor of Yale University 's The Papers of Benjamin Franklin , said that in Ben Franklin 's day , the American dream was not owning a house with a two car garage , two luxury cars and a microwave ; it was truth , justice and liberty .
It was true progress .
Americans have indeed gone from wanting principles to principally wanting material things .
To demonstrate this sad current condition , ask yourself how many people you know who would sacrifice their comfort , their homes , their careers and income and their very lives for an ideal ?
This is exactly what America 's founders did .
Today , through government education and the established media , most people think that being patriotic is what America 's founders were all about .
Of course , when you have a corrupt government , being ' patriotic ' means you support that corrupt government and all the evil that it does .
Webster 's Desk Dictionary defines patriot as : 'a person who loves , supports , and defends his or her country . '
Is that what George Washington and the other founders were doing , defending their country ?
Actually , they were not only not defending their country , they were attacking their country !
At the time , the recognized government was Great Britain .
By waging war against Britain , America 's founders were anything but patriots by the standard definition !
The standard definition of patriotism played no part in the desires of America 's founders .
What they were after was progress .
Only progress can bring about real positive change .
Renaissance men like Thomas Jefferson knew , from observing other areas of life such as science and religion , that a conservative worldview is a stagnant worldview and an enemy to progress .
Had , for example , history 's heroes like Galileo been content to adhere to the conservative teachings of the church , mankind would not have made progress in both fields of science and religion .
Likewise , the founders knew true progress could not be achieved by clinging to the established government .
Progress demanded revolution .
The cost of progress is high .
America 's founders risked everything they had to wage war against their government and to create a more progressive republic .
Many of our founders were wealthy , established leaders in society .
Ben Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , and George Washington were all very well off and financially secure in 1776 .
By today 's greed - based standards , they'd be considered to be on the lunatic fringe .
They had everything they needed under the established system , yet they wanted to destroy that system and replace it with a progressive one , the benefits of which touched the lives of many more people .
By waging war against the government , they not only risked losing all of their income and wealth , they risked losing their very lives .
If they failed , they would at best be hung as traitors to the government ; at worst , they would be hung until close to death and then drawn and quartered .
Not many people in today 's money and material - driven society would choose all those risks over material comfort , but thankfully , the Founders did .
It was n't only the famous people like Jefferson , Washington , Adams , etc. , who paid a very high price for liberty and its progress .
Thousands of new Americans paid a very heavy price for their ideals and desire to make a better world .
And it was n't just the soldiers and Minutemen who paid .
Living in today 's society , it 's difficult to realize the support women of that time gave to the cause of freedom and progress .
One moving example is found in the writings of a Mrs. Davis , who was the wife of a Minuteman by the name of Isaac Davis .
Her words can be found in the book The Revolutionary War , written by Bart McDowell for the National Geographic Society .
Isaac took part in the fight against British troops , who were ordered to destroy the weapons the citizens and anti-government rebels had at Concord , Massachusetts .
This was a case of government - sponsored gun control , which led to the first time rebels fired on government troops .
Mrs. Davis wrote , ' Isaac Davis was my husband .
He was then thirty years of age .
We had four children ; the youngest about fifteen months old .
They were all unwell when he left me , in the morning ; some of them with the canker - rash .
' The alarm was given early in the morning , and my husband lost no time in making ready to go to Concord with his company .
My husband said but little that morning .
He seemed serious and thoughtful ; but never seemed to hesitate .
He only said , ' Take good care of the children , ' and was soon out of sight .
' In the afternoon he was brought home a corpse .
He was placed in my bedroom till the funeral .'
What an exceptional woman !
She loved the ideals of liberty and progress so much , she was willing to sacrifice her family life for them .
She and her husband were capable of seeing the big picture and would not let anything stand in their way that would prevent them from fighting for it .
To me , this is true patriotism of the highest order , and well placed .
It was not placed in the government , as people tend to do today .
Instead , it was placed where it belongs and can do the most good -- in ideals and in principles , not in government .
Women on the other end of the financial spectrum were just as notable and important in seeing a successful progressive march of society .
Could you imagine a wealthy woman today who marries a man whose wealth and assets are far below her own , actively supporting her new husband in his revolutionary desires and actions that put in jeopardy not only his material wealth , but her much greater level of material wealth ?
That is exactly what Martha Washington did .
Not only did she have to be concerned for their wealth , she had to be concerned for her children .
Going well above and beyond what most people would have done , she took an active part in supporting the revolution every winter .
She would go to the Army 's winter camp and help take care of the troops medically as well as giving their morale a boost .
Thomas Jefferson 's wife Martha was also a devoted supporter of the revolutionary cause .
When Jefferson was called to the Continental Congress in 1776 , Martha was sick in bed at Monticello .
She did n't pressure him to shirk his duties to the revolution .
She did n't attack him for putting their home and family at risk by fighting against the government .
She supported him and the cause , even when it was personally detrimental and demanding .
These courageous women are shining examples of living and giving for the ideals of liberty we can all learn from .

First Detection of Ebola Reston Virus in Pigs
First Detection of Ebola Reston Virus in Pigs
FAO / OIE / WHO offer assistance to the Philippines
MANILA 23 December 2008 – Following the detection of the Ebola Reston virus in pigs in the Philippines , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) that the government of the Philippines has requested the three agencies send an expert mission to work with human and animal health experts in the Philippines to further investigate the situation .
An increase in pig mortality on swine farms in the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Bulacan in 2007 and 2008 prompted the Government of the Philippines to initiate laboratory investigations .
Samples taken from ill pigs in May , June and September 2008 were sent to international reference laboratories which confirmed in late October that the pigs were infected with a highly virulent strain of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( PRRS ) as well as the Ebola - Reston virus .
Although co-infection in pigs is not unusual , this is the first time globally that an Ebola - Reston virus has been isolated in swine .
It is not , however , the first time that the Ebola - Reston virus has been found in the Philippines : it was found in monkeys from the Philippines in outbreaks that occurred in 1989 - 1990 , 1992 , and 1996 .
The Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family ( filovirus ) and is comprised of five distinct species : Zaïre , Sudan , Côte d’Ivoire , Bundibugyo and Reston .
Zaïre , Sudan and Bundibugyo species have been associated with large Ebola hemorrhagic fever ( EHF ) outbreaks in Africa with high case fatality ratio ( 25–90 % ) while Côte d’Ivoire and Reston have not .
Reston species can infect humans but no serious illness or death in humans have been reported to date .
Since being informed of this event in late November , FAO , OIE and WHO have been making every effort to gain a better understanding of the situation and are working closely with the Philippines Government and local animal and human health experts .
The Department of Health of the Philippines has reported that initial laboratory tests on animal handlers and slaughterhouse workers who were thought to have come into contact with infected pigs were negative for Ebola Reston infection , and that additional testing is ongoing .
The Bureau of Animal Industry ( BAI ) of the Philippines Department of Agriculture has notified the OIE that all infected animals were destroyed and buried or burned , the infected premises and establishments have been disinfected and the affected areas are under strict quarantine and movement control .
Vaccination of swine against PRRS is ongoing in the Province of Bulacan .
PRRS is not transmissible to humans .
The planned joint FAO / OIE / WHO team will work with country counterparts to address , through field and laboratory investigation , important questions as to the source of the virus , its transmission , its virulence and its natural habitat , in order to provide appropriate guidance for animal and human health protection .
Until these questions can be answered , the FAO and WHO stressed the importance of carrying out basic good hygiene practices and food handling measures .
Ebola viruses are normally transmitted via contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected animal or person .
In all situations , even in the absence of identified risks , meat handling and preparation should be done in a clean environment ( table top , utensils , knives ) and meat handlers should follow good personal hygiene practices ( e.g. clean hands , clean protective clothing ) .
In general , hands should be regularly washed while handling raw meat .
Pork from healthy pigs is safe to eat as long as either the fresh meat is cooked properly ( i.e. 70 °C in all part of the food , so that there is no pink meat and the juices run clear ) , or , in the case of uncooked processed pork , national safety standards have been met during production , processing and distribution .
Meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead should not be eaten and should not enter the food chain or be given to other animals .
Ill animals should be reported to the competent authorities and proper hygiene precautions and protection should be taken when destroying and disposing of sick or dead pigs .
The Philippines Department of Agriculture has advised the Philippine public to buy its meat only from National Meat Inspection Services certified sources .
As a general rule , proper hygiene and precautionary measures ( wearing gloves , goggles and protective clothing ) should also be exercised when slaughtering or butchering pigs .
This applies both to industrial and home - slaughtering of pigs .
Children and those not involved in the process of slaughtering should be kept away .

The newspaper said the lawsuit accuses school administrators of " permitting and sanctioning an atmosphere that is hostile to female , lesbian , bisexual , gay and transgender students in general , and has led to despicable threats of violence against one student in particular . "
Last month , the school canceled an edited version of the rock opera whose gay characters use drugs and battle AIDS .
The newspaper noted that the school drama instructor said his principal killed the play because of its gay characters , but the principal says otherwise .

— 15 Practical Linux Find Command Examples
Photo courtesy of Qole Pejorian
Apart from the basic operation of looking for files under a directory structure , you can also perform several practical operations using find command that will make your command line journey easy .
In this article , let us review 15 practical examples of Linux find command that will be very useful to both newbies and experts .
First , create the following sample empty files under your home directory to try some of the find command examples mentioned below .
# vim create_sample_files.sh touch MybashProgram.sh touch mycprogram.c touch MyCProgram.c touch Program .c mkdir backup cd backup touch MybashProgram.sh touch mycprogram .c touch MyCProgram.c touch Program.c # chmod +x create_sample_files.sh # ./create_sample_files.sh # ls -R . : backup MybashProgram.sh MyCProgram.c create_sample_files.sh mycprogram.c Program.c ./ backup : MybashProgram.sh mycprogram.c MyCProgram.c Program.c
1. Find Files Using Name
This is a basic usage of the find command .
This example finds all files with name — MyCProgram.c in the current directory and all its sub-directories .
# find - name " MyCProgram.c " ./ backup/MyCProgram.c ./MyCProgram.c
2. Find Files Using Name and Ignoring Case
This is a basic usage of the find command .
This example finds all files with name — MyCProgram.c ( ignoring the case ) in the current directory and all its sub-directories .
# find - iname " MyCProgram.c " ./mycprogram.c ./backup/mycprogram.c ./backup/MyCProgram.c ./MyCProgram.c
3. Limit Search To Specific Directory Level Using mindepth and maxdepth
Find the passwd file under all sub - directories starting from root directory .
# find / - name passwd ./usr/share/doc/nss_ldap-253/pam.d/passwd ./usr/bin/passwd
./etc/pam.d/ passwd
./etc/passwd
Find the passwd file under root and one level down .
( i.e root — level 1 , and one sub - directory — level 2 )
# find - maxdepth 2 - name passwd ./ etc / passwd
Find the passwd file under root and two levels down .
( i.e root — level 1 , and two sub - directories — level 2 and 3 )
# find / - maxdepth 3 - name passwd ./usr/bin/ passwd
./etc/pam.d/ passwd
./etc/ passwd
Find the password file between sub - directory level 2 and 4 .
# find - mindepth 3 - maxdepth 5 - name passwd ./usr/bin/ passwd ./etc/pam.d/passwd
4. Executing Commands on the Files Found by the Find Command .
In the example below , the find command calculates the md5sum of all the files with the name MyCProgram .c ( ignoring case ) .
{} is replaced by the current file name .
# find - iname " MyCProgram.c " - exec md5sum {} \ ; d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e ./mycprogram.c d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e ./backup/mycprogram.c
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e ./backup/MyCProgram.c
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e ./MyCProgram.c
5 . Inverting the match .
Shows the files or directories whose name are not MyCProgram .c . Since the maxdepth is 1 , this will look only under current directory .
# find - maxdepth 1 - not - iname " MyCProgram.c " .
./ MybashProgram.sh ./create_sample_files.sh ./backup ./Program.c
6. Finding Files by its inode Number .
Every file has an unique inode number , using that we can identify that file .
Create two files with similar name .
i.e one file with a space at the end .
# touch " test - file - name " # touch " test - file - name " [ Note :
There is a space at the end ] # ls - 1 test * test - file - name test - file - name
From the ls output , you cannot identify which file has the space at the end .
Using option - i , you can view the inode number of the file , which will be different for these two files .
# ls -i1 test * 16187429 test- file - name 16187430 test-file-name
You can specify inode number on a find command as shown below .
In this example , find command renames a file using the inode number .
# find - inum 16187430 - exec mv {} new - test - file - name \ ; # ls -i1 * test * 16187430 new-test-file-name 16187429 test-file-name
You can use this technique when you want to do some operation with the files which are named poorly as shown in the example below .
For example , the file with name — file ?. txt has a special character in it .
If you try to execute “ rm file ?. txt ” , all the following three files will get removed .
So , follow the steps below to delete only the “ file ?. txt ” file .
# ls file1.txt file2.txt file ?.
txt
Find the inode numbers of each file .
# ls -i1 804178 file1.txt 804179 file2.txt 804180 file?.txt
Use the inode number to remove the file that had special character in it as shown below .
# find - inum 804180 - exec rm {} \ ; # ls file1. txt file2.txt [ Note :
The file with name " file ?.txt " is now removed ]
7 . Find file based on the File - Permissions
Following operations are possible .
Find files that match exact permission
Check whether the given permission matches , irrespective of other permission bits
Search by giving octal / symbolic representation
For this example , let us assume that the directory contains the following files .
Please note that the file - permissions on these files are different .
# ls -l total 0 - rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:31 all_for_all -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:30 everybody_read
---------- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:31 no_for_all -rw------- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:29 ordinary_file -rw-r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 others_can_also_read
----r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 others_can_only_read
Find files which has read permission to group .
Use the following command to find all files that are readable by the world in your home directory , irrespective of other permissions for that file .
# find .
- perm - g=r - type f -exec ls -l {} \ ; -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:30 ./everybody_read - rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:31 ./all_for_all
----r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 ./others_can_only_read -rw-r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 ./others_can_also_read
Find files which has read permission only to group .
# find .
- perm g=r - type f - exec ls -l {} \ ; ----r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 ./others_can_only_read
Find files which has read permission only to group [ search by octal ]
# find .
- perm 040 - type f -exec ls -l {} \ ; ----r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 ./others_can_only_read
8 . Find all empty files ( zero byte file ) in your home directory and its subdirectory
Most files of the following command output will be lock - files and place holders created by other applications .
# find ~ - empty
List all the empty files only in your home directory .
# find .
- maxdepth 1 -empty
List only the non-hidden empty files only in the current directory .
# find .
- maxdepth 1 - empty - not - name " . *"
9. Finding the Top 5 Big Files
The following command will display the top 5 largest file in the current directory and its subdirectory .
This may take a while to execute depending on the total number of files the command has to process .
# find .
- type f -exec ls -s {} \ ; | sort -n -r | head - 5
10 . Finding the Top 5 Small Files
Technique is same as finding the bigger files , but the only difference the sort is ascending order .
# find .
- type f -exec ls -s {} \ ; | sort -n | head - 5
In the above command , most probably you will get to see only the ZERO byte files ( empty files ) .
So , you can use the following command to list the smaller files other than the ZERO byte files .
# find .
- not - empty - type f - exec ls -s {} \ ; | sort -n | head - 5
11 . Find Files
Based on file - type using option - type
Find only the socket files .
# find .
- type s
Find all directories
# find .
- type d
Find only the normal files
# find .
- type f
Find all the hidden files
# find .
- type f - name " . *"
Find all the hidden directories
# find - type d - name " . * "
12 . Find files by comparing with the modification time of other file .
Show files which are modified after the specified file .
The following find command displays all the files that are created / modified after ordinary_file .
# ls - lrt total 0 -rw-r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 others_can_also_read
----r----- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:27 others_can_only_read -rw------- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:29 ordinary_file -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:30 everybody_read - rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2009-02-19 20:31 all_for_all
---------- 1 root root 0 2009 - 02-19 20:31 no_for_all # find - newer ordinary_file .
./everybody_read ./all_for_all ./no_for_all
13 . Find Files by Size
Using the - size option you can find files by size .
Find files bigger than the given size
# find ~ - size + 100M
Find files smaller than the given size
# find ~ - size - 100M
Find files that matches the exact given size
# find ~ - size 100M
Note : – means less than the give size , + means more than the given size , and no symbol means exact given size .
14 . Create Alias for Frequent Find Operations
If you find some thing as pretty useful , then you can make it as an alias .
And execute it whenever you want .
Remove the files named a.out frequently .
# alias rmao= " find .
- iname a.out - exec rm {} \ ; " # rmao
Remove the core files generated by c program .
# alias rmc=" find .
- iname core - exec rm {} \ ; " # rmc
15 . Remove big archive files using find command
The following command removes *.zip files that are over 100M .
# find / - type f - name *.zip - size +100 M - exec rm - i {} \ ; "
Remove all *. tar file that are over 100M using the alias rm100 m ( Remove 100M ) .
Use the similar concepts and create alias like rm1g , rm2g , rm5g to remove file size greater than 1G , 2G and 5G respectively .
# alias rm100 m = " find / - type f - name *. tar - size +100 M - exec rm - i {} \ ; " # alias rm1g = " find / - type f - name *. tar - size +1G - exec rm - i {} \ ; " # alias rm2g = " find / - type f - name *. tar - size + 2G - exec rm - i {} \ ; " # alias rm5g = " find / - type f - name *. tar - size +5G - exec rm - i {} \ ; " # rm100 m # rm1g # rm2g # rm5g

JFK assassination film hoax
The fast - forward mistakes
In 1963 , home video recorders did not exist .
The only people who could make videotapes were television studios .
Most news footage was taken on film ( and processed just like a photo film ) .
Hand - held video camcorders did n’t exist !
Today , we all know what happens when you fast - forward ( “ picture search ” ) a videotape : not only does everyone move quickly , but their actions are much too jerky .
When the forgers made the Zapruder film , they needed to use genuine film of the limousine and the people in it , to make it look realistic — they could n’t just get Warner Brothers to draw cartoons !
They cut and paste this genuine film into a new background film of Elm Street .
Some changes could be made .
They could cut people out and move them around a bit .
They could make copies of arms , legs and bodies , and stick them back together to make them perform actions that the real people never did .
They could also slow down or speed up any action .
You can slow things down by making several copies of each film frame , and changing the “ in - between ” copies a little bit so that everything moves smoothly .
Researchers think that this was done for JFK , after he emerges from the road sign .
He leans over and pulls his elbows up , so that his shirt cuffs appear to wipe his face , and then he just stays there until the fatal shot :
JFK ’s wife , Jackie Kennedy , seems to move quite normally .
She seems to have been pasted in at a fairly normal speed , coordinated with the actions of her husband .
You can also speed things up .
All you need to do is delete some of the frames !
When the speed - up rate is changing , you need to change some of the frames a little to make sure everything moves smoothly .
It takes skill to do it really well .
Eyewitnesses overwhelmingly reported that , during the assassination , the limousine braked suddenly and came to a stop , before accelerating away again .
Some people have also seen another film of the assassination — not yet seen by the public — which shows this stop very clearly .
But Zapruder ’s film does n’t show the limousine stopping at all !
It just keeps on driving down Elm Street the entire time .
The forgers needed to remove all evidence of the car stopping .
Not only would it have shown evidence of shots coming from the front , but people would also have asked why the Secret Service agents stopped the car when the President was clearly in danger .
It was very easy for the forgers to keep the car moving , by deleting more and more frames as it slowed down and stopped , and then less and less at it started off again .
But the four people in the front of the car — the two Secret Service agents in the front seats , and the Texas Governor and his wife behind them — gave the forgers many problems .
It was not worth the time and effort to make sure that their motion was perfect , like they had done with JFK and his wife .
These other four people would not be the focus of attention .
A quicker job of cutting and pasting would have to do for them .
When the film frames had been created , these four people seemed to move smoothly enough when looked at frame - by - frame , or in slow motion .
But when the film was projected at full speed , there were major problems : “ fast - forward ” mistakes !
We will look at some of these below .
The mistakes are so obvious that anyone at all looking at the film at full speed would have known that something was wrong with it !
To cover up the mistakes , the forgers , and those directing them , did three things :
1 . They made it look like Abraham Zapruder jiggled his camera around a lot when he was filming .
Whenever someone moves in a way that is too jerky , the whole ( pretend ) camera was made to jiggle .
This makes it impossible to follow the detail if it is being projected at full speed .
2 . They made sure that the moving film was not shown publicly .
It was 12 years before it was shown on TV !
3 . They made sure that the film frames published in November 1964 were black and white , and not great quality .
The next danger for the forgers , and those directing them , was that a film expert might “ stabilize ” the camera jiggles , frame by frame .
If this “ stabilized ” film was projected at full speed , the “ fast - forward ” mistakes would be obvious !
To avoid this danger , they made sure that any “ stabilized ” film was only ever shown in slow motion .
This is how it was shown on TV , in 1975 .
It is also how it was shown on a 1997 DVD and video release !
Control of the “ stabilized ” versions made sure that the mistakes stayed secret .
( For a couple of decades ! )
Using modern computers , it has been possible to stabilize the film and put it back together at full speed .
The mistakes are now obvious for everyone to see with their own two eyes .
You can view a stabilized version of the Zapruder film here on YouTube .
You can also download a higher - quality version of it ( you might need to right - click and Save As ) , that lets you move forward or backward frame - by - frame using QuickTime .
The clips shown below were originally created in 2003 , before YouTube , when computers had trouble showing large video clips full - speed .
These clips were created to run at the right speed by doubling up the frames .
This does not look as good as the full - speed video on YouTube .
We will look at the mistakes in the order that they appear in the film .
Some just look ridiculous ; others can actually be shown to be humanly impossible , or violate the laws of physics .
The first mistake you should look at is called “ Connally ’s Hat Trick ” .
The Governor of Texas , John Connally , was holding his hat in his hand .
According to the U.S. Government , he was hit by the “ magic bullet ” at the same time that JFK got hit in the throat — in other words , when the car is hidden by the sign .
This bullet supposedly broke his right wrist .
But after the car comes out from behind the sign , Connally does some sort of superhuman hat - flicking motion — with his broken wrist !
( It happens so fast that it almost ca n’t be seen in this clip — see the MPEG clip above if you really want to see it ! )
The second mistake occurs when Mrs. Connally snaps her head to the rear far too rapidly .
Just before she does , she turns her head to the front in a more realistic motion :
This might look fast , but compare it to the “ head - snaps ” of the Secret Service driver of the limousine :
These have been analyzed scientifically , and shown to be twice as fast as humanly possible , even for an athlete trying to do it as quickly as possible !
You might not think that doing something twice as fast as an athlete is all that big a deal .
But imagine running a mile in two minutes , or 100 meters in five seconds , or jumping twice as far , or twice as high , as everyone else in the long jump or high jump at the Olympics !
Not only that , but imagine that you managed to keep control of a car even with those dizzying forces on your brain !
( Snapping your head twice as fast means the dizzying forces are four times as big ! )
Now , as you looked at that last clip , you might have noticed some other weird things .
The most obvious is that , at exactly the same time , all four people lurch forward suddenly :
You do n’t need to know the laws of physics to know what this means : the car must have braked suddenly at that time .
But if you watch the film , the car does n’t brake at all !
Scientists have taken careful measurements of the film , to figure out when the limousine was slowing down and speeding up .
According to its motion on the film , it is slowing down for a few seconds before this time !
Worse , at the time of the lurch , the car starts to accelerate rapidly !
Have you ever been in a car when someone has planted their foot on the gas pedal , and been thrown forward ?
Of course not !
It ’s ridiculous !
It violates the laws of physics , and it violates common sense .
The next weird thing you might have noticed is that Governor and Mrs Connally both “ collapse ” to the floor very rapidly :
It ’s almost like they were nine - pins , designed to fall out of sight !
According to Mrs Connally , she pulled the Governor down into her lap to protect him , and according to the Governor he then lost consciousness .
They never described both collapsing like this .
Worse , if you watch the full MPEG movie above , you can see that the Governor gets back up again , and looks over his wife !
It is quite likely that the Connallys had to be “ collapsed ” out of sight like this because of a photograph that was taken by an Associated Press photographer and published in newspapers around the world within hours of the assassination :
Zooming in on where the Connallys should be , we see that there is nothing visible except a bunch of flowers :
In the actual assassination , there would have been several seconds when the limo stopped , and then accelerated again , during which the Connallys would have dropped down to avoid the fusillade of shots reported by eyewitnesses .
By removing the car stop , the forgers had to make the Connallys collapse in a way that would be comical if the implications were not so grave .
Finally , if you look at the stabilized video on YouTube , and follow Mrs. Kennedy carefully , after she climbs out onto the back of the limo , you can see that she seems to dissolve into the rear seat of the car , and sit on the President 's head !
The only way to cover all up these mistakes was to make Zapruder ’s camera appear to jerk around wildly at these times , and then to make sure that any stabilized film was only ever shown in slow motion .
By watching these clips at full speed , you can see through the lies with your own eyes !

Guest article by John Nestler ( website : Space Marauder )
“ The United States is not developing space weapons and could not afford to do so even if it wanted to , ” said an official with the Pentagon last Thursday .
Space weapons have always been a bit of a hush - hush topic , and it looks like the trend has n’t been broken with this recent announcement .
The real issue surrounding this announcement is what the Pentagon ’s ideas of “ space weapons ” are …
The announcement came from an official with the Pentagon ’s National Security Space Office on Thursday , at a time when President Obama has expressed interest in a space weapons ban .
It is a bit hard to believe that the Pentagon is n’t looking into space weapons , the final frontier where weapons are n’t prevalent .
Just last spring Wired reported on the Pentagon ’s estimated budget for space weapons which totaled into a whopping $ 520 million .
Granted this money is spread out over a number of different projects , not all specifically related to space weaponry , yet there was definitely some interest in the area less than a year ago .
Pete Hays , a senior policy analyst with the Pentagon and the associate director of the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Studies points to funding issues that would prevent the Pentagon from pursuing further development of space weapons .
According to him , the government ’s commitments to the military program makes funding for space weapons development improbable .
Here ’s his say on space weapons development at the Pentagon :
“ There are no space weaponization programs .
It ’s an issue that academics like to flog now and then , but in terms of funded programs , there are n’t any .
I can tell you that categorically . ”
The definition of space weapons still remains a bit shady , as just a few weeks ago the Pentagon admitted to using two covert spy satellites to inspect a failed geostationary satellite .
The event caused more than a few people to be worried about transparency within the Pentagon , and the possibility that the Pentagon could use these covert satellites to sabotage other enemy satellites in the future .
The U.S. also flexed a bit of muscle when a rocket was launched to intercept and destroy a satellite that was deemed harmful as it was carrying full tank of a toxic propellant .
The use of the rocket in this situation was clearly non-hostile to other satellites and was launched to destroy a credible threat .
The problem is in the future where this same situation occurs , except the rocket accidentally intercepts and destroys a different satellite .
One use is for the protection of the citizens on Earth , while another use is military related .
This type of argument can be put forth for other similar developments in space technology which is what makes the area such a touchy subject .
Other countries are rightfully worried about the future of weapons in space , and have taken steps to create a treaty regarding the issue .
China and Russia have been asking for a treaty like this at the United Nations Disarmament Conference for a while now .
The U.S. has maintained it ’s refusal on treaties banning space weapons since the 1970’s .
Times are changing though and hopefully we will see some progress made in this area in the coming years .
Taking the news from the Pentagon face value is fine , but there is still a reasonable amount of doubt regarding their space weapon development plans .
A little transparency into their plans could calm the nerves of countries that are n’t as established in space yet .
On a final note , Pete Hays specifically mentioned that there were not any funded programs dealing with space weapon development .
This still leaves open the option that the Pentagon may have secret off the books programs going on , which seems probable .
As it stands currently there is no way to know what the future of weapons in space will be despite what countries claim , only time will tell .

Washington , DC , March 17 , 2009 – Following a stunning breakthrough in a 25 - year - old case of political terror in Guatemala , the National Security Archive today is posting declassified U.S. documents about the disappearance of Edgar Fernando García , a student leader and trade union activist captured by Guatemalan security forces in 1984 .
The documents show that García ’s capture was an organized political abduction orchestrated at the highest levels of the Guatemalan government .
Guatemalan authorities made the first arrest ever in the long - dormant kidnapping case when they detained Héctor Roderico Ramírez Ríos , a senior police officer in Quezaltenango , on March 5th and retired policeman Abraham Lancerio Gómez on March 6th as a result of an investigation into García 's abduction by Guatemala ’s Human Rights Prosecutor ( Procurador de Derechos Humanos — PDH ) .
Arrest warrants have been issued for two more suspects , Hugo Rolando Gómez Osorio and Alfonso Guillermo de León Marroquín .
The two are former officers with the notorious Special Operations Brigade ( BROE ) of the National Police , a unit linked to death squad activities during the 1980s by human rights groups .
According to the prosecutor Sergio Morales , the suspects were identified using evidence found in the vast archives of the former National Police .
The massive , moldering cache of documents was discovered accidentally by the PDH in 2005 , and has since been cleaned , organized and reviewed by dozens of investigators .
The National Security Archive provided expert advice in the rescue of the archive and posted photographs and analysis on its Web site .
Last week , Morales turned over hundreds of additional records to the Public Ministry containing evidence of state security force involvement in the disappearance of other student leaders between 1978 and 1980 .
As the Historical Archive of the National Police prepares to issue its first major report on March 24 , more evidence of human rights crimes can be expected to be made public .
Government Campaign of Terror
The abduction of Fernando García was part of a government campaign of terror designed to destroy Guatemala ’s urban and rural social movements during the 1980s .
On February 18 , 1984 , the young student leader was captured on the outskirts of a market near his home in Guatemala City .
He was never seen again .
Although witnesses pointed to police involvement , the government under then - Chief of State Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejía Víctores always denied any role in his kidnapping .
According to the Historical Clarification Commission ’s report released in 1999 , García was one of an estimated 40,000 civilians disappeared by state agents during Guatemala ’s 36 - year civil conflict .
In the wake of García ’s capture , his wife , Nineth Montenegro – now a member of Congress – launched the Mutual Support Group ( Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo — GAM ) , a new human rights organization that pressed the government for information about missing relatives .
Co-founded with other families of the disappeared , GAM took shape in June of 1984 , holding demonstrations , meeting with government officials and leading a domestic and international advocacy campaign over the years to find the truth behind the thousands of Guatemala ’s disappeared .
The organization was quickly joined by hundreds more family members of victims of government - sponsored violence , including Mayan Indians affected by a brutal army counterinsurgency campaign that decimated indigenous communities in the country ’s rural highlands during the early 1980s .
Declassified U.S. records obtained by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the United States was well - aware of the government campaign to kidnap , torture and kill Guatemalan labor leaders at the time of García ’s abduction .
“ Government security services have employed assassination to eliminate persons suspected of involvement with the guerrillas or who are otherwise left - wing in orientation , ” wrote the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research four days after García disappeared , pointing in particular to the Army ’s “ notorious presidential intelligence service ( archivos ) ” and the National Police , “ who have traditionally considered labor activists to be communists . ”
The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala considered the wave of state - sponsored kidnappings part of an effort to gather information on “ Marxist - Leninist ” trade unions .
“ The government is obviously rounding up people connected with the extreme left - wing labor movement for interrogation , ” wrote U.S. Ambassador Frederic Chapin in a cable naming six labor leaders recently captured by security forces , including García .
Despite reports that García was already dead , the ambassador was “ optimistic ” that he and other detainees would be released after questioning .
Many of the kidnapping victims noted in U.S. records included in this briefing book also appear in the “ Death Squad Dossier , ” an army intelligence logbook listing 183 people disappeared by security forces in the mid-1980s .
In 1999 , the National Security Archive obtained the original logbook and released a public copy .
The logbook indicates that García was among dozens of students , professors , doctors , journalists , labor leaders and others subjected to intensive army and police surveillance in the weeks leading up to their capture , disappearance and – in about half of the cases – execution .
The logbook entry listing Fernando García includes his alleged subversive alias names and affiliation to the Guatemalan Communist Party , as well as detailed personal information taken from official documents such as his national identification card and his passport .
Other victims listed in the Death Squad Dossier who are named in the U.S. documents posted today include Amancio Samuel Villatoro , Alfonso Alvarado Palencia , José Luis Villagrán Díaz and Santiago López Aguilar .
U.S. records describe their disappearances in the context of the government campaign to systematically dismantle Guatemala ’s labor movement .
The U.S. records posted today contain illuminating information on how the use of illegal kidnapping as a counterinsurgency strategy reached a peak during the government of Oscar Mejía Víctores .
U.S. figures estimated that there was an average of 137 abductions a month under the Mejía Víctores regime during 1984 .
According to one extensive State Department report written in 1986 , part of the modus operandi of government kidnapping involved interrogating victims at military bases , police stations , or government safe houses , where information about alleged connections with insurgents was “ extracted through torture . ”
The security forces used the information to conduct joint military / police raids on houses throughout the city , secretly capturing hundreds of individuals who were never seen again , or whose discarded bodies were later discovered showing signs of torture .
The National Police , subservient to the Army hierarchy , created special units to assist the military in the urban counter - guerrilla operations .
The records also demonstrate military efforts to cover up their role in the extra-legal activities .
In 1985 , for example , as Guatemala prepared to transition to a civilian government for the first time in a quarter of a century , the Army ordered the Archivos – which the State Department called “ a secret group in the President ’s office that collected information on insurgents and operated against them ” – to move its files out of presidential control and into the Intelligence Directorate ( D - 2 ) section of the military .
U.S. documents also chronicled developments as members of GAM became targets of government violence themselves .
GAM members suffered the worst period of violence during Easter “ holy week ” in 1985 , beginning with the kidnapping of senior member Héctor Gómez Calito , whose tortured and mutilated body was found on March 30 , 1985 .
According to one U.S. Embassy source , agents from the Detectives Corps of the National Police had been gathering information on Gómez in the days leading to his abduction .
Two weeks before his disappearance , Chief of State Oscar Mejía Víctores publicly charged that GAM members were being manipulated by guerrillas and questioned the sources of their funding .
Following his murder , GAM co-founder and widow of missing student leader Carlos Ernesto Cuevas Molina , Rosario Godoy de Cuevas , who had delivered the eulogy at Gómez Calito ’s funeral , was found dead at the bottom of a ditch two miles outside Guatemala City , along with her 2 - year - old son and 21 - year - old brother .
While the government claimed their deaths was an accident , Embassy sources discounted the official version of the events , and claimed that Godoy was targeted and her death a premeditated homicide .
Human rights monitors who had seen the bodies reported that the infant ’s fingernails had been torn out .
Future Investigations
The arrest of the police officers in Guatemala is an unprecedented step in the struggle against impunity , and a testament to the investigative efforts being carried out in the historical National Police archive .
The declassified records , however , demonstrate that Fernando García ’s disappearance was not an ordinary police arrest , but rather an organized political abduction orchestrated by the highest - levels of government .
In addition to the police files that have already proven so crucial to breaking new ground in this case , the release of the relevant military files is critical to unraveling what role the Army High Command and Chief of State played in this crime .
In addition to the material authors of the crime , those who planned and ordered García ’s kidnapping must also be investigated .
At the time of his disappearance , the key military and police personnel overseeing Guatemala ’s urban counter - terror campaign were :
Head of the Army Intelligence Directorate ( D - 2 ) : Byron Disrael Lima Estrada
Director of the Presidential General Staff ( EMP ) : Juan José Marroquín Siliezar
Directors of the Archivos : Marco Antonio González Taracena and Pablo Nuila Hub
Chief of the National Police : Héctor Rafael Bol de la Cruz
Oscar Mejía Víctores , Guatemala ’s former chief of state , is currently named as one of eight defendants charged with genocide and other crimes in an international criminal case that is being investigated by Judge Santiago Pedraz in the Audiencia Nacional ( National Court ) of Spain .
The García case is also important in the context of Guatemala ’s current struggle against organized crime .
The same week authorities arrested the police officers involved in Fernando García ’s kidnapping 25 years ago , the PDH announced that retired and active duty police are involved in today ’s organized kidnapping gangs .
Government prosecutors have announced they are currently investigating at least 10 members of the police ’s elite anti-kidnapping unit for involvement in contemporary abductions .
The struggle for justice and accountability for Guatemala ’s past crimes has a direct relationship to the current efforts to dismantle illegal armed networks .
Last week ’s arrests marked an important initial step in the right direction towards ending blanket impunity in Guatemala .

Trade - Union Leaders Abducted
U.S. Embassy in Guatemala , Classified Cable
The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala informs Washington about the abduction of Fernando García and other trade - union officials in the recent weeks .
According to press accounts on his disappearance , armed men kidnapped him while he was walking in Guatemala City on February 18 , 1984 .
The cable provides information on related incidents of abductions of labor activists in the weeks leading up to Fernando García ’s capture , describing the disappearances in the context of the widespread government targeting of Guatemala ’s labor leaders .
The document provides information on the political and organizational affiliation of the recently disappeared labor activists .
According to the cable , Fernando García was part of CAVISA , the industrial glass union , which is an “ affiliate of the communist trade - union confederation FASGUA , ” Guatemala ’s autonomous federal trade - union .
It also mentions that the disappeared victims were associated with the CNT ( Confederacion Nacional de Trabajadores ) , and makes reference to the case of the 28 CNT labor leaders , who “ disappeared in 1980 in one fell swoop .
It is believed that GOG security forces murdered all of them . ”
The other group mentioned is the National Council for Trade Union Unity – CNUS , which asserted that Fernando García was already dead .
Despite those claims , the U.S. Embassy remained “ optimistic that Fernando García of CAVISA will be released . ” Edgar Fernando García was never seen or heard from again .

Guatemala : Political Violence Up
U.S. Department of State , secret intelligence analysis
The same day that Embassy officials inform Washington of Fernando García ’s disappearance , the State Department produces an intelligence report on the recent spike in political assassinations and disappearances .
The intelligence report describes several notable cases of victims in the “ new wave of violence , ” over the past several weeks , and provides key information on police coordination with military intelligence in government kidnappings .
It mentions the recent abduction and release of a labor leader and confirms that “ he had been kidnapped by the National Police , who have traditionally considered labor activists to be communists . ”
It states that the detective corps ( the DIT ) of the National Police has traditionally been involved in “ extra - legal ” activities , working alongside the Army ’s presidential intelligence unit , the Archivos .

Guatemala : Democratic Trade Union Confederation CUSG Protests Abductions of Trade - Union Leaders
U.S. Embassy in Guatemala , confidential cable
Less than a month after Fernando García ’s disappearance , the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission in Guatemala , Paul D. Taylor reports on the growing protests from the Confederation of Syndicalist Unity ( CUSG ) over the recent disappearance of trade - union leaders , “ especially the disappearance of STICAVISA trade - union official Edgar Fernando García . ”
The CUSG blames the disappearances on the “ government attempts to destabilize the Guatemalan labor movement , ” a charge which the government denies .
The cable goes on to describe the individual cases of the disappeared , including the case of the escaped prisoner Álvaro René Sosa Ramos , who “ fled to asylum in the Belgian Ambassador ’s residence after being shot in an attempt to escape his captors .
Once recovered from gunshot wounds , he will be going into exile . ”
Sosa Ramos is mentioned in the Death Squad Dossier as entry number 87 .
The document offers further background as to why the labor leaders are disappearing .
According to the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Paul D. Taylor , “ By picking up leftist trade - union leaders connected with the CNT and the FASGUA , the government of Guatemala – advertently or inadvertently – is destabilizing the Marxist - Leninist wing of the Guatemalan labor movement . ”
His analysis concludes that the individuals were most likely targeted due to government suspicion that they were connected to armed insurgent groups , and that “ security forces are after them for that reason . ”

Guatemala : March 25 - 29 Visit of U.S. Trade - Union Delegation
U.S. Embassy in Guatemala , classified cable
International pressure continues to mount for investigations into the disappearances of Fernando García and other labor leaders .
The cable reports on a trade - union delegation visit to Guatemala , led by former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Pat Derian .
The delegation presses Embassy officials for information on the missing trade - union leaders .
The Embassy continues to make the point that “ all of these abducted union leaders are from the leftist CNT , ” emphasizing the political orientation of the disappeared victims .
The delegation maintains that Fernando García was being held by the army , and asked the Embassy to look into his disappearance , as well as that of Jose Luis Villagrán , “ disappeared February 11 , 1984 in zone 11 . ” U.S. officials promise they will “ make inquiries to the government about all these people . ”
Ms. Derian presses further , asking them to make “ representations , ” not just “ inquiries ” into the disappearances .
Deputy Chief of Mission Paul D. Taylor still maintains , however , that it has yet to be demonstrated “ whether government forces seized all these trade - unionists ” and further comments “ If the GOG has picked them up , it is almost certainly for matters other than their trade - union activities . ”

Murder of Member of Mutual Support Group ( GAM )
U.S. Embassy in Guatemala , limited officials use cable
The cable reports on the death of Héctor Orlando Gómez Galito , a member of the activist Mutual Support Group ( GAM ) .
The Embassy reports that he was “ abducted and assassinated the weekend of March 30 - 31 . ”
Gómez was kidnapped by unidentified men after leaving a weekly GAM meeting in Zone 11 of Guatemala City , and his body was discovered near the Pacific highway 15 miles from the city .
“ His assassination follows in the wake of reports that members of the groups had been the subject of unspecified threats . ”
The cable lists the co-directors of GAM as Beatriz Velasquez de Estrada , Aura Farfán , Maria Rosario Godoy de Cuevas , Maria Choxom de Castañón , Nineth Montenegro de García , and another Mrs. García , the mother of Edgar Fernando .
The cable examines Héctor Gómez Calito ’s involvement in the organization , concluding that he may have acted as a spokesperson unofficially because of security concerns .
Gómez was one of the group ’s planner for a march to be held on April 12 or 13 , and , “ According to reports , the GAM claims that Gómez was killed because of his involvement with the organization . ”

Background on Case of Héctor Orlando Gómez Calito , Murdered “ Mutual Support Group ” ( GAM ) Member : Embassy Discussions with Two Sources
U.S. Embassy in Guatemala , confidential cable
GAM director , Nineth Montonegro de García , and Father Alain Richard , member of Peace Brigades International ( PBI ) , meet with U.S. officials to provide the Embassy with background information on the death of Héctor Gómez .
They explain that Gómez had joined GAM following the disappearance of his brother , and had acted as a publicist for the group .
Richard tells officials that the police detective corps ( DIT ) had asked the mayor of the town of Amatitlan , where Gómez was from , for information about his activities , and that his house was reportedly under surveillance by “ men in automobiles . ”
The Embassy also states “ Richard had no doubts that the GOG [ the Government of Guatemala ] was directly responsible for Gomez ’s murder . ”
Richard added that regardless of the belief that the entire group was being watched , GAM would continue their advocacy efforts .
The cable ends by noting “ Embassy officers will meet GAM directors on Monday , April 8 . ”

Background and Recent Developments of the Mutual Support Group ( GAM )
U.S. Embassy in Guatemala , Confidential Cable
The Embassy provides a summary of GAM organizing in March , “ with some emphasis on its activist activities ( blocking traffic , occupation of government offices , etc. ) and the GOG reaction to those activities . ”
It gives background on the creation of the group , dating its first public appearance in early July 1984 , when GAM members began publicly campaigning for an investigation into the disappearances of their relatives and calling upon others to join .
They approached the Embassy shortly thereafter , “ asking for our assistance on behalf of 67 missing persons . ”
A few days after a GAM event in November 1984 , they were received by Chief of State General Mejía , where “ they repeated their demands ” to investigate the disappeared .
They met with Mejía a second time , which led to the formation of a government commission ostensibly to look into the GAM charges .
In March 1985 , they occupied the offices of the Guatemalan Attorney General , “ protesting the lack of action by the GOG Tripartite Commission . ”
Beginning in mid March , the government began to express disapproval of the tactics chosen by GAM to pursue their objectives .
Press reports carried warnings issued by Mejía Víctores in which he “ charged that the GAM was being manipulated by the insurgents and questioned the source of the group ’s funds . ”
According to the cable , the Embassy had informed Washington on March 25 that four members of GAM had allegedly received various threats .
One of the names on their list was Héctor Gómez , even though he was “ not then known to the Embassy in any capacity related to GAM .
Additional information regarding the specifics of Gómez ’s murder have been provided . ”

Before Embassy officials had the chance to meet with GAM members again , another one of their members was killed .
“ At about 8:00 pm April 4 , Maria del Rosario Godoy Aldana de Cuevas , a founder and member of the board of directors of GAM was found dead in her automobile . ”
Three days after Rosario Godoy de Cuevas delivered the eulogy at Héctor Gómez ’ funeral , she was found dead along with her 2 - year - old son and 21 - year - old brother .
U.S. Embassy provides the official story given by the Guatemalan government , that she was “ the victim of an apparent vehicular accident . ”
Embassy sources , however , believe the death was premeditated , and note several contradictory facts in the official version of events .
Rosario de Cuevas helped found GAM following the disappearance of her husband , Carlos Ernesto Cuevas Molina , another labor leader who was kidnapped on May 15 , 1984 .

Embassy comments on the matter of the autopsy , noting that it is unclear what examination was completed by “ police forensic specialists . ”
An Embassy source also said “ he had heard that the victims had died of asphyxiation and that a ‘ bogus autopsy ’ had been performed ... another rumor circulating said that the victims had died from gunfire .
But again , no details or proof have been offered . ”
The Guatemalan Interior Minister said he had the “ official report that showed the Cuevas case to have been an accident . ”
The cable reiterates that “ GAM members had recently began to receive anonymous threats by letter and telephone , ” and that other press reports spoke of anonymous threats against the organization .
Threats notwithstanding , the group announced plans for another public protest later that month .

Five days after the death of Rosario Godoy de Cuevas , U.S. Ambassador - at - large for Central America Harry Shlaudeman visits Guatemala and meets with Mejía Víctores and Foreign Minister Fernando Andrade .
During the meeting , U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Alberto M. Piedra takes Mejía Víctores aside to express U.S. concern over the recent events , “ especially the death of Maria Rosario Godoy de Cuevas . ”
He indicates that “ even if the government had nothing to do with the matter , public opinion abroad would definitely blame the military . ”
The Ambassador explains that the high profile violence was making it difficult to defend Guatemala ’s position , especially in Congress , and this could endanger their efforts to increase aid to the government .
Piedra also takes aside the Foreign Minister , who tells the Ambassador that he was against the “ continuance of these types of crime . ”
He added that the U.S. Embassy should continue opposing such violations to all sectors of Guatemalan society , “ and in a very special way to the military . ”

Guatemala ’s Disappeared : 1977 - 86
Department of State , Bureau of Inter - American Affairs , secret report
This Department of State report from 1986 provides details on the evolution of the use of forced disappearance by security forces over the decade prior , and how this tactic became institutionalized under the Mejía Víctores regime .
“ In the cities , out of frustration from the judiciary ’s unwillingness to convict and sentence insurgents , and convinced that the kidnapping of suspected insurgents and their relatives would lead to a quick destruction of the guerilla urban networks , the security forces began to systematically kidnap anyone suspected of insurgent connections . ”
The documents estimates there were 183 reported cases of government kidnapping the first month of the Mejía government , and an average of 137 abductions a month through the end of 1984 .
Part of the modus operandi of government kidnapping involved interrogating victims at military bases , police stations , or government safe houses , where information about alleged connections with insurgents was “ extracted through torture . ”
The document concludes that the U.S. embassy and the State Department have failed in the past to adequately grasp the magnitude of Guatemala ’s problem of government kidnapping .

If you have n't been following the browser wars in the last few months , JavaScript engines are now the hot new thing to showboat ... unless , of course , you 're Microsoft and have the kind of market share where you do n't need to worry about what benchmarking nerds think .
But for Microsoft 's loyal rivals , JavaScript engines are being trotted out in the latest browser builds with names straight out of American Gladiators - like Chrome 's V8 , Safari 's Nitro , Firefox 's TraceMonkey , and Opera 's Futhark .
Google - made Chrome has been particularly vocal about how it slaps JavaScript up and down the aisles until it wishes it never had elements to render .
The Mountain View engineers pin the eternally - beta Chrome as not just a browser , but a " vehicle for delivering web applications . "
Sounds like hot stuff indeed .
So it 's really no surprise with IE8 being made available Thursday and Microsoft downplaying the significance of browser speed , that Google comes out with a new project just to show that fast JavaScript engines are the greatest thing ever to be created by Man .
From Google 's new Chrome Experiments project :
We think JavaScript is awesome .
We also think browsers are awesome .
Indeed , when we talk about them , we say they are the cat 's meow - which is an American expression meaning AWESOME .
In light of these deeply held beliefs , we created this site to showcase cool experiments for both JavaScript and web browsers .
The site presently includes 19 animated micro-games and widgets that are admittedly very cool .
For example , one game called Browser Ball lets you load up separate browser windows , then " throw " a ball between them .
Google Gravity makes the company 's iconic search page shatter to the bottom of the screen , where each of the page 's elements remain functional .
Demos at Chrome Tools are all tested with Chrome , of course - but most appear to work with the other major browsers as well .
Your millage may vary .
It 's all very slick and yes , perhaps even awesome .
But Microsoft 's argument with IE8 has been that raw script performance is n't really the main concern for your average web surfer .
Mind , this position is almost guaranteed to change as soon as IE catches up .
But Microsoft 's speed in updating its browser has historically been rather glacial - and by the time it has pulled out a new JavaScript engine it 's likely the other folks will have moved on touting something else as the hot new thing . ®

Why HTTP ?
Why HTTP ?
The world does n’t need another arbitrary binary protocol .
Just use HTTP .
Your life will be simpler .
Originally this came up when scaling a gaggle of MySQL machines .
I would have killed for a reliable proxy .
It ’s with this in mind that I ’ve come up with my list of things that HTTP has that an arbitrary protocol will have to rebuild .
Anytime you choose to use a service based on a non-HTTP protocol , look over this list and think carefully about what you ’re giving up .
1. Servers in any language .
2. Clients in any language .
These two are obvious .
Moving right along .
3. Proxies
There are rock solid drop - in software solutions for proxying traffic from one machine to another .
These proxies can do all types of request or response rewriting .
4. Load balancers
Need to scale past one machine ?
Need higher reliability ?
Drop a load balancer in front of multiple machines and you have a transparent barrier around the complexity of scaling up a service .
There are no problems that have not yet been encountered .
In fact , there are probably tools for diagnosing every malady you will ever encounter .
6 . Web browsers
You already have a client , you ’re using it right now .
You can use it to poke at APIs .
7. People
Everyone knows HTTP .
Quite a few people know more about it than you ever will .
You can always reach out for help , or get contractors to solve problems .
8. Guaranteed web access
Corporate proxies and weird ISPs cause all kinds of havoc for things that are n’t HTTP .
Being HTTP means you sidestep those problems .
9 . Extensive hardware
If you ’re high traffic or need extremely high uptime , you ’re going to outgrow most software solutions .
When you step up to the big time , hardware vendors will be there to support you .
10 . Known scalability paths
Not only are there software solutions to allow easy migrations to more scalable architectures , but there are also easy patterns for designing a backend to scale up servicing HTTP ’s stateless request - responses .
11 . Prior knowledge
You already know HTTP .
Your coworkers already know HTTP .
You can start working on the harder problems at hand .
12 . Extensibility
Between HTTP verbs and headers you have quite a bit of freedom to extend your original schemes .
Need an extra piece of data ?
Add a header .
Have pieces of information but want to be able to remove them ?
Use HTTP DELETE .
Run into a really hairy problem that really wants a piece of it to be solved in a different protocol ?
Use HTTP protocol switching .
13 . URLs
Using HTTP allows you to use a standard way of referencing resources .
Parsers already exist for every language and their semantics are well understood .
14 . Security
HTTPS gives you baked in easy to use security .
It has its limitations , but if you ’re really paranoid you can always use SSH and a SOCKS proxy .
Once again , HTTP has your back .
( Forgot to include this , thanks Daren Thomas for pointing it out ! )
In the end the rules are simple .
Is it possible to do over HTTP ?
Then do it over HTTP .
I ’m not exactly defending an unpopular position , but there are still surprising transgressions of this rule .
XMPP being the most obvious one .
It ’s quite a bit more complex than HTTP and is missing most of the above qualities .
It ’s usually cited as an example of a protocol that solves a problem http can’t : asynchronous bidirectional messaging ; allowing the server and the client to send messages with minimal lag .
The truth is HTTP can do this just fine , with long - polling and HTTP keep - alive you can keep a persistent bidirectional connection open .
There are an ever slimming number of commonly used protocols that are n’t http : instant messaging , e-mail , irc and ftp come to mind .
Move a service to HTTP , and it becomes a team player in our ecosystem .
Let ’s revolutionize the last of our dinosaur protocols and move on .

Could nanosecond - long pulses of electricity be used as stun-guns ?
( Image : a_kartha , stock.xchng )
A technique thought to be a promising cancer treatment is also being investigated as the basis for a Taser - like weapon that stuns for longer , New Scientist has learned .
The technology involves short , nanosecond - long pulses of extreme voltage .
Microsecond pulses have been used for years to punch temporary holes in cell membranes , to shove genes or drugs into cells .
But the nanosecond pulses have similar effects on individual organelles inside a cell , such as the nucleus .

For reasons as yet unknown , this can cause a cell to destroy itself in a process known as apoptosis , something being investigated as a cancer treatment .
But the nanosecond pulses are also being researched as a way to temporarily disable human muscles .
Incapacitating effects
Much research to date on nanosecond pulses has come from the Frank Reidy Research Centre for Bioelectrics at Old Dominion University in Norfolk , Virginia , where some research is sponsored by the Pentagon ’s Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ) of Quantico , Virginia .
“ Efforts are ongoing as part of our Human Electro - Muscular Incapacitation bio-effects research , ” confirms David B Law , technology division chief at the JNLWD .
“ The short - pulse simulations and research appear to be demonstrating a degree of voluntary muscular impairment or inhibition , that remains in effect for durations longer than the exposure period , ” he adds .
Existing Tasers use multiple electric shocks of a few microseconds over a five - second cycle .
The shocks are delivered to the body through twin electrodes fired in a dart .
The pulsing electric field created inside the body disrupts the electrical activity of nerve cell membranes .
These are responsible for carrying instructions and feedback around the body .
The effects wear off almost immediately , according to Taser spokesman Steve Tuttle , so that a suspect is incapacitated for just long enough to make an arrest .
Stunned for longer
Even shorter , nanosecond pulses have the potential to cause similar but longer lasting stunning , research from the Frank Reidy centre suggests .
One study on cells in vitro indicated that 60 - nanosecond pulses caused “ profound and long - lasting loss ” of the electrical activity in the membranes of cells similar to nerve cells .
The effect lasted fifteen minutes .
So far , research investigating the potential to disable muscles using nanopulses has been limited to tests on tissue samples in vitro and theoretical studies that claim the ultrashort shocks should be able to disable a whole animal .
However , Law says that plans for testing on live subjects are “ proceeding at appropriate institutions . ”
He declined to be more specific or say when human testing might take place .
“ The medical and biological effects of such ultra - short electrical shocks in such a weapon are presently unknown , ” highlights Amnesty International researcher Angela Wright , saying the organisation is already concerned that evidence is emerging that Tasers and other shock devices have long - term health effects .
She thinks that the different effects of even shorter pulses may also have unpredicted effects .
HBO has made a deal to bring David Chase , the creator of its biggest hit , “ The Sopranos , ” back to television .
The network announced on Monday that Mr. Chase would write and produce an ambitious mini-series that would dramatize the history of Hollywood moviemaking , from the early days of the 20th century to the present day .
The series , “ Ribbon of Dreams , ” will begin with the behind - the - scenes roles played by two fictional characters  one a cowboy with some violence in his past , the other a mechanical engineer  who work for the famous early film director D. W. Griffith .
It will follow them and their professional heirs through the development of the movie business .
The project is expected to cover each period of Hollywood movies , beginning with silent westerns and comedies , through the golden era of the studio system , to the emergence of auteur film directors in the 1970s , and up to the current mix of studio blockbusters and independent films .
The cast of characters will also include many of the biggest names of Hollywood ’s past , including John Wayne and Bette Davis .
Future of Tempelhof Magic Mountain for Berlin ?
The city of Berlin has long been trying to decide what to do with the monumental Tempelhof airport , built in the heart of the city by the Nazis .
Some of the most recent proposals include a 1,000 meter mountain and a gigantic red - light district .
This week , out on the broad wastes of cable news drekdom and the uplands of Beltway journalistic drivel , a simple fact has gone almost entirely unreported : virtually everything congressional Republicans are saying about the Stimulus Bill would n’t cut it in remedial economics .
Not that there are n’t legitimate policy differences and criticisms to be made of the outline plan before Congress .
But to call the
Republican complaints ‘ policy differences ’ would be to engage in what that old president used to call the soft bigotry of low expectations , as though a political party with as legitimately proud a history as the GOP could not be expected to produce more than economic illiterates .
The ground under our feet might feel firmer if this were just standard order rhetorical abuse .
But the truth of it is genuinely frightening , especially since these fellows are planted in Congress rather than on one of the sidewalk corners in Union Square ranting about Socialism and Fluoride or Lyndon LaRouche .
But now there are some flickering signs that the tide may be turning , perhaps in response to just how nonsensical the conversation got earlier this week .
For instance , in tomorrow ’s Post , business columnist Steven Pearlstein devotes an entire column to the fact most of Republicans on Capitol Hill do n’t even seem to grasp how a Stimulus Bill is supposed to work or even more basic stuff about demand , recession economics or even how jobs come into existence .
As in , it ’s not a Stimulus Bill , it ’s a spending bill .
Tactfully , Pearlstein does n’t say explicitly for most of the article that it ’s Republicans he ’s talking about .
You have to infer that from the names of the members he dings .
But toward the end of the piece he can’t seem to help cutting to the chase …
what ’s striking is that supposedly intelligent people are horrified at the thought that , during a deep recession , government might try to help the economy by buying up - to - date equipment for the people who protect us from epidemics and infectious diseases , by hiring people to repair environmental damage on federal lands and by contracting with private companies to make federal buildings more energy - efficient .
What really irks so many Republicans , of course , is that all the stimulus money is n’t being used to cut individual and business taxes , their cure - all for economic ailments , even though all the credible evidence is that tax cuts are only about half as stimulative as direct government spending .
It really does approach flat earth territory .
When you step back from the immediacy of the moment and consider just what nonsense these guys are spouting and what games they ’re playing while the country is legitimately in danger , it ’s breathtaking .
All the reporters have fallen down on the job .
But maybe we can hope for more tide - turning tomorrow .

Thursday , March 19 , 2009 WASHINGTON — Israeli Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi cut short his visit to Washington after getting an extraordinarily cool reception from the new U.S. administration .
On his current trip to Washington , Ashkenazi sought to meet the administration of President Barack Obama , but most officials were unavailable .
A statement to WorldTribune.com by the Israel Defense Forces spokesman attempted to downplay the snubs .
But diplomatic sources said Ashkenazi failed to obtain access to any Cabinet member , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The Israeli military chief , who sought to discuss the Iranian nuclear threat , was also unable meet his counterpart , Adm. Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Also In This Edition [ On March 19 , the Israel Defense Forces spokesman e-mailed the following statement to WorldTribune.com : " The schedule for the United States visit of the IDF Chief of the General Staff , Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , was preplanned according to requests made by American officials .
Any meetings that were cancelled were substituted with telephone conference calls . " ]
The IDF Internet site reported on March 17 , that Ashkenazi cut short his trip to the United States in order to participate in a security cabinet meeting regarding the abducted soldier Gilad Shalit .
" The Chief of the General Staff wishes to send his sincere apologies to the 1500 senior donors of the Friends of the IDF in the United States , who will gather for their annual donation gala dinner in New York City on Tuesday night ( Mar. 17 ) , in which Lt. Gen.
Ashkenazi was supposed to participate as a guest of honor , " the IDF report stated .
On March 12 , Ashkenazi left for a five - day visit to the United States meant to lobby the Obama administration to abandon the planned U.S. dialogue with Iran , Middle East Newsline reported .
Ashkenazi , scheduled to meet with the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee , was expected to have brought new Israeli intelligence on Iran 's nuclear weapons and missile programs .
But the diplomatic sources said the administration made it clear that nobody in a policy - making position was available to sit with Ashkenazi .
This included the president , Vice President Joseph Biden , Gates , National Intelligence director Dennis Blair or Mullen .
[ " With regards to a meeting with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , one was not scheduled between Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi and Adm. Mullen , " the IDF stated .
" Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi has met with Adm. Mullen five times in the past year . " ]
" The administration is sending a very clear message to Israel , and this is we want to talk about Palestine and not Iran , " a diplomat who has been following U.S. - Israel relations said .
Ashkenazi obtained an appointment with National Security Advisor James Jones .
But the sources said the meeting was to focus on U.S. demands for Israel to ease military restrictions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
" The Obama administration believes that Israel is as much or more of a problem as it is an ally , at least until Israel 's disagreements with its neighbors are resolved , " former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton , said .
Bolton envisioned that the White House would pressure Israel to legitimize Hamas and Hizbullah .
At the same time , he said , Obama would continue to woo Iran .
Already , economic and diplomatic advisers to Obama have urged the president to launch a U.S. dialogue with Hamas .
The US / Middle East Project , which includes such Obama supporters as former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Sen.
Chuck Hagel , was said to have elicited a promise from Obama to listen to any proposals made by Hamas .
" The main gist is that you need to push hard on the Palestinian peace process , " former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft said .
" Do n't move it to the end of your agenda and say you have too much to do .
And the U.S. needs to have a position , not just hold their coats while they sit down . "
The Israeli chief of staff had also scheduled a session with Dennis Ross , the special adviser on Iran to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
But the sources said Ross was not regarded as being in a policy - making role .
The diplomatic sources said the White House and the senior echelon of the Obama administration have refused a dialogue with Israel on the Iranian threat .
They said Ms. Clinton , during her visit to Israel , was largely silent during briefings by Israeli intelligence on Iran 's nuclear and missile programs .
During her visit , Ms. Clinton received written recommendations on U.S. policy toward Iran from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
The U.S. secretary said the recommendations would be relayed to the White House .
" The Israeli government and military have been alarmed by the rapid and dramatic reversal in the U.S. policy toward Iran , " the source said .
" This reversal took place without any consultation with Israel , Gulf Arab countries or even Congress . "
The sources said Israel has sought a U.S. commitment to limit its dialogue with Iran .
Israel has also urged Obama to make it clear that the military option against Iran 's nuclear program exists .
But Obama and his top aides appear uninterested in hearing Israel 's position .
The sources said a key aim of Ashkenazi was to urge the administration to release weapons and systems long sought by Israel in the area of aerial refueling , air - to - ground weapons , sensors as well as the F - 22 fighter - jet .
In 2008 , under the Bush administration , Gates and then - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice blocked U.S. requests for these military systems .
The sources said Gates and Ms. Rice concluded that Israel could use this equipment for an air strike on Iran 's nuclear weapons facilities .
" Ashkenazi sees this U.S. refusal as what has been undermining Israeli deterrence toward Iran and boosting the confidence of the Teheran regime , " the source said .
" The mullahs in regime have concluded that America has dropped the military option and wo n't allow such an option to Israel . "

While strong , Israel is in grave danger if the U.S. signals weak support !
Such a signal would betray Israel and embolden terrorists .

Turning our back on Israel and trying to force them to give away land that is rightfully theirs is a huge mistake .
Gaza and the West Bank belongs to Israel .
The Palestinians have a homeland , its called Jordan .
Jeff Calvert 1:33 p.m. / Sunday , March 22 , 2009 Israel can and will handle itself very well .
Remember the 6 day war ?
Remember when all their neighbors attacked them the day after their status as a nation was confirmed ?
They annilated their massive enemies and took lands rightfully theirs anyway .
They were massively outnumbered yet wiped the floor with their aggressors .
God defends Israel and America will pay a huge price if it goes too far with its hostile and hypocritical attitude towards Israel .
Daniel 9:25 p.m. / Saturday , March 21 , 2009 Israel needs to cut her dependency on the U.S. , ask their G -d to help them , then go do what must be done .
The same G-d who parted the Red Sea is still there to help them , if they will only wake up and acknowledge their need of Him .

What a disappointment .
I was thinking that USA is a source of good in this world - before beliefs , before religion , before interests .
I think USA must obligate itself to democracy !
With great power comes great responsibility .
Israel is a democracy under continuous attack from dozens of states that want to see us destroyed .
And still we are the bad guys ?!
Yoav 7:50 a.m. / Saturday , March 21 , 2009 Israel is quasi - independent state because it is very dependent on foreign aid .
As such , the state technically can act alone without America 's approval but that would be an unforgivable act as far as the USA is concerned .
The only attack Israel can conduct would be a nuclear one which is off the table .
Conventional attack on Iran is nearly impossible and too costly for Israel to undertake without U.S. backing .

It does n't matter .
Just like blacks in America , it does n't matter how baddly Democrats treat Jews .
They will still vote Democrat on election day .
And Jews are supposed to be smart ?!
Bob A 4:17 p.m. / Friday , March 20 , 2009 Re : " however , it will [ Israel ] alone and ALONE it shall bear the devastating consequences of an Iranian reprisal . "

Better to risk the reprisal ( likely useless ) than the " devastating consequences " of an Iranian first strike .
AHasta la vista , Iran .
Joe Meric 2:05 p.m. / Friday , March 20 , 2009
It is an utter nonsense that the U.S. is preventing Israel from attacking Iran .
Israel ( at least under the UN ) is a sovereign country .
It can attack if it wishes to ; however , it will alone and ALONE it shall bear the devastating consequences of an Iranian reprisal .
The U.S. will not fight the Israeli regime 's wars .

" Lord " Hugh Rodley lived in a Tudor manor in Gloucestershire
Two men who plotted to steal £ 229 m from a bank using software have been found guilty for their roles in the scam .
" Lord " Hugh Rodley , of Gloucestershire , who bought his title , was convicted of conspiracy charges dating back to 2004 .
Gang members had installed spyware on computers at the London offices of Sumitomo Mitsui bank in order to steal money from big business accounts .
Soho sex shop owner David Nash , 47 , from Durrington , West Sussex , was also convicted at Snaresbrook Crown Court .
He had been used by Rodley to front accounts into which the funds would have been channelled , the trial heard .
Rodley , who lived in a Tudor mansion in Tewkesbury , Gloucestershire , teamed up with a gang of internet thieves to target the Japanese bank .
The " bold and sophisticated " plot was only foiled at the 11th hour by the complexities of inter - bank money transfers , the court heard .
Bank security supervisor Kevin O'Donoghue , 34 , unlocked the Japanese bank 's London offices so the gang could make " surreptitious " visits at night , the jury was told .
THE £ 229M BANK SWINDLE PLOT Hugh Rodley , 61 , of Tewkesbury , Gloucestershire , guilty of conspiracies to defraud and to transfer criminal property David Nash , 47 , from Durrington , West Sussex , guilty of conspiracy to transfer criminal property Kevin O'Donoghue , 34 , of Minstead Road , Birmingham , admitted conspiracy to steal Jan Van Osselaer , 32 , of Belgium , admitted conspiracy to steal Gilles Poelvoorde , 35 , of Belgium , admitted conspiracy to steal
Heist plan that came so close
He also tampered with CCTV equipment in a bid to avoid the presence of two men - Belgian computer expert Jan Van Osselaer , 32 , and his " recruiter " , Frenchman Gilles Poelvoorde , 35 - being caught on camera .
The duo then used software to corrupt the bank 's computer system , record the keystrokes of staff and reveal user names and passwords , jurors were told .
That gave them access to the holdings of major companies like Toshiba International , Nomura Asset Management and Sumitomo Chemical UK .
They made several attempts to electronically transfer up to £ 12.5 m at a time around the world , but were unsuccessful because of " field logging errors " .
The plot was discovered when staff returned to work after the weekend and realised their computers were not working properly .
Then they found a number of network cables had been " taken out " .
Woman cleared Rodley , 61 , was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to transfer criminal property between 1 January and 5 October 2004 .
Nash was cleared of that first same charge but convicted of the second same charge .
Swedish national Inger Malmros , 58 , who lives in Gran Canaria , was cleared of both counts .
She had told the court she knew nothing of two instructions - allegedly from her firm - concerning the planned transfer of some of Sumitomo 's cash .
O'Donoghue and the Belgian - based hackers will be sentenced alongside Rodley and Nash on Thursday .
A seventh defendant , Rodley 's 74 - year - old business partner Bernard Davies , committed suicide two days before the trial began .
' Lost will to live ' A note was read to the court in which he said he had " lost the will to live " after receiving death threats from an underworld figure because he would not reveal Rodley 's and Nash 's whereabouts .
Rodley did not give evidence during the trial , relying on his barrister to defend him against Nash 's claims he was " the architect of all this " .
But the sex shop owner went into the witness box to deny any knowledge of the bank theft plot , insisting : " I was just the driver , the security , working on a need - to - know basis . "
Sumitomo Mitsui said in a statement that its systems and controls had prevented the fraud 's success and that at no point were customer accounts at risk .
" Following the fraud attempt , we conducted a full review of our internal procedures and have subsequently continued to enhance them further , " it added .

Verdacht auf Kinderpornografie : Tauss Anwalt kritisiert Verfahren
Der Verteidiger des unter Kinderpornografie - Verdacht stehenden SPD - Abgeordneten Jörg Tauss glaubt an eine Kampagne und bezeichnet das Verfahren als " soziale Exekution " .
BERLIN taz Der Verteidiger des SPD - Politikers Jörg Tauss erhebt schwere Vorwürfe gegen die Staatsanwaltschaft Karlsruhe .
" Die Staatsanwaltschaft geht in einer Art und Weise vor , die einer Vorverurteilung und faktisch einer sozialen Exekution meines Mandanten gleichkommt " , sagte Anwalt Jan Mönikes am Sonntag der taz .
" Es ist ungeheuerlich , dass die Ermittler in einem derart sensiblen Verfahren stündlich Wasserstandsmeldungen an die Presse weitergeben , ohne dem Angeschuldigten oder seinem Verteidiger die Möglichkeit zu geben , in der Sache Stellung zu nehmen " , sagte Mönikes .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft Karlsruhe hatte am Donnerstag zwei Wohnungen und zwei Büros des medienpolitischen Sprechers der SPD wegen des Verdachts durchsuchen lassen , Tauss sei im Besitz von Bilddateien mit kinderpornografischen Inhalten .
Nach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft sei dabei belastendes Material gefunden worden .
Tauss beteuert seitdem seine Unschuld .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft will dem SPD - Politiker aber erst frühestens Ende dieser Woche Gelegenheit zur Aufklärung geben .
Akteneinsicht wolle die Staatsanwaltschaft der Verteidigung auch erst frühestens am Mittwoch gewähren , teilte der leitende Oberstaatsanwalt Rüdiger Rehring am Wochenende mit .
" Damit bringt die Staatsanwaltschaft die Verteidigung in eine unmögliche Position " , sagte Mönikes .
Aus rechtlicher Sicht dürfe sich Tauss vor Einsicht in die Akten und der Anhörung durch die Staatsanwaltschaft nicht öffentlich erklären .
" Die Staatsanwaltschaft hat mit ihrem Vorgehen die rechtsstaatlichen Prinzipien der Unschuldsvermutung sowie die Praxis , Stillschweigen bis zur Anhörung zu bewahren , beschädigt . "
Die Staatsanwaltschaft Karlsruhe wies die Vorwürfe am Sonntag zurück : " Eine Vorverurteilung war und ist ganz und gar nicht unsere Absicht .
Wir sind vielmehr so zurückhaltend wie möglich vorgegangen " , sagte Rehring .
Tauss Verteidiger Jan Mönikes hält es für möglich , dass die Ermittlungen gegen Tauss Teil eines politischen Manövers sind , um einen kritischen Geist zur Strecke zu bringen .
" Noch während die Hausdurchsuchungen am Donnerstag durchgeführt wurden , ließ Staatsanwalt Rehring über die Medien verbreiten , es sei belastendes Material gefunden worden . "
Zuvor hatte der Vorsitzende des Immunitätsausschusses , Thomas Strobl ( CDU ) , zugestimmt , die Immunität von Tauss aufzuheben .
" Herr Tauss und Herr Strobl , der der Schwiegersohn von Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble ist , sind in der Landespolitik von Baden - Württemberg politische Kontrahenten " , sagte Mönikes .
Tauss war zuvor als exponiertester Gegner der Schäuble - Pläne in Erscheinung getreten , bestimmte Angebote aus dem Internet herauszufiltern .
95 % of cell phones are contaminated with more that one type of microbe
Mobile phones used by hospital healthcare workers are often contaminated with germs , including those that can causes illness in hospitalized patients , a Turkish research team reports .
Dr. Fatma Ulger and others at Ondokuz Mayis University , Samsun , swabbed the dominant hand and the mobile phones of 200 doctors , nurses , and other healthcare staff working in intensive care units and operating rooms .
They found that 95 percent of telephones were contaminated , often with more than one type of microbe , and often with antibiotic - resistant bacteria .
Potentially serious infectious bugs such as staphylococci were isolated from phones in intensive care units , the team reports in the online BMC journal Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials .
When the study participants were questioned , 90 percent said they never cleaned their mobile phones .
The investigators conclude that mobile phones “ may facilitate transmission of bacterial isolates from patient to patient in wards or hospitals . ”
They recommend routine decontamination of mobile phones with alcohol - containing disinfectants .

Alaska is an energy experiment unfolding .
While it exports more oil than any state besides Texas , alternative energy provides 25 % of its current energy .
Its governor , Sarah Palin , wants the state to get 50 % of its energy from renewable or alternative sources by 2025 .
The Alaskan experiment , though , shows the perils of relying on wind energy .
It also provides a stark reminder of the gap between what 's technologically feasible and what makes for good news copy .
The New York Times visits Alaska to report on the state 's alt energy ambitions , likely moved by a report a month ago that Gov. Palin wants to increase alt - energy usage .
They find there are a number of natural opportunities for wind , ocean , and geothermal energy sources .
The need to tap these resources is urgent , as electricity to rural parts of the state costs five to ten times what it costs the rest of the country .
Yet , for the promised savings wind power is supposed to provide , residents in the rural town of Toksook Bay still pay through the nose for power .
A resident there says he pays $ 371.14 a month in electric bills for his house and $ 713.12 for his small business .
And that 's with wind turbines and state subsidies .
The wind turbines will take 17 years to pay for themselves .
The turbines will only last 3 to 8 more years after that .
Therein lies the problem with alternative energy .
In a perfect situation to test the vitality of wind power , it comes up short .
The turbines still need to be supplemented with diesel fuel .
Residents are n't getting cheap energy .
( On the plus side , they might get some new jobs , when they build new turbines . )
Palin will spend $ 300 million over five years on her 670,000 residents to provide alternative energy solutions .
If this state , with its ideal environment , and generous investment can't get wind and geothermal figured out , then we wonder who will .
We want to see the experiment in Alaska succeed .
But as in the rest of the country , Alaska will need some time and innovation before its grand experiment can pay off .

The world ’s biggest losers
If there ’s one thing you ’ve got to love about tough times is : they ’re tough on everyone .
These days , it ’s not easy even for those who have taken historically proven paths to amassing wealth , fame , power , social acceptance and happiness — like becoming a billionaire or pope or U.S. Treasury secretary or an Austrian sadist .
Admittedly , it ’s hard to work up too much sympathy for most of these mighty who have fallen , but sympathy is not the only reason to reflect on their fates .
There are also the cautionary lessons offered up by their Icarus - like descents .
Nah , who are we kidding ?
That ’s for some other blog .
There are only two real reasons to revisit these stories .
It ’s fun to watch the bastards squirm .
And because recently the headlines have been filled with so many prominent people who for one reason or another are royally screwed , we want to know :
Who ’s the most screwed ?
Which of these figures who have chosen a well - worn path to the limelight , has done the most damage to their own reputations and the lives of those around them ?
Here are thirteen choices from this month ’s headlines ranked by just how little sympathy we should have for them :
13 . ) Edward Liddy
The only reason this guy is on the list is that his career is probably finished simply because most people will forever associate him with A.I.G .
But while the company has already joined Enron , Long Term Capital Management , Drexel Burnham Lambert and Blue Horseshoe in Wall Street ’s Hall of Infamy , Liddy himself is something like a hero , coming to work for a dollar a year as a public service in the most thankless job in the global business community .
( And what is Blue Horseshoe ?
Hint : “ Blue Horseshoe loves Anacot Steel . ” )
12 . ) Forbes Billionaires List
According to Forbes , the official magazine of Wall Street greed , the world ’s billionaires managed to misplace $ 1.4 trillion in the past year , their ranks thinning from 1125 to 793 .
Their average net worth has fallen by almost a quarter to only $ 3 billion .
Both Warren Buffet and Carlos Slim each lost $ 25 billion .
One , Adolf Merckle , ended up killing himself .
Former Wall Street titans like Hank Greenberg and Sandy Weill fell completely off the list as did Facebook wunderkind Mark Zuckerberg .
But Zuckerberg is only 25 and still has $ 900 million left .
So as far as sympathy goes this is pretty much a mixed bag .
The reality is that these days even a few hundred million gets you pretty far so let ’s not lose too much sleep over them .
( The reason they are this low on the list is not because I feel sympathy for them … it ’s because I feel considerably less for everyone else on the list . )
11 . ) Eliot Spitzer
Poor Eliot .
If only he had kept it in his pants , this would have been his moment .
One can hardly imagine what is making his life worse right now , the fact that the A.I.G. scandal and the collapse of Wall Street could have been his apotheosis , the moment the howling dogs of ambition in his breast might have finally gotten enough red meat of press exposure … or the fact that his wife Silda has stood by him and thus will have the moral high ground in his marriage until he dies .
Admittedly , while Spitzer unzipped his own career , his worst violation did not come against the public but against his family .
10 . ) Gordon Brown
It ’s hard to hate Gordon Brown .
In fact , it ’s hard not to feel bad for the guy .
This is due in part to the fact that he is Britain ’s first prime minister who is also part basset hound .
Also , he had to follow Tony Blair who was quite telegenic and appealing , particularly in that phase of his career when he was being played by Michael Sheen .
( Less so later when he was being played by one of George W. Bush ’s hand - puppets . )
Still , Gordon did accept the job of PM , did screw it up to a fare - thee - well and now is on the verge of blowing his last big moment on the public stage as he prepares to host a G20 Summit that is very likely to realize somewhere between zero and few of his grand ambitions for it .
9. ) Bibi Netanyahu
The fact that a man President Clinton ’s White House spokesman once called “ one of the most obnoxious individuals you ’re going to come into — just a liar and a cheat ” has managed to bring himself to the verge of returning as Israel ’s prime minister is something of an amazing feat .
Although perhaps not so much if you are familiar with what people in Israel euphemistically call politics .
But Netanyahu assured that he was lost before he even took office by teaming up with racist boor Avigdor Lieberman .
Together the two may fight so hard to protect Israel that they irreversibly weaken it .
8. ) A.I.G. Bonus Babies
The NY Times writes , “ Residents who had been pillars of Connecticut towns are finding themselves the focus of populist rage . ”
But should n’t we have hated them already for even wanting to be pillars of Connecticut towns ?
I mean , these people actually chose to become insurance executives and live in John Cheever hell just to become wealthy ?
Did n’t they see The Ice Storm .
Oh , the humanity !
I hate them for their stale dreams more than I do the fact they squandered one of the great names of Wall Street while gaming both global financial markets and the American taxpayer .
7. ) Ben Bernanke
In ancient societies , dark uncontrollable forces were placated by throwing virgins into volcanoes .
In Washington , the ritual involves throwing officials under the bus .
( The bus is implacable but near - sighted .
As it approaches one victim , it will be at least temporarily satisfied if that victim throws someone else in its path . )
Edward Liddy was in front of the bus this week during Congressional hearings and at the last minute , threw Bernanke in its path by saying the Fed knew everything A.I.G. was doing re : bonuses .
But later the bus claimed other more delicious victims and Bernanke escaped … then he announced the U.S. government was going to print a trillion dollars in monopoly money to stem the crisis .
Inflation was a near certainty before … now it will be Bernanke ’s inflation .
No one will even remember he had anything to do with A.I.G. … and that wo n’t be a good thing .
6. ) Tim Geithner
Sadly for Tim Geithner , he even looks like a sacrificial lamb .
Earnest , brilliant , trying his best , he will never be able to escape the fact that he is one of the few who will get the blame for both the misguided Bush era bailouts and the false - starts of the Obama administration .
Every time there is a mistake , the bus will head in his direction .
Obama says he has confidence in Geithner .
That is exactly what they said about Tom Daschle before they pulled the plug on him .
Heck , Obama said he would no sooner disown Jeremiah Wright than his own grandmother shortly before he disowned him , as they say , with prejudice .
Geithner might survive , but he has been wounded .
The good news for the economy : sometimes they say people who have been through near death experiences actually develop psychic powers .
5. ) Asif Ali Zardari
Zardari was known to be a bad guy long before he became Pakistan ’s president .
Many of the closest friends of his late wife , Benazir Bhutto , could not stand him .
Now , as it turns out , neither can most of the Pakistani people .
Locked in a bitter struggle with opposition leader Nawaz Sharif , Zardari showed his weakness by capitulating to demands to reinstate Pakistan ’s former Chief Justice per Sharif ’s demands .
Now in a desperate attempt to reassert control of his own party he may be plotting the ouster of his Prime Minister according to Indian press reports .
He ’s on the ropes , his opposition is gaining strength , and meanwhile fraught , dangerous , complex Pakistan is hardly being governed at all .
4. ) Chris Dodd
The Nutmeg State ’s longest - serving senator got his job the old - fashioned way , he [ effectively ] inherited it from his father , Sen. Thomas Dodd .
He is also now virtually certain to lose it the old - fashioned way , as a result of a combination of arrogance , corruption , lying , and misreading the mood of the times .
From his questionable home - mortgage finances to the comedy of errors this week when he denied having anything to do with legislative provisions allowing the A.I.G. bonus then blamed it on his staff then blamed it on the Treasury , Dodd is serving himself up on a silver platter to his opponents .
And none of that even addresses the issue that as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee he was at the center of a fat - donations - from - Wall Street - equals - zero - oversight - from - Congress culture that helped get the world into this mess in the first place .
3. ) Bernie Madoff
What more can you say about Bernie ?
For a decade and a half he went to bed every night knowing that he was lying , cheating , faking trades , committing fraud , and putting his and countless other families at grievous risk .
And yet he lived his life like a king , like the former chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers that he was , with yachts and mansions in the Hamptons and Mayfair .
In fact , noted judge of character and bankruptcy - addict Donald Trump said “ he was a pretty respected guy . ”
That says it all .
2. ) The pope
To non-believers he may be just a creepy old ex-Hitler Youth member who wears funny clothes and has appalling values , but to Catholics he is so much more than that .
For example , according to one Vatican insider quoted in the U.K. ’s Daily Telegraph newspaper , “ he ’s out of touch with the real world ” and his papacy is “ a disaster . ”
Another is reported to have said he “ is isolated and fails to adequately consult his advisors . ”
At least .
His Africa trip pronouncement that condoms not only do n’t help the fight against AIDS but that their distribution actually “ aggravates the problems ” is not just a PR nightmare for the Holy See ; delivered on the continent where both AIDS is most rampant and the Church is growing fastest , it is a formula for massive death and suffering .
1. ) Josef Fritzl
Back in the good old days , when Joseph Alois Ratzinger was a little boy , being an Austrian sadist was a surefire path to the top , it could lead anywhere , perhaps even to world domination .
But today , Austrians are outraged that one of their own could have locked his daughter in the basement , made her his sex slave , and killed one of the seven children he had with her .
Which is really bad .
Austria has changed , you see .
There is no tolerance for twisted brutality there anymore .
Well , less .
In fact , fewer than a third of Austrians voted for the hate - spewing , neo - fascist extreme right parties like the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future .
And while cynics ( Jews or Muslims ) might point out that this was the same proportion of the population who voted for Austria ’s leading party , the Social Democrats , their point is undercut by the fact that it was only a relatively few Austrians who honor Nazi heroes in public ceremonies on the anniversary of Kristalnacht or who have participated in nasty little rituals like the recent unfurling of a Nazi flag in Hitler ’s hometown of Braunau .
No , there is no place for a Fritzl in modern Austria and so he will be sent to a psychiatric prison for the rest of his life .
But one must wonder , is the outrage because of his crimes , because they were against fellow Austrians or because he thought so small ?

You 're not Googling us : The Blairs , House of Commons and Google boss wo n't have THEIR privacy invaded on Street View
Tony and Cherie Blair :
You wo n't find their London house on Google 's Street View
Google was at the centre of new controversy last night after pictures of Tony Blair ’s London home were mysteriously removed from its Street View web service .
Images of the House of Commons , the entrance to Downing Street and several Government departments were also blacked out .
And it also emerged that Google ’s own boss in the UK does not have his London house on Street View .
Anyone typing Mr Blair ’s address into the website , which allows people to see 360 - degree pictures of streets , including close - ups of houses and buildings , is met with the message : ‘ This image is no longer available . ’
While the front of Mr Blair ’s house has been blacked out , it is still visible from a slightly different angle .
Ironically , when the Blairs bought their Connaught Square townhouse they installed closed - circuit TV cameras around the building to address their ‘ security needs ’ – provoking anger from neighbours .
Critics also pointed out that while in office Mr Blair presided over a ‘ surveillance society ’ .
There appeared to be some confusion yesterday over why the Foreign Office and the Treasury buildings on Whitehall had been removed , while other departments such as the Northern Ireland Office and the Ministry of Defence remained visible .
The Treasury and the Foreign Office denied that any representations had been made to Google .
But a Google spokesman said : ‘ We would never proactively remove or blur a property and we only do so on request from the owners .
For public buildings such as a Government office , the request would have to be made in an official capacity . ’
No entry : Google 's car - mounted cameras could n't go down this private West London road , where the company 's UK boss Dennis Woodside happens to live
One theory is that the Metropolitan Police may have been concerned about images of officers in front of the buildings appearing on the website .
Despite assurances from Google about blurring people ’s faces , the face of one officer guarding the Blair home was visible .
Scotland Yard was unable to shed any light on the issue , saying it did not discuss security matters .
Mr Woodside wo n't have his privacy invaded online - but the rest of us are n't so lucky
Last night , in the absence of any explanation for the removal of the pictures , campaigners mocked the Government ’s apparent double standards .
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said :
‘ It is delicious irony , even a modern morality tale , when those who have perpetrated so much snooping protest personal privacy for themselves .
‘ So much for “ nothing to hide , nothing to fear ! ” Perhaps we all have something to fear after all . ’
Guy Herbert of campaign group NO2ID said : ‘ It is astonishing that a Government which gave council tax valuation officials the power to enter your home and take photos of it from the inside should worry about what ordinary people can see of their properties from the outside . ’
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said : ‘ Perhaps the Government will now understand why there is so much concern about the extent of all their plans to monitor the lives of the people they represent . ’
It was also unclear why the front of the House of Commons , viewed from Parliament Square , had been blacked out – but was clearly visible from other angles .
It is still possible to view the rear of the Commons from Westminster Bridge , for instance , and even zoom in on the riverside terrace , popular among MPs in the summer .
The Serjeant at Arms is the official responsible for maintaining law and order in and around the Commons , but her office was unavailable for comment last night .
Anyone in the world can now see close - up online pictures of millions of houses and buildings , sometimes even through windows , and it is thought that many celebrities will also be opting out of the service .
Some people , however , managed to escape the all - seeing spy cameras .
Among them is Dennis Woodside , the boss of Google UK .
Before : The Google image of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament ...
After : ... but it was subsequently removed due to security fears
Mr Woodside was spared inclusion because his £ 2 million West London townhouse stands on a private road , inaccessible to his company ’s camera cars .
Typing his postcode into the search engine merely sends users to a nearby street .
The 40 - year - old American , who lives in the house with his wife Laura and two children , has been Google ’s head of operations in the UK since 2006 and oversaw the complex implementation of Street View .
Launched last Thursday , the service appears to have attracted more awe than anger about privacy invasion .
Google spokeswoman Laura Scott said requests from members of the public for images of themselves or their homes to be removed ran into the ‘ hundreds ’ .
‘ I ca n’t be precise about the figure but it ’s below 1,000 , which is n’t bad considering tens of millions of locations can be seen on the site , ’ she said .
Among the images removed are a man emerging from a sex shop in Soho and a reveller vomiting outside an East London pub .
The screen now just says : ‘ This image is no longer available ’ on a black background .
At the launch of the service , the company pledged to blur all faces and number plates using special software .
A spokesman for the Information Commissioner ’s Office said it will investigate any complaints .
‘ The ICO is satisfied that Google is putting in place adequate safeguards to minimise any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals , ’ he said .
‘ Individuals who have raised concerns with Google and who do not think they have received a satisfactory response can raise that concern with the ICO . ’
One of the cameras used to record streets for Google Street View
The images are not ‘ live ’ but were taken by a fleet of Google cars last summer as they drove along more than 2,000 miles of public roads .
Within hours of going live the service , available through the Google Maps website , had attracted millions of hits .
But despite Google ’s pledge to protect privacy , not all faces and numberplates were blurred , and some people were easily recognisable .
Street View was launched in America two years ago and has since been expanded to cities in France , Italy , Spain , Australia , New Zealand and Japan .
The British version features tens of millions of photos of 25 cities including London , Edinburgh , Cardiff , Manchester , Oxford and Leeds .
More towns and cities will be added over the next few years , and the photos are expected to be updated every two or three years .
Google believes Street View will be popular with shoppers trying to find stores , drinkers looking for pubs , and house buyers wanting to find out more about neighbourhoods .
The service is free and available on personal computers and to those with a mobile phone , including iPhones and BlackBerrys .
Google ’s Ed Parsons said the company would black out any photographs if homeowners objected to their properties being on display using an online form .
‘ Privacy is really important to us , ’ he said .
‘ We recognise that there have been concerns about that and we think we have addressed those concerns .
‘ The images you see on Street View are the same images you would see if you were to walk or drive down the road yourself . ’
How to get your house removed
To remove your house from Street View , visit the website and click on the words ‘ Report a concern ’ in the bottom left of the screen .
Then click ‘ privacy concerns ’ , followed by ‘ my house ’ then ‘ I have seen a picture of my house and would like it removed ’ .
A Google spokeswoman said requests for images to be removed were nearly always complied with .
‘ All we ask is that the reporting form is filled in correctly .
‘ If someone wants their house taken off , we will do what they want but only after we have verified that they are the homeowner . ’
It 's quite easy , wandering round the small town of Billund , to start believing in the existence of a Lego god .
You can't help but feel a master intelligence is at work here - the place is so manifestly wholesome , the street plan so well ordered , the pavements so tidy .
Unostentatious automobiles proceed slowly along all - but - empty roads , stopping politely for pedestrians nowhere near a zebra crossing .
A jovial red-and - yellow Lego giant points towards the town centre ; huge coloured bricks lie scattered as if awaiting deployment in some exemplary new civic amenity ( except that , being Denmark , it 's not immediately apparent what else the town might need ) .
I half - expect to be plucked from the pavement , brushed up a bit and plumped down in front of the smart rectangular building labelled Head Office : Lego A/S .
My goal here is to find out how , in the teeth of global recession and barely five years since it was being read the last rites , one of the world 's best - loved brands has come back from the dead .
For Lego , born of an earlier and tougher depression , is positively revelling in this one : the little studded , primary - coloured bricks are selling like never before .
In Britain alone , the company 's turnover last year was up 51 % .
Its home town , though , is a bit too much for some people .
" I could n't ever live here , " admits Mads Nipper , who looks and - when it comes to plastic bricks - acts about 12 , but turns out to be one of the company 's executive vice - presidents .
" I 'm nuts about Lego , believe me ; I eat , sleep and breathe the stuff .
But there 's a bit too much of it around here even for me . "
I got my first Lego set at the age of five .
Bits of it are still in a chest at my parents ' house : a grey plastic base board , an assortment of rectangular red-and - white bricks , a few square ones , roof tiles , beams , a little door that opens and shuts , a red - framed window with three transparent panes , red wheels with grey rubber tyres .
Exactly the same set is on display in the Lego Idea House in Billund , the front of the box adorned with a carefree 1960s kid in a home - knitted sweater who could almost , bar the unnaturally blond curls , have been me .
Just along from that set , though , is a selection of Bionicles , fierce warrior - robots with strange Polynesian names who live on the mythical - mystical isle of Mata Nui and fight each other with an array of unwholesome - looking weapons .
My boy , now eight , liked those a lot a while ago .
Now he is more into the Lego Star Wars Magnaguard Starfighter , whose 431 - piece complexities he ( and I ) spent many hours wrestling with over Christmas .
That is on display in Billund , too .
Charlotte Simonsen , the company 's spokeswoman , says more than 400 million people will play with Lego this year .
After 50 - odd years of production , there are apparently 62 Lego bricks for every man , woman and child on the planet .
And most of us , I 'd imagine , would say we felt pretty warmly towards these little chunks of injection - moulded acrylonitrile butadiene styrene .
Some would go considerably further .
Lego reckons it has maybe 250,000 Afols , or Adult Fans of Lego , around the globe .
They gather for mammoth week - long conventions with names such as BrickFest , and vie with each other to build the World 's Largest Lego Boat ( 14ft 7in long ; 300,000 bricks ) , construct the Biggest Lego Train Layout Ever ( 3,343ft , and it ran through an entire Lego cityscape ) or beat the Fastest Time to Build the Lego Imperial Star Destroyer ( 3,104 pieces ; five builders maximum and no pre-sorting allowed ; record : 1 hour 42 minutes 43 seconds ) .
There are enthusiasts out there who make animated film shorts using characters and sets built solely of Lego .
A man called Brendan Powell Smith has built The Brick Testament - 2,000 scenes from the bible - using Lego .
And half a dozen people are Lego Certified Professionals : company - accredited creative artists whose working medium is Lego .
I 'm not sure how many of them , mind you , awakened by some nocturnal commotion , have rushed bleary - eyed into their children 's bedroom at dead of night and stepped on a Lego brick in their bare feet .
Had they done so , they would surely have cursed Lego and all its works , and wished Ole Kirk Christiansen had never been born back in 1891 .
Christiansen was the inventor of Lego ; his descendants still own the company today .
He was a journeyman carpenter , son of a farm labourer , one child among 13 .
Kirsten Stadelhofer , a Lego employee for more than 30 years ( " Plenty of people here , " she says , " do 40 . " ) tells me Ole Kirk 's story .
In 1916 , he bought a small workshop , the Billund Maskinsnedkeri .
In it he produced furniture , tools , stepladders , ironing boards , footstools , and , sometime in 1932 , in the middle of the Great Depression , toys .
To cheer the children up , he said .
Christiansen was by all accounts a good man , bespectacled , balding , universally liked .
In 1934 he decided his growing company needed a rather catchier name than Billund Maskinsnedkeri and alighted on Lego , a contraction of the Danish leg godt , or play well .
( It can also be construed to mean " I put together " in Latin . )
At that stage he and his half - dozen employees turned out brightly coloured wooden cars , fire engines , pullalong chickens and quacking ducks .
Christiansen was smart : when a 1930s yo - yo craze died , he sawed his stock in half .
Each yo - yo made two wheels for a toy truck .
Quality was the watchword .
Det beste er ikke for godt was his motto , or ( roughly ) , Not even the best is good enough .
Once , when his son Godtfred , who had worked in the factory since he was 12 and would eventually take it over , boasted that he had saved money by applying only two coats of varnish to a batch of toy ducks rather than the usual three , Christiansen made him go back and rectify his error , through the night , on his own .
" Lots of people , " says Stadelhofer sternly , " might say that since it is only for children , it does n't have to be well made .
Ole Kirk thought that since it was for children , it could never be good enough . "
In 1947 , Lego bought Denmark 's first injection - moulding machine and began making toys with some plastic components ; its first big 100 % plastic hit was a model Ferguson tractor , produced for Christmas 1951 .
Then , in 1949 , Christiansen came across some intriguing English - made plastic building blocks called Kiddicraft , designed by a Hilary Harry Fisher Page , with little round studs on the top .
Inspired , Lego started producing its own Automatic Binding Bricks .
The Lego System of Play - how virtuous it sounds now - was launched , to widespread indifference , in 1955 .
It consisted of 28 building sets , eight vehicles , various supplementary components , all interchangeable ( as they still are ; Lego bricks from the 1950s connect with their 2009 counterparts ) .
The problem was , none of it really stuck together : the bricks were hollow .
After much painful experimentation , Godtfred , by now vice - president , patented the studs - and - tubes mechanism that made the system stable in January 1958 .
A toy that grasps simply , brilliantly even , what millions of children ( and their parents ) want , that today sells seven sets a second and has twice been named Toy of the Century , was born .
It would be nice to say Lego has n't looked back since , but it would n't be true .
At first , it did seem as if the company could do no wrong .
In 1962 , it expanded fast and furiously into Sweden , Belgium , France , Britain , America .
The first Legoland , in Billund , opened in 1968 , drawing an unprecedented 625,000 visitors in its inaugural summer to somewhere even the locals concede is quite a long way from anywhere .
To Lego City ( the original town plan with its streets , houses , fire and police stations , unchanged in essence since 1955 ) were added Lego sets themed around space , robots , vikings , castles , space , the wild west and pirates - the first even remotely unfriendly looking Lego mini-figures , unshaven and scowling and carrying ( heavens ! ) weapons .
Then in the 1990s came the licensed products : Star Wars , Harry Potter , Bob the Builder , SpongeBob SquarePants , Indiana Jones .
And then things started to go awry .
" We 'd lost sight of what we were good at , " says Simonsen .
" There were other reasons too : the market was changing fast , children were getting older younger , computer games were really taking off .
But basically , we'd got into movies , clothes , software games , own - brand stores , theme parks from Windsor to California - all non-core stuff that was absorbing vital management capacity .
We 'd moved far , far away from what we did well . "
Suddenly , unthinkably , Lego was losing money .
And not in a small way : after several years of increasingly heavy losses , in January 2004 the company reported a record deficit of Dkr1.4bn ( £ 144 m ) .
Crippling debts amounted to more than Dkr5bn .
There was fevered speculation that the Christiansen family ( now , confusingly , spelled Kristiansen ) would be forced to flog it , or large parts of it , to some all - American , plastic - fantastic interloper such as Mattel .
All Denmark mourned .
Instead , Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen , Ole Kirk 's grandson , took a deep breath and appointed a 36 - year - old former McKinsey 's management consultant called Jorgen Vig Knudstorp to dismantle Lego 's sprawling house brick by brick , then put it back together again .
Assets , including the Legoland theme parks , were sold .
Whole product lines ( particularly those for girls , with whom Lego has always had trouble engaging ) were axed .
More than 1,000 of the company 's 3,500 jobs in Billund went , a shocking experience for a town whose pristine , ultra- automated factories produce some 36,000 Lego elements every minute - but one that seems , astonishingly , to have been accepted .
" This town is n't just about Lego any more , you know , " observes a woman who asked to be called just Birgita , perching her youngest son on the back of her bicycle outside the supermarket .
" It has n't been for a long time .
We 're proud of Lego , certainly , but there are lots of other companies , lots of other jobs here now .
The good thing was that all that happened when the rest of the economy was still in quite good shape .
Heaven knows what it would have been like today , with half the world collapsing . "
In two days in Billund I did n't meet anyone who felt Lego had behaved badly during the bad times .
People were were looked after , retrained , and found other jobs .
" In fact now we 're doing well again , lots have come back , " says Stadelhofer .
" It 's sounds like a cliche but really , Lego is a family . "
It does feel a bit like that .
The factories and packing centres may be operated largely by robots and automatic cranes , shuttling noiselessly between moulding machine , warehouse and sorting station with trays of green cacti , grey pirate swords and translucent spaceship windshields , but elsewhere gangs of cheerful Danish women pack boxes , engineers in white coats check tolerances - accurate , they say , to within 0.0002 of a millimetre - and the canteen at lunchtime is a warm uproar .
The creative labs , though , are strictly off - limits .
Five years after reporting its heaviest ever loss , Lego last month said its net profit for 2008 had soared 32 % to DKr1.35bn , on sales up a healthy 18.7 % .
Part of this recession - busting feat , Nipper concedes , is down to the fact that in times of trouble , consumers - in this case , parents - turn to " the well - known , the safe , the durable .
Lego may not be the cheapest toy , but parents know it has stood the test of time , it will last years , provide hours of quality play , represent good value for their hard - earned money " .
But also , he insists , Lego is cool again for kids .
" Kids are ruthless little bastards , " he says , only half in jest .
" If they do n't like the product , then at the end of the day the best marketing and distribution and all the rest of it wo n't make any difference .
All you 'll be doing is controlling the damage .
What counts , all that counts , is that you 're at the top of kids ' wishlists .
Which is , now , where we are again . "
How to stay there , though , amid the combined onslaught of PlayStation and Xbox and Nintendo ?
It wo n't be easy .
Nipper says
Lego is confident children will continue to play with physical toys , although the company is active in the world of virtual play : an independent partner develops and markets successful console games based on Lego 's Star Wars and Indiana Jones ranges , and Lego itself will be launching a children 's MMOG - massively multiplayer online game - called Lego Universe next year .
Its ultimate goal , though , is somehow to integrate physical and virtual play .
It is part of the way there : the website factory .
lego.com allows you to download simple 3D design software , create a Lego toy online , then order the parts to build it ; and there 's a pretty funky robot , Mindstorms , for older children and adults , which communicates wirelessly with your computer and can be programmed to climb stairs , say , or select only the green M&Ms from a pile .
But Nipper dreams of a " seamless melding " of two interrelated worlds : a day when playing with a physical toy in a bedroom will somehow change its characteristics in an online multiplayer game , for example .
Or vice versa .
" Imagine , " he says , " if kids were telling their playmates : ' Hey !
Guess what !
If you clip a set of shoulder pads on to this guy , he gets three times as many strength points online ! '
That would be the holy grail .
But we 're not there yet . "
In the meantime , Lego is looking to a completely new venture .
A British designer , Cephas Howard ( who previously worked at the Guardian ) has overseen the development of a series of 10 games , made mostly of existing Lego bricks and other components .
First , you have to build them .
Then , once you 've played them , you can tinker with the board ( by rebuilding it differently ) or the dice , and see how the game changes .
They wo n't be out until August , and much surrounding them is still secret .
But the one I played with Howard in an office in Billund was an absolute cracker , based on the Ludo " get to the middle " principle , but with some very neat additions .
" When I was a kid , " Howard says , " I had two passions : Lego and boardgames .
Lego was great for imagination and creativity , but it was a solitary occupation .
Boardgames were great for socialising , but they 're not very creative .
It seemed to me that if you combine the two , you might be on to something . "
Howard 's games have n't been launched yet , but already they 're hoovering up innovation prizes at leading toy fairs .
That Lego god , I 'd say , is smiling .
I love to see your artwork !
If you have a picture you drew or colored that you would like me to see , ask your parents * to send it to my friend Peggy at peggymiller@objectiveministries.org , along with your first name and age .
Everyone who sends me a picture will be in my prayers !
Here are some of the super pictures that you have sent me ...
Howard - Phillips ( 10 ) drew Jesus making a new friend !
" It shows Jesus with an squid monster named Kootooloo .
Because Jesus loves everybodey ,
even squid monsters and sinners .
I hope my pictere will help others find Jesus . "
Monsters are just God 's creations
who have n't been hugged by Jesus yet !
Brittany ( 13 ) drew me with Shotacat
showing our love for Jesus !
Yay !
I do n't know who Shotacat is
but I like his style !
Nice shirt !
Jonathan ( 9 ) drew this with the help of his big sister ...
" I have been practising my witnessing techniques
every day before bedtime and when I tried
them on the devil he wanted to be my friend
so here is a picture of me , Jesus and the
devil all being friends together .
I hope very
much that Lambuel likes it and comes to play
with us all too . "
If only the devil would stop being such a jealous meanie
and accept Jesus ' Love ... then we could all play together
instead of having a huge war !
Would n't that be nicer ?
Matthew ( 13 ) shows us what that war might look like ...
In 1000 YEARS ( that 's 1/6 the age of the Universe ! )
you , me , and all the saved people who disappeared in the Rapture
will descend down from Heaven with Jesus to New Jerusalem and
bring a Final Judgment to the people left behind !
Those unsaveds
who rejected the mean old devil will get to stay with Jesus and us in
His Kingdom on New Earth and live forever in our new glorified bodies !
Is n't that nice of Him to give the unsaveds a second
chance , even though they rejected Him ?
Jesus really does Love everyone !
Great job !
Send me more pictures * and remember ...
Jesus & I You !
In this series , I 've explained how to use Test : : Class in Perl , how to reuse Test : : Class tests , and how to simplify Test : : Class tests , and how to manage data dependencies and fixtures with Test : : Class tests .
If you 've followed along -- and if you 've written your own tests with Test : : Class , you 're on your way to becoming a testing expert .
Now it 's time to discuss some ancillary issues you may encounter .
Performance
With Test :: Class :: Load , you can run all of your test class tests in one process :
use Test :: Class :: Load qw< path/to/tests >;
That loads the tests and all modules you 're testing once .
This can be a huge performance boost if you 're loading " heavy " modules such as Catalyst or DBIx : : Class .
However , be aware that you 're now loading all classes in a single process ; there are potential drawbacks here .
For example , if one of your classes alters a singleton or global variable that another class depends on , you may get unexpected results .
Also , many classes load modules which globally alter Perl 's behavior .
Grep through your CPAN modules for UNIVERSAL : : or CORE :: GLOBAL : : to see just how many classes do this .
Global state changes can introduce difficult - to - diagnose bugs .
You will have to decide for yourself whether the benefits of Test : : Class outweigh these drawbacks .
My experience is that these bugs are usually very painful to resolve , but in finding them , I often find intermittant problems in my code bases that I could not have found any other way .
For me , Test : : Class offers many benefits , despite occasional frustrations .
People who prefer not to run all of their code in a single process often create separate " driver " tests :
#!/usr/bin/env perl - T use Test :: Person ; Test :: Class ->runtests ;
... and :
#!/usr/bin/env perl - T use Test :: Person :: Employee ; Test :: Class ->runtests ;
Remember to omit the call to runtests if you 've included this in your base class INIT .
Making Your Classes Behave Like xUnit Classes
In xUnit style tests , this is an entire test :
sub first_name : Tests ( tests =>
3 ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ person = $ test -> class - > new ; can_ok $ person , ' first_name ' ; ok ! defined $ person -> first_name , '... and first_name should start out undefined ' ; $ person -> first_name ( ' John ' ) ; is $ person -> first_name , ' John ' , '... and setting its value should succeed ' ; }
The TAP world considers this as three tests , but xUnit regards these three assertions as validations of a single feature , and thus one test .
TAP - based tests have a long way to go before working for xUnit users , but there 's one thing we can do .
Suppose that you have a test with 30 asserts .
The fourth assert fails .
Many xUnit programmers argue that once an assert fails , the rest of the information in the test is unreliable .
In that case , the test driver often halts .
Regardless of whether you agree ( I hate that JUnit requires the test method to stop ) , you can get this behavior with Test : : Class .
Use Test :: Most instead of Test :: More and put this in your test base class :
BEGIN { $ ENV{DIE_ON_FAIL} = 1 }
Because each test method in Test : : Class is wrapped in an eval , that test method will stop running , the appropriate teardown method ( if any ) will execute and the tests will resume with the next test method .
I 'm not a huge fan of this technique , but your mileage may vary .
Conclusion
While many projects work just fine using simple Test :: More programs , larger projects can wind up with scalability problems .
Test :: Class gives you better opportunities for managing your tests , refactoring common code , and having your test code better mirror your production code .
Here 's a quick summary of tips in this series :
Name your test classes consistently after the classes they 're testing .
When possible , do the same for your test methods .
Do n't use a constructor test named new .
. Create your own Test :: Class base class .
base class .
Abstract the the name of the class you 're testing into a class method in your base class .
method in your base class .
Name test control methods after their attribute .
Decide case - by - case whether to call a control method 's parent method .
Do n't put tests in your test control methods .

PROVIDENCE , R.I. ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Rhode Island is a tiny state with big problems .
With just over one million residents , it ranks in the top 10 in terms of foreclosure , unemployment and state budget crunches .
CNNMoney.com traveled there in early January to witness the hard times up close .
Over the next five days , we will use Rhode Island to illuminate the real economy on Main Street -- and give voice to kitchen table conversations across America -- as Washington debates how to get the nation back on track .
We will tell the stories of the jobless returning to school to learn new trades and the senior citizens feeling the pinch of state budget cuts .
We will talk to renters being evicted because their landlords are facing foreclosure and spend time with a community housing group hoping to use federal funds to turn around a neighborhood suffering from the mortgage meltdown .
And we will let Rhode Islanders tell you , in their own words , how they are coping .
Take Cheryl Smith - DuBois of Bristol .
Her husband , a carpenter , is out of work and the couple is trying to scrape by on his unemployment and her job as a Mobil cashier .
Looking to save every penny , she hardly gets to see her grandchild , who lives less than 15 minutes away , because she 's trying to save on gas .
" It 's hard to live within a box , " said Smith - DuBois , 61 .
Smith - DuBois ' struggles and Rhode Island 's plight are common .
States around the country are reeling from one of the worst economic and financial crises since the Great Depression .
As people lose their jobs and stores lose their customers , states are seeing their income and sales tax revenues dwindle .
Declines in business profits only exacerbate the problem , driving down corporate tax revenues .
The confluence of these trends means many states are wrestling with multi-million budget deficits and cutting services and personnel .
Some 45 states faced or are predicting shortfalls in their budgets for this year or next , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a Washington think tank .
At least 41 states and the District of Columbia have mid-year budget gaps totaling $ 43 billion , or nearly 9 % of their collective budgets .
" The picture will get worse , at least in the first half of 2009 , " said Robert Ward , deputy director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government .
" Beyond that , we can hope that the picture starts to get better or at least stabilizes . "
Budget gaps in Rhode Island
Rhode Island is scrambling to close a $ 350 million gap in its budget for the 2009 fiscal year , which began July 1 .
This shortfall comes after the state already slashed services and reduced personnel to plug a $ 425 million deficit in its $ 6.9 billion budget at the start of the fiscal year .
Last year , the state cut in half community service grants that assist the elderly , the youth and the poor ; tightened the requirements for health coverage for low - income parents , and reduced funding for public colleges by $ 19.5 million , forcing them to hike tuition by as much as 10 % for the fall semester and even more for the spring .
To deal with the mid-year gap , Gov. Donald Carcieri has proposed slicing 6 % of aid to municipalities and eliminating some retirement benefits for state workers , such as the annual inflation adjustment .
It is also depending on federal aid to see it through .
" I am very concerned that the economy is continuing to slide , " said Carcieri in a televised address earlier this month .
" While this plan closes the gap as of today , we could be facing more shortfalls by the end of this fiscal year . "
Even without these state service cuts , Rhode Island residents are feeing the pain .
As manufacturing and other jobs disappeared , the state 's unemployment rate zoomed to 10 % in December , the highest in more than three decades and more than double what it was a year ago .
Its November rate of 9.3 % was the second highest in the nation .
And homeowners , who enjoyed a meteoric rise in housing values during the real estate boom , are dealing with a 3.18 % foreclosure rate , the 10th highest in the United States , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
States in trouble
Other states are also suffering in the economic downturn .
Michigan is coping with an unemployment rate of 10.6 % , amid the auto industry 's decline .
Florida and Nevada , which have the highest number of homes in foreclosure at 7.3 % and 5.6 % , respectively , are trying to rebuild their housing markets .
And , during his annual State of the State address earlier this month , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said California is " in a state of emergency " and faces insolvency within weeks in the wake of a projected $ 42 billion deficit .
Recognizing the dire straits of the states , President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are planning to pump billions into their economies as part of an $ 825 billion stimulus package .
States will get more money for a wide range of services , including education , senior nutrition and infrastructure projects .
" This recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states , workers , and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession , " Obama said in a speech earlier this month .
" Government at every level will have to tighten its belt , but we 'll help struggling states avoid harmful budget cuts , as long as they take responsibility and use the money to maintain essential services like police , fire , education , and health care . "

Is it a crime to take pictures ?
By Victoria Bone
BBC News
Photographers staged a mass photo call in protest at the law
From today , anyone taking a photograph of a police officer could be deemed to have committed a criminal offence .
That is because of a new law - Section 76 of the Counter Terrorism Act - which has come into force .
It permits the arrest of anyone found " eliciting , publishing or communicating information " relating to members of the armed forces , intelligence services and police officers , which is " likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism " .
That means anyone taking a picture of one of those people could face a fine or a prison sentence of up to 10 years , if a link to terrorism is proved .
The law has angered photographers , both professional and amateur , who fear it could exacerbate the harassment they already sometimes face .
On Monday , a group is gathering outside New Scotland Yard for a " mass picture - taking session " in protest .
The event is organised by the National Union of Journalists .
It insists the right to take pictures in public places is " a precious freedom " that must be safeguarded .
NUJ organiser John Toner said : " Police officers are in news pictures at all sorts of events - football matches , carnivals , state processions - so the union wants to make it clear that taking their pictures is not the act of a criminal . "
The problems we can see arising are with junior officers using the legislation to overcome situations they find uncomfortable

Innocent photographer or terrorist ?
' Suspicious circumstances '
The British Journal of Photography recently reported an incident involving a photographer in Cleveland who was stopped by a police officer while taking pictures of ships .
He was asked if he was connected to terrorism , which he was n't , and told his details would be kept on file .
A Cleveland police spokeswoman told the journal that " in order to verify a person 's actions as being entirely innocent , " anyone in " suspicious circumstances " could be asked to explain themselves .
Photojournalist Marc Vallée is among those angry at the law .
He specialises in covering protests and fears for the implications of Section 76 .
" Alarm bells really are ringing , " he told the BBC News website .
" I know some of it sounds a bit funny .
Train spotters being stopped for taking pictures , that sort of thing , but I 've spoken to people who 've been on their own , at night and they 're surrounded by several officers .
It can be intimidating .
" It may be that officers are just doing their best with a bad law , but if that 's the case , they need guidance to tell them , ' Stop harassing photographers . ' "
Mr Vallée also pointed out that members of the Royal Family were part of the Armed Forces .
" Are we going to be stopped from photographing them ? " he said .
Photographers say they are frequently being stopped and searched ' Outrageous '
The NUJ said some police officers wrongly believed they had the right to delete photographers ' images .
Other critics , meanwhile , fear the new law could inhibit their right to peaceful , democratic protest .
Leo Murray is a spokesman for climate change campaign group Plane Stupid .
His members film any direct action they take .
" It 's outrageous , " he told the BBC News website .
" It 's yet another in a long line of measures designed to erode people 's civil liberties .
" Being able to film the police has completely changed the way they are able to police our protests .
It 's made us much , much safer and the risks of a violent confrontation have almost disappeared .
" If we could n't film they could act with impunity , they could just mete out violence with the confidence that nobody would find out .
" There 's absolutely no way we are going to observe this ban .
If they try to bring charges against us we will fight them in the courts . "
In a statement , Number 10 said that while there were no legal restrictions on taking pictures in public places , " the law applies to photographers as it does to anybody else " .
" So there may be situations in which the taking of photographs may cause or lead to public order situations , inflame an already tense situation , or raise security considerations , " it said .
Photographers could therefore be asked to " move on " for the safety of themselves or others .
" Each situation will be different and it would be an operational matter for the police officer concerned as to what action should be taken , " the statement added .
Junior officers
This discretion , however , is what some feel is the key problem with the law .
Critics fear the new law could stop them photographing legitimate protests Neil Turner , vice chairman of the British Press Photographers '
Association , said he believed there was no intention among senior ranks of the police to prevent legitimate photography .
" The problems that we can see arising are with junior officers using the legislation to overcome situations that they find uncomfortable or where they make judgements about photography and do n't know how to apply the legislation on the ground , " he said .
" We firmly expect that there will be inappropriate uses of the act and that someone will end up in front of a judge before there is some clarity and before the purpose of the act is properly defined . "
The Metropolitan Police insisted the law was intended to protect counter - terrorism officers and any prosecution would have to be in the public interest .
" For the offence to be committed , the information would have to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to provide practical assistance to terrorists , " it said .
" Taking photographs of police officers would not , except in very exceptional circumstances , be caught by this offence . "

Is there any trade crazier than the liquid biofuel business ?
Apart from a handful of cars and vans running on used chip fat , it exists only because of government rules and subsidies .
So what social benefits do these buy ?
Biofuels are supposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
They do the opposite .
Almost all of them produce more greenhouse gases than petrol ( gasoline ) or diesel , for two reasons : • emissions of nitrous oxide ( a very powerful greenhouse gas ) caused by the application of nitrogen fertilisers
• the destruction of grassland , wetland and forest caused by the expansion of agriculture stimulated by this new market ( see this study on the biofuel carbon debt and this one on biofuels increasing greenhouse gases
Biofuels - especially biodiesel made from palm oil - also cause other kinds of environmental havoc .
They are now among the major drivers of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia , wrecking tens of millions of hectares of primary forest and driving orang - utans and other wildlife towards extinction
And they help to starve the world .
Last year , the global food crunch was caused by a decline in the world 's stockpiles of cereals : they fell by around 53 m tonnes .
The production of biofuels consumed almost 100 m tonnes .
The extra millions who died as a result of malnutrition - related diseases when the price of grain rose last year did so largely because we took their food to put in our tanks .
Yet all motorists in this country are forced by law to participate in this crime against humanity .
Why ?
Because , by taking into account only some of the emissions produced by biofuels , the government can claim to be cutting greenhouse gas production , thereby helping it to meet the legally binding targets in its climate change act .
Because it means that people can carry on driving without constraint , this policy causes the government no political pain .
It is exchanging political convenience at home for the lives of people overseas .
In the US the biofuel business is stimulated by a series of massive subsidies , running into hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
Yesterday the European Union imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs on US biodiesel on the grounds that the subsidies there are distorting trade , unfairly harming biodiesel producers over here .
There 's already plenty of aggro being generated over the Buy American clause in the US stimulus plan : this new decision could be explosive .
So here 's what we gain from the biofuels trade : 1 . Global environmental destruction
2 . Higher greenhouse gas emissions
3 . Mass starvation
4 . The loss of hundreds of millions of dollars
5 . The prospect of a new trade war .
Is there anyone out there who still thinks they are a good idea ?

Teenager Conor
Black died minutes after he was stabbed
An illiterate teenager who was convicted of stabbing a boy to death at a house party in Manchester has been given a life sentence .
Shane Boyd , 16 , will serve at least 11 years for murdering Conor Black in an argument over a Xbox games console .
Conor , also aged 16 , collapsed and died minutes after being stabbed outside the house in Moston last August .
Boyd , who boasted that he was " the man " after the attack , was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court last month .
Judge Clement Goldstone QC sentenced him to life , to serve a minimum of 11 years before he can be considered for parole .
Boyd had admitted manslaughter but his plea was rejected by the court .
The court heard Boyd confronted Conor outside a house party in the early hours of 16 August over the alleged theft of an Xbox console .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Boyd came out of the house and smashed his victim over the head with a can of lager , before stabbing him in the back as he turned to escape , the jury heard .
Conor ran a short distance to a grassy area where he collapsed and died .
The court heard Boyd then stood in the road shouting that he " was the best " , he " was the man " - before threatening to kill anyone who mentioned his name to police .
Judge Goldstone said : " You had already armed yourself with a knife .
" Having seen him you asked someone for a beer can with which you hit him over the head and after he was walking away from you in something of a daze , posing no threat to you , you stabbed him once in the back .
" Your initial response was to gloat and to boast to anyone who would be impressed by what you had done . "
Shane Boyd will serve at least 11 years of his sentence After the sentencing Conor 's family released a statement through Greater Manchester Police saying they were devastated by his death .
" All the hopes and dreams of a family were crushed when Conor 's life was stolen in that terrible , violent way , " it said .
" His mum lost her friend , her child , her life and that makes us so very sad and helpless . "
Det Ch Insp Serena Kennedy , of Greater Manchester Police , said Conor 's death had shown the devastating impact knives could have .
" One boy 's family is grieving the loss of his life , and today the defendant , himself a boy , will start spending his life in prison , " she said .
Boyd 's cousin , John Boyd , 20 , of the same address , was sentenced to three years in a young offenders ' institution for assault and perverting the course of justice .
The court heard that he threatened a 16 - year - old witness he mistakenly believed had told police that Shane Boyd was a murderer .

What goes on at these places ?
Anyone ever been to a swing club ?
I ’m dreadfully curious — what ’s it like ?
What are the rules , the etiquette ?
Can you go and just watch or do they find that annoying ?
By “ swing clubs ” I mean the type of establishment where you have a membership and there are scheduled parties and dances , rules and regulations , etc .
Off premises or on .
It turns out there ’s such a club in the city where I live , and I ’m told by my gentleman friend that an acquaintance of his ( from work no less ) can refer us to the proprietors .
I ’m not the type to want to get naked with strangers , but I certainly am the type who has always wanted to indulge an untried voyeuristic inclination .
So , the more anyone can tell me about what goes on at these parties , the better .
I ’ll know if I want to try and go to one …or two or three or …
Interview with Spencer Sherman , Financial Adviser and Author of The Cure for Money Madness
Recently I have had the privilege of interviewing Spencer Sherman , one of the top-rated wealth manager and financial adviser in the country according to Worth , and author of the recent book ‘ The Cure for Money Madness ’ .
Spencer is CEO of Abacus Wealth Partners , a fee - only independent wealth management firm .
He firmly believes that our childhood experiences and perceptions of money prevent us from making rational money decisions and the first step to a lifetime of financial prosperity and improved money relationships is to cure our money madness .
To read more about Spencer Sherman and his book please visit The Cure for Money Madness website .
Independent reviews of the book can be viewed at Arohan ’s Investing Life or at Yielding Wealth .
Spencer was kind enough to set aside some time from his busy schedule to answer a few questions that I had for him and I really appreciate his generosity .
The interview below is presented verbatim without any editing ( except for formatting ) .
Spencer ’s responses are under blockquotes .
PD : Congratulations on your recent book “ The Cure for Money Madness ” !
It really does provides for a way for all of us to conquer our inner money madness and approach financial planning in a rational manner and simplify our financial lives and relationships .
Do you have any special words of advice for many of us who are going through the current economic crisis with a fear of losing their jobs and houses ?
How should they plan for it ?
Complete an intentional spending statement with ranges for each expense category .
Pause before making any financial decision .
Pretend you are advising someone else : what would you tell him / her to do ?
Use cash only ( it ’s impossible to overspend ! ) Complete an Actual Net Worth statement Give money away .
You ca n’t be generous and fearful at the same time .
PD : What is your take on the current economic crisis ?
Do you think this represents a critical point in the US economy where we may no longer be able to achieve 10 - 11 % long term appreciation in the US stock market ?
No .
I feel that this is the perfect time to buy equities .
The valuations are highly compelling .
History tells us that stock prices return at even higher rates than 10 - 11 % during a rebound .
The best returns come at the end of a stock market declines .
PD : No where in the book do you discuss the need for an emergency fund .
Do you think a separate emergency fund is an essential part of financial planning ?
How would you recommend your readers to structure it ?
Should it be separate from one ’s investment portfolio ?
My emergency fund is part of the bond asset class percentage .
The book shows you how to calculate your bond percentage .
I recommend safe and short - term bonds .
You can then sell the short - term bonds as you need cash for living expenses .
PD : The Madoff and Allen Stanford scandals have snared even the most sophisticated investors .
How would you suggest a common investor ensure that their accounts are protected and not invested in dubious instruments ?
Do n’t invest in an unregulated structure like a hedge fund .
This gives even the most ethical person license to do very risky and concentrated investments .
Find a structured and transparent investment methodology that does n’t allow a manager to do risky or emotionally - driven investing .
If you invest in the Rainbow Portfolio , for example , you ’ll avoid a dangerous , secretive , and exotic strategy .
The best strategy is one in which the financial advisor has no discretion in terms of market timing or security selection .
A study just released from MIT shows that for the 20 year period ending 1/31/09 , only 3 % of the actively managed funds beat a simple index fund .
PD : You recommend an investment program based on your Rainbow Portfolio .
This portfolio is still overweight in US assets .
Is there a specific reason why this may be the case ?
Do you feel that going forward more international allocation may be called for ?
I ’ve increased my international allocation to 40 % .
I will continue to adjust this as the world market valuations of different countries shift .
I do overweight the US because my clients live here .
PD : For a business owner who depends on his business for income , should the business be considered a part of his or her investment portfolio and therefore considered in the asset allocation ?
For most , this would make the asset allocation very lop sided
We should be constructing an investment portfolio to hedge our risk , not increase it .
If you are in the technology business , for example , do n’t invest in technology .
PD : Even after we follow the advice in the book and simplify our financial lives considerably , there are still complications introduced by the complicated and ever changing tax and estate planning laws .
How do we find a balance ?
What I have found is that over a lifetime , people who keep things simple will make the most money .
It ’s that simple .
And , yes , find an unbiased fee - only financial advisor and spend an hour with this person every 6 months .
If you ca n’t afford or find such a person , ask a friend with common sense who has no agenda with you to be your money mentor ; you could also be his or her money mentor .
We are so much more objective and wise advising others than advising ourselves .
For those who have a net worth greater than $ 5 million , an ongoing sophisticated fee - only financial advisor is essential .
PD : What are your thoughts on kids inheriting wealth ?
Talk to them .
Prepare them for it .
The problems I have seen are with those kids who are unprepared for the responsibility .
Find out how your kids feel about inheriting the money and what they plan to do with it .
It might surprise you to learn that many might not even want the inheritance .
PD : I was interested in reading your thoughts on smart philanthropy where you recommend people invest in groups that teach people how to fish rather than hand out fish to the people and in the process try to generate a return for investors .
However , the tax policy in this country penalizes by taxing those returns and encourages giving that may not help the recipient better his / her condition by giving tax breaks to the donors .
What is your opinion on this apparent disconnect between what is best for the society versus the government policies ?
I disagree .
One has the opportunity to reinvest that money in another philinvestment or give it to a nonprofit .
You do get a deduction if you lose your money in an investment .
Only if you make money , do you get taxed .
Conversely , you do n’t get any money back from a non-profit donation .
Also , today ’s lower capital gains tax rates encourage entrepreneurial investing that will create products or services designed to solve the world ’s problems .
PD : Thank You Spencer for your time and advice !

John Beyer to Julian Petley
In 1972 Lord Denning , then Master of the Rolls , observed that the 1959 Obscene Publications Act had " misfired " so far as prosecutions are concerned .
" Much that is obscene , " he said , " has escaped the reach of the law . "
This remains the position today , and so news that the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) is mounting a prosecution under this act comes as a surprise .
Is this a calculated risk , I wondered , to show again that the law is " not fit for purpose " ?
I had thought the CPS had long ago given up on such cases because they rarely result in a conviction .
In criminal cases under this act , jurors are asked not if the material before them is obscene but if an imaginary third party who is " likely " to see it would tend to be depraved or corrupted .
Given that it was parliament 's intention to " strengthen the law concerning pornography " there can be no doubt that the law has failed because of this fundamentally flawed test .
Any objective examination of the volume and nature of pornography now compared with 50 years ago surely proves the point conclusively .
I would argue that the act should be replaced with one that actually achieves what parliament intended .
Several attempts to amend the law have failed , not because they lacked popular support , but because of parliamentary procedures .
The best option for reform , I believe , was that proposed by the late Earl of Halsbury in the House of Lords in 1980 in a debate he initiated about the Williams report , which examined the issue in the late 70s .
Halsbury suggested drawing up a list of obscene sexual imagery , but this proposal was criticised by Williams , as it could never be exhaustive .
Halsbury asked : " If it catches 90 % of what you want to catch , is that not better than catching nothing at all ? "
This gets us to the heart of the matter : do we , as a society , still regard anything as " obscene " and should " catching nothing " now be the objective ?
Julian to John
I think that what Lord Denning actually meant was that much of what he personally felt to be obscene had escaped the reach of the law !
And this is indeed the problem for many people with the Obscene Publications
Act as it stands , namely that it does n't catch works that they themselves consider obscene .
You note quite rightly that it was parliament 's intention " to strengthen the law concerning pornography " in passing the act in 1959 , but it needs to be pointed out the act was also meant " to provide for the protection of literature " .
In this respect it was a liberalising measure .
At the time it was generally thought that sexual material could be neatly divided into two classes , " literature " and " pornography " , and that the former would be protected by the new act while the latter would be caught by it .
However , partly because this distinction is actually extremely difficult to sustain in practice , a large amount of material came into circulation which the more conservative supporters of the act would doubtless have liked to be prosecuted .
But the basic unworkability of the literature / pornography opposition was not the only reason for this .
As you say , the act contained the " deprave and corrupt " test ( which had in fact been used in common law cases of obscene libel since 1868 ) .
You say that this is " fundamentally flawed " , but this is not and could never be an objective test which could be applied to material before a court ; what it actually requires and involves , in practice , is juries and magistrates in obscenity cases taking into account what they deem to be current standards of public acceptability in this area .
These not only change over time , but they vary from one social group to another .
There 's no doubt that cultural attitudes have generally become more liberal since the 1960s – and the way in which the act has been enforced has reflected that , which you do n't like – but , equally clearly , not everyone shares those liberal attitudes , and nor is there any reason why they should do so .
So what do we do ?
My view is that we need to find a way of protecting people from material that they might deem obscene , while at the same time protecting the existence of such material and the freedom of those who wish to access it ( whether or not they think it obscene ) .
What do you think ?
Incidentally , I really would counsel against the " laundry list " approach to obscenity which you outline .
As Winston Churchill found to his cost in 1986 when he introduced an ill - fated private members bill to reform the Obscene Publications
Act , the real problem with such an approach is not that it does n't catch everything it 's supposed to , but that it catches a very great deal more besides .
As , in my view , will the " extreme pornography " clauses in the new Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 .
John to Julian
Although approaching the matter from very different perspectives it is pleasing to be in agreement that the present law is certainly not effective in achieving parliament 's intention .
But I believe this is an argument for effective reform rather than abolition .
The 1959 act started out as a 10 - minute rule bill introduced into parliament by the late Lord Jenkins of Hillhead .
It is very rare for such a bill to reach the statute book , but because it was supported by the government of the day it became the first in a succession of liberal reforms sweeping away constraints and opening the way for the " swinging 60s " , an era when opinion - formers and style gurus advocated " letting it all hang out " !
The pornography industry quickly took the lead .
As the consequences of this social engineering unfolded it was surprising that Roy Jenkins observed , when speaking in Abingdon in 1963 , that " a better name for the permissive society is the civilised society " .
This curious juxtaposition is a sure indication of very muddled thinking .
In this context , " permissive " and " civilised " are contradictory .
What , in fact , has happened is that pornography has perpetuated inequality and discrimination , becoming for some a new form of slavery .
It is the weakness in law that the pornography industry shamelessly exploits regardless of any other consideration .
Lord Denning also noted that the law had " misfired " because of " the wording of the statute and the way the courts had applied it " .
This , from the former Master of the Rolls , is not a personal judgement of pornographic imagery but a statement based on the evidence coming to him from the courts up and down the land over which he had jurisdiction .
There can be no denying that attitudes change , but in the realm of pornography attitudes towards acceptability have largely been shaped by those who have most to gain .
The truth is that what pornographers continue to supply , because the ill - defined law allows it , creates the demand for material that has degenerated from a masturbatory aid to depictions of sexual torture .
Julian to John
As I said before , the Obscene Publications
Act was effective in achieving one of parliament 's intentions , namely offering to literature a degree of protection from prosecution for obscenity .
I also suspect that Lord Jenkins , who was liberal - minded in these matters , would have accepted that an increase in the amount of pornography in legal circulation as a result of the act was a price worth paying to protect literature .
I actually agree with you that the pornography industry has deeply unpleasant aspects , but I think we should re-direct ourselves to the question of the future ( if any ) of the act .
You 've suggested that the act should be reformed so as to take a " laundry list " approach to obscenity , and I 've explained why I think this is unworkable .
So let me propose my approach , which is similar to , but in some respects goes further than , that of the 1979 Report of the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship chaired by Bernard Williams .
Namely :
• Terms such as " indecent " , " obscene " , and " depraved and corrupt " should be recognised as too subjective to have any place in modern law and so should be scrapped
• The only material that should be banned is that whose making can be proved to have involved the commission of illegal acts , such as non-consensual sex
• Material which some people might find offensive or which should not be made available to young people , should be restricted .
Thus , for example , certain publications will still find themselves relegated to the top shelf , and only licensed sex shops will be able to sell hardcore pornography .
Unlike at present , though , they will also be allowed to engage in mail - order business
The merit of this approach is that only material which most people would regard as incontrovertibly harmful , in that its making involved committing acts which are in themselves illegal , would be banned .
It also retains those elements of the Indecent Displays Act and Local Government
Act which makes it illegal for licensed sex shops to display or otherwise advertise their wares in such a way as to shock the casual passer - by , and that part of the Obscene Publications
Act which insists that the target or likely audience of the material in question must be taken into account when judging whether or not it is obscene .
Thus the authorities ' attention will be directed solely at material which is demonstrably and unarguably harmful .
With their task considerably simplified , they will ( hopefully ) put all their energies into discouraging the production of such material by energetically pursuing its perpetrators .
Meanwhile , those who do n't want to see , or in the case of children , should n't be seeing , certain kinds of material , wo n't have it thrust in their faces .
John to Julian
Although speculative , you may be right that Lord Jenkins was content with the situation he brought about .
It may also be true that he had regrets about how his law was manipulated by the very people parliament sought to constrain .
Writing about television , in 2004 , one of his contemporaries , Lord Hattersley , said : " A painful fact to swallow for unapologetic libertarians – is that liberty , far from producing an improvement in quality , has produced a continual deterioration in standards . "
Of course , there are different ways to resolve the failure of the act and I agree with you that subjective terms are less than ideal .
It is for this reason that those who have thought about it advocate the " list " approach because it would work .
The British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) operates exactly such a scheme in determining which imagery is suitable for a given age rating .
The board is clear in its guidelines that certain pornographic imagery should be restricted but other imagery is suitable for general exhibition .
Although the board has drawn the line in the wrong place it demonstrates that a list approach works .
Curiously , you seem to be advocating a list yourself when proposing to outlaw " illegal acts " .
Are you really saying that an obscene sexual act may be marketed just as long as those involved consented ?
What would be the difference in the image if the " performers " had been coerced ?
How would this be proved in a court ?
Do you envisage that these performers would be called to give evidence that they were not coerced ?
And how do you define " harm " ?
I would argue that the sexual free - for - all that pornography represents has caused serious harm in terms of the sexual health crisis , the rise in sexual offences and broken or unfaithful relationships , and the perpetuation of discrimination against women .
Pornography has invaded every aspect of modern life , particularly television , film and the internet , to which there is unrestricted access .
If you do not recognise these as " harms " please define your term .
Julian to John
I 'm interested that you regard the BBFC 's guidelines as constituting a " list " approach .
To me , a list ( in this context ) suggests an index of absolutely banned words and images , whereas , for the most part , the BBFC guidelines simply inform distributors that certain pretty broadly defined kinds of content will not be acceptable within certain age ranges .
On the other hand , within the 18 category certain kinds of material are indeed proscribed outright , namely that which " appears to the Board to risk harm to individuals , or , through their behaviour to society – eg , any detailed portrayal of violent or dangerous acts , or of illegal drug use , which is likely to promote the activity " , along with " portrayals of sexual violence which might , for example , eroticise or endorse sexual assault " .
Although I have problems with the notion of " harm " that is being employed here , I still do n't see this formulation as constituting a list as it's just too broad and general .
It 's not until we get to the R18 category – for material which may be sold only in licensed sex shops – that we start to encounter more specific categories of proscribed images , which do indeed amount to a form of list .
But this is precisely where the problems arise .
First of all , it is in this adults - only category , in which one would expect to find the BBFC making the least cuts , that it actually makes the most – in 2007 , 27 % of R18 DVDs were cut .
Second , it 's hard to read the accounts on the BBFC 's excellent website of why specific R18 titles were cut without gasping in disbelief .
Can it really be the sign of a sane society that highly trained examiners are spending vast amounts of time poring in minute detail over material that the authorities in most other western countries regard as largely unproblematic – just in case it might be thought to fall within a category proscribed by the R18 list ?
And now , in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act , we have another list – this time of the ingredients of what the government describes as " extreme pornography " .
But many of the constituents of the list are highly subjective , and , where they are more specific , they threaten to criminalise a far wider range of material than the authors of the act claim they intended .
Those are some of the problems associated with a list approach to reforming the Obscene Publications Act .
And yes , in answer to your question , I do think that the notion of " harm " should be limited to the harms caused to those taking part in non-consensual activity , and that this should ultimately be a matter for the courts to decide .
John to Julian
I agree with you that there are some " deeply unpleasant aspects " to the pornography industry .
It is difficult to discern which aspects are not so !
Surely pornography , by its nature , is unpleasant because it turns private sexual intimacy into a public spectacle and a commodity to be sold indiscriminately .
As such it undermines human dignity and destroys the innate modesty that comes with being human .
Performers are required to satisfy the tired sensibilities of onlookers for whom the people involved are little more than sex objects .
There is no sense of love , emotion or commitment : it is just the exploitation of sexual functioning divorced from the reality of whole relationships .
How can this be good or embody literary merit ?
Tragically , in the liberalisation of the last 50 years , statistics show that sexual offences have dramatically increased and some women have even been murdered as a result .
We know that Frederick and Rosemary West used pornography in their crimes .
So did Anthony Hardy , Peter Sutcliffe , Roy Whiting and Graham Coutts .
Never before in human history has pornographic imagery been so widely and easily available .
To believe that this does not create a distorted view of human sexuality is irrational .
Many children are being routinely exposed to such material while surfing on the internet and real fears have been expressed about the permanent psychological damage this could cause .
The industry seems to be much more concerned about " getting them hooked while they are young " so its future market is secured .
In this short debate we have established that the present law is not working as parliament intended and I have expressed concerns about the damaging consequences for societies where pornographers operate with little legal constraint .
This is a serious issue that is not about freedom of expression but about the role of parliament in legitimately protecting citizens from exploitation .
Accordingly , I believe the law should be effectively strengthened for the common good .
Julian to John
In our exchanges , I 've sensed your desire to broach the " effects " debate , and equally you may have sensed my desire to avoid it !
This is n't because I think it dents my case but because I do n't think it gets us very far .
As this is my last letter , let me try to explain why .
Britain has an extremely poor record compared with nearly every other European country when it comes to levels of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases .
However , many of the countries that have the best record in these matters , such as the Netherlands and certain Scandinavian states , are also very liberal in their attitude to pornography .
So why would anyone suggest that our sexual problems be caused by pornography ?
In my view , there are two major difficulties with drawing direct causal links between media images and forms of social behaviour .
The first is that they 're unprovable ( which results in people falling back on unhelpful appeals to " common sense " , and ignoring that correlation is not the same thing as causality ) .
The second is that making such links draws attention away from the real causal factors of the behaviour in question , factors whose roots lie deep in the socialisation process ( or lack of it ) and which raise uncomfortable questions about the kind of society in which we live .
It is true that many sex criminals have used pornography , but it 's equally true that the vast majority of people who use pornography do n't turn to sex crime .
Furthermore , there 's no way of knowing whether or not these criminals would have acted thus in the absence of pornography .
Again , this is what I mean about this line of reasoning not really taking us very far .
My own view is that some ( but by no means all ) forms of pornography do represent people as dehumanised sex objects and , as such , embody the values of the highly commodified society in which we live and in which women and men are treated highly unequally .
But for me the main problem is not such pornography itself , but the attitudes underlying it and to which it appeals , which no amount of censorship will change .
So while , as I 've said , I would reform the Obscene Publications
Act so that it applied only to material whose making involved actual harm to the participants , I would also attempt to reduce the long - term demand for the more sexist forms of pornography by improving the quality of sex education and starting it at a younger age , along with abolishing all forms of gender inequality in the workplace .
This , I think , is the difference between us : you would make the world better by abolishing pornography ; I would make the world better and , in so doing , reduce the demand for the more objectionable forms of pornography .

U.S. home sales registered their biggest monthly jump in nearly seven years in December , as cratering prices began to draw out more buyers and several major housing markets showed some signs of stabilizing .
The 6.5 % rise in sales from November was attributed in part to strong sales of foreclosed homes .
Economists say it is too early to suggest that broad improvement is at hand , though , and warned that the spring buying season is likely to be sluggish amid growing economic hardship .
Indeed , the employment picture continued to darken Monday as U.S. employers announced at least another 65,000 layoffs .
( See related article . )
Investors nonetheless seized on the whiff of good housing news , sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 100 points before it retreated to close up 38.47 points , or 0.5 % , at 8116.03 .
The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied single - family homes , condominiums and cooperative homes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.74 million units in December .
Last month 's rise was the largest since the early phase of the housing boom in January 2002 and a sharp rebound from the prior month , when sales plunged 9.4 % , according to revised data from the Realtors .
But home sales were still down 3.5 % from a year earlier .
The trade group said 45 % of transactions completed in December were " distress sales " by banks unloading foreclosed properties or homeowners selling for less money than they owe to lenders .

Unemployment queues across Europe are getting longer European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels , as Europe faces some of the worst unemployment figures in a generation or more .
The jobless rate across the 27 - member EU in January was 7.6 % - but in individual countries like Spain it is almost double that , leading some American commentators to label Europe a continent in denial or a continent adrift .
Ireland 's unemployment rate is already more than 10 % .
In Europe 's biggest economy , Germany , it has inched up to 7.9 % .
While in Britain and France the number of unemployed has surpassed two million in each country .
Even Eastern Europe 's success stories , the so called " Baltic Tigers " , have not escaped the chill wind of rising unemployment .
The last three or four months have been a catastrophe
Iiris Viitmaa
Laid off in Estonia Estonia 's Social Welfare Minister Hanno Pevkur told the BBC's Europe Today programme that last year unemployment was only 4 % - but that this year had seen a dramatic change in fortunes .
" We have reached already 7.5 % unemployment rate within just a few months , " he said .
And he said it was set to get much worse : " Our prognosis indicates that by the end of the year , unemployment may be as high as 15 % . "
' Catastrophe ' Iiris Viitmaa , who worked for a construction company in the Estonian capital , Tallin , before losing her job , says the decline in the workforce has been sudden .
" It was quite OK half a year ago , and then the last three or four months have been a catastrophe , " she says .
For those like Iiris , the hope of finding new work is slim .
" I have got replies saying it was 1,400 or 1,600 [ applicants ] for one place for jobs like client manager , " she explains grimly .
One of the worst - hit countries in Europe is Spain .
As recently as two years ago Spain was creating a third of all new jobs in the European Union , largely on the back of its booming construction sector .
But when the housing bubble burst , so too did the star of Europe 's economy .
Its unemployment rate is now nearly 15 % .
EUROPEAN UNEMPLOYMENT
Spain 14.08 % Latvia 12.3 % Slovakia 9.8 % Lithuania 9.8 % Cyprus 4.3 % Denmark 4.3 % Austria 4.0 % Netherlands 2.8 % source : Eurostat Jakob Von Weizsaecker , a research fellow at Bruegel , a Brussels - based think - tank , believes Spain is now facing a real battle .
" Spain has huge problems - it 's the bursting of the real estate bubble , and its labour market is rather complicated , " he says .
Part of the problem is its two - tiered labour market .
" Many older people have contracts and it's very hard to fire them , and many of the young people , who are often more productive , have fixed - term contracts that are easier to terminate , " he explains .
It is this group that is now bearing the brunt of the job loses - one in three young people under the age of 25 is without a job .
Chantal Hughes , spokeswoman for the EU Commissioner for Employment , Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities says the objective of member states at the moment is to keep people in work , or get them back to work as quickly as possible .
" We have to maintain demand , if people do n't have money the economy is not going to be relaunched . "
End of the bubble
But some argue the rigidity of the labour market in many European countries is hindering this goal .
Jose Luis Feito , from the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations ( CEOE ) , says that in Spain this inflexibility , and the high costs that come with it , is contributing to unemployment .
" The lay - off costs in Spain are way above those prevailing in any other European country , " he says .
They would have been the first to leave ... but there is nowhere for them to go now
Brendan Landers
This , he argues , leads to businesses taking pre-emptive action .
" As soon as you see on the horizon a crisis coming you immediately begin to lay - off people because you know it is going to be extremely costly ... to get rid of them [ later ] if the crisis is very severe , " he explains .
Even in countries with more flexible labour markets and less baggage , the downturn is taking its toll .
One of the consequences of rising unemployment is the increasing number of people who leave their place of birth in search of work elsewhere .
That was the stark experience of Ireland in the 1980s .
UK unemployment made its biggest jump last month since records began Unemployment then was more than 20 % and hundreds of thousands of people packed their bags and left for America , Canada , Australia and Britain .
Many were lured back again in the late 90s when the " Celtic Tiger " was born , much like in Spain , on the back of a construction boom .
But now , with unemployment already at more than 10 % , many people are once again considering emigration .
Journalist Brendan Landers left Ireland for Canada in 1984 , after being unemployed for more than two years .
" I was ready to kill myself , I was in utter despair , " he says .
He returned to Ireland in 2001 after seeing his country 's economy growing again , but now he describes that as a " huge mistake " .
" It was all just based on the huge big property bubble .
The bubble burst last year and the place has gone to the dogs , " he says bitterly .
The current downturn is reminiscent of the 1980s , but with one striking difference - this time it is the white - collar workers who are loosing their jobs , according to Brendan .
" In my generation most of the people who left were blue - collar workers ... a lot of people now who are going on the dole are solicitors and architects , professional people . "
He says in the past the white - collar workers would have avoided unemployment by finding work overseas .
" They would have been the first to leave ... but there is nowhere for them to go now . "

Frequent - flier S.F. mayor draws fire on ground SAN FRANCISCO
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom chats before an address by US President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to US mayors February 20 , 2009 in the East Room of the White House in Washington , DC .

Gavin Newsom has spent the equivalent of more than nine months traveling outside of California since he became mayor in 2004 , in addition to his frequent in - state trips to Sacramento or Southern California .
His regular absences - particularly the recent ones that have coincided with ever - worsening news about the city 's budget deficit - have prompted some accusations that Newsom seems more devoted to his own agenda than he is to San Francisco .
The mayor has been out of the state about 280 days since he was first elected , according to calendars and other documents requested by The Chronicle .
In 2004 , he only left the state for seven days , compared with 80 days in 2008 and 21 days already in the first two months of this year .
And as his run for governor heats up , the criticism is likely to grow .
He 'll be in Southern California for campaign events four days this week .
" That habit of being out of city or out of state is consistent with my impression of him as being a bit disengaged , " Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi said .
" His absence is felt quite a bit .
His campaigning ( for governor ) dovetails with arguably the worst times ever with the current economic crisis . "
High - profile expected
Still , many political pundits say Newsom does n't appear to travel any more than his predecessors or other big -city mayors .
Newsom says that traveling is a key part of his job , and local political analysts said San Francisco residents expect their mayor to have a high profile in the state and around the country .
" Judge me on my performance .
All of these trips are very much in line with the job description , " Newsom said .
" Look at the last two months .
I feel we 've had an extraordinarily productive few months , and that 's when I 've been campaigning more for governor . "
Each year , Newsom takes a couple of weeks of vacation , often to Hawaii .
Last year , the mayor was married in Montana and went on a three - week African honeymoon .
At times his vacation plans have angered critics .
In 2007 , Newsom left town in November just hours after the massive Cosco Busan oil spill in the bay .
A month later , he left town after the deadly Christmas tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo .
But most of his traveling is professional .
Every year , except 2004 , he has attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , and toured at least one foreign city , often as a sister - city exchange .
He also makes regular trips to the East Coast , usually New York and Washington .
Newsom 's trips outside San Francisco are almost always funded by groups such as the Chamber of Commerce , although the mayor 's security team , which travels everywhere with him , is paid with city money .
Police officials have refused to release the cost of the security detail .
Newsom was out of the state for more than 20 percent of 2008 , " and that 's going to go up , " said David McCuan , an associate political science professor at Sonoma State University .
" It 's not just a function of the 2010 gubernatorial election , but the Obama administration , too , " he said .
" If his trips are to D.C. , the travel makes sense because San Francisco is such an important city . "
The Chronicle 's count of Newsom 's out - of - state absences includes days when he was only gone for a few hours - for example , when he was in San Francisco for most of the day before getting on a red - eye flight to the East Coast .
Acting mayor
Each time the mayor leaves the state he must appoint an acting mayor in his absence .
He almost always appoints one of his political allies on the Board of Supervisors .
It 's not as easy to tell when he 's traveling to other parts of the state .
The mayor 's office has long refused to provide detailed daily calendars , and Newsom does n't always promote his quick jaunts to campaign in Los Angeles or vacation at Lake Tahoe , where his family has deep roots .
Political analysts say Newsom 's travels are to be expected .
San Francisco residents are used to electing mayors who become national leaders and even celebrities .
Plus , big -city mayors often look to other cities for policy ideas , and Newsom makes frequent references to plans that he co-opts from other mayors , said University of San Francisco political scientist Corey Cook .
" We want people in other cities to be able to pick out our mayor in a photo .
Our mayors are people like Willie Brown and ( Dianne ) Feinstein , " Cook said .
" One of the things that Newsom did very early was to show people he had the stature to be that type of figure . "
That said , Cook said , it 's not surprising Newsom 's City Hall colleagues are becoming frustrated with his absences .
" During the good times , people in San Francisco liked having a jet - setting mayor .
But in the context of budget problems , it 's different , " Cook said .
" The perception early in his term was , ' Is n't this great that we have this young , vibrant mayor who 's promoting San Francisco around the world ? '
And now it 's like we have this mayor who 's somewhere else when he should be right here . "
Newsom 's defense
Newsom said he works continuously on city policy while he 's traveling , pointing out that sometimes he can get more work done on a flight to Southern California than in his office , where he 's constantly interrupted .
" People should want to see me outside City Hall , " Newsom said .
" City Hall is oftentimes not a very productive place .
I 'd argue I 'm in there way too much . "
But his critics , most of them speaking privately , said it 's not always a question of how much work the mayor does as how much face time he gives the city .
Department heads have complained of feeling abandoned by the mayor at a time when they 're being asked to make deep budget cuts , and Newsom was criticized last month for not attending budget meetings organized by David Chiu , the freshman president of the Board of Supervisors .
Mirkarimi , who has traveled abroad with Newsom , said he does n't doubt that the mayor 's out - of - town trips are useful .
He 's just not convinced that Newsom 's time would n't be better spent in the city .
" I think he would actually win empathy and support if he was more communicative and clear about how these efforts benefit us all , " Mirkarimi said .
" Some communication , some sincere interface , would go a lot further than the administration understands . "
Local nonprofits are banding together to fight the city 's recent move to begin collecting fees in lieu of taxes from charitable organizations .
“ It 's unreasonable , ” says Deborah Williamson , executive director of the Virginia Network of Nonprofit Organizations .
A 1993 city ordinance calls for charging tax - exempt nonprofits — with the exception of churches — a percentage of their property value as reimbursement for city services , such as picking up trash and providing fire and police protection .
The ordinance , however , has not been acted on until now .
Maurice Rice , fiscal officer for Richmond Residential Services , says his nonprofit agency will have to fork over about $ 10,000 on its 13 group homes for developmentally disabled adults .
He says the fees will force the residential group to cut costs elsewhere , such as “ staff or the groceries and supplies we provide . ”
The fees are due to the city June 15 .
Jim Hester , the city 's real estate assessor , says there are 210 parcels in the city that fall into the nonprofit category , with a total assessed value of $ 328 million .
The service fees could yield about $ 800,000 in new revenue .
City Council President Kathy Graziano does n't relish the idea of acting on a city ordinance for the first time 16 years after it was passed .
“ Nobody had a heads up so they could put it in their budgets for this year , ” she says .
“ Now on the flip side , all those nonprofits that are now tax - exempt use all our services , so that 's something we 're going to look at in the future . ”
Suzette Denslow , chief of staff to Mayor Dwight C. Jones , echoes Graziano 's sentiment , hinting that the fees could be scaled back .
“ We are working with City Council to find a solution that does n't unduly charge not - for - profits a newly enforced service charge , in the middle of a fiscal year , ” she says .
Bling may not be the obvious place to be for a luxury sports car maker today , but here 's Bentley showing what the ultimate development of the Continental GT will be .
The Continental Supersports will be shown next week at the Geneva motor show as a production model .
Its 630 - hp turbocharged W12 will make it the fastest and most - powerful Bentley ever .
The headline figure is 204 mph , taking the Supersports into the stratospheric territory of production cars capable of eating up a mile in less than 18 seconds .
The Supersports can do this while drinking either standard pump fuel or E85 , making it the first Bentley to be biofuel compatible , a step that all future Bentley models will make as the British company pushes toward a greener future .
Started as an under - the - radar project , the Supersports is likely to become the best - selling Continental GT if Bentley¹s experience with its Speed models is anything to go by -- the Speed model now makes up 60 percent of coupe sales .
" The Supersports is something my engineers worked on amongst themselves , to create the ultimate Continental , and then we picked it up as an official project , " says Uli Eichhorn , Bentley chief engineer .
The changes to make the Supersports run on E85 should not be underestimated , adds Eichhorn .
As well as re-engineering the fuel system to cope with the corrosive ethanol , all the electronic subsystems had to be reprogrammed and revalidated .
With U.S. regulatory approval still to be cleared , the Supersports will go into production the fall , with North American cars becoming E85 - capable by summer 2010 .
The main change to the engine to increase power above 600 hp is extra boost from the twin turbos , whose airflow is eased by 10 percent larger intercoolers .
The latest , quick - shifting version of ZF 's six - speed automatic helps the higher - output engine deliver sharper performance .
Bentley quotes a 0 - to - 60 - mph time of 3.7 seconds and 50 to 70 mph in 2.1 seconds .
Billed as the ultimate " extreme " Bentley by the company , there are dozens of detailed underskin changes to ensure the Supersports delivers a special driving experience .
Most significant is a new , rear - biased 60:40 torque split from the center differential for the four - wheel - drive system , which is said to reduce understeer and increase chassis adjustability on the throttle .
But there 's also a wider rear track , extended by 0.8 inch to enhance high - speed stability , and standard carbon - ceramic brakes to haul the Supersports down from its tarmac - ripping top speed .
Steering , suspension , spring and damper rates have all been revised , too , in line with the extended performance .
The lower front suspension arm is now made from aluminum , the antiroll bar is retuned and stiffer bushings improve steering responses .
Even Bentley does n't describe the 4,938 - pound Supersports as lightweight , but it is considerably lighter than the Continental Speed .
The rear seat is removed , a rear panel is made from carbon fiber and new lightweight 20 - inch wheels save 5.5 pounds per corner .
In total , the Supersports is 242 pounds lighter than the GT Speed .
There are styling differences , too .
The wider rear track necessitates new rear body panels that beef up the Supersports 's rear haunch .
Extra cooling vents are needed in the hood and front airdam , features that increase aggressiveness .
A subtle change is new brightwork around the window openings , which now features a smoky - chrome look .
Even this cosmetic change introduces new technology , the finish being applied for the first time to stainless steel using physical vapor deposition .
Inside is new carbon fiber trim , including a cross-cabin beam that looks like a body stiffener but is actually a luggage retaining bar .
There 's plenty of substance to this reworked Bentley Continental , which is also reflected in a significant 20 percent price rise .
The figure is not final yet , but if you 've got around $ 250,00 to spend on a fabulous sports car , the Bentley Continental Supersports just jumped onto your wish list .

Students
Student applications open March 23 and end on April 3 .
If you 'd like to get started on your proposal early , we 'll be looking for a few things .
You 'll need to have a concrete task in mind ( some ideas are below ) along with a solid idea of what will constitute " success " ( you tell us ) .
We 'll want to know a bit about you -- links to previous work are great , if any .
You 'll also need to provide us with a rough schedule of milestones so your mentor can know if and when to nag you :)
Note that none of the ideas below are good enough to be submissions in their own right ( so do n't copy and paste ) !
We 'll want to know not just what you want to do but how you plan to pull it off .
And do n't feel limited to the ideas below -- if you 've got a cool project you want to work on , we 'll probably be able to find you a mentor .
We plan on approving as many projects as we possibly can .
Note : we 're looking for projects that add value to Django itself - not application / CMS projects that use Django .
Communication
The ​django - gsoc Google Group has been setup to facilitate communication between students and mentors in the GSoC efforts .
Ideas
Here are some suggestions for projects students may want to propose ( lazyweb : please add to this list ! ) .
This is n't by any means the be-all and end - all of ideas ; please feel free to submit proposals for things not on this list .
Try to scope ideas / proposals to the 4 - month timeline -- simply proposing to fix a ticket or two will probably result in your proposal being rejected in favor of a more ambitious one .
The SOC does not cover activities other than coding , so certain ideas ( " Write a more detailed tutorial " or " Create demonstration screencasts " or " Add a pony ? " ) are not suitable for inclusion here .
On the other side , though , be sure to be concrete in your proposal .
We 'll want to know what your goals are , and how you plan to accomplish them .
In no particular order :
Please support our drive to Fix CNBC and sign the petition .
Jim Cramer finally commented on his much talked about appearance on The Daily Show after he was left sitting there , almost teary eyed and speechless when he was confronted by Jon Stewart face to face .
His remarks on The Today Show just underscored how out of touch this man is and what lengths he 'll go to distort the truth .
( rough transcript )
Viera : ... you guys had been cheerleaders for the financial bubble , that you had also allowed CEO 's to come on the shows and essentially lie to the American public without really challenging them .
I do n't want to rehash the whole thing , but did he have a point ?
Cramer : I do n't think so .
Viera :
Not on any of this ?
Cramer :
Well I think it was a naive and misleading thing to attack the media .
We were n't behind this .
CNBC in particular has been out front on this " Viera :
So you do n't think the media bears any responsibility , Jim ?
Cramer : I think there are people that bear so much more responsibility that it 's just wrong headed ...
Sure , there were a lot of parties responsible for the meltdown of the economy , but that does n't absolve the news media for turning a blind eye to it , Mr. Jim .
Meredith Viera really asked the right questions so good for her and as Cramer bashes Jon Stewart I would like to ask this .
Why was he such a coward on the Daily Show when he had the chance to confront Stewart ?
Comedy Central makes a good point in there piece : Jim Cramer Attacking Jon Stewart Again From a Safe Distance .
Since Cramer became so outspoken about CNBC 's role in the financial crisis , he and Rick Santelli are becoming the poster boy 's for it , but Cramer has another huge credibility problem and his name is Lenny Dykstra .
Cramer has a lot of juice in the Wall Street world and he promoted Lenny Dykstra like no other .
On HBO he said this :
So much so that Lenny was posting his stock picks on The Street .
Well , it 's now being revealed that Dykstra is possibly a fraud .
( I 've jumped around in the text that I quoted . )
Day trading deity Jim Cramer crowned him " One of the great ones in this business . "
Fortune magazine gushed for six pages over the " fledgling guru " of investing .
HBO referred to him as a " prominent , remarkably successful stock investor . "
The subject of this breathless coverage is Lenny Dykstra , a former New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder who claims a 90 % - plus return picking stocks each of the last three years .
Yet a close look at Dykstra 's portfolio raises doubts about whether the baseball All - Star turned TheStreet.com ( nasdaq : TSCM - news - people ) guru has been picking many of those stocks or relying on a seasoned stand - in .
Ending his major league playing days in 1996 , Dykstra says he handed his savings to a Wall Street broker who lost half of it when the market melted down a few years later .
Dykstra was determined to start making his own investment calls and dove into the pursuit the same aggressive way he played baseball , following 30 investment newsletters at a time .
In 2003 he began e-mailing CNBC money mouth Jim Cramer , who added Dykstra to TheStreet.com 's stock - picking roster .
Soon Dykstra was a financial talking head on Fox News and other channels .
Another reason Doubledown might have gotten cold feet about publishing Dykstra 's investment gems is buried on page 15 of its countersuit .
There , Doubledown claims , " At Dykstra 's insistence , Doubledown began negotiations to pay Richard Suttmeier , a stock analyst , to provide Dykstra with research assistance for the Dykstra Report and who , upon information and belief learned subsequently , provided Dykstra lists of recommended stocks daily . "
Who is Richard Suttmeier ?
A market strategist for financial Web site RightSide Advisors and formerly a contributor to RealMoney.com , a subscription Web site owned by TheStreet.com .
Suttmeier , 64 , says he got his Wall Street start trading Treasurys in the 1970s .
He later bounced around second - tier investment banks and landed at RightSide in 2006 .
---
Suttmeier says that after he did a television appearance several years ago he received a call from Dykstra .
" He wanted to learn how to read a [ stock ] chart , " Suttmeier says .
" I taught him . " ---
Dykstra , who speaks in a slow drawl and now sports a hefty paunch , likewise denies that Suttmeier is picking his stocks .
" It 's a bald - faced lie .
Not even close , " he says during a brief interview .
Not even close ?
FORBES compared Dykstra 's buy recommendations as they appeared on TheStreet.com from Apr. 1 through May 1 with those in Suttmeier 's weekly Sector Report during the same month and before .
Among Dykstra 's 17 buys , 11 had appeared days earlier in Suttmeier 's newsletter ( see table ) ... read on
You have to read this entire piece .
And there 's another article about him that 's unflattering to say the least :
There 's much more at Men.style.com.gq : YOU THINK YOUR JOB SUCKS ?
TRY WORKING FOR LENNY DYKSTRA
Jim Cramer wants to call Jon Stewart " naive " for attacking him and CNBC then what is he for promoting Lenny Dykstra ?
I think " naive " would be the wrong word to use , do n't you ?
Despite having written for the Internet the last four years , I 've never been particularly tech - savy , so you might think I 'm unqualified to write a column comparing Dell 's computer repair customer service to Apple's .
But this is no tech - head review .
Instead , I 'm only reporting the events of my last week when a perfect storm of mishaps combined to break both my Dell laptop and Mac PowerBook .
The timing was especially cruel as I 'd just fired up my Twitter account and now my ability to recount my glorious life in real time was more limited ( jumping into the void with opportunistic greed was my co-columnist Dan O'Brien , selfishly sucking up all the twitciples he could find while I was away .
You 're welcome , Dan ! ) .
Anyway , here 's my story ...

Dell PC
The Breaking
I bought my Studio Dell laptop halfway through the run of Hate By NumbersÃÂ ¢ÃÂ ÃÂ ¢ and I gotta tell you , it started falling apart instantly .
The screws came out , converting the the cheap plastic casing into a snap trap for my arm hair .
Nevertheless , because I am a professional ( and because I now no longer have any arm hair ) I kept using it .
Shortly thereafter though , the hinges gave way and the screen got all wobbly .
Still , I remained undeterred until last week when the computer suddenly stopped charging .
I decided to remedy all these problems at once .
I knew that meant I might be without my laptop for a few weeks , but I still had my Mac .
What could go wrong ?

The Call To Customer Service
I called Dell 's 800 number and was instantly directed to India .
Apparently , Dell has found a way to make money off of America 's racism and / or xenophobia because now -- for an additional fee -- you also have the option of being connected to a customer service technician " right here in America " ( I think this ploy will be more successful than the automated message they had first considered : " If you hate talking to brown people , push ' 1 ' " ) .
Anyway , because I love people of all races and creeds and because there was no way I was paying Dell one more cent for their crap laptop , I opted to hold for an Indian technician .
I was greeted by a " Raj " who filled my head with Slumdog Millionaire images .
( no , Raj was not gouging out a singing boy 's eyes with a spoon .
I meant the tech support scene . )
Raj quickly displayed his near - perfect English and startling systematic diagnostic prowess :
i present to you , the readers : your quiet sunday morning .
keep in mind , your quiet sunday morning will start with the sound of sizzling bacon , but who does n’t love that ?
and until you take the bread out of the oven , your morning will also be filled with the sounds of your friends and family asking “ is it done yet ? is it done yet ? ” but once you start divvying out pieces of this perfect , moist and flavorful corn bread , simply put , everyone will shut up .
forget dry , tasteless and crumbly corn bread – this is the real deal , complete with bacon fat .
pair it up with brunch , or with a great big bowl of chili .
it ’s sweet , but not too sweet , soft and delicate but still hearty , and of course , topped with delicious crumbled bacon .
with a mix of fresh corn and coarse cornmeal ( soaked in buttermilk ) , the flavors are so vibrant , you can take a break from your new years diet to indulge .
there are hundreds of variations on corn bread , but all of them have one thing in common : when you eat corn bread , it just makes you just feel good inside .
一般的には都庁近くの高層ビル街が思い出されるかもしれませんが、地域としては西口・東口・南口、さらには3丁目～御苑前。と、幅広い地域を指します。それぞれ個性が違い、貸事務所の賃料も事務所の形態や設備もかなり違います。業種によってイメージが合う地域、合わない地域があるので、事務所自体の設備や広さ、賃料などだけでなく、その事務所がある地域の個性を考慮することが重要です。全体的に大きな高層ビルが多い地域と思われがちですが、古いビルやマンション型でフロントのある事務所など、バラエティーに富んだ幅広い物件が揃っています。大江戸線、副都心線の開通により交通アクセスも良くなり、再開発されつつある地域もあります。需要に合った物件を見つけやすい地域です。
最新のビジネスエリア南口・再開発も進行する西口
南口の駅ビルが完成し、近くのオフィスビルも完成するなど、最新のビジネスエリアである南口にも大小様々な貸事務所があります。南口駅ビルを起点に、東側は明治通り沿いに南へ伸びる地域で、東口や西口に比べると駅から近距離でビジネス色の強い環境になります。副都心線の新宿3丁目駅にも近く、落ち着いた印象で様々な業種に合い、堅実な企業イメージを演出できるでしょう。JR線を隔てた西側は、甲州街道の南側に規模の小さめのビルが多く、マンション形式でフロントのある、古くから有名なビルもあり、スタートアップや士業のオフィスなどにも適しています。住所としては甲州街道の南側は渋谷区になります。西口の高層ビル街といえば、都庁もあり、東京のビジネスエリアを代表する地域のひとつです。既に有名なビルは築年数も30年を超えていますが、常にリニューアル・整備され、今も多くの企業が集まっています。更に西口地区には常に各所で再開発が行われてもいます。
小規模のビルが多い3丁目～御苑界隈、東新宿
再開発で大きなオフィスビルが建ち、副都心線の駅も出来たことで一気に東側のビジネスエリアになった東新宿、食品大手の本社があることでも有名です。南下して3丁目、さらに東へ御苑前という地域は、比較的小規模のビルが多い地域。3丁目の駅周辺は繁華街といった印象ですが、新宿通りから御苑周辺は落ち着いたビジネスエリアになっています。上場企業も多く事務所を構えていますし、御苑界隈には出版関係の企業も多く、その関係で印刷やDTP関連の企業のオフィスも多い所。こじんまりした地域ですが、地域的には賃料も少し安くなり、貸事務所の量も多くなっています。地下鉄利用で移動もしやすく、大きな通りも近いので、車を使う業種でも充分に対応できるでしょう。場所によっては御苑の緑がビル内から見えるところもあり、広い庭園のおかげで抜け感もあり、見事な眺望が得られるビルもあります。
DENVER — A Denver federal appellate court will hear arguments Monday on the religiousness of 12 - foot - high crosses used to honor deceased Utah troopers along state highways .
A federal judge in Salt Lake City in 2007 ruled that the crosses are not an illegal public endorsement of religion and are used to communicate a secular message — that a patrolman died or was mortally wounded at a particular location .
Texas - based American Atheists in their appeal to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , reject arguments that the cross “ now falls into the category of the no-longer - religious Christmas tree . ”
The group has suggested a tombstone or American flag to honor fallen troopers .
The judge said the U.S. military uses crosses in cemeteries to represent death and also noted that Utah ’s majority religion , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , does not use a cross as an icon .
American Atheists will have 20 minutes to present their argument before a three - judge panel , while the Utah Highway Patrol and Utah Highway Patrol Association , which privately funds the crosses , will have 15 minutes .
Colorado , Kansas , New Mexico and Oklahoma , as well as the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty will also have five minutes to tell the judges how the case may affect roadside memorials in their states .
Eric Russbach , litigation director for the Becket Fund , said his group asked to argue on behalf of the states because to them it ’s an issue of privately - funded free speech and having a neutral government forum , not the religiousness of crosses .
“ If you can avoid having the government say this is religious , this is n’t , is n’t that better ? , ’ Russbach said .
“ We think it ’s better for the court to decide it on the free speech issue . ”
Courts have found that crosses do n’t always convey a religious message .
The 10th Circuit last year found the three crosses used by Las Cruces , N.M. , in a city seal was a pictograph of the city ’s name , which in Spanish means “ The Crosses . ”
In court documents , American Atheists attorney Brian Barnard acknowledges that crosses are common in government - owned cemeteries , but argues the case is about public rights of way .
Utah ’s memorial crosses contain the highway patrol ’s logo and a small plaque with a photo and short biography of the fallen trooper , as well as the trooper ’s name , rank , badge number and year of death .
“ A passing motorist at 65 - plus miles per hour sees only the shape of the memorial and the UHP logo , ” Barnard wrote .
“ The information conveyed by such a speedy drive - by is ‘ Christianity ’ and ‘ Utah Highway Patrol . ' ”
Calls to Barnard and to the Alliance Defense Fund , which represents the association , were not immediately returned Sunday .

Sarah Palin continued today to position herself as President Obama ’s 2012 election opponent by releasing a statement that hammered Obama ’s comment about his bowling and the Special Olympics last night on The Tonight Show .
Palin said that she was shocked by Obama ’s comment .
Palin , herself managed to insult and patronize the disabled .
“ I was shocked to learn of the comment made by President Obama about Special Olympics .
This was a degrading remark about our world ’s most precious and unique people , coming from the most powerful position in the world . ”
Governor Palin thought she was defending the disabled , but as a member of the disabled community , I can tell you that disabled people do not like to be patronized by described with terms like unique , special , and precious .
It is an insult .
Most disabled people do n’t want to be precious or special .
They only want to be treated and viewed in the same manner as everyone else .
I hope she does n’t have this same attitude with her intellectually disabled son , but I have a bad feeling that she does .
The last half of Palin ’s statement was much more appropriate , “ These athletes overcome more challenges , discrimination and adversity than most of us ever will .
By the way , these athletes can outperform many of us and we should be proud of them .
I hope President Obama ’s comments do not reflect how he truly feels about the special needs community . ”
Advertisements
Turning this into a political issue is a terrible thing to do .
I prefer the position that Tim Shriver the chairmen of the Special Olympics has taken .
Shriver accepted Obama ’s apology and urged that this incident be used as a teachable moment , “ This is a teachable moment for our country .
We are asking young people , parents and leaders from all walks of life to engage in conversation and help dispel negative caricatures about people with intellectual disabilities .
We believe that it ’s only through open conversation and dialogue about how stereotypes can cause pain that we can begin to work together to create communities of acceptance and inclusion for all . ”
Maybe I am so offended because I have spent time with some intellectually disabled persons in the past .
Obama made an insensitive remark that is sadly all too common in our society .
I am glad he apologized , but I am not happy that his apology was not posted in the White House blog .
I shudder at the idea that Palin is positioning herself again as the candidate of those with special needs .
Her attitude about the disabled is old fashioned and straight out of 50 years ago .
There are many degrees of disability so it was unfair of Palin to generalize the way she did .
Imagine the utter arrogance of ' career ' politicians casually remarking that , ' people can expect to have a dozen or more jobs / career moves in their lives . '
Except for themselves or Supreme Court Justices .
Notice how there are never any follow up stories after a business takes off for China or to a state where Somallians are employed by the company .
When the paper mills - local modular home ( award winning ) business closed down , local officials - the Governor were right on hand for that photo - op , promising " job retraining " .
This happens all over the nation .
We have NO idea , of what , if any job retraining there is ?
None has been reported in our local press , unless 'ice fishing ' is a new career ?
In Pittsburgh ( true ) they offered steel workers , with mills off to China , South Korea , etc - jobs as nurses aides .
Little wonder eh - they do n't do follow ups on everybody living happily ever after ?
We now have over 31 million on food stamps and thousands living in tent cities .
I imagine this is n't shown on the ' news ' because it would make people feel bad , worried , fearful ?
If we just pretend it 's not happening - maybe it 'll all disappear ?
Through various years of high unemployment backdrops , we read " people are being retrained " or " ' they must be retrained " ( news reports that people should EXPECT to have numerous dislocations and different jobs durning their lifetime .
( UNLESS you 're a CAREER political ) .
for new careers , but the writers and or the so - called expert pundits very carefully avoid saying for what jobs exactly people must be trained ??
Gaping hole questions are never fully answered on that particular question .
An observer sees clearly the discomfort that pundits face as " outsourcing " of better paid manufacturing or high tech jobs increase over the years .
They do n't dare tell the people the truth : that " they better get used to menial jobs and an altogether altered standard of living . "
Once again , but with a bit more emphasis , business or scholarly journals inform us that some industries are NEVER coming back , and others that remain will never reclaim the large numbers of employees they once did , as the article below actually clearly spells out .
Systematically and insidiously ; over the past decades , ANCHOR industries of small town U.S.A. , have shut down and with subsidies voted by Congress , moved to foreign lands .
Multinationals do n't burden themselves with such things as ; loyalty - pride - community - county fairs - farmer 's markets - Fourth of July parades - the global world to them is about a serf class and PROFITS .
It 's about the productive and the non-productive !
These closures do n't make the ' headline ' ( corporate owned ) media .
This exodus accelerated greatly under the Bush administration / though BOTH parties are equally at fault .
Who knows or cares about Pride Mfg ( Wisconsin ) the world 's largest producer of golf tees , off to China ?
The hundreds that worked here care / and all the supporting businesses ( grocer - diner - hardware - car dealers etc ) .
Maytag - ( they keep the name to fool consumers ) off to China leaving thousands in small towns ( mid west ) devastated .
Paper Mills on NH - IBM in Vermont , furniture mills in the Carolinas , Hersey Town ( Pa ) closed , chocolate ( wax ) candy now in Mexico .
Notice how ( lying ) politicians DARE to pontificate on the campaign trail - talking shows , of how they care !
THEY made it possible with major trade agreements that our country entered which has resulted in a race to the BOTTOM in WAGES , health standards , environmental protections , safety , etc. Both Obama and Hillary ( laid off Ohio steel workers ) lied and told these ' hopeful - believing ' folks that by God they 'd rework NAFTA ( one of numerous trade agreements ) .
NOT - Obama ( as President ) on his visit to Canada told them ' not to worry / that was being ( NAFTA ) put on the back burner ' .
The trillion - dollar question :
With all the low paying jobs already filled , what work remains for the MILLIONS of newly unemployed ?
During the last several recessions , people were told that the custodial industry , the nationwide gulag , aka the growing prison system , would place a considerable number of unemployed .
From a carepenter , engineer , farmer , etc to a prison guard .
Now there 's a career move for ya !
In the previous outsourcing years , policy wonks and various ' representatives of the people " told us using deceptive language , that certain job seekers would have NO choice but to accept low wage geriatric care jobs in the other people warehousing system , aka the nursing home industry .
From forging steel - steel that built WWII ships , to our finest bridges - to changing bedpans .
This is what they told the burly steel workers in Pittsburgh !
Others yet with the mainly low paying work in the parks and services ' industry ' and the growing ( Ninja troops ) law enforcement ' industry ' . "
As well as with the entertainment and gladiator sports , aka the bread and circus ' industry ' .
No news on the numerous ' tent cities ' ( Obama - Bushvilles ? ) ; popping up from Hawaii - Calfornia - Florida - Seattle etc ( working poor - unable to afford obsene rents , utilities ) , yet the MEDIA went on and on and on lauding billionaire ( gladiator golf ) Tiger Woods whose greatest feat in life is hitting a golf ball !
Tiger , who makes MORE ( a year ) for wearing the goofy NIKI logo on his cap / new line of clothing than ALL the slave wage workers in Indonesia !
Meantime , another useless turd ( Sununu ) does n't think doctors deserve a decent wage !
But here 's the new problem :
In our day , all those employment sectors are filled ( a job as a rapper is scarce in NH ) and in fact most or all , to some extent , are now laying off or firing certain numbers , for good , due to revenue shortages .
My question remains ?
For what other jobs are people to be RETRAINED ?
Over the years , and gaining rapid momentum since the late seventies , when the Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) was signed ( Clinton ! ! ) in 1994 , setting the final stage for the mass manufacturing plant closures and the export of huge amounts of machine tools to China , Mexico and other growing hubs for manufacturing --- most of the middle class better paying jobs in production have disappeared .
The Economist last year wrote that manufacturing makes up just 5 - 7 % of U.S. GDP .
How pitiful is that ?.
If a large and strong capital / property owning middle class is necessary for the absolute unkeep and safeguarding of representative government , serving also as the enforcing VOICE of liberties ' laws and norms then castastrophe awaits us with the RAPID decimation of what remained of the already - years long decreasing middle class - via these HUGE layoffs and firings and the finishing off of any manufacturing we had remaining !
History recalls the SCORN of France calling Great Britain ' the world 's shopkeepr ' as that mighty power de-industrialized .
Today , the United States of America is accepted as the world 's shopkeeper , even as it chokes to death over its STUFF .
Even as tens of thousands of its shops close , throwing millions into penury and despair .
The truth as I see it , and as it finally becomes plainer from the pens of policy makers in journals like Forign Affairs , The Economist and even the NY Times , is that this country is about to smell , taste , live what ' the rest ' of the world have had to do for so long .
In the the following article , the U.S. is entering that dreaded era of its historical existence , perhaps a long lasting ( like forever ) era , when chronic unemployment with all its accompanying burdens , ( like death ) will no longer be the norm of just other poverty striken nations . .
Will the American people wake up at some near point and scream ENOUGH ?
I do n't think soon enough , though a few might ? .
60 - 70 years of uninterrupted prosperity has served to soften and atrophy the ' fight and flight ' neuro transmitters of once , the richest , most industralized , nation in the world !
Take a look at the bold history of the richest country , with the largest middle class , the most educated for its time , coming out of feudalism :
France , which then stupidly decided to have a revolution which led to the reign of terror .
Then the other nation : the most educated for its time , highly industrialized and believed itself democratic : GERMANY in the 30s .
Germany in the 30's .
Then we could discuss ad nauseum the examples of Rome or Athen or the Persian empire , or Byzantium , and of cours the dark ages , as the result of apathy and foolishness .
People do not learn from history .
It seems they are condemned to repeat it or some version of it , none of it good .
Regardless , I 'm willing to bet the countryside will be quite a bit safer and offer more opportunities for a civil even if complex , survival , than the cities or suburbia .

Drinking and driving is not the only way to get in trouble at a sobriety checkpoint .
Two pedestrians found that out when state police set up a checkpoint late night Saturday into early morning Sunday along state Route 34 in New Bloomfield .
In addition to two motorists who were cited for driving under the influence and related traffic offenses , police said , troopers also cited two pedestrians for public drunkenness after they were observed to be intoxicated as they walked through the checkpoint area .
Police also cited another driver for driving with a suspended license , issued three vehicle code citations and handed out five written warnings .
A total of 97 vehicles were stopped during the checkpoint .
I really do n't understand Obama 's reluctance to lance the boil on this .
I really do n't .
With so many economists frantically advising taking over these banks , it seems he 's only postponing the inevitable :
Some of the nation ’s large banks , according to economists and other finance experts , are like dead men walking .
A sober assessment of the growing mountain of losses from bad bets , measured in today ’s marketplace , would overwhelm the value of the banks ’ assets , they say .
The banks , in their view , are insolvent .
[...]
But without a cure for the problem of bad assets , the credit crisis that is dragging down the economy will linger , as banks cannot resume the ample lending needed to restart the wheels of commerce .
The answer , say the economists and experts , is a larger , more direct government role than in the Treasury Department ’s plan outlined this week .
The Treasury program leans heavily on a sketchy public - private investment fund to buy up the troubled mortgage - backed securities held by the banks .
Instead , the experts say , the government needs to plunge in , weed out the weakest banks , pour capital into the surviving banks and sell off the bad assets .
It is the basic blueprint that has proved successful , they say , in resolving major financial crises in recent years .

Modern piloting is built on routines .
Hundreds of millions of man-hours have been poured into analyzing every possible eventuality , stripping it of risk and mapping out what to do on the rare occasion when something does go wrong .
On the afternoon of January 15 , Chesley B. Sullenberger III was following the routine .
He reported for work at La Guardia at the appointed hour .
He reviewed the standard preflight data : weight and balance figures ; the amount of fuel needed to get to Charlotte , North Carolina ; the takeoff , climbing , and cruising speeds .
A few seconds before 3:25 p.m. , the tower cleared US Airways Flight 1549 for takeoff .
Sully ’s first officer , Jeffrey Skiles , was at the controls .
They trade off , and it was his turn .
Skiles hit the throttle .
Sully called out the appropriate speeds .
And at 3:25 , they were aloft over the Bronx , headed out toward the Biggy Intersection , the navigational fix over New Jersey that steers them clear of Newark air traffic .
From Biggy , they ’d veer south over D.C. to North Carolina .
The controller cleared them to climb to 15,000 feet .
Sully acknowledged .
The skies were clear and calm .
For Sully , this was the last leg of a four - day workweek .
It had all the makings of a milk run .
Sully saw the birds a second before they hit — at 3:27 p.m. , a huge flock of them .
His first impulse was to duck .
He heard them connect — thump !
Then he smelled them .
There was no mistaking it .
Every pilot with enough flight hours has smelled burning birds .
There ’s usually not much more to a bird strike than that — maybe a little hiccup in the hum of the engines before the plane keeps on climbing .
But this was different .
This time , the craft lurched , and then there was silence .
Sully had probably experienced something like that long ago , as a trainee , when his instructor leaned over , shoved the throttle into idle to mimic the loss of engine power , and asked , “ Okay , now what ? ”
But this was n’t a lesson .
This was real engine failure — both engines .
Sully was 3,200 feet in the air , without power , slowly falling to Earth with 150 passengers and four other crew members onboard .
For the first time that day , the captain took control of the plane .
“ My aircraft , ” Sully said .
“ Your aircraft , ” said the first officer .
Pilots have rules even for falling , and Sully set about following them .
He lowered the nose so the plane would glide , not drop quickly .
He ordered the first officer to start into a three - page checklist of procedures for restarting both engines , even though he must have known that was hopeless .
He radioed the controller to report the bird strike .
“ Ah , this is Cactus 1549 , hit birds , we lost thrust in both engines .
We ’re turning back toward La Guardia . ”
The controller ordered the La Guardia tower to stop all departures .
“ It ’s 1549 .
Bird strike .
He lost the thrust in the engines .
He ’s returning immediately . ”
It was 3:28 .
Pilots are taught that if you need to ditch , you should land at the nearest practical airport .
But Sully did n’t have time for that .
He ’d been out of power for a minute already ; he ’d now dropped well below 3,200 feet .
The controller asked if Sully wanted to land on La Guardia ’s Runway 13 .
Sully responded : “ We ’re unable .
We may end up in the Hudson . ”
Teterboro was n’t a possibility either .
He could see the New Jersey airport out of his window and knew it was too far .
The rules were n’t useful anymore .
Sully had no playbook to consult , even if he ’d wanted to .
No pilot in modern jet aviation had ever pulled off a successful water landing .
The simulators do n’t even offer it as a scenario .
He turned the aircraft south from the Bronx to align himself with the river .
The George Washington Bridge was straight ahead .
Sully had to eyeball it the same way he ’d eyeballed Teterboro , deciding if he could clear it .
He did , by just 900 feet .
Then he had to calculate the projected glide path , and gin up a way to set the plane on the water at just the right angle , so the nose was up and neither one of the wings tipped .
If the nose or a wingtip hit the water as he approached , the plane could flip , spin out , or snap in two .
It was 3:29 .
Sully saw a boat on the river .
He wanted to be close to that boat , so passengers could be pulled from the wreckage .
He was improvising .
Without the use of his engines , he maneuvered the flaps just so to control his speed — enough to minimize impact , but not so much that the plane would drop like a 50 - ton rock .
And with 90 seconds left , he made his first communication to the passengers of Flight 1549 .
“ Brace for impact . ”
But it was n’t really his aircraft .
It had n’t been for years .
When Chesley B. Sullenberger III was first starting out , 40 years and 19,663 flight hours ago , commercial - airline pilots were like gods .
It was the age of Chuck Yeager and Pan Am , and the captain in uniform was a breed apart , on a par with Hollywood actors and professional athletes .
The job was prestigious and well paid ; kids wanted to visit the cockpit , to grow up to fly .
And on a clear but frigid January Thursday , when Sully set his plane down in the middle of the Hudson River , becoming the first pilot ever to execute a controlled water landing in a modern commercial airliner without a single fatality , the age of the hero pilot was once again , for a brief moment , alive .
Sully ’s deification , which began almost instantly , moved from the Inauguration to the Super Bowl and continues next week , when the pilot is set to appear on 60 Minutes and David Letterman .
But the truth is , in the years since Sully began flying commercial jets , piloting has become anything but glamorous .
Automation has taken much of the actual flying out of the job .
The airlines ’ business woes have led to longer hours and lower pay .
Flying is now governed by enough rules and regulations to fill several encyclopedias .
The people attracted to the profession today are different , too .
Where the piloting ranks were once made up of former Air Force jocks , many of them combat veterans , they are now filled mainly with civilians for whom flying is less an adventure than a job .
“ Twenty - five years ago , we were a step below astronauts , ” says one veteran pilot .
“ Now we ’re a step above bus drivers .
And the bus drivers have a better pension . ”
From a passenger ’s point of view , that ’s mostly a good thing .
Each year , hundreds of millions of people fly commercial in the U.S. , and fatalities are almost always in the low double digits .
In the past two years , there have been absolutely no deaths at all .
Changes in the way pilots are recruited and trained are a key reason :
In the vast majority of situations , airline - safety experts say , you want the company man , not the cowboy .
But then there are the exceptions , the Miracles on the Hudson , the rare moments when it is following the rules , not subverting them , that becomes the riskier course of action .
Pilots like Sully who can perform in such circumstances are a dying breed .
Sully has been in the business long enough to witness firsthand the domestication of the airline pilot .
In the early days , pilots were largely uneducated farm boys or blue - collar kids who left home to become barnstormers .
Some might never have spent a minute in flight school or read a flying manual .
But as commercial air travel began rapidly expanding , the airlines embraced the image of the heroic captain , the distinguished man in uniform you can trust with your life .
The industry paid top dollar for a new generation of service - academy - educated aviators , many of whom had been through Vietnam .
This was Sully ’s generation .
By the seventies , as many as 80 percent of commercial - airline pilots had served in the military .
“ When Sully first got hired , ” says Keith Hagy , the director of engineering and air safety for the Air Line Pilots Association , the pilots ’ union , “ he probably made a pile of money . ”
The airlines liked military pilots , in part , because “ the government had done all that work for them , ” says Don Skiados , who has worked closely with pilots for 40 years as a past chairman of the Aviation Accreditation Board International .
The military had already tested the pilots ’ psychological abilities , emotional traits , knowledge base , reaction time , and ability to make judgments .
The only downside of the military background was that the pilots were , by necessity , trained to be risk - takers .
“ The approach to the mission is that this is war , ” says Bob Ober , who worked as a pilot for Pan Am for 25 years and Delta for 10 .
“ We gotta go .
It does n’t matter if certain things are inoperative , we ’re gonna take some risks . ”
Since that time , pilot culture has done almost a 180 .
The maverick pilot has given way to the professional — the captain who knows how to put aside his ego and not take unnecessary risks .
The change began when the military started downsizing after Vietnam and its talent pool dried up .
The pilots of the military made room for a generation of pilots largely educated in flight schools offering four - year degree programs .
Candidates racked up flight hours on small commuter planes over Albuquerque and Toledo , not in fighter jets .
The planes also began to change .
Where a Vietnam - era pilot could fly more or less by stick and rudder , today ’s pilots fly primarily by computer .
Sully , for instance , was flying the Airbus 320 .
On older aircraft , a pilot pulls back on a wheel attached to cables that literally pull the plane up .
On an Airbus 320 , he pulls back a joystick that sends a signal to the computer ’s auto - throttle .
If he ’s doing it wrong , the computer often corrects him , thrusting if he does n’t do it soon enough , never stalling if he pulls back too hard .
Takeoff has preprogrammed speeds ; the pilot just moves a lever into a notch .
Practically everything about the Airbus assumes the human factor to be the most dangerous thing about the flight .
Incredibly , you can go on autopilot from as low as 100 feet in the air .
Although some pilots worry about overreliance on technology and the distractions it can cause , most like a tricked - out plane .
Still , there ’s no getting around the fact that automation has taken control away from pilots .
It ’s the same with regard to air - traffic controllers and airline operations .
Pilots used to have to navigate themselves ; now it ’s all done with GPS systems .
Pilots used to have more discretion over takeoff times and maintenance decisions ; now they ’re frequently overruled .
The state of the airline industry has also diminished pilots ’ status .
The modern era of airline mergers and bankruptcies and rising fuel costs has meant extended flying schedules , wage freezes , and pension cuts .
Today starting salaries at some airlines are as low as $ 25,000 .
Sully ’s retirement plan was taken away during one airline bankruptcy , and over two decades , his pay has increased by just 6 percent .
“ Pilots are being treated as a commodity , ” says Gary Hummel , training committee chairman for the U.S. Airline Pilots Association .
“ Until you need them to park a plane in the Hudson .
Then you say , ‘ Hey , there might be more to this job . ’ ”
Pilots and pilot advocates worry that great aviators may be being bred out of the system .
“ I have a son who is 27 and a software engineer , ” says Hummel .
“ I have a daughter who is 25 and is a professional nurse .
They both graduated from good colleges .
Both of them have flown an airplane , but I told them , ‘ Find another profession , because you wo n’t be able to feed your family or have a retirement in this one . ’
My daughter earned more in her first year as a nurse than Jeff Skiles , Sully ’s first officer on Flight 1549 , earns after eighteen years of dedicated service with US Airways .
Why would I encourage them to be a professional pilot ? ”
Pilots have a hard time making a case about the potential effects of all of these changes , because the airlines ’ safety records are so impressive at the moment .
“ You go and argue with either the public or the CEOs that there ’s going to be an impact on safety at some point , ” says Bob Ober .
“ The statistics make it hard to make that case to someone who is n’t intimately acquainted with day - to - day operations , sitting in the cockpit next to people .
But the guys in the industry know it ’s got to . ”
So what does happen when the unexpected happens ?
In an emergency , what separates a great pilot — a Sully — from one who fails catastrophically ?
Keeping calm is clearly an essential factor , but what ’s that a function of ?
In 1989 , United Airlines Flight 232 , a DC - 10 piloted by captain Al Haynes , crash - landed in Iowa at Sioux City Airport .
The craft had lost one engine and all three hydraulic systems , forcing an emergency landing .
One hundred and eighty - five people survived the crash .
In part , self - preservation is what helped keep Haynes calm , he says .
“ Panic just wo n’t do you any good .
From day one , you know that if you panic , you ’re dead . ”
Not only does piloting self - select for people who tend to handle stress effectively , but the airline industry has developed sophisticated systems for ferreting out candidates who are n’t unusually self - possessed .
“ When I was hired , ” says one retired commercial pilot , “ you got hired on the basis of your qualifications , your interviews , and that was it .
Now you see a shrink , you ’ve got batteries of psychological tests , you ’ve got an interview process to go through with very sophisticated questioning . ”
The thousands of training hours pilots log also help them numb their stress , Haynes says .
“ By constantly being retrained , and going through all kinds of different problems and having to do it calmly and efficiently , that just sticks with you .
So when the time comes that something really goes wrong , that ’s inherent in you and you just do it . ”
Today ’s flight simulators can mimic almost any situation .
“ They ’re actually a little more difficult to fly than the airplane , so if you can fly the simulator , then you can certainly fly the airplane . ”
In recent years , the old paradigm of the lone pilot ’s single - handedly saving the day has been discredited in favor of assiduous collaboration .
The approach is known as Crew Resource Management , and it ’s seen as another critical tool for successfully managing a crisis .
Haynes ’s United Flight 232 is taught as a case study in CRM .
Denny Fitch was a flight instructor and check airman who happened to be a passenger on Flight 232 .
When Fitch sent word to the cockpit that he was intimately familiar with the systems of a DC - 10 , Haynes brought him forward , and he and the rest of the crew worked together .
“ Any other captain probably would have said , ‘ Why do n’t you shut the hell up ?
I ’m busy up here , ’ ” says Gary Hummel .
“ But Captain Haynes said , ‘ Absolutely .
I ’ll take all the help I can get . ’ ” It was only by working together — Fitch had knowledge of the plane ’s hydraulic systems that proved critical — that Haynes and the others managed to jury - rig an effective solution .
“ If you read the cockpit transcript , there ’s no arguing at all , ” Haynes says .
“ None of us knew what to do , and we ’re just working together to find a way to get the thing down to the ground . ”
The airlines have since concluded that the least communicative pilots and crews in crises are the ones that fail the most , and CRM is now a standard part of flight training .
Simulated flights are even videotaped and critiqued to maximize collaboration among pilots and between pilots and crew .
“ In the debriefing , ” Hummel says , “ you actually sit down with the captain and the co-pilot and say , ‘ Hey , when you were having that emergency situation , and you looked over at the co-pilot and said , “ Give me the gear now ” — how did that come across ? ’
And the co-pilot can say , ‘ Well , he kind of shut me out .
It was like he was screaming at me . ’
And the captain might sit back and say , ‘ You know what ?
I did n’t know I came across like a jerk .
I could have said , “ Hey , how about the gear , please ? ” I could have included him and made him more inclusive . ’ ”
At the same time , a pilot has to know when to take over an aircraft himself and simply improvise .
Al Slader was the co-pilot of United Airlines Flight 811 , a 747 that was en route from Honolulu to New Zealand in 1989 when a cargo door failed , blowing out several rows of seats .
With a gaping hole in the side of their plane , the crew was still able to make an emergency landing back in Hawaii .
Nine people died , but 346 survived .
“ We had two engines out , Nos. 3 and 4 , same side , ” Slader says .
“ We were gonna go down ; it was just a matter of where . ”
United ’s procedure for severe engine damage is to pull the firewall shutoff , he says .
“ If I had done that , we ’d have lost two hydraulic systems ” — half the plane ’s flight controls — “ and we ’d have probably ended up in the water .
But I did n’t do that . ”
In emergency situations , Denny Fitch says , you have to “ live by what you can use out of the book , then adapt your airmanship if it ’s not in the book .
You just have to come up with your answers to problems that nobody ever thought of before . ”
Old - fashioned optimism , Fitch says , can also help .
“ My attitude from the very beginning of that incident was that we were n’t going to crash , ” he says .
He had a clear vision of the desired outcome : “ We are going to successfully land this thing , with the wheels down , rolling down a runway , and come to a stop .
The evacuation doors are going to open , the slides are going to deploy , and 296 people are going to slide out safely .
Then we are going to get ground transportation , go to the nearest bar , and I am buying . ”
“ Twenty - five years ago , we were a step below astronauts , ” says one veteran pilot .
“ Now we ’re a step above bus drivers .
And the bus drivers have a better pension . ”
When you break the rules , of course , you ’ve got to get it right .
That ’s what leaves other pilots in awe of the Hayneses and Sladers and Sullys of the world .
“ Pilots are on - off switch people , ” says Jack Stephan , another US Airways pilot .
“ We go through a decision tree , through procedures and training and checklists , and the pilot knows what to do .
Captain Sullenberger displayed the type of piloting that ’s required when the checklist really does n’t cover the situation .
There is no way to train for this .
Clearly this was a hand - flying masterpiece . ”
Being lucky does n’t hurt , either .
It was pure chance that Sully had been trained as a glider pilot .
It also helped that the sky was clear and the winds light that day .
“ If Sully had been a mile or so in almost any other direction across the river , he would n’t have made it , ” Slader notes .
“ He would n’t have been able to glide into the river .
So he did a heck of a good job , but there was a little bit of luck involved .
Same thing with ours .
We were lucky . ”
Some experts worry that today ’s pilots — with their lack of military experience , their aversion to risk , their reliance on automation — are perhaps less capable of improvising in an emergency .
They may be the right men for providing the greatest margin of safety for the greatest number — and in a world in which 80,000 planes take off and land in the United States every day , having that kind of pilot corps makes sense .
But what if you are one of the unlucky few who wind up in a plane that ’s in trouble ?
On that plane , you may want the pilot who dodged enemy fire over Vietnam , the seat - of - the - pants stick - and - rudder guy .
“ I ’m not suggesting that a young pilot or new pilot could not handle a situation , ” says Jack Stephan .
“ But would you want your kid in that flight ? ”
The importance of a pilot ’s ability to improvise in an emergency is n’t lost on passengers .
Haynes , Fitch , and Slader all stay in touch with some of the survivors of their flights .
They have dinner together , see shows , go to ball games .
Fitch says he gets a Christmas card every year from a family whose baby daughter survived the crash .
She ’s in her twenties now .
“ I ’ve watched that child grow , ” Fitch says .
“ The note would include , you know , ‘ Look at her , this is the life you saved . ’
What a sweet reminder of how they regarded me for my efforts . ”
David Sontag , a 74 - year - old screenwriter turned professor , was flying home to North Carolina on US Airways Flight 1549 after attending the funeral of his brother .
From the back of the plane , in seat 23 F , he had heard the bang a minute into the flight .
From his window he could see flames coming out of one engine .
The next five minutes were a blur of fear : the impact , the evacuation , waiting on the wing to be rescued .
Before they hit the water , he said a prayer : “ God , my family does not need two deaths in one week . ”
Last week , Sontag wrote letters to Sully and the rest of the crew .
“ I tried to personalize each of them as best I can , ” he says — even those to the flight attendants in the front whom he never met .
In his letter to Sully , he says , he thanked the pilot “ for his extraordinary skill and clear thinking and decision - making , and the calm and professionalism he exhibited . ”
He included words that he spoke at his brother ’s funeral , back in New York : “ We leave a little bit of ourselves with everybody we come in contact with . ”
The whole crew , Sontag says , “ would live on with everybody who was on that flight — and everybody we touch with our lives . ”
Sontag believes
Sully did one crucial thing that day that prevented a widespread panic :
He did n’t announce “ Brace for impact ” until it was absolutely necessary .
“ My feeling is he waited that long to keep people from freaking out , ” Sontag says .
“ By saying it that close to impact , all you could do was put your head down .
If that was his choice , I thought it a good one . ”
Of course , Sully also might have been too busy gliding over the Hudson to keep the passengers posted .
But Sontag prefers to think he was in control the entire time — that it really was his aircraft .
So do we all .
For many of us , faith in the captain is the only thing that gets us on a plane .
Additional reporting by Jacob Gershman .
Mr Vaisman claims almost 500,000 men over the past decade have responded to AMI 's billboard - sized promises of longer lasting sex .
The NSW regulator believes the disaffection is probably much higher than the actual complaints received as men are too embarrassed to lodge formal complaints over the $ 4000 contracts which commit them to 18 months of " treatment " and severely limit their access to the company 's money - back guarantees .
The thriving business predicated on men's sexual - performance anxiety has delivered millions of dollars to AMI coffers and spawned more than 20 clinics in Australia and New Zealand , and , most recently , a discreet consultancy in London .
Last year AMI , registered as a public company on the US NASDAQ , posted an almost 50 per cent increase in gross profit , from $ 8 million to $ 12 million , in the July to September quarter alone - profit the company attributed to its more effective advertising campaigns ( at a cost of $ 500,000 a quarter ) , increased brand name recognition , and the effectiveness of its products .
Yet AMI 's founder and owner Mr Vaisman , a portly Ukrainian migrant in his early 60s with a good suit and a comb-over , denies he is a very wealthy man .
Comfortably off , he 'll concede .
But far from accumulating personal wealth , Mr Vaisman claims he is delivering savings worth millions of dollars to Australian taxpayers every year .
" All my consultations , we never use Medicare , " he said .
" Can you imagine if 90,000 impotent patients went to their GP every year ?
At $ 45 or $ 50 a consultation , what would happen ?
The Government would lose millions of dollars . "
Sexual dysfunction , says Mr Vaisman , is a quality of life condition and if you want quality of life you have to pay : " It 's like if you want a better car or you want a better house , you pay more money . "
Mr Vaisman is under fire from multiple corners , but that is hardly new .
In 1996 his former company , On Clinic Australia , was prosecuted for importing $ 500,000 worth of unregistered drugs - the charges were proved but no conviction was recorded , with the Court of Criminal Appeal acknowledging the probably inadvertent nature of the offences .
Aside from much - publicised run-ins with the Advertising Standards Bureau , there has also been attention from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over allegedly misleading claims relating to his controversial treatments and AMI 's promises of guaranteed results or money back .
Mr Vaisman rejects the latter allegation outright : " We can not guarantee a result but we always guarantee money back . "
Meanwhile , the chorus of caveats and criticisms from the medical fraternity multiplies monthly .
Dr Chris McMahon , associate professor of the Australian Centre for Sexual Health , has dealt with former AMI patients , and alleges the majority have not received what they thought they paid for .
AMI 's apomorphine - based nasal spray has not been the subject of clinical trials , so its efficacy remains untested , he says .
" There 's a certain logic to it , " he conceded .
" I could also argue that because Panadol is effective as a tablet for a headache we could crush it up and put it into some K-Y Jelly and rub it into the scalp .
Now we all know that is ridiculous - the way that you would prove or disprove that is to do a clinical trial . "
The non-profit Impotence Australia receives on average about five complaints about AMI each week .
When patients fail to respond to the nasal spray , lozenges are offered but invariably the patient ends up facing injection therapy , the association 's chief executive , Brett McCann , says , which is where many men will draw the line .
" [ I 've seen ] one guy who had only one arm …
It is pretty difficult to inject when you 've only got one arm .
He said he would never have agreed to it had he known . "
But formal complaints are comparatively rare , says Professor Basil Donovan , from the University of NSW 's National Centre in HIV , Epidemiology and Clinical Research .
" Men are too embarrassed to come forward , " he said .
" It is an area prone to exploitation . "
The Australian Medical Association has expressed concern that some of AMI 's initial customer contact does not involve a registered medical practitioner .
Moreover , the company 's practice of conducting phone consultations is unlikely to identify health issues such as heart disease , stroke , obesity and diabetes that can often be underlying causes of erectile dysfunction , AMA president Dr Rosanna Capolingua says .
Dr David Malouf , the vice - president of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand , says the treatments AMI offered at large mark - ups could be provided at a much cheaper rate by a GP .
" But the reason [ GPs ] do n't is because these treatments are less effective than others , such as Viagra , Cialis and Levitra . "
Such mainstream treatments are also largely without the horror side effects sometimes associated with injectibles , says Dr Malouf , warning that 30 per cent of men may develop local pain at the site of the injection .
" I 've seen bruising , scarring , curvature of the penis and priapism [ persistent painful erection ] .
I had one patient who was treated with one of these agents .
He was given a sheet of paper with a number to call if anything went wrong , which it did .
He was effectively told [ by AMI ] ' there is nothing we can do , you have to go to a hospital emergency department ' …
That case of priapism was so severe , it permanently damaged his erectile function .
He went from having a mild erectile problem to having a non-functioning penis .
And he was a young guy , too . "
Dr Malouf says he also had a 17 - year - old boy who was prescribed treatment for premature ejaculation from an AMI clinic : " I would have thought that was entirely inappropriate . "
When The Sun-Herald put this to Mr Vaisman last week , he said : " If a patient asks for help , does it make any difference of the age ? "
The following day , public relations firm Wilkinson Media issued a statement saying AMI had a policy of not providing treatment to people under the age of 18 .
Mr Vaisman has never been registered as a medical practitioner in Australia , a sacrifice made , he claims , to stay in this country .
With a mother , wife and daughter to support - the former two suffering serious health problems - a year - long hospital internship was out of the question when the Ukrainian - trained doctor arrived in 1987 : " This was the price I had to pay for my freedom . "
That much of the clinics ' work with clients takes place over the phone is logical , Mr Vaisman argues , as erectile dysfunction is very much a self - diagnosed condition .
" If a patient says to the doctor , I can not get an erection , there is no test that can prove or disprove this , you have to take his word . "
It is also an effective technique , he says , in protecting anonymity .
With the exception of occasional crustiness or bleeding around the nose , Vaisman says his nasal sprays have practically no side effects .
The risk of priapism is no more prevalent with the use of injectibles than with more conventional treatments such as Viagra , he adds , while AMI 's 24 - hour hotline is available to advise in such emergencies .
Mr Vaisman says Impotence Australia , one of AMI 's most vocal critics , is in direct competition and accepts sponsorship from large pharmaceutical companies such as Viagra 's manufacturer , Pfizer .
Impotence Australia declares it accepts sponsorship from pharmaceutical companies on its website , but denies the direct competitor claims made by Mr Vaisman .
" We 're not offering any treatment , " said Mr McCann .
" We refer people either to GPs or sex therapists or we give general information . "
Mr Vaisman describes himself as a pioneer : " We have a lot of criticism .
But I am fighting for what I believe is right .
I am a fighter . "
Fighting the Recession America Is from Mars , Europe Is from Venus
As the global economic downturn worsens , the industrialized nations are at odds over how to fight the crisis .
Obama wants the Europeans to introduce additional stimulus programs , but Merkel insists Germany is already doing enough .
This year is an important one for the three largest BitTorrent sites .
In common with The Pirate Bay and isoHunt , Mininova is also heading to court in a dispute with the entertainment industry .
This May , the court will decide if the BitTorrent indexer has to actively filter content from the site .
The top three BitTorrent sites are all involved in at least one court case .
The Pirate Bay trial has just ended and isoHunt is involved in a case against the MPAA , and one against CRIA – the Canadian equivalent of the RIAA .
Mininova , based in The Netherlands , is up against local anti-piracy outfit BREIN , which has a reputation for forcing torrent sites offline or to hosting in other countries .
Through legal action , BREIN now hopes to convince the court that Mininova has to filter its search results , so that all . torrent files which may point to unauthorized content are removed .
The date for the trial was set today for May 20th , and it will take up only one day .
Before it came to legal action , Mininova and BREIN have had lengthy discussions on how to deal with copyrighted content , but they never reached an agreement .
“ The case wont say much about the legality of torrent sites , but it will give more insight into what measures BitTorrent indexers and similar services have to take in order to make sure that they do n’t link to illegal content , ” Mininova President Erik Dubbelboer told TorrentFreak .
“ In particular , it deals with the question of whether or not website owners have to actively filter content .
In other words , is a notice and takedown policy sufficient or not . ”
With the Pirate Bay case still fresh in everyone ’s memory , a comparison between the two cases is easily made .
However , they are more different than most people would assume .
First off , Mininova ’s case is against the company , not the individuals involved with the site .
“ The Pirate Bay case is a criminal trial , ours is civil , ” Erik told TorrentFreak .
Erik further noted that Mininova does n’t operate an open tracker and that they , as opposed to The Pirate Bay , take down torrents when they get an appropriate takedown request .
“ These are all big differences that clearly distinguish the two cases , ” Erik said .
There is no doubt that the Mininova trial will set an important precedent for all other BitTorrent indexers hosted in The Netherlands .
Erik and the other Mininova founders think they have the law on their side .
“ We have confidence in the outcome of the case and we do n’t think Mininova will cease to exist , ” he said .
To be continued .
The east of England may be the most godless region of the UK , according to a " belief map " published by a theology thinktank today .
Almost half of adults there believe the theory of evolution makes God obsolete , and more than 80 % disagree with creationism and intelligent design , which propose that humans were created by God in the past 10,000 years , and that life owes its complexity to divine intervention .
The map was drawn up by the thinktank
Theos following a survey of 2,060 people across the country who were chosen to be representative of the adult population .
The survey , which was conducted to mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth , found that nearly half of the British adult population could not name the country 's greatest naturalist as the author of On the Origin of Species , the 1859 book that introduced evolution through natural selection to a sceptical Victorian society .
The poll also revealed some extraordinary views on more recent writings , with 5 % of adults thinking Darwin wrote A Brief History of Time , a bestseller on the science of spacetime , which was written by the Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking and is widely regarded as the most popular science book never to be completed by its readers .
A further 3 % of those surveyed thought Darwin wrote The God Delusion , by the arch - atheist and Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins , while 1 % thought Darwin was the author of The Naked Chef by Jamie Oliver .
The study found only 15 % of people knew that Darwin was a self - described agnostic towards the end of his life , with a fifth believing he was an atheist .
Nearly half thought evolution challenged Christianity but said it was possible to believe in both .
The survey suggests there is a widespread lack of religious sentiment across Britain .
National average figures revealed that less than a third of adults see evolution as part of God 's plan , 89 % dismiss intelligent design and 83 % reject creationism as plausible explanations for the existence of human life .
The survey reveals a relatively high proportion of people in London who believe in creationism .
" Whereas the national average is 17 % who believe that human beings were created by God in the last 10,000 years ... in London , that figure is 20 % .
That may well be due to the growth of Pentecostal churches in London , which are growing at an extraordinary rate , " said Paul Woolley , director of Theos .
According to the survey , Northern Ireland has the highest proportion of people who believe in intelligent design ( 16 % ) and creationism ( 25 % ) .
" The research clearly indicates there is a great deal of confusion about what people believe and why they believe it , " said Woolley .
" There are two lessons in particular that we can learn from Darwin .
The first is that belief in God and evolution are compatible .
Secondly , in a time when debates about evolution and religious belief can be aggressive and polarised , Charles Darwin remains an example of how to disagree without being disagreeable , " he added .

Here ’s a list of the 30 basic chord types : Major

In addition , the Complete Keyboard Chord Poster shows how you can alter most 7th , 9th , 11th , and 13th chords , or any of their inversions , without doubling any notes , to create a broad spectrum of variants for these chords .
A column labelled “ ALT ” just to the right of each “ alterable ” chord type shows you which notes you may substitute in these chords to create “ altered ” variant chords without doubling any notes in either the original chord or its altered variants .
That means , using nothing but the Complete Keyboard Chord Poster , you can play about 8,800 completely unique chords on any keyboard .
For example , you may substitute one or more of the following notes to create these unique and interesting altered chords : - Major 2nd or perfect 4th in place of a major 3rd , to create
suspended 2nd or 4th alterations of 7th or 9th chords .
- Diminished or augmented 5th in place of a perfect 5th , to
create diminished or augmented alterations of 7th , 9th , 11th ,
or 13th chords .
- Major seventh in place of a dominant 7th to create major 7th
alterations of 9th , 11th , and 13th chords .
- Flat 9th or augmented 9th in place of a 9th , to create flatted
or augmented 9th alterations of 11th and 13th chords .
You can use more than one alteration in a single chord .
That means you can play dozens of completely unique variants of a single basic chord ( e.g. , C7 or F9 , or any of their inversions ) without doubling any notes in any of the altered chords .
And , you can do it without knowing how to read a note of music , yet still be able to identify every chord by its correct name , so that you can return to it later , or incorporate it in a lead sheet for a song , etc. ~  ~  ~  ~
" Intervals used to stump me .

Suppose the chords of a given song are in the key of D .
The chords might be , for example : D , Bm , F #7 , Dm7 , and A7 How can you quickly find the equivalent chords in a different key , for example , the key of G ?
And how do you finger the chords in the new key ?
Here 's how , using the Complete Keyboard Chord Poster .
The red horizontal bar contains all the chords for the key of D .
The grey horizontal bar contains all the chords for the key of G .
So , wherever any chord appears in the red bar , just play whichever chord appears in the same column in the grey bar .
Here 's the original chord sequence in the key of D , followed by transposed chords in the key of G : Chords in Original Key ( Key of D , red bar ) : D , Bm , F #7 , Dm7 , A7 Chords in Transposed Key ( Key of G , grey bar ) : G , Em , B7 , Gm7 , D7 You do n't have to do any mental calculations to transpose the chords from one key to another .
Just look at the colour bar corresponding to the key you want to transpose to .
Then play whichever chords appear in the same columns as the chords in the colour bar of your original key .
That ’s all there is to it .
