Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador , June 3 , 2009 -- On June 1 , Mauricio Funes and Salvador Sanchez Cerén were sworn in as president and vice - president of El Salvador at the Feria Internacional Convention Center in San Salvador .
It was a magical day for the Salvadoran people , social movement organisations , and the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) , which Funes and Sanchez Cerén represent .
Counted among the 2000 invited guests were many international delegations and heads of state , including President Correa of Ecuador , President Lula of Brazil , Vice - President Lazo of Cuba , President Bachelet of Chile , President Lugo of Paraguay , President Uribe of Colombia and President Arias from Costa Rica .
Representatives from the Dominican Republic , Bolivia , China , Taiwan , and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton among others joined them .
Notably absent were presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia , who were unable to attend due to last - minute concerns regarding their security while in the country .
The Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador ( CISPES ) was also present with a delegation of members from Washington DC , Los Angeles , New York and Minneapolis .
View pictures of the inauguration here and here .
In a powerful inaugural address , Funes promised that the change the people asked for with the election of the FMLN “ begins now ” and is in the hands of the people , not just the individual will of the president .
He vowed to work with the social movements to “ create a new national project ” based on social inclusion and guided by the forces of hope and optimism .
Several steps that he and cabinet members ( see recent CISPES update ) , who were sworn in immediately following the ceremony , will take to confront the deep economic and social crisis in El Salvador include an employment program to build more tha 25,000 new houses , a central bank to guarantee credit to small - scale agricultural producers and the re-imagination of the Rural Community Solidarity Network to guarantee access to health , nutrition and free public education for the most vulnerable sectors of society .
The address was imbued with the themes of social justice , equality and of a “ peaceful and democratic revolution ” .
He stated that El Salvador would no longer have a “ government of the few , of the privileged ” but one where all people would be “ recognised for their talents and honesty , not for their connections or their last name ” .
He spoke of his teacher and mentor , Monsenor Oscar Arnulfo Romero , whose tomb he visited the morning of the inauguration and whose vision of a “ preferential option for the poor ” was a pillar in Funes ’ discourse during the campaign .
Funes emphasised the importance of investing in the public sector and of transparent , democratic public administration , marking a clear break from the notorious corruption and policy of rampant privatisation of the right - wing ARENA government during the last 20 years .
Funes explained that even though the economic crisis was neither the fault of the Salvadoran people or the FMLN party , but rather of the previous ARENA administrations , it is their responsibility to resolve it .
He vowed to fight corruption within the government and within the police , stating that “ the time of bankrolling and impunity is over ” .
He said frankly , “ There are leaders and political parties who have had their chance and they have failed .
Now it is our turn and our responsibility .
It is time to show that we have n’t waited this long to govern just to frustrate the dreams of the Salvadoran people . ”
The bold public exposure of corruption and cronyism of the right - wing government signals a major shift in El Salvador ’s political climate , as does the homage to the Archbishop Romero , whose assassination was orchestrated by the founder of the ARENA party .
It was a very emotional experience for many Salvadorans and long - time solidarity activists to see the leadership of the FMLN , many of whom , including vice - president Sanchez Cerén , were guerrilla commanders , being saluted by the Salvadoran military and taking the reins from the very government that killed more than 75,000 Salvadorans in its attempt to stop the FMLN from coming to power during the civil war .
Despite the decorum and formality of the inauguration ceremony , many in the crowd erupted into cheers of “ Sí se pudo , Sí se pudo !
( Yes we did ! ) ” and “ El pueblo unido jamás será vencido ! ” with their left fists in the air .
Further revealing the guiding political and ideological principles of many FMLN activists , the loudest cheers were heard during the announcement of international delegations from Cuba , Venezuela , Vietnam and Palestine .
The excitement and energy of the FMLN ’s base only increased at the people ’s inauguration ( see video and pictures at http://www.cispes.org), the FMLN ’s public celebration at Cuscatlán Stadium that lasted into the night .
Salvadorans who came from across the country arrived as early as 3 am to be part of what former FMLN leader Schafik Handal once promised would be “ a date with history . ”
More than 50,000 people formed a celebratory sea of red and white in the stadium , cheering and dancing to the music of historic revolutionary groups like Cutumay Camones and Los Guaraguao as they waited for the address of their new president .
Before Funes spoke , Latin American leaders including President Rafael Correa of Ecuador and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua congratulated the Salvadoran people on their triumph and welcomed El Salvador into the consolidation of left - wing and progressive countries in Latin America , calling forth the vision of Simón Bolívar for the unity and integration of the Americas .
Funes announced that earlier in the day he had formally re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba and would move toward regional integration in Central America .
Funes also recognised the great sacrifice of many Salvadorans throughout decades of struggle .
A banner hanging in the stadium read : “ Only the people can guarantee that the electoral victory will become popular power . ”
Militant organisation by the Salvadoran people , both during 30 years of struggle and during the past year of electoral campaigning , resulted in the first left - wing government in El Salvador , and will remain the most powerful force in what Funes called “ the work of re-inventing the world ” .
Even by the standards of the Pentagon fringe science arm , this project sounds far - out : " programmable matter " that can be ordered to " self - assemble or alter their shape , perform a function and then disassemble themselves . "
But researchers backed by Darpa are actually making progress on this incredible goal , Henry Kenyon at Signal magazine reports .
One day , that could lead to " morphing aircraft and ground vehicles , uniforms that can alter themselves to be comfortable in any climate , and ' soft ' robots that flow like mercury through small openings to enter caves and bunker complexes . "
A soldier could even reach into a can of unformed goop , and order up a custom - made tool or a " universal spare part . "
One team from Harvard is working on a kind of " generalized Rubik ’s Cube " that can fold into all kinds of shapes .
Another is trying to order large strands of synthetic DNA to bind together in a " molecular Velcro . "
An MIT group is building " self - folding origami " machines that " use specialized sheets of material with built - in actuators and data .
These machines use cutting - edge mathematical theorems to fold themselves into virtually any three - dimensional object . "
The Programmable Matter project is five months into its second phase , which is supposed to wind up early next Spring .
When they 're done , the researchers ought to " assemble four or five three - dimensional solids of a specific size and shape from a set of building blocks . "
Intel , which has done a bunch of programmable matter work on its own , is looking beyond those basic steps .
Way , way beyond .
The malleable stuff could one day " mimic the shape and appearance of a person or object being imaged in real time , and as the originals moved , so would their replicas , " according to their website .
" These 3D models would be physical entities , not holograms .
You could touch them and interact with them , just as if the originals were in the room with you . "

The Google Street View driver had quite a time fending off the angry mob !
A gang of angry Luddites in Ye Olde Middle England have set upon an innocent Google Street View car driver in an attempt to save their lives from ruin .
" Angry villagers formed a human chain to thwart the progress of a Google Street View car that was in the process of taking photographs of their homes , " reads a report in The Times .
Police were soon on the scene in the leafy village of Broughton in deepest Buckinghamshire with the " furious villagers " blocking the progress of the Google Street View car .
A burglar 's charter
Local man Paul Jacobs , was quickly able to identify this moving threat to civilisation with its 360 - degree snooping camera eye and was quick to warn his fellow villagers of the presence of the Google alien in their midst .
He warned the driver , telling The Times : " My immediate reaction was anger ; how dare anyone take a photograph of my home without my consent ?
I ran outside to flag the car down and told the driver he was not only invading our privacy but also facilitating crime .
" This is an affluent area .
We 've already had three burglaries locally in the past six weeks .
If our houses are plastered all over Google it 's an invitation for more criminals to strike .
I was determined to make a stand , so I called the police . "
Thames Valley Police confirmed that one of its squad cars " was sent to Broughton at 10.20 am on Wednesday to reports of a dispute between a crowd of people and a Google Street View contractor . "

In a further sign of its aggressive intent , North Korea has prohibited vessels from sailing in the mid and upper parts of the Yellow Sea until the end of July .
Although bans on sailing in the area are issued frequently by Pyongyang , the latest embargo is unusually long in duration .
South Korea said it was monitoring activity in the area very carefully .
Paul Krugman , writing in August of 2002 :
To fight this recession the Fed needs more than a snapback ; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment .
And to do that , as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it , Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble .

Calling all iPhone owners anxious about the spread of swine flu :
A potential app , the Swine Flu Tracker , may be on the way .
The Swine Flu Tracker , still pending approval from Apple , would be free .
It was developed by IntuApps , whose founders , Barry Schwartz and Lilly Gold , say they want to keep people informed about the virus and where it is spreading .
“ Just being able to have the information with you on the go is a powerful tool for people , ” Gold told CNN .
The Swine Flu Tracker 's first tab shows the current threat level – Phase 5 – and brief description from the World Health Organization .
The next feature , likely the most useful , is a map that tracks where the virus is spreading in relation to the user via a “ locate me ” button .
Each pin that pops up on the map offers details about confirmed and suspected flu cases .
The data comes from a Google Maps RSS feed .
A third tab provides virus facts and flu symptoms from the Centers for Disease Control , Wikipedia and other sources .
The last screen , Alerts , is a consolidated triad of Twitter updates from the World Health Organization , the CDC and HealthMap .
Schwartz submitted Swine Flu Tracker on Thursday and said Apple typically takes a week or two to approve new apps before they are released .
Given the urgency of the swine flu outbreak , maybe they 'll move more swiftly on this one .
“ Hopefully the virus will end soon , but being informed is important for now and [ for ] trying to keep everyone healthy , ” Gold said .
Any iPhone user interested in downloading Swine Flu Tracker can leave a comment for Schwartz on his blog , CartoonBarry.com , and he will let you know when the app goes live .

First - time applicants for passports may be asked about their credit card debts - which is one result of a link between public and private sector databases .
Similar questions may be asked in future when individuals apply for ID cards , though not at the initial roll - out of ID cards in Manchester , when applicants will not need to attend an interview .
A senior civil servant at the Cabinet Office said at a technology roundtable in central London this week that a credit agency is supplying the Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) with suggested questions to ask applicants for passports at their interview .
The civil servant cited the link between the IPS and the credit histories of individuals as a positive example of how citizens will sometimes accept the sharing of sensitive data between the state and the private sector if there is a clear benefit : in this case a new passport .
But some privacy campaigners may see the linking of private and public databases as evidence of state intrusion into peoples ' lives .
Applicants face the questions on their credit histories when they are interviewed for new passports at one of the Identity and Passport Service 's 68 enrolment offices .
The offices opened in 2008 .
As a check on their identity , all first - time applicants for passports aged over 16 must be interviewed and accept that the Identity and Passport Service will obtain information about them from various databases , including one run by credit agency Equifax .
The IPS has confirmed that it is using information from the credit card firm Equifax and from other sources to build a profile of applicants before they are interviewed as part of enrolment for new passports .
Its spokesman denied that specific questions are recommended by credit card agencies to be put to passport applicants .
Computer Weekly has learned , however , that the IPS is seeking to have questions for applicants at enrolment generated automatically as a result of data sharing between public and private sector databases , including those run by credit agencies , and information given on application forms .
The IPS says that the questions it asks applicants will be based on information given in the application form and from " lawful searches of other public and private sector databases , including credit reference agencies " .
An IPS spokesman said : " ' When carrying out interviews with first time adult applicants we use information , including credit history , held by public and private sector organisations as part of the process to verify the applicant 's identity .
" This is not a detailed credit check but an identity check to confirm that the person exists and is active in society .
" This also gives us the confidence that the applicant is who they say they are and are resident at the address provided before the passport is despatched to them .
Both the application form and IPS website makes it clear that we will be making this check to verify the identity of applicants . "

An exhibition called ' Sight Unseen ' has opened at the California Museum of Photography which showcases the work of twelve blind photographers from around the world .
The curator of Sight Unseen , Douglas McCulloh , explains how visually impaired people are able to capture such beautiful images .
The interview is low - key but demanding .
First , the person recalls a vivid memory , like the first day at college , so researchers have a baseline reading for how the person communicates .
The person then freely recounts the event being investigated , recalling all that happened .
After several pointed questions ( “ Would a police officer say a crime was committed ? ” for example ) , the interviewee describes the event in question again , adding sounds , smells and other details .
Several more stages follow , including one in which the person is asked to recall what happened in reverse .
In several studies , Dr. Colwell and Dr. Hiscock - Anisman have reported one consistent difference : People telling the truth tend to add 20 to 30 percent more external detail than do those who are lying .
“ This is how memory works , by association , ” Dr. Hiscock - Anisman said .
“ If you ’re telling the truth , this mental reinstatement of contexts triggers more and more external details . ”
Not so if you ’ve got a concocted story and you ’re sticking to it .
“ It ’s the difference between a tree in full flower in the summer and a barren stick in winter , ” said Dr. Charles Morgan , a psychiatrist at the National Center for Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder , who has tested it for trauma claims and among special - operations soldiers .
In one recent study , the psychologists had 38 undergraduates enter a professor ’s office and either steal an exam or replace one that had been stolen .
A week later , half told the truth in this structured interview , and the other half tried not to incriminate themselves by lying in the interview .
A prize of $ 20 was offered to the most believable liars .
The researchers had four trained raters who did not know which students were lying analyze the transcripts for response length and richness of added detail , among other things .
They correctly categorized 33 of the 38 stories as truthful or deceitful .
The study , whose co-authors were Amina Memon , Laura Taylor and Jessica Prewett , is one of several showing positive results of about 75 percent correct or higher .
This summer , Dr. Colwell and Dr. Hiscock - Anisman are scheduled to teach the technique at the San Diego Police Department , which has a force of some 2,000 officers .
“ You really develop your own antenna when interviewing people over the years , ” said Chris Ellis , a lieutenant on the force who invited the researchers to give training .
“ But we ’re very open to anything that will make our jobs easier and make us more accurate . ”
A photo of the contents of an albatross chick 's stomach illustrates the impact our dependency on plastic has on marine wildlife
Toothbrushes , bottle tops and cigarette lighters – all every day objects we take for granted .
But as this startling picture taken of the contents of a young albatross shows , some of the 260 m tonnes of plastic used annually ends up in the most unlikely places .
Sometimes with tragic consequences .
Published this week in the Theme Issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , the picture clearly illustrates the impact our dependency on plastic has on marine wildlife .
The special issue took two years to compile and contains contributions from more than 60 scientists worldwide to provide the most comprehensive description of the consequences of our use of plastics .
Dr Richard Thompson from Plymouth University who edited the special issue said it should be a research priority to find out what effect swallowing plastics has on the 160 species of marine wildlife that swallow it .
" Plastic production is growing at 9 % a year , " he says .
" The quantity of plastic produced in he first 10 years of this century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded it . "
The contents from the dead Laysan albatross chick were collected and arranged by Cynthia Vanderlip on Kure Atoll in Hawaii .
The photograph was taken by Rebecca Hosking , who successfully campaigned to turn her hometown of Modbury plastic bag free .
It is not known whether the bird died because it ingested so much debris , and it is often difficult to establish whether plastics kill marine life .
" For ethical reasons you can only carry out this research on dead birds – so it 's difficult to establish exactly how they 've died , " says Thompson .

You no longer need to be in international waters to get away with illegal radio broadcasting : the net has provided new platforms to transmit signals and hide those producing them ( Image : Universal / Everett / Rex Features )
YOU are chilling out to your favourite songs on your car radio , only to have them drowned out by an appalling , fuzzy din you did n’t tune into .
It happens all too often in cities , where legitimate stations in the FM band lose out to pirate stations playing their own brands of music alongside brash nightlife advertising .
And this hijacking of the airwaves wo n’t change any …
Mark Cavendish packed his lightweight helmet , his fingerless gloves and his cleated shoes and went home on Friday night , with a full week of the Giro d'Italia still to go .
Cycling is a funny sport sometimes , its conventions and nuances difficult for the uninitiated to comprehend , and here was an example .
Why , in perfect health and with three stage victories to his name , would the man who has proved himself unquestionably the rider of the year so far decide to walk away from the climax of the centenary edition of one of cycling 's great races ?
The answer is that , for Cavendish , Friday 's 13th stage of the Giro d'Italia was his 55th day of competitive riding in 2009 .
Six weeks hence he will be on the starting line in Monaco , requiring every ounce of his strength as he sets off on his quest to become the first British rider to win the green jersey in the Tour de France .
And the grand plan says he needs a rest .
Introduced in 1953 and given to the rider who compiles the biggest total of points for stage placings and intermediate sprints , the green jersey is usually won by a sprinter with a modicum of all - round ability .
Cavendish , who celebrated his 24th birthday last week , is a specialist sprinter who knows that he will have to work on other elements of the package if he is to achieve his ambition .
But there is a chance that he will bring it off this July , a year after he established a record for a British rider of four stage wins in the 2008 Tour , which he also left early in order to prepare himself for the Olympic Games .
You do n't win the green jersey if you do n't finish the race , of course , and for Cavendish that will mean hauling himself across the summits of the various mountains included in this year 's Tour itinerary .
By the time the riders reach the mighty Mont Ventoux on the penultimate day they will already have 2,000 miles in their weary legs , including ascents of the Port d'Envalira , the Col du Tourmalet , the Grand Saint Bernard and the Cormet de Roselend .
I make no apology for returning to the subject of Cavendish so soon after praising his victory in the Milan - San Remo one - day classic last month .
What the young Manxman is doing is as remarkable as anything currently being achieved by any British sportsman or woman in any field , and he deserves far more than the muted credit he is getting at home .
In countries where cycling is woven more deeply into sporting life , his deeds are being looked on with awe .
Italians were impressed last week when , having suffered defeat at the hands of the local hero Alessandro Petacchi in two early stages of the Giro , Cavendish came back , his pride aflame , exploiting the talent and discipline of his Columbia - High Road team - mates to make the score 3 – 2 in his favour before both men left the race on the same evening .
And on Saturday morning , the cycling correspondent of L'Equipe christened him " le Mozart du onze - dents " .
Those words translate into something rather less poetic : the Mozart of the 11 - tooth sprocket , that being the smallest sprocket on the cassette of a racer 's derailleur gears , and the one which a sprinter uses to mount his final charge to the line .
It 's worth noting once again that , through no fault of his own , Cavendish was the only member of Britain 's entire Olympic track cycling squad to leave Beijing last summer without having found his way on to the podium .
When , on the way home , he borrowed a gold medal from a team - mate who had one to spare in order to try and get himself the upgrade to the first - class cabin granted by British Airways to the winners , he was spotted and sent back into his pre-assigned seat .
He has never been short of ambition and self - confidence , but maybe the petty humiliation that followed his unexpected Olympic setback is one of the factors currently putting wings on his 11 - tooth sprocket .
Uefa pragmatists spawn another oversized monster
We said goodbye last week to the Uefa Cup , which began life in 1955 as the Inter - Cities Fairs Cup , changed its title in 1971 , and next season will mutate into the Europa League , a competition that promises to burden its finalists with an extra 19 games in an already overcrowded season .
The choice of title is interesting and significant .
Here , surely , is the climax of Uefa 's long campaign to silence those of us who persist in referring to their senior knock - out club competition as the European Cup , which is how it became known to English - speakers when Gabriel Hanot invented it , also in 1955 .
The first references to the Champions League came in 1992 - 93 , when the new title was introduced by stealth – I remember it appearing that winter , with no prior announcement , on hoardings around the perimeter of San Siro before a tie between Milan and Gothenburg .
For my money , the thing that either Manchester United or Barcelona will hold aloft in Rome on Wednesday is the European Cup .
But now that there is something officially known as the Europa League , the battle to defend the historic title of Hanot 's great tournament appears to be lost .
Mourinho 's ego got in way of success , says Makelele
Here is Claude Makelele on Jose Mourinho , from the former Chelsea midfielder 's new autobiography , published in France this week : " For two years we lived like a gang of mates who eat together , get out of their heads together , train together the next day , and win matches together . "
The solidarity of the Chelsea squad between 2004 and 2006 was exceptional .
Mourinho destroyed that unity by getting rid of certain elements in favour of new players considered to be stars .
Certainly , he made it clear that he was not in favour of all the new recruits .
But if that was the case , he should have gone ...
" Very early in the 2006 – 07 season he became distant from the players .
At a stroke , a split opened in the spirit of brotherhood which had united us with him .
Then he got involved with Abramovich .
When the president asked for his champion players to express themselves more freely on the pitch , Mourinho obstinately refused to change his methods ...
Something was broken at the top and we , the players , finished up suffering for it ...
" During the third and final season under that regime , I was shocked to see how Mourinho forgot the vital role of the players and took just about all the credit for himself ...
For him , it was n't the individuals who made the team work but the methods he had put in place .
Towards the end , he really gave the impression that he felt endangered whenever a player took the attention away from him . "
Just as we thought , no ?
France finds its voice during Heineken session
The domestic rugby season , in which the effect of the experimental law variations created so much debate and controversy , ended with a Heineken Cup final that relocated us squarely in the days of good old thud and blunder .
Watching Leinster overcome Leicester on French television , the commentators ' exclamations of " Quelle bataille !
Quelle bataille ! " came thick and fast .
And none the worse for that , if you ask me .
DeltaRPM Support ( Presto )
Summary
The presto plugin for yum adds support for downloading deltarpms and using them to generate new packages .
If user enables this plugin , it will make a substantial dent in the amount of data having to be downloaded for updates .
Owners
Name : LukeMacken , SethVidal
Current status
Targeted release : Fedora 11
Last modified : 2009-03-02
Percentage of completion : 100 %
bodhi ticket # 160 for more details .
need to figure out where we want to put the deltarpm files and get our compose / push tools to add the options for it .
Details
Plugin and tools exist in the repository
Well over 100 users ( closer to 200 ) have been using the plugin in conjunction with unofficial presto- enabled repositories with no fatal ( i.e. yum breaks ) errors since August .
XML format is cleaned up and has a schema for validity checking
createrepo has code to generate deltarpms and presto xml metadata .
code is all ready to go - plan is to have a test for f11 al pha -> f11 beta upgrades
Usage cases / rationale
Justin only has a dial - up connection available for his computer .
Currently he has very little chance to actually keep up with the update churn of Fedora due to the amount of data being transferred .
Adding presto support will reduce the amount of data he has to transfer and thus make it so that he can keep his Fedora system updated .
Barry pays for his network connection based on usage .
Adding presto support will reduce the amount of data he has to transfer and thus reduce the cost for his network connection .
Scope
Requires that the yum - presto metadata be created / available by default .
Also requires infrastructure work on the buildsystem and compose tools so that we can ensure that deltas are included in the - updates repositories .
We will NOT be enabling yum - presto by default .
Users can install this plugin if they wish and take advantage of the repositories having the presto / delta metadata .
How To Test
Ensure that updates work using deltas rather than downloading full packages .
Ensure that changing files from a package lead to downloading the full package rather than the delta .
Ensure that changing a % config file from a package does not lead to downloading the full package .
Ensure that yum does n't break when yum - presto runs into problems .
( i.e. always fall back to downloading the full package if nothing else works )
Dependencies
The binary diff algorithm used in deltarpm is a version of bsdiff modified for speed .
Details
Contingency Plan
If things are n't working , then we just do n't install and enable the plugin by default .
Documentation
See README for the documentation
Release Notes
Normally when you update a package in Fedora , you download an entire replacement package .
Most of the time ( especially for the larger packages ) , most of the actual data in the updated package is the same as the original package , but you still end up downloading the full package .
Presto allows you to download the difference ( called the delta ) between the package you have installed and the one you want to update to .
This can reduce the download size of updates by 60 % - 80 % .
It is not enabled by default for this release .
To make use of this feature you must install the yum - presto plugin : yum install yum - presto .

2 The Englishman lives in the red house .
3 The Spaniard owns the dog .
4 Coffee is drunk in the green house .
5 The Ukrainian drinks tea .
6 The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house .
7 The Old Gold smoker owns snails .
8 Kools are smoked in the yellow house .
9 Milk is drunk in the middle house .
10 The Norwegian lives in the first house .
11 The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox .
12 Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept .
13 The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice .
14 The Japanese smokes Parliaments .
15 The Norwegian lives next to the blue house .
In the interest of clarity , it must be added that each of the five houses is painted a different color , and their inhabitants are of different national extractions , own different pets , drink different beverages and smoke different brands of American cigarettes .
What happened
Europe ’s antitrust regulator fined computer chip giant Intel a record $ 1.45 billion for illegally stifling competition , by undercutting smaller rival AMD .
The European Commission says Intel illegally cut deals with PC makers to lock out AMD , while Intel says it just offered volume discounts .
Whether or not the EC proves that Intel broke EU laws , “ there are questions about whether consumers were really harmed . ” ( BusinessWeek )
What the commentators said
Only the zealous EC would argue that consumers were hurt by Intel ’s “ heinous crime ” of cutting prices , said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
But it may not be alone for long : President Obama ’s antitrust chief just announced “ radical ” changes that will move the U.S. away from its “ consumer - harm test ” model and toward the EU ’s often anti-consumer policy of “ protecting competitor welfare . ”
The Obama team ’s revisions were sorely needed , said The New York Times in an editorial , because President Bush ’s antitrust division “ bent so far backward to shield monopolies . ”
Bush ’s team did n’t go after even one big company for trying to shut out a smaller rival .
And look where we got letting the marketplace police itself .
Comparing the EC to the U.S. Justice Department is like apples and oranges , said Peter Gumbel in Fortune .
The EC’s “ clout ” within Europe is “ actually quite limited , ” as it depends on approval from 27 member nations .
That ’s why it goes after big U.S. firms like Intel and Microsoft : politically , “ it ’s a lot easier to take on big and ugly Americans . ”
Commodities Trading as Risk and Inflation Hedge
With all the recent talk of economic stimulus , it is little surprise that talk of another kind is cropping up as well .
With our economy likely to be flooded with cash in the coming months , many analysts ( Peter Schiff comes to mind ) are talking about the possibility of inflation .
Inflation basically represents an erosion of your buying power as the value of the currency declines .
In order to protect yourself against inflation , there are those who recommend that you invest in commodities .
What are commodities ?
Commodities are tangible goods that can be traded .
Unlike our currency , which has nothing besides promises and a perception of value to back it , commodities represent hard assets .
These are things like precious and industrial metals , lumber , oil and gas , livestock and agricultural crops .
Commodities are traded on an exchange , either for immediate , physical delivery ( spot ) , or for future delivery ( futures ) in which the investor rarely receives physical delivery ( contracts are settled prior to delivery ) .
Most investing in commodities undertaken by individuals takes place on the futures market ; for the most part , only producers and direct users of commodities actually make use of the spot market .
Commodities futures are designed to protect producers .
An example is of how this works with farmers .
A farmer may have a crop of soybeans that s/he plans to harvest .
Before s/he plants it , he can sell it for cash at an agreed - upon price .
The farmer may get a better price for it if s/he waits , but there is also a chance that prices plummet .
By selling the future crop , the farmer is assured that expenses will at least be met ( and maybe some profit received as well ) .
The buyer then puts the contract with the farmer up on the futures market , where it can be “ bought ” and “ sold . ”
If something happens and the price of the crop heads higher , the futures contract holder wins ; the commodity is worth more than s/he paid for it .
If something happens to drive prices lower , though , the contract holder loses out .
Right now , commodities that are expected to gain dramatically as the global economy improves include agriculture , uranium , iron , copper , and oil .
These commodities , in general , gain fast in periods of economic expansion — especially in the early stages .
These are items that are in demand by industrial societies as they gear up for a spike in economic activity .
While gold bugs will tell you that precious metals are the way to go , it is worth noting that gold has only grown in purchasing power at the rate of 2.7 % per year — hardly an inflation - buster .
( But gold is still popular as a safe haven investment in times of economic uncertainty . )
Commodities trading and risk
Any sort of futures trading is risky .
On top of that , commodity prices are volatile , changing as new political currents , economic data and natural events come to light .
Another factor to consider is that with commodity futures , you are using leverage to control large positions .
A commodity futures contract allows you to take a relatively small amount of capital of your own , and leverage it into huge positions in commodities by borrowing from your broker .
The chance for profits is greater , but so is the risk of loss .
If you do not have the risk tolerance ( financial and emotional ) for commodities trading , it is a good idea to stay away .
You can reduce your exposure to the risk of commodities by using exchange traded funds .
There are ETFs that track commodity indexes , as well as ETFs that focus on a basket of commodities .
Commodity mutual funds are also available ( but watch out for load fees and other costs ) .
While risk remains , using these types of investments is often less risky than becoming engaged on the commodity futures market .
Plus , they can add some diversity to your portfolio .
Commodities can make a desirable addition to your investment portfolio if you want to add a little more growth potential and can stomach the risk .
However , it is important to be careful , as the volatility involved in the commodity futures market can lead to losses that are even large than the gains .
It should be noted that commodity trading in the futures market by non users is essentially speculation and carries with it great risks .
Due to leverage , incorrect trades have the potential to wipe out an investor ’s principal and then some .
Extreme caution is warranted .
1 Do not argue with an idiot .
He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience .
2 I want to die peacefully in my sleep , like my grandfather ..
Not screaming and yelling like the passengers in his car .
3 I asked God for a bike , but I know God does n't work that way .
So I stole a bike and asked for forgiveness .
4 Sex is not the answer .
Sex is the question .
" Yes " is the answer .
5 Going to church does n't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car .
6 We live in a society where pizza gets to your house before the police .
7 Women might be able to fake orgasms .
But men can fake a whole relationship .
8 The last thing I want to do is hurt you .
But it 's still on the list .
9 Light travels faster than sound .
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak .
10 If I agreed with you we'd both be wrong .
11 Men have two emotions : Hungry and Horny .
If you see him without an erection , make him a sandwich .
12 We never really grow up , we only learn how to act in public .
13 War does not determine who is right - only who is left .
14 Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit ; Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad .
15 Children :
You spend the first 2 years of their life teaching them to walk and talk .
Then you spend the next 16 years telling them to sit down and shut - up .
16 Politicians and diapers have one thing in common .
They should both be changed regularly , and for the same reason .
17 My mother never saw the irony in calling me a son - of - a- bitch .
18 Having sex is like playing bridge .
If you do n't have a good partner , you 'd better have a good hand .
19 The early bird might get the worm , but the second mouse gets the cheese .
It ’s amazing what a little appreciation , acknowledgment and gratitude can do .
You can go from feeling hum - drum or bummed to feeling completely ecstatic in a few short moments if you only take the time to practice gratitude .
Gratitude is like this magic potion that reminds us of all we have to appreciate in life–and there is a LOT to appreciate .
I have some friends who share gratitude with one another every time they sit down to share a meal together .
Others use gratitude as a way to connect at the beginning of their monthly family meeting .
I even know some parents and kids who say what they ’re grateful for each night before bed .
I ’ve found that when I feel appreciated and acknowledged , I am more willing to contribute , I feel more engaged in my relationships , and I ’m just generally happier .
So , do kids feel any different ?
I do n’t think so .
I think we all respond well to being appreciated and acknowledged .
But it depends on how .
For instance , compliments like , “ You have pretty hair . ” usually do n’t impact me in the same way that true acknowledgment does .
Here ’s the difference : A compliment is really just a positive judgment which might feel good at the time , but then it also leaves room for negative judgments which we can feel afraid of .
An acknowledgment is different .
With an acknowledgment we share the impact on us that a particular action had .
So , instead of “ you have such pretty hair ” , you might say “ Wow , when I see the way the light shines off of your hair I feel so joyful and grateful for all the beauty in my life .
Thanks for being such a shining light in my life ! ”
An even better example would be when you notice your child contributing to your family in some way .
You might share , “ Oh , Ralph , when I see you entertaining your sister I feel so happy because it gives me the time I need to get ready to go and I feel so grateful that you and your sister are enjoying each other . ”
Or “ You know , Cindy , when you tell those funny jokes at the dinner table I really appreciate how you bring lightness and laughter into our family , without your shenanigans , I would n’t laugh nearly as much as I do .
Thanks ! ”
The truth is , every member of your family is contributing in many ways all the time .
I ’m just suggesting that we all take a little extra time to actually acknowledge those contributions .
If you ’re having trouble coming up with something to acknowledge , just take a moment to think about what this person brings to your life that you would n’t have without him or her .
It might be joy , laughter , spontaneity , support , fun , play , or even peace .
You can even do this exercise to recognize your own contributions .
How do you impact the other members of your family ?
And do you feel grateful for the opportunity to contribute in those ways ?
Or are you grumbling all the way to the grocery store ?
If you ’re grumbling , you might need some more acknowledgment .
And guess what –it ’s OK to ask for it !!!
I ’m sure you already know most of this already , but I just wanted to remind us all to take a little extra time this week for gratitude , appreciation , and acknowledgment .
I know it has made a positive impact on my life , and I ’m pretty sure it will on yours as well .
I ’d love to know about your own experiences of acknowledgment and the difference between acknowledgment and compliments .

Since the Supreme Leader Ayatollah declared there was NO CHEATING in Iran 's presidentail election and is prepared to put the HAMMER down on protestors tomorrow , the protestor 's are MARCHING IN THE STREETS TOMORROW .
President Obama says to Ayatollah , " The World is Watching You " .
I absolutely do .
First of all , let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people who are pouring into the streets in Iran are somehow responding to the West or the United States , that 's an old distraction that I think has been trotted out periodically .
And that 's just not going to fly .
What you 're seeing in Iran are hundreds of thousands of people who believe their voices were not heard and who are peacefully protesting and seeking justice .
And the world is watching .
And we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way .
Already we 've seen violence out there .
I 've said this throughout the week , I want to repeat it , that we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard , that that 's a universal value that the American people stand for and this administration stands for .
And I 'm very concerned , based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made , that the government of Iran recognize that the world is watching .
And how they approach and deal with people who are -- through peaceful means -- trying to be heard will I think send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what Iran is and is not .
But the last point I want to make on this -- this is not an issue of the United States or the West versus Iran ; this is an issue of the Iranian people .
The fact that they are on the streets , under pretty severe duress , at great risk to themselves , is a sign that there 's something in that society that wants to open up .
And , you know , we respect Iran 's sovereignty and we respect the fact that ultimately the Iranian people have to make these decisions .
But I hope that the world understands that this is not something that has to do with the outside world ; this has to do with what 's happening in Iran .
And I think ultimately the Iranian people will obtain justice .
read more here ....
And now some pictures from Al Rodgers , ••And finally as I think about the protestors in Iran , I can only think of the fear they must feel but the importance of what they must continue to do .
Dear Lord : Shield the Iranian Protestors from harm 's way as they march their way , continuing on to getting their voices heard .
Do n't let the Ayatollah kill them in cold blood .
Freedom and democracy is a right for every living being .
Protect them as they continue to march their way to freedom .
Iran we are truly praying for you .~icebergslim~
The map uses 1.3 million images and covers Earth ’s land surface between 83 degrees North and 83 degrees South latitudes
An astonishing new map has revealed the elevation of nearly every place on Earth .
The Global Digital Elevation Model was created using nearly 1.3 million images collected by a Japanese camera on board Nasa ’s Terra spacecraft .
It is made up of a giant grid of 23,000 tiles , with each height point spaced 98ft apart .
( Pics )
It shows a detailed representation of the planet ’s land mass .
In this colourised version , low elevations are purple , medium elevations are greens and yellows , and high elevations are orange , red and white .
England , Ireland and Denmark ( l ) and Florida in the U.S ( r ) have similar low - lying areas that show up purple on the Aster map
It reveals that England and most of Ireland are low - lying and share a similar elevation to Denmark , Poland and northern Russia in Europe , Mauritiana and Somalia in Africa , Brazil and Argentina in south America , Florida in the U.S and parts of Australia .
‘ This is the most complete , consistent global digital elevation data yet made available to the world , ’ said Nasa scientist Woody Turner .
‘ This unique global set of data will serve users and researchers from a wide array of disciplines that need elevation and terrain information . ’
The Los Angeles Basin is bordered on the north by the San Gabriel Mountains .
In this image simulated natural colour image data was draped over digital topography from Aster
Data from The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( Aster ) has been combined with other Nasa images to create stunning terrain pictures of Death Valley and the Los Angeles Basin among others .
Aster was launched in 1999 along with four other instruments on the Earth Observing System .
It takes about 600 high - resolution images a day , each one covering an area of 60 x 60 km .
It also provides scientists with information on land surface temperatures .
Death Valley is the hottest and driest place in North America .
This view looking towards the northwest was created by draping a simulated natural colour image over digital topography from the Aster
Researchers said it could be used for engineering , energy exploration , conserving natural resources , environmental management , firefighting , geology and city planning , to name just a few .
It is a large improvement on the previous best topographic map , where 80 per cent of the planet ’s landmass was surveyed during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission .
‘ The Aster data filled in many of the voids in the shuttle mission ’s data , such as in very steep terrains and in some deserts , ’ said Michael Kobrick , from the Shuttle Radar project .
Nasa has 15 satellites that monitor the globe providing high - resolution data on how the globe in changing .
Recently the Orbiting Carbon Observatory was destroyed during launch , which was a huge loss to the space agency ’s Earth Science programme .

Those who anxiously downloaded the Windows 7 beta will be able to enjoy their sneak - peek at the operating system for a month longer than expected .
Despite an email to testers threatening to cut off the beta on June 1st , Microsoft last night announced it will remain untouched until July 1st .
From Beta to Release Candidate
In a post on the Windows 7 blog Tuesday , Microsoft spokesperson Brandon LeBlanc explained that the email sent to beta testers threatening service shutdowns after June 1st was a mistake .
Although no explanation for the slip - up was provided , LeBlanc assured everyone that the beta will continue for a month longer than that .
However , he did encourage users to move from the beta to the release candidate ( RC ) version of Windows 7 , since the former 's life is set to expire by August .
Windows 7 : No Promises on Stability
For its part , Microsoft is n't guaranteeing a perfectly stable experience with either the beta or its more recent release candidate .
As the final release of Windows 7 nears ( Microsoft has promised copies on store shelves by Christmas ) , it 's in the company 's best interest to sell the marketable copy , not the free ones .
In fact , Microsoft is currently informing business users operating production machines to avoid downloading any of the prerelease software , which is n't guaranteed to work perfectly all of the time .
" You 're Volunteering to be a Guinea Pig . "
Michael Cherry , Microsoft 's research VP for operating systems at Directions on Microsoft , says his company is n't about to tell people that the beta is , or ever has been , completely safe .
" I do n't have a lot of sympathy for someone who says they have a transition problem , " Cherry remarked .
" You 're volunteering to be a guinea pig . " ( Source : technewsworld.com )
In other words , only try Windows 7 out on that backup computer you 've stashed in the basement .
And yes , that 's unlikely given the demands of newer operating systems .
Windows Vista Service Pack 2 Released
If you 're not yet ready to make the leap to Windows 7 , either in RC or final form , then perhaps you 'll be encouraged to hear that Microsoft has released a second service pack for Vista ( Service Pack 2 ) , promising improvements to WiFi support , better RSS functionality , and increased power management efficiency .

LOL .... my cat Jub sounds like this .
But , no , trust me , he 's NOT retarded .
I do n't think it 's even possible for cats to be retarded .
My cat does ALL these things and more .
I can't even begin to list the kinda things he does lol .
But , do n't worry about your cat being retarded , the vet is right .
If he 's physically healthy , you have NOTHING to worry about .
If he 's an indoor cat only , he might be meowing cause he 's in heat .
Or , he wants to go outside to play with the other cats he sees ( If he sits and watches the outside world from a window )
Him playin in the litterbox is just that .... playing ... maybe a sense of wonder .
Same with the shower and the toilet .... they 've gotta learn for themselves on what the boundaries are .
Some cats even like water until they 're forced into it ... then , they 'll hate it .
My cat walks on my head while i'm sleeping ... he'll meow and jump up and down while i'm sleeping .
It does n't help having 3 other cats in play mode while i'm sleeping , especially since they 're all about 3 - 4 years younger than Jub .

Advertisement Troops in Honduras have ousted the president and flown him out of the country after a power struggle over plans to change the constitution .
After arriving in Costa Rica , deposed President Manuel Zelaya said he had been kidnapped by soldiers in a " coup " .
Mr Zelaya , elected for a non-renewable four - year term in 2006 , had wanted a vote to extend his time in office .
His arrest came just before the start of a referendum ruled illegal by the Supreme Court and opposed by Congress .
There had also been resistance within Mr Zelaya 's own party to the plan for the vote .
' Arrested in pyjamas '
Congress swiftly appointed its speaker Roberto Micheletti - a member of Mr Zelaya 's Liberal Party , but an opponent of him - as acting head of state .
The day 's drama began at dawn on Sunday when soldiers stormed the president 's residence in the capital , Tegucigalpa , an hour before polls were to open .
This was a plot by a very voracious elite , which wants to keep this country in an extreme level of poverty
President Manuel Zelaya
In pictures : President ousted Profile : Manuel Zelaya World reaction : Honduran crisis Mr Zelaya was taken to an airbase outside the city and rumours swirled over his whereabouts .
The BBC's Stephen Gibbs , in the region , says armoured vehicles were on the streets and troops fired tear gas to disperse the president 's supporters outside his home .
Several hours later Mr Zelaya turned up in Costa Rica and said troops had " kidnapped " him in his pyjamas .
He insisted he was still the rightful president and urged Hondurans to resist those who had removed him .
" This was a plot by a very voracious elite , an elite which wants only to keep this country isolated , in an extreme level of poverty , " he said .
Later the Honduran Supreme Court said it had ordered the removal of the president , who had been due to leave office next January .
Then Congress produced what it said was Mr Zelaya 's letter of resignation , which it voted to accept .
The ousted president dismissed the letter as a fake .
Chavez military warning
There was international condemnation of events in Honduras : MANUEL ZELAYA
Took office in Jan 2006 ; beat ruling National Party candidate Has moved Honduras away from its traditional ally the US Enjoys the support of Venezuela 's leftist President , Hugo Chavez A civil engineer and rancher by profession •
At an emergency meeting in Washington , the Organization of American States said it was a " coup " • Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , blamed " the Yankee empire " , and threatened military action should the Venezuelan ambassador to Honduras be attacked ; President Evo Morales of Bolivia described Mr Zelaya 's removal as " an assault on democracy " • The White House denied any involvement ; President Barack Obama urged Honduras to " respect the rule of law " and a State Department official said America recognised Mr Zelaya as the duly elected president •
The European Union called for " a swift return to constitutional normality " in Honduras
The military 's dramatic move came after President Zelaya sacked the chief of the army , Gen Romeo Vasquez , on Wednesday for refusing to help him organise the referendum .
A day later , the Honduran Congress approved plans to investigate whether the president should be declared unfit to rule .
In an interview with Spain 's El Pais newspaper published on Sunday , Mr Zelaya said a plot to topple him had been thwarted after the US refused to back it .
The Central American country - an impoverished coffee and banana - exporting nation of more than 7 million people - has experienced military coups in the past .
Soldiers overthrew elected presidents in 1963 and again in 1975 ; the military did not turn the government over to civilians until 1981 .

The Case for a Creator , Chapter 3
Jonathan Wells ’ second “ icon ” is Darwin ’s tree of life , which he says is a “ dismal failure ” [ p.43 ] as an illustration of the fossil record .
With a lead - in like that , you ’d expect a typical creationist jeremiad against transitional fossils .
In fact , that ’s not what we get .
The focus of Wells ’ complaint is about the Cambrian explosion , 550 million years ago .
No transitional series more recent is treated here : not the origin of tetrapods , not the therapsids which illustrate the evolution of reptiles into mammals , not the beautiful and compelling whale transitional series , and certainly not the emergence of the human species .
Wells never even mentions these compelling , and indisputably relevant , examples of evolutionary transition preserved in the fossil record .
Instead , the source of his ire dates all the way back to the origins of modern phyla :
“ Darwin knew the fossil record failed to support his tree .
He acknowledged that major groups of animals – he calls them divisions , now they ’re called phyla – appear suddenly in the fossil record .
That ’s not what his theory predicts . ” [ p.43 ]
This is a lie .
For the record , Darwin was well aware of the imperfection of the fossil record , and devoted an entire chapter of his book to explaining why we should not expect to see clear transitions preserved .
If anything , he was too pessimistic , and our paleontological surveys have surpassed his expectations .
“ Then at the beginning of the Cambrian – boom !
– all of a sudden , we see representatives of the arthropods , modern representatives of which are insects , crabs , and the like ; echinoderms , which include modern starfish and sea urchins ; chordates , which include modern vertebrates ; and so forth .
Mammals came later , but the chordates – the major group to which they belong – were right there at the beginning of the Cambrian .
This is absolutely contrary to Darwin ’s Tree of Life .
These animals , which are so fundamentally different in their body plans , appear fully developed , all of a sudden … ” [ p .44 ]
Wells ’ argument is that the various phyla are so different in their body plans , they could not possibly have all diverged from a common ancestor in such a brief period of time .
The best answer to this is a clever analogy originally proposed by Richard Dawkins to clear up just this sort of confusion :
Suppose you have a great oak tree with huge limbs at the base and smaller and smaller branches toward the outer layers where finally there are just lots and lots of little twigs .
Obviously the little tiny twigs appeared most recently .
The larger boughs appeared a long time ago and when they did appear , they were little twigs .
What would you think if a gardener said , “ Is n’t it funny that no major boughs have appeared on this tree in recent years , only small twigs ? ”
Strobel and Wells would like their readers to believe that the various phyla were already radically different from each other at the time of the Cambrian explosion .
This is not the case .
The phyla are like the twigs on Dawkins ’ tree .
Originally , far back in the Cambrian , they were very similar to each other .
But over great spans of geological time , they have diverged farther and farther , and what were originally slight differences became accentuated by evolution to fit the varying lifestyles to which they adapted .
Today , the living representatives of these groups have major differences from each other , and looking all the way back , we can see how those differences developed from what were originally slight distinctions .
In that sense , it ’s fair to say that the “ fundamental body plans ” first appeared in the Cambrian .
But that ’s not the same thing as saying that the earliest members of these groups were radically different when they lived side by side .
When Wells speaks of “ major groups ” , he subtly misleads the reader .
Based on his examples , a lay reader might erroneously conclude that starfish , crabs , reptiles , insects , and the like all just suddenly appeared during the Cambrian .
In fact , as already stated , most species of the Cambrian explosion were relatively similar , and none of them looked much at all like the modern groups that are thought to have descended from them .
Here are several Cambrian animals that Wells claims represent “ major groups ” that are “ fundamentally different in their body plans ” .
Can you tell which one is the ancestor of what modern group ?
( All images from the Smithsonian ’s Burgess Shale Fossil Specimens page . )
If you ’ve given up , the first of these animals is called Aysheaia , and is thought to be an ancestor of the velvet worms ( phylum Onychophora ) , segmented worm - like animals with rows of clawed feet .
The second is Canadia , believed to be an ancestor of annelids ( phylum Annelida ) , whose modern representatives include earthworms and leeches .
And the last is Pikaia , believed , with some dissenters , to be an ancestor of the phylum Chordata – us .
All modern animals with dorsal nerve cords – fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds , mammals – all of them were represented in the Cambrian by this tiny , one - inch - long free - swimming creature .
These supposedly vast phylum - level differences , in the beginning , were trifling things .
It ’s only time and evolution that have turned these small twigs into great branches spreading far and wide .

We 've updated the story with comments off the record from BBC insiders here .
These are heady days for fans of the Texas Rangers , who now find themselves in the unusual position of supporting winners .
Not since the turn of the century have the Arlington - based team reached baseball 's play - offs , not since 2004 have they really been in contention to win the American League West .
There may be many reasons for this sustained run of mediocrity , but prime among them surely has been the club 's apparently insatiable appetite for financial dramas .
When things are going well on the field , the Rangers can usually be relied upon to stumble into some kind of off - the - field tribulations guaranteed to sidetrack players , officials and supporters .
So it has been in recent days with the announcement that Tom Hicks is willing to cede control of a team he bought in 1998 from , among others , George W Bush .
" With the right partners , I would be willing to sell a controlling interest in the Rangers .
My family and I want very much to stay involved with the club , but we understand that we may have to be open to solutions that may include partners who own a controlling interest in the Rangers , '' Liverpool 's co-owner said in a statement at the end of last week , before adding a pay - off so lacking in self - awareness that it was almost comical : " I do n't want any of this to be a distraction to the team and our fans . "
If any of this sounds familiar to Liverpool fans , who have watched their beloved club slide into almost constant tumult , at least off the field , since Hicks and his business partner George Gillett arrived on Merseyside back in 2007 , then it was the same old story , too , in the States , where Hicks has earned a reputation for what the New York Times called wrong - headedness .
" How can it not be a distraction ? " the paper asked this week of his announcement about his plans to sell the Rangers .
" This is a team for which being in first place a third into the season is a new experience , and its players have to deal with reports and questions about the team being for sale . "
Hicks , an old school Republican , can live with the criticism of a liberal newspaper like the New York Times .
Harder to bear is the personal embarrassment that comes with the acknowledgment of defeat in his battle to remain in control of the Rangers .
Only three months ago , he had insisted that while he wanted to sell at least some of his 95 % holding in the Rangers he was interested only in having minority partners .
Much has happened since then , not least the Hicks ' decision to default on over $ 500 m in loans tied to his ownership of the Rangers and the Dallas Stars ice hockey team .
At the time the Rangers owner was bullish , calling the move a " non-event " designed to bring his creditors to the negotiating table .
Clearly , it was more complicated than that , to put it one way .
To put it another : he was unwilling to accept the truth ; that he did not have the financial wherewithal to meet demands from Major League Baseball to reduce the size of the club 's debt .
The only option he was left with was to sell the club .
This is embarrassing indeed for a man such as Hicks , who relished the caché that came with owning a major league baseball team and never missed an opportunity to throw his money around , lest anyone in Texas and elsewhere was unaware of exactly how rich he was .
Not for him the low - key approach adopted by others , the likes of Randy Lerner ( owner of the NFL's Cleveland Browns ) , Stan Kroenke ( owner of the Denver Nuggets of the NBA ) and Malcolm Glazer , who controls the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFL .
Gillett was another who preferred to remain in the background , stewarding one of ice hockey 's most storied clubs , the Montreal Canadiens , in a fashion entirely at variance with the man who was to become his business partner in English football .
While Lerner , Kroenke and Glazer , who have all bought their way into English football in recent years , at Aston Villa , Arsenal and Manchester United , respectively , could give Greta Garbo lessons in maintaining studied mystery , Hicks has seldom come across a microphone he did not want to pontificate into or a stage he did not want to hog .
His outgoing personality ( or out - sized ego , depending on who you ask ) was an asset in the world of leveraged buy - outs , where his chutzpah helped him build a personal fortune using other peoples ' money to buy and sell companies .
But it ill - served him in the world of sport , where he allowed his ego to cloud his better judgment , both in what he said and in what he did .
Famously , or rather infamously , he allowed himself to be talked into the biggest single contract for an athlete in history – a 10 - year , $ 250 m deal for the short - stop Alex Rodriguez .
At the time , this was seen as a bold declaration of intent by the Rangers owner .
Looking back , now that Rodriguez has long departed for the New York Yankees and details of the deals have been made public ( the next highest bid for Rodriguez 's service at the time was a reported $ 170 m ) , it would be fair to say it was a supreme act of folly , perhaps the greatest ever in American professional sport ( which really is saying something ) .
Yet Hicks ploughed on : on to the next bad baseball deal , on to the next losing season and finally on to Liverpool , where he and Gillett have guided the Merseyside club towards the financial precipice .
The news that Liverpool are hampered by debts of £ 300 m - plus – that their owners , who promised to be " different " from the Glazers , who borrowed other peoples ' money to buy Manchester United , were in fact exactly the same – has shocked English football .
But perhaps more shocking is that few people had apparently noticed before now .
Hicks himself had admitted , in an interview shortly after he and Gillett bought the club , that any profits earned would be used to service their debt .
" When I was in the leveraged buy - out business we bought Weetabix and we leveraged it up to make our return .
You could say that anyone who was eating Weetabix was paying for our purchase of Weetabix .
It was just business .
" It is the same for Liverpool .
Revenues come in from whatever source and go out to whatever source and , if there is money left over , it is profit , " he said at the time , with commendable honesty .
Like Weetabix , Liverpool FC is an enduring brand name .
It was there before Tom Hicks arrived and it will be there when he is gone , as inevitably will happen one day , probably sooner than later .
Whatever happens before , expect the Texan to issue a statement expressing his hope that none of the tumult at Anfield is a distraction for the club and fans .
Expect him to be sadly disappointed .

The American Family Association wanted to celebrate gay pride with an hour - long infomercial that painted gay people as disgusting family destroyers .
Some folks had a problem with this .
Donald Wildmon ’s AFA , which proudly traffics in hate and lies , was so jazzed about St. Petersburg Pride ( reportedly Florida ’s largest gay pride celebration ) that it wanted to treat viewers of NBC affiliate WFLA - 8 to a full hour of misinformation .
Speechless : Silencing the Christians is an in - depth look at the radical homosexual activist agenda , and how they are ruining Christian families !
Naturally , those annoying homosexual activist groups did n’t like the sound of this , and started complaining .
Luckily , you ca n’t hold down the AFA !
Through the power of the Internet , you can watch the whole program here .
And yes , this looks to be a repackaging of the Family Research Council ’s own Hate Crime Laws : Censoring the Church and Silencing Christians .

DOSE :
7.0 g oral Mushrooms ( dried ) smoked Cannabis
I actually wrote this about 4 years ago , and was reading through it randomly tonight and decided to post it .----- I ate the quarter of disgusting mushrooms over a 5 - minute time span , starting at exactly 7:00 PM .
I was at my friend Adams house , hanging out in his basement with a bunch of other friends .
Two people had taken rolls , and everyone else was smoking weed .
I was really excited about the intense trip that I would experience .
About 8 minutes after consumption , I noticed that the mushrooms were already beginning to kick in .
Everything around began to look different .
The room became started to seem more noticeable and more real .
The colors in the room were gradually becoming brighter .
What I was experiencing was nothing very intense , but I was feeling some nervousness .
It had n't even been 10 minutes and I was already feeling the mushrooms .
In my entire shrooming career , mushrooms had NEVER kicked in that fast .
It occurred to me that I probably shouldnt have eaten so many shrooms on an empty stomach .
I decided not to tell anybody that the shrooms were already kicking in .
I figured everyone would think that I was just exaggerating anyway .
To relieve the tension I sat down in the chair , but I continued to feel very uncomfortable .
I just could n't relax .
This feeling of tension in my body was building up .
One of my friends was smoking a joint , and I figured that some pot would relax me and soothe the physical unease that I was experiencing .
' Hey man can I have a hit ? '
I asked He gave me the last of the joint and I managed to get a couple of hits off of it .
I then went to sit back down but somebody had taken my seat .
I wasnt feeling too bad , but I just wanted to sit down and relax .
Things were pretty good for the most part , and I was in a good mood .
I looked up at the lights and realized how bright they were .
I could tell that my pupils were already dilated .
I gazed down at the grey concrete floor and observed the dark shadows cast upon it .
Then to my amazement I noticed that the shadows were swirling together and forming strange patterns .
It started to look like the dark shades of shadow on the ground were forming images on the floor .
Two - dimensional cartoon cars and houses appeared to form on the ground , as well as other various shapes and images .
But oddly , I was having trouble telling if the shadows were really forming those strange shapes and patterns or if the mushrooms were kicking in harder than I thought . '
Hey , ' I said to somebody .
' Do you see those patterns ? '
I pointed to the images that were clearly visible on the hard concrete floor , but he just looked at me strangely and did n't answer .
I was starting to realize that these vivid pictures decorating the floor werent even there .
I was amazed at how real and detailed they looked though , but also slightly nervous by the fact that I couldnt distinguish them from reality .
As I continued to observe them they morphed and changed shape .
I was tripping already .
It hadnt even been half an hour since I had eaten the mushrooms and I was tripping pretty decently .
I knew that I was in for a very intense night , but I was still completely unaware of the experience that I was about to embark upon .
The seeds of nervousness that were already planted in my mind began to grow when my friend turned to me and said ' You know this is n't going to be a good experience .
These kids we are with are all lightweights .
' I nodded , but tried to forget what he said .
He didnt mean I was going to have a bad trip .
He just meant I would feel separated because only two people that we were with had ever tripped before .
So I tried to ignore the comment , and push it out of my mind .
However nervousness about everything was growing deep inside me .
I began to convince myself that I was going to have a bad time .
I had a tense feeling in my chest that was steadily building up .
I knew not to think this way during a mushroom trip , so I forced my mind onto other thoughts .
I looked back at the lights on the ceiling and they were even brighter now .
They were glowing bright white .
' Are my pupils big ? '
I asked out loud .
My friend looked up at me and said ' Yea they look really big to me and Im all the way across the room .
'I relaxed and began to forget about my physical and mental unease .
Everybody sat in a circle , getting ready to smoke some weed , so I took a seat on the couch .
Weed was just what I needed .
I wanted to relax a little , and I was sure the weed would calm my stomach .
Plus smoking weed is awesome on shrooms .
Somebody pulled out a bong and started passing it around .
When it came to me I took a massive hit .
I just kept inhaling more and more smoke because I could n't feel any smoke in my lungs .
I held the hit in for a while and then finally exhaled a huge cloud of smoke .
After that , I sat back , and waited for the weed to relax me some more .
I looked over at one of my friends , and he started to climb a pole in Adam 's basement .
He had taken a hit of ecstasy earlier , and it was starting to kick in .
I turned away and leaned back on the couch .
My body was beginning to feel heavy .
The shrooms were really grabbing a hold of my brain .
When I looked back I saw that two of my friends ( both were rolling ) were hanging from a pole on the ceiling .
What the fuck ?
This was too weird for my altered state to make sense of , so I just ignored it .
I started talking to somebody else to distract myself from the crazy kids on ecstasy hanging from the ceiling .
He was saying something about me having a crazy grin on my face .
As I listened to my friend talk , he started to sound further and further away .
I could barely hear him at all .
It was like trying to listen to him from underwater .
His voice sounded muffled and distorted .
Everything around me looked and sounded so distant .
Then I heard two people talking to each other , although I did n't know who was saying what .
Their voices sounded very distant .
'This is so weird , normally we are the people who are always fucked up '' Yeah but this time everybody else is fucked up and we are sober ' Fucked up ?
Was I fucked up ?
No , I was normal .
I started to forget where I was , believing that I was at my friend Dans house .
I could see his room , his bed , his carpet .
I quickly snapped out of it though and realized where I actually was .
Then my mind returned to its previous thoughts .
Fucked up ?
I couldnt be fucked up .
I didnt understand the concept of hallucinogens , or even drugs in general .
How could they alter consciousness ?
Why would I want to alter my consciousness ?
What the hell was consciousness anyway ?
What was going on ?
I was feeling very uncomfortable now .
My stomach was very tense , and my body felt weird and unfamiliar .
My sense of gravity was severely altered .
It felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper into the couch .
I sat up straight because I did n't like that feeling .
But sitting up did n't feel right either .
I needed to stay as relaxed as possible , and when I sat up my body felt like it was being pulled from different directions .
So I laid back against the couch and once again felt like something was pushing me into it .
The feeling was very similar to the pulling sensation I experienced on salvia .
I looked at my hands and legs and they did n't seem like they were mine .
Just like when I was on salvia .
Salvia .
Am I on salvia ???
I wasnt sure .
Everything started to seem exactly like salvia , and I had a feeling mushrooms and salvia were related somehow .
This was making me very nervous , because I did n't want to be this fucked up .
The Salvia universe was the last place that I wanted to go .
Suddenly I just wanted it all to end .
I wanted to know how much longer I would be tripping for , how much more of this uncomfortable madness I would have to endure .
' What time is it ? '
I asked my friend . ' Its 7:30 ' he said .
' Okay , ' I said .
But the numbers had no real meaning to me .
It had been half an hour since I had eaten the shrooms and I was already tripping much harder than I ever had before .
I sat back and felt the pulling sensation return , but it was even stronger now .
The couch was trying to pull me into it !!!
I quickly sat back up again but gravity felt so weird .
I could n't get comfortable .
It was getting very scary .
My sense of time was completely destroyed by now .
After enduring what seemed to be a couple hours of this sinking feeling , I asked my friend what time it was again .'
It 's midnight ' he said jokingly .
Even though it felt like hours had passed I guess only a minute had .
However , I believed him when he told me that it was midnight .
'IT 'S MIDNIGHT ???
I exclaimed .
 I gotta go home !!!
Will somebody drive me home ?
'' Ha ha its not actually midnight ' he said laughingly .
 Im just joking .
It s only been like a minute since you asked me .' Oh , ' I said .
I tried to forget it but I couldnt get the thought of it being midnight out of the back of my mind .
I sat on the couch , enduring my mushroom trip .
I waited a few hours , struggling to keep my sanity .
' What time is it ? '
I asked him again a long time later .
'
It 's midnight now ,  he said again .
Oh no !
It really was midnight this time !
I knew because I could tell a long time had passed since I last asked him .
I was still tripping too !
I didnt want to get home too late or my parents might get really mad .
' I have to go home !!!'
I told him 'Relax , I m just joking '
He said and once again laughed .
 You keep asking that every 30 seconds .
My sense of time was so distorted that I seriously thought four hours had passed in those 30 seconds .
Time was becoming extremely dilated .
Every second was being stretched out so that each moment felt like an hour .
' Messing with his mind like that is the worst thing you can to do somebody who is tripping ' I heard somebody say .
Tripping ?
Was I tripping ??
What the hell ?
I was n't tripping .
I was getting really freaked out now .
Slowly my friends were beginning to look more and more unfamiliar to me .
I did n't know what was going on .
I heard Adam shouting loudly .
That made me even more uncomfortable .
I suddenly realized that this was a bad place to eat shrooms .
I didnt like being here normally , let alone shrooming .
I did n't know or care what time it was anymore , all I knew is that I wanted to go home .
I hadnt been careful enough about setting .
I was having such a bad time because I was at a place I didnt like .
But how would I get home ?
It was too far to walk , and I hadnt driven there .
Somebody would be nice enough to drive me home .
These people were all my friends .
They would understand that I didnt want to be here , and they would be more than willing to drive me .
' Will somebody drive me home ??? '
I asked .
Everybody seemed confused that I wanted to leave since it was n't even 8 PM on a Friday evening .
And nobody wanted to leave to drive me home .
I remember somebody saying ' Why do you want to go home ?
Do n't you want to stay with your friends ? '
His voice sounded distorted and unfamiliar .
Friends ?
I was confused .
By this point I didnt even recognize anybody anymore .
' Uh no I just want to go home .
Why wo n't anybody drive me home ? '' Nobody has a car to drive you home right now . '
He said .
This was totally ridiculous since everybody had their cars there , but at the time I believed him .
' Oh I understand , ' I said .
It seemed to make perfect sense to me at the time .
So I began walking around .
The room was looking unbelievably bizarre now .
Every color was more intense than any color I had ever seen .
It was almost like everything was glowing .
I walked over and stared at the unplugged pinball machine in the corner , trying to keep myself entertained .
I could feel the spiritual energy coming .
I knew something BIG was on its way .
But soon the idea of wanting to go home crept back into my head .
I asked for people to drive me home again , but nobody would .
Everybody was looking at me like I was completely insane , and I couldnt understand why .
I felt really scared .
Was I insane ?
I never thought that I was insane .
But what if I was ?
What if I had been for a long time and had never realized it .
Everybody who met me would be nice to me , but they were really just being nice to the retarded kid .
I had become one of the prime examples of how drugs could completely destroy somebodys mind .
And I had never even realized it .
I could see myself walking through the halls at school , talking to people , feeling completely normal .
But then everybody would look at me sadly as I was walking away and think  It s so sad what drugs can do to somebody . 
Was I one of those kids who were mentally challenged and I just did n't realize it ?
Were drugs the reason why ?
Everybody was treating me strangely , looking at me strangely .
Something was wrong but I couldnt figure out what .
They were all staring at me with concerned looks on their faces .
They all looked so unfamiliar .
I felt like a little kid on a hospital table , being stared at by a bunch of strange adult doctors while a bright spotlight blinded me .
Their faces looked warped and distorted .
' Are you starting to feel scared ? ' somebody asked me .
Im just really confused . I said .
My voice sounded so unfamiliar .
I wasnt really feeling terror or panic .
But the distortion , the confusion , it was overwhelming .
Are you thinking that you want it to stop ?' Yeah maybe I dunno what 's going on , I just want to go home . '
I said , filled with paranoia .
Everybody was staring at me .
There was something wrong with me .
But what ?' That 's what had happened to me too ' he said to somebody else .
Then he turned to me and said ' Nobody can drive you home right now .
Here , just lay down on the couch for a while .
'I laid down on the couch and tried to go to sleep .
By this point , all I wanted was for this to end .
I tried to sleep it off , but when I closed my eyes all I could see were colors and colors and colors .
There were hundreds of intense bright colors , moving around and changing and flowing .
This was insane .
I was so shaky , I looked at my hands and they were drenched in sweat .
It felt like I was tripping on acid .
Only it was crazier .' Do n't go to sleep , ' Somebody said to me .
' You 're going to waste the trip .
'' Haha , he 's not going to fall asleep ' Someone else replied .
They sounded millions of miles away .
I laid there on the couch with my eyes closed , confused , staring at the bright colors which danced behind my eyes .
I couldnt sleep it off .
I sat up .
I didnt feel good .
I felt sick .
Very very sick .
' Here , take you shoes , off , get comfortable ' A kid who was rolling said to me .
I must have mentioned that I was feeling sick .
' If you have to throw up , try to do it in this bucket .
If you do n't make it in the bucket though that s okay , we will clean it up . '
I did n't want to throw up .
I do n't know why but I was suddenly determined not to vomit .
The nausea in my stomach was steadily increasing but I fought it .' I 'm so cold ! '
I said .
My body was freezing ; I had never felt so cold in my life .
I felt icy , but the feeling wasnt just covering my body .
The cold was deep inside me as well .
It was so uncomfortable that I was shaking .
He gave me his green plaid shirt to wear , but I was too confused to put the shirt on .
' Here , put one arm in one sleeve , and the other arm in the other . '
He told me .
I tried but I could n't manage to do it .
It was like seeing a shirt for the first time .
I couldnt filter my vision to figure out what I was seeing .
There was just a mass of random colors and shapes .
 No dont just put it around you , put your arms in the sleeves .
He said .
I still wasnt doing it right and so eventually he just put the shirt on me .
Then he got somebody elses sweatshirts and put that on me as well .
I returned to the couch , laying on my stomach and trying to sleep my trip off .
I should have known by now that there was no way to sleep off a trip , but it was the only thing I wanted to do .
I looked down at the shirt I was wearing but realized that I had never seen it before .
I had already forgotten that I was wearing somebody elses shirt .
This added to my sense of total confusion .
As I continued to lie on the couch , gravity suddenly stopped existing .
The couch was sideways .
Then it was spinning .
Then it was upside down so that it was on top of me , crushing me .
My face was being smothered in the pillows .
I could n't breath .
I was drowning in it .
The couch was a red liquid ocean and I was drowning in it .
I wanted to get up , to tell somebody that I was dying but I could n't move .
I felt like I was suffocating in the couch .
Nobody seemed to notice that I was dying either .
Something was going very wrong in my body .
Why wasnt anyone paying attention to me ?
Suddenly I realized the severity of what was happening .
I had always known that I was going to die , that my life on this earth would have to come to an end eventually .
But now it was ACTUALLY happening .
I felt filled with fear at what was going to happen .
It was all ending .
Soon my body , the body that had been mine for so many years , would just be lifeless laying in this basement .
My life , my memories , my self , would all be gone .
I thought about my parents .
They would be so upset about it .
But by this point it was too late , there was nothing I could do .
I couldnt hold on any longer .
And I felt myself die .
It was scary .
My heart wasnt beating in my body anymore , I wasnt breathing , everything was going wrong in my brain .
And then it was over .
The frantic panic dissolved into serene calm .
Suddenly it was n't scary anymore .
I became one with the trees , the grass , the world .
I felt my soul stretch towards infinity .
Feeling myself becoming part of the millions of galaxies existing throughout the universe .
I was seeing visions of the stars and heavens glowing brilliantly .
Swirls of universes , the amazing heavens , it was more amazing than any picture of outer space that you could ever see .
And I was part of it all again .
It had always been like this .
This was all so familiar .
Something that you forget when you are alive , but once its over you become a part of everything again and remember .
And it was amazing .
Forever later , a friend was talking to me .
Somehow I was processing earth again .
I was processing life again .
But the mushroom trip was only getting stronger .
I was completely unaware of what was going on .
He was saying something like ,  Relax , just remember that itll be over in a few hours .
It would be over ???
I momentarily started to realize that I was shrooming .
I was still very confused , but hearing that made me feel a lot less frightened .
It would all be over eventually .
I remembered that it was Friday , and I hoped that I would stop tripping before school started on Monday , but I was pretty sure I wouldnt .
Time was completely distorted and I started going through what seemed to be hours in a matter of seconds .
I was fast forwarding through Friday , and then Saturday , and then Sunday .
The time for me to have to go to school was coming closer and closer and I was still tripping .
In reality only a couple seconds had passed but I didnt realize this .
As far as I was concerned , I was living hours and hours in moments .
It was Monday morning .
I started walking around .
I remember somebody put a bunch of pillows on the floor and said ' Hey , do you want to jump on these pillows ? '
I was confused , why would I want to do that ?
No  I said .
He kept giving me suggestions on things to do and I kept doing them .
Soon he said  These are all just suggestions you know .
You can do whatever you want .
This was amazing .
I suddenly felt free .
Like I had been trapped in a negative state of thought , and now I was free .
I didnt have to do anything I didnt want to .
I didnt have to follow him , or anybody else .
I was embarking on an amazing journey , and I could choose where I wanted it to go .
I had complete freedom to do anything I wanted .
To go anywhere I wanted .
To live anyway that I wanted .
Life felt incredible .
I started walking , not sure where I was going but knowing that it would be beyond amazing .
I was on an adventure .
I walked out the door and stood in Adams backyard , looking around .
I wanted to keep walking outside but it was so cold and rainy , so I decided to go back inside .
I kept walking around on the journey of my soul , traveling miles in the small basement .
I realized that I was completely amazed at the power of the mushroom .
I was tapping into vast amounts of universal information .
I saw a library of information stretching out in front of me .
Endless shelves , filled with row after row of books on every subject matter , stretching out in every direction towards infinity .
This feeling was beyond amazing .
I was in contact with the mushroom spirit now and it was guiding me along .
This mushroom spirit was ancient , yet so familiar .
It had been around for so long , it had seen the earth when it was a totally different place .
This ancient spirit had been around for thousands of years , and would be around for thousands more to see the future worlds .
I was walking by somebody , barely aware of any concept of reality , and he said  Hey look at these rugs , what trippy things are you seeing in it ?
I realized I was walking by two rectangular rugs with intricate designs weaved into them .
I looked at one and it shifted from two dimensional to three - dimensional .
It kept gaining a sense of depth and slowly became a portal to another world .
I gave some nonsensical answer to my friend about what I was seeing and he didnt understand it .
Then I walked right through the portal !
I remembered watching Gumby as a little kid .
There was an episode when they walked through some Chinese painting and ended up in China .
I saw all of this happening in my mind and realized that was exactly what was happening to me .
I was going through this rug and into the same world that Gumby had went into .
I was seeing strange claymation figures of Gumby characters and wandering through a fantasy claymation world At some point a friend was talking to me .
I didnt really hear most of what he was saying , but I remember him saying ,  Yeah , youve tripped plenty of times before .
TRIPPED .
The word got stuck in my head .
It was something magical to explain the magic that was being cast upon me .
Everything was magical .
I was in a magical new world now .
Tripped .
Tripped .
Tripped .
FLASH .
When I thought of the word tripped , there was a flash and I traveled somewhere new .
I became waves of energy which were rippling across time and space , transporting me somewhere else .
Suddenly I found myself sitting in my first period English class .
Every color was so vivid and intense .
The bright red floor seemed to be glowing .
My English teacher had a crazy grin on her face , like she was intoxicated on the magic in the air that I was feeling .
FLASH .
I thought of the word  TRIP  again and in a flash I once again I traveled somewhere new .
I once again became rippeling waves of energy and was transported .
There were these strange adults standing around talking about me .
They had that same strange grin that my English teacher had .
There was magic in the air .
I could see it , I could touch it .
They understood the magic of these mushrooms .
You eat them and permanently enter this new world .
I was going to be in this state forever .
In this magical world for the rest of my life .
In the background of this traveling I heard the distant voice of somebody ( I think it was Dave ) say to somebody else ,  Cops dont even care .
Did you hear about the guy that was caught tripping by channel 2 news ?
Cops dont even care ?
In a second I was transported to another place .
I was seeing places that I would be in the future .
People standing around me , grinning that same crazy grin .
The mushroom kept transporting me from one spot to another to another with these flashes .
I was soaring across time and space .
And that is when I got stuck in the time loop .
In my head I once again heard Daves words  Did you hear the guy that was caught tripping by channel 2 news ? 
And then the spirit of the mushroom showed me something that completely blew my mind .
The person who had gotten caught by channel 2 news was ME !
Although it hadnt happened to me yet , I knew that I was the person they were talking about .
It hadnt happened yet but it would by the end of the night .
I was probably going to wander outside and get lost .
Somehow I was going to be caught by the channel 2 news .
I was seeing what would happen .
People would be filming me , laughing while I wandered around completely disoriented .
But they werent mad that I was on drugs ; they just found it humorous that I was tripping so hard .
All those people had the same crazy grin on their face too .
I knew that it was bad to be caught tripping , but it I knew I wouldnt get in trouble because  Cops dont even care .
Then the mushroom showed me the news clip that would be showed on the news of me .
In the clip I was wandering around completely disoriented , but the news wasnt making a big deal over how a horrible drug epidemic is taking over the town .
Instead they just laughed happily .
They didnt even give out my identity or show my face .
That s because I was in this new , magical world now , where everybody seemed to be intoxicated by the magic in the air .
Then the mushrooms showed me Dave sitting in his house watching this story on TV , except he didnt know that it was me who had been caught tripping because the news hadnt released my identity .
He then came to Adams later that day .
I ended up taking Shrooms at Adams and while I was Shrooming Dave said  Did you hear about the guy who was caught tripping by channel 2 news ?.
And so I was stuck in some strange sort of time loop .
It all came back to itself in some sort of strange circle , but even though it hadnt happened yet , I knew that I was the one who was going to be caught by channel 2 news .
Soon I was walking on those rugs again , staring at the patterns .
But time was going backwards now .
I was getting younger and younger .
I felt like a 6 year old , wandering around .
I kept getting younger and younger , and soon I was a 3 year old .
I looked at my friends green plaid shirt , which I was still wearing , and thought back to when it had been put on me .
I had completely forgotten that he had put it on me .
Instead I was seeing my parents putting it on me , and then I was at some day care .
I thought I was at the day care I used to go to when I was little .
But I kept getting younger and younger as time rewound faster .
Soon I was a baby again .
It was amazing ; I was getting closer and closer to the creation of my existence .
I would soon know what happened before I was born .
I kept getting younger and younger until I reached the point before I was born .
And WOW .
Suddenly a million memories started flooding back to me .
But they werent memories from my life .
They were memories of the ultimate truth .
The answer to every question .
This is definitely the hardest part of the trip to explain .
It was like an incredible never ending déjà vu .
The feeling kept getting stronger and stronger as I was soaring through this new spiritual dimension , I didnt have a body to hold me down .
Nor did I have a self to hold me together .
When you are on the earth existence , its like you have blinders on , making you forget about the truth .
But once you leave the earth world , the spiritual understanding comes back to you .
Thinking back to earth life , and remembering how I was always trying to understand what life really was .
But I couldnt understand it because I had those blinders on .
But now I was back to the place where my soul had initially came from .
My soul was continuously moving faster and faster through this new world , uniting with it .
Realizing that it had never been separate from this world .
The seperateness was just an illusion .
This was my true home .
As I thought back to that earth existence , I realized that eventually I would have to go back there .
Once again , Id have to live another life confused about existence with my blinders on .
But it didnt matter , because no matter how long it seemed that I would be in that world , it was really only a tiny amount of time compared to how long Id stay in the ultimate truth once I died again .
And then I would come back to my souls true home and reunite with the ultimate .
And then I would have to go back to the earth world again .
I would be eternally switching back and forth between these two places .
I then realized that I always had been switching back and forth between these two worlds since the creation of the universe .
I had lived a million lives and would live a million more .
Basically existence is in the shape of an enormous circle .
There is our lifespan on earth , which is about one hundreth of the circle .
And the rest of the circle is the ultimate truth .
Our soul travels along the circle .
We travel along the 1/10th that is existence on earth , and then we die and travel along the rest of the circle .
Eventually we come back to the beginning of earth existence and are forced to separate and live another life .
Once I entered the ultimate truth I remembered all of this .
Every time anybody dies they start to remember this as they travel along the circle .
I was following the ultimate path , and everything made sense .
I didnt understand it , but I knew the universe was guiding me along this ultimate path , this journey of my soul .
And the path was paved with colors : reds , yellows , and greens , and a million colors I had never known existed .
It was beyond words .
Im not sure how long I was in that state .
I slowly began to become aware of what was going on around me .
I vaguely remember sitting on a chair while somebody was spinning it around .
And I also vaguely remember that later I picked up the chair and threw it across the room .
I didnt realize I had thrown it .
I didnt know gravity existed anymore , and so from my perspective I just pushed it up into the air .
It slowly rose into the air and seemed to float .
Since gravity didnt exist , I thought it would just stay up in the air .
But then it suddenly clattered to the ground and waves of sound echoed through the universe .
My friends just laughed at me .
I was still aware that I was in this ultimate truth , even though consciousness was returning to my body again .
I was still walking around , still on this incredible journey .
I remember hearing somebody said something about cigarettes .
I wondered if I wanted a cigarette , but then I realized I didnt smoke .
I thought about how they were all smoking weed , and for the first time in my life it seemed stupid to me .
There was no reason for me to smoke weed anymore .
Or do any drugs anymore .
I thought about the mushrooms I was growing .
I was going to stop growing them .
I was going to throw them out when I got home ..
I saw myself at home taking the cakes and throwing them all out .
Good thing I wasnt home or I probably would have .
After a few million eternities the ultimate truth faded from my mind .
Then came probably the most shocking part of the experience .
I started to come back to reality , to realize where I was .
I saw all my friends around me and suddenly remembered who they were .
I realized that I was in Adam 's basement .
I wasnt at school , I wasnt in Gumby Land , I wasnt in some ultimate universal state of existence .
I hadnt figured out the answer to life and death at all .
Then I remembered that I had eaten mushrooms .
This freaked me out more than anything else that happened during the trip .
I had been completely delusional for the last few hours .
I had intended to have a fun exciting trip , but then ended becoming totally insane .
I had been so happy to finally understand the universe , but now realized none of it had been real .
For the majority of the trip I hadnt even realized that I was under the influence of a drug , I had been convinced that it was all real .
I was still tripping for a while after this realization .
I was giddy and excited , wandering around looking at things .
The grain on the table would start patterning itself and moving and changing .
I looked at the lights and saw rainbows around them .
Some other things happened to but I was just amazed at what the mushrooms had done to me .
I remember my friend saying to me ' Arent you glad that we didnt drive you home ???' I suddenly remembered how at the beginning I had wanted to go home so badly .
I was so glad I didnt go home , I would have gotten caught by my parents for sure .
I was totally delusional for hours .
Finally it was time to leave .
We were outside , and it was raining .
I was amazed at how beautiful it was outside .
The raindrops on the car windows were crystal - like and shimmering .
The air smelled amazing and everything looked fresh and new .
If I focused on things I could still make them move and change .
I got home and kept tripping lightly for a little while .
Although it was a very intense and at times unpleasant experience , I still feel that I learned a lot from it .
I had an adventure through space and time that I never knew was possible .
I came face to face with my own mortality and feel that I am a little more prepared .
And above all , I realized that even though the trip was all a big hallucination , that reality and life and death is still much crazier than it seems , and there is something incredible going on .
I was amazed at how totally out of touch with reality those mushrooms had gotten me .
I hadnt known where I was , who I was , or what was going on .
It was like having an incredible dream , a dream in which you get what you had always wanted .
And then waking up and realizing it was n't true , it was all a dream .
That is how I felt as I was coming down from this experience .
It actually disturbed me a little to realize anything could put me in such a distorted state .
And that is why I will never eat a quarter of mushrooms again .
Well ... at least not anytime soon .

Alys sez , " A new bill is due to be introduced Thursday in the Canadian House of Commons that will give police the ability to eavesdrop on online communications .
This legislation would apparently allow them to force ISPs to allow the police to tap into their systems to obtain information .
Naturally , this comes about with the spectres of ' gangsters , sexual predators and terrorists . ' "
They forgot pirates .
The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse are gangsters , child pornographers , terrorists and pirates .
As a Pirate - Canadian , I am deeply insulted .
The proposed legislation would force Internet service providers to allow law enforcement to tap into their systems to obtain information about users and their digital conversations …
Privacy advocates and civil libertarians , however , have vocally opposed the prospect of giving police " lawful access " to the digital conversations of Canadians by being able to access such things as their text messages , e-mails , web surfing habits and Internet phone lines .
Feds to give cops Internet - snooping powers
( Thanks , Alys ! )
Let 's go over some of the ways the Iran situation has affected social media .
First ,
Twitter rescheduled its downtime because it 's been instrumental to communication from protesters .
Facebook launched a Persian translation to help facilitate discussion .
Google Translate released Farsi support so English users could understand Farsi communication easier .
And YouTube , Twitter , and the blogosphere have been on fire .
These web tools have been essential to communication between Iranians and have brought vivid information about the situation to the rest of the world .
So it should not surprise you that people are using these tools to create mashups that help .
We found one being shared today that piqued our interest .
It is a Google Maps mashup of embassies accepting injured Iranians in Tehran .
The map , seeded from information in a liveblog on The Huffington Post , is a running list of embassies that are publicly taking in injured Iranians .
The nice thing about it being a Google Maps mashup is that it can be easily utilized by Iranians and shared with others .
It 's another example of what you can do with blogs , social tools , and a lot of sharing .
If you want to see and use the mashup , here is a direct link :
Note :
If you 're wondering why the U.S. is not on this map , it 's because the U.S. has no embassy in Tehran , since the U.S. Government has no official relationship with the nation or its leadership .
As you may know , Thursday is patent application publication day ( try saying that 10 times fast ) , and yesterday 's crop of documents included several Apple patent filings .
AppleInsider took a gander and has details on one of the applications .
This particular one discusses an electronic device that could enter " security mode " or transmit a security signal based on vibration or acceleration readings , among other things .
We 've seen a number of mentions of mobile device security and safety from Apple lately , including device locators and biometric sensors , so the company seems to be on a bit of a kick .
The most recent patent filing discusses a system that would put an iPod or iPhone into " lock - down mode " if certain vibration or acceleration levels were detected , and might also call or e-mail an external security service ( or perhaps any external source ) depending on the level of vibration or acceleration involved .
Owners of the device would also be able to enter a code to bring the device out of the security mode .
At first , the system sounds a little silly — it 's unlikely that an iPhone thief would vigorously shake the device just for fun — but there are some situations in which it might make sense .
For one thing , having your iPhone call the police if huge acceleration levels are detected might help if you 're in a car accident .
You could also set your iPhone to lock whenever someone picks it up , in case you need to leave it in a gym locker or something .
Still , the number of uses for something like this seem a bit limited , so it 's unlikely that this will appear as part of the next iPhone revision .
America 's Army Devs Laid Off Following Launch ( Updated )
A representative for America 's Army confirmed the news with Shacknews , noting that future development of the free - to - play PC military simulator will occur at the program office in Redstone Arsenal , AL .
Exactly how many developers were affected is as yet unknown .
" This consolidation will allow us to gain efficiencies between our public and government applications , " the representative explained . "
We appreciate all the hard work that every member of the America 's Army team has contributed to the project , and we look forward to delivering future America 's Army game releases in the months ahead . "
Update :
While we still have no official word on the number of those affected by the " consolidation , " an America 's Army representative tells us that " some " of those from Emeryville have been asked to relocate to Redstone Arsenal and help with the " ongoing game development effort , " with " about a quarter of the team " expected to do so .
An atheist summer camp for children set up in Somerset is to offer a " godless alternative " to religious camps .
The 24 places on Camp Quest UK , which will be held next month near Bath , have already been booked up .
Organisers said the purpose of the camp was to encourage critical thinking and provide children with a summer camp " free of religious dogma " .
The camp , supported by scientist Richard Dawkins , plans to expand after receiving hundreds of inquiries .
The event has been set up by Samantha Stein , a postgraduate psychology student from London .
She said : " It is not about changing what they think , but the way that they think .
" There is very little that attacks religion , we are not a rival to religious camps .
" We exist as a secular alternative open to children from parents of all faiths and none . "
Poo me ?!
No , Poo YOU !
“ Honey , your mother sent us something in the mail ”
Every once in a while , an idea comes along that ’s so much a part of the current zeitgeist that it warrants mention on the zeitgeistiest of zeitgeist sites : ours .
That idea is legally sending poop to someone .
Albeit worm poop , PooYou.com warrants attention for tapping into the basest level of human emotions ( that being jealousy and anger ) and then sending them through the mail .
PooYou says :
“ Maybe you ’re more enraged by that jackass who sits next to you , the neighbor whose idiot dogs leave messes in your yard , or that evil orthodontist who ruined your teenage years .
Finally , you have a way to tell them exactly how you feel with a safe , legal , and direct message that makes your point while helping the environment . ”
Though my last concern when being disgruntled enough to send someone poo is the environment , I do see the genius in shipping feces while maintaining some semblance of a conscience .
It says , ‘ I hate you enough to pay for feces to enter your home but let ’s not get the ozone layer involved . ’
Apparently , a ‘ Poo - You ’ message is 100 % organic and 100 % biodegradable , and has been naturally sterilized , leaving no odor .
Yes , I know : where ’s the fun in that ?
But it comes from saying , did you get that box of shit I sent you ?
And that is priceless .
PooYou.com even sends a package of seeds along with the poo/ fertilizer “ in hopes that doing something good will make up for [ the recipient ’s ] evil deeds and wretched ways . ”
But if you ’re like me , and would send it someone who is too good that it gets annoying , then the wishful thinking does n’t really apply .
I just hope that sending a goody - two - shoes some poop will bring them closer to my level .
PooYou.com does n’t simply ship sterilized worm poop .
They engage users with virtual poo cards ( see below ) and a Facebook application that chronicles your “ Sh*t List . ”
I would ’ve titled this , “ Boss , you can be a real sh* thead ”
With only five slots , you better make sure your list is a succinct recap of all the people and businesses that have screwed you over in life .
While I ’ve got you here , my top 5 would be :
1. 7-11 hot dogs – for delivering unrepenting diarrhea at 3 am 2 . George W. Bush – for , above all , smirking like a jackass 3 . S.N. – for screwing me out of 2 grand on a business venture 4 . Mrs. Mudano – for driving me to therapy in second grade 5 .
The suburbs – for never having anything open past 9 pm , making me drive when I need to walk , gentrification , standardizing the American ideal , and for making lawn mowing a necessity
Whew !
That felt good .
But darn , there ’s so many more .
If you want to use the PooYou facebook app , you can download it here .
My craps off to you , PooYou.com , for giving others a place to channel their anger and hone it excrementally .
The speedmeisters at 9ff have taken the already potent Porsche 911 GT2 and transformed it into an 850 - horsepower beast decked out in classic Gulf livery that could n't be sexier .
The BT - 2 is a testament to the simple idea that more horsepower is always better .
Not that the GT2 is a slouch , what with that 520 - horsepower engine giving it a zero - to - 62 mph time of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 206 mph .
It 's not a car for the weak or the stupid , which is why it 's nicknamed " the widowmaker . "
But that was n't good enough for the guys at 9ff
They fitted the 3.6 - liter twin - turbo mill with an improved exhaust and tweaked ECU .
The result is 850 horsepower and a stunning 678 pound - feet of torque .
Unleash all those ponies - if you dare - and the car will sprint to 62 mph in 3 seconds flat .
Keep the hammer down and you 'll see what 200 mph looks like in just 19 seconds .
She 'll top out at 240 mph if you 're brave enough .
If the BT - 2 is n't insane enough for you , there 's always the GT9 .
It produces 987 horsepower and a top speed of 254 .
The company also is developing an even wilder version , called the GT9 - R , slated to put down 1,120 horsepower .

On May 5 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) administered a warning against General Mills regarding the claim that Cheerios® Toasted Whole Grain Oat Cereal has the ability to lower cholesterol .
Basically , the FDA cited General Mills for marketing Cheerios® as a cholesterol - reducing drug .
I believe the FDA ’s points are valid and factual , but I have to ask – Should n’t our agency watchdog be focusing greater attention on the operators of thousands of Web sites and the spammers who peddle contraband or counterfeit drugs to American consumers every day ?
What are the consequences for these dangerous marketing practices ?
The Partnership for Safe Medicines ( PSM ) strongly suggests that the only way to curb the sale and distribution of counterfeit drugs is to introduce warnings and reprimands against dangerous online drug sellers and then to follow up and make sure they stop .
Yes , it is important for consumers to understand that eating Cheerios® is not the solution to lowering cholesterol .
But if the FDA can focus its attention on these types of skewed advertisements , then why can't more be done to safeguard Americans from potentially harmful counterfeit drugs ?
The PSM wants to reiterate the only way to put a stop to illegal and dangerous drug counterfeiting , is to place punishments on those that produce and distribute them .

Aung San Suu Kyi probably knew she was courting danger when she allowed “ that wretched American , ” as one of her lawyers called John Yettaw , to sleep overnight in her home .
He ’d exhausted himself swimming across the lake on which her house is situated and withholding mercy does n’t come naturally to the type of person who wins a Nobel Peace Prize .
Burma ’s ruling junta is another tiger that ca n’t change its spots .
No doubt , its 12 generals are congratulating themselves over catching up Suu Kyi in a technical violation of her house arrest ( allowing , however uninvited , an unauthorized visitor ) .
Aung Din , executive director of the US Campaign for Burma called it a “ cunning scheme . ”
But there ’s nothing clever or cunning about using the flimsiest and most obvious of legalistic pretexts to deposit Suu Kyi in Rangoon ’s infamous Insein prison .
Like many of the junta ’s actions and policies , it ’s heavy - handed , just like you ’d expect from a tin - pot dictatorship .
Even more pitiful , the junta seems to work at cross purposes with itself .
For example , the New York Times had just run a story entitled A Year After Storm , Subtle Changes in Myanmar .
Last May , Cyclone Nargis , swept through the Irrawaddy Delta killing 85,000 and leaving 54,000 missing ( presumed dead ) .
The subsequent “ surge of humanitarian aid , ” reports the Times , “ might have opened a breach in the political wall around Myanmar , including perhaps a new and softer line by the United States . ”
If you ’ll recall , the junta at first refused to allow aid organizations into the country .
” But now it “ readily accepts air shipments of foreign aid , ” though not by sea because “ the xenophobic junta — still [ fears ] a seaborne invasion by Western powers .
… [ Also ] the number of international aid groups allowed to work in Myanmar has doubled in the past year . ”
The article quotes Frank Smithuis , director of Médecins Sans Frontières in Burma : “ Look , the human rights record is shaky , yes , and it ’s politically nice to beat up Burma , but the military has actually been quite helpful to us . ”
“ Shaky ” ?
Try nightmarish .
“ Politically nice to beat up Burma ” ?
There could n’t possibly be any other reason besides politics that over 100 groups outside of Burma are working for its democracy and that the United States and the European Union have sanctioned it , could there ?
More to the point , no sooner did a major American media outlet in effect pat the junta on the back for signs it was growing a conscience then the junta turned around and arrested one of the world ’s most beloved women .
Will the Times also praise the junta for allowing foreign media and diplomats to attend the trial ?
( Uh , probably not , since it only lasted one day . )
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was livid , declaring to a congressional hearing that the trial was “ baseless ” and that the 2010 elections were “ illegitimate because of the way they have treated her . ”
Sure , the junta is an easy target , but the point is they should n’t be , especially since , post - Nargis , the world has been reaching out to it .
The UN and ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations ) also censured Suu Kyi’s arrest , as did the European Union .
Then the United States extended the current sanctions regimen , which was n’t even up for reconsideration until the end of the year , when it expires .
Maybe the Times and the aid organizations quoted in the article , however well intentioned , were giving the junta too much credit .
In the view of Asia Times Online ’s Brian McCartan , the flow of aid that the junta allowed is regulated by The Aid Wall .
Many international aid groups are angling to extend their activities beyond the Irrawaddy Delta . …
They complain that the junta has maintained restrictions in other parts of the country , effectively building an “ aid wall ” around the Nargis - hit delta .
… the military rulers clearly still believe an extended relief effort could have political repercussions , including unwanted observers of its alleged human - rights abuses and empowerment of grassroots communities .
In fact …
. . . the humanitarian aid community ’s outreach in the Irrawaddy Delta has not resulted in greater openness but rather represents the latest example of the junta ’s well - worn open - and - closed strategy for maintaining power .
Supposedly the 12 generals of the ruling junta are preparing for next year ’s elections .
By mimicking democracy , they hope to seduce the United States and the European Union into removing sanctions .
But imprisoning the Lady , as she ’s known to Burmese , erecting an aid wall , and oppressing minorities such as the Karens and Shan are a funny way of showing you care about the West ’s opinion .
Clearly , the junta does n’t .
Thanks to oil and gas deals , among other business transactions , it already has China and India in their economic corner .
Sacrificing development from the West is a small price to pay to ensure that the junta endures .
The Bush administration went out on a limb to convince the Nuclear Suppliers Group to overlook India ’s refusal to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
One ca n’t help but wonder why the United States ca n’t exact some sort of reciprocity from India .
Expecting India to completely disengage from the junta is unrealistic .
But asking it to withdraw specified deals in response to fresh human rights violations on the part of the junta should n’t be too much to ask .
Meanwhile one encouraging development has emerged as a result of Aung San Suu Kyi ’s internment .
Irrawaddy Magazine reports that East Timor President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos - Horta has teamed up with the Burma Lawyers ’ Council .
Together they intend to petition the International Criminal Court to begin investigations in hopes of charging the junta ’s leader , General Than Shwe , with human rights abuses and violations of international law .
The ICC may not be able to haul him into court , but it will make it that much harder for India , if not China , to continue dealing with the junta .
astronomy abuse , now on national tv
ABC's Tandem follows the age old tradition of cramming enough technobabble into the plot of a space themed disaster show and hope the audience does n't ask questions .
Here ’s a doomsday scenario .
A chunk of a brown dwarf lodges itself in the lunar surface , increasing the mass of our natural satellite to twice that of Earth which sends it careening into our planet .
No , wait , I ’m not done yet , there ’s more .
To save the world , three scientists have to go to the Moon and dislodge the neutron star - dense piece of a celestial object with high explosives , the only sci - fi movie approved way to save worlds .
The burning sensation you ’re feeling is the several million degrees worth of stupid emanating from Tandem and ABC in a mini-series apparently written by someone who dropped out of eight grade .
Just take a look for yourself …
Let ’s start with the basics .
Brown dwarfs are either overgrown planets or underachieving stars depending on whether you want to be optimistic or pessimistic about their fates .
They emit light and there ’s some sporadic fusion happening in their cores which means that they ’re almost entirely gaseous , have no surface and their densest innards would probably be similar to soup in consistency .
So , um , how exactly does one break off a large bit of a dense gas which weighs about 20 sextillion tons and make it so small , it can easily hide in the tiny rocks that make up a meteor shower ?
The only known objects in the universe with this much density are neutron stars which are basically just atomic nuclei kept from imploding only by the degeneracy pressure of the Pauli- exclusion principle .
The only thing dense enough to possibly break off a chunk of a neutron star is another neutron star .
And when neutron stars collide , you ’ll just get a black hole because they ’ll overcome the only force holding them from collapsing into a gravitational ghost .
Oh and there ’s another problem with the mass of the object the writers crash into the Moon .
If it has about two Earth masses , the scientists would n’t have noticed it by chance during a meteor shower .
In fact there would n’t be a meteor shower as the object ’s mass would ’ve attracted the comet and the rocks it carried in its tail .
As well as push the Earth out of its orbit on approach .
Since it seems that even basic Newtonian gravity was too much of a hassle to take into consideration , the writers not only ignored that for eye - candy effects which could only happen if our planet was being swallowed by a black hole ( and even then the explanations provided by the “ scientists ” would be wrong ) , they also sent the super - heavy Moon into a death spiral with the Earth .
Even though if the Moon was twice as massive as we are , it would become the dominant object in the system and send us into a rapidly decaying orbit around itself .
At this point I could mention that trying to tear out 20 sextillion short tons of … whatever out of the Moon could n’t be done with every nuclear weapon we ’ve ever built going off at the same instant about a thousand times over .
Or that we ’d probably destroy the Moon in the process and send our planet tumbling through space as there ’d be no force to help us keep our comfortable polar axis stable .
But rather than expanding on these issues , I ’m going to wonder who thought that such a ridiculously implausible show which would be rejected even by the companies which provide stilted , low budget B movies for the Sci -Fi Channel , was worth producing .
If you ’re going to write science fiction , you have to take into account that your audience probably knows a fair bit about space , how gravity works and understands the difference between a neutron star and a brown dwarf .
If you want to tell a good science fiction story , it has to be both plausible and respectful of the science involved in its mechanics .
Otherwise , all you do is force viewers to mentally correct every other word that comes out of your characters ’ mouths instead of following the storyline .
I ’ll bet that in the future , Impact may just become a punchline used to describe terrible science fiction movies written by someone who ’s ignorance of the basics of astronomy could only be rivaled by the likes of Spike Psarris .
Some people think that during Soviet era there were no alternative art in Russia , but only portraits of Lenin were popular and only scenes of everyday Soviet life were depicted .
To tell truth I was a bit shocked when met those installations by Russian ( yes , he is Russian , no matter what was his name – he had Spanish father but was raised by Russian mother in Russia ) artist Francisco Infante - Arana .
He used no photoshop , mainly because most of the images you see in this post are from 1970 - 1980s , he used only natural objects like mirrors , ropes and cords and endulged a lot into the effect of light and shadow .
He became widely recognized even by Soviet officials and hold personal exhibitions , as well as his art pieces were shown in main Russian museums like Tretyakovka .

" My boys now call me Mum , the Myth Buster ! "
The actor 's young children may have been convinced by the performance , but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was not .
" Coke 's messages were totally unacceptable , creating an impression which is likely to mislead that Coca - Cola cannot contribute to weight gain , obesity and tooth decay , " said the ACCC 's chairman , Graeme Samuel .
" [ The ads ] also had the potential to mislead parents about the potential consequences of consuming Coca - Cola . "
Today , Coca - Cola South Pacific gave the ACCC court - enforceable undertakings to publish corrective advertisements in The Sydney Morning Herald , The Age , The Australian , The Courier Mail , the Adelaide Advertiser , The West Australian , and the Hobart Mercury , as well as on the company 's own website .
The correct level of caffeine for Diet Coca - Cola must be included in the corrective advertisements , the ACCC has ruled , because of the false claims in the original campaign that the soft drink contained about one third the amount of caffeine as tea , when in fact the soft drink had well over half the caffeine content of tea .
The ACCC began investigating Coca - Cola after a complaint was lodged jointly by the Obesity Policy Coalition , The Parents Jury and the Australian Dental Association .
The Obesity Policy Coalition 's senior policy adviser , Jane Martin , described the ACCC 's action as a major victory for Australian consumers .
" Coca - Cola , in an attempt to reach the ' mum - market ' , tried to soothe concerns about the unhealthy aspects of their products , but this has back - fired , '' Ms Martin said .
" Coca - Cola 's promotion points clearly to a need for better food labelling so food and drinks can be seen for what they are , rather than allowing marketing spin to dress them up as something that they are not . ''
The president of the Australian Dental Association , Dr Neil Hewson , said consumers had a right to accurate information about the products they buy , " especially when the consumption of sugary , fizzy drinks are likely to contribute substantially to Australia 's escalating childhood obesity epidemic and cause significant dental health problems ' ' .
Coca -Cola South Pacific has issued a statement stating the intention of the ads was to balance the debate about whether the soft drink could be justified as part of a balanced diet and lifestyle .
" We certainly did not intend our message to be misleading and we have been working with the ACCC to address its concerns .
The ACCC were concerned we oversimplified some complex topics and we acknowledge we should have provided more information , '' the statement said .
The corrective advertisements , which the company has entitled " Setting the Record Straight ' ' will be published on Saturday and will not involve Armstrong , who has remained silent throughout the controversy until today .
Armstrong told Armstrong told
today she would not comment on the advertisements , but said : " The campaign that I did has passed and gone and I have n't made any comment yet - nor am I going to - because there were things that happened that were out of my control as well . ''
The first thing you learn at Overload is that everything you know about fitness is wrong .
Well , just about everything .
Calories still matter , but in the opinion of Overload founder Joshua Trentine , common terms such as cardio , reps and toning are worthless , and traditional weight lifting is a waste .
Some of Trentine 's ideas are tough for a runner like me to swallow .
But having given Overload a try , I concur he 's got something people should consider .
As the name suggests , Overload takes you to your limits .
You perform a small set of tasks slowly , with control , for a short time , until your arms or legs simply fail .
The reasoning is that most people spend their fitness time inefficiently , knocking out endless repetitions with too much assistance from momentum .
Seeing little benefit , they either give up or keep on trying in vain .
Alternatively , Overload trainers cut right to the chase , taxing large muscle groups with concentrated efforts lasting roughly 20 minutes .
These , in turn , build more muscle by stimulating key hormonal reactions .
Hence the slogan , " Maximum Fitness , Minimum Time . "
Overload 's facilities in Westlake , Beachwood and Columbus are like monasteries of fitness .
Members sign contracts promising to give their all , and the heavily cooled workout rooms are distraction - free , with dim lights and no music or mirrors .
Also missing : free - weights .
Instead , trainers employ machines , calibrating each to the individual .
Some you might see in a gym .
Others look like something out of a lab .
But if there is n't much to look at , it 's for good reason .
When you 're there , you 're supposed to be working , focused on your breathing and keeping a loose , unclenched face .
They even ask you not to talk too much .
True to the formula , my workout was short .
Trentine used five machines on me , and I 'm pretty sure I spent no more than two or three minutes on each , not counting what it took to assume proper form and learn the instructions .
Each time , whether on the rower , lumbar device , or the leg , chest or overhead presses , Trentine set loads I consider easy , amounts I 'd probably double on my own .
In every case , though , moving so slowly , the burden came to feel like a ton of bricks .
Watching Trentine work out this way was like witnessing someone speak in tongues .
It almost looked fake , or at least melodramatic .
After just four or five repetitions , he'd be trembling , sweating and breathing rapidly .
But I can testify his struggle was real .
After five rounds of Overload , using weights far lighter than Trentine 's , I was exhausted , destined for soreness , my legs quivering and my arms like rubber .
It felt as if I 'd spent all afternoon lifting weights .
Happily , Trentine said I 'd only need to put myself through this once or twice a week .
That 's all .
If I were n't involved in endurance sports , there 'd be no need for so - called " cardio " activities like running , cycling and swimming .
Overload alone would keep me trim and strong , he said .
I suppose that 's a good thing , given Overload 's price tag .
Individual sessions cost $ 70 , while buying 96 sessions for 12 months sets you back $ 4,300 .
But at 20 minutes a pop , Overload is certainly attractive , the closest thing to fitness in a bottle .
At the very least , I 'll keep in mind the principles when I 'm at my loud , bright gym , doing my less - than - perfect thing .
Nereus was tested in the waters off the dock of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts in April before being sent to the spot known as Challenger Deep in the Pacific 's Mariana Trench .
At 11,000 metres below sea level , more than 1,600 metres deeper than Mount Everest is high , Challenger Deep is arguably one of the most remote locations on Earth .
( ( Tom Kleindinst / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ) )
An unmanned robotic vehicle has successfully touched the deepest known part of the ocean floor , U.S. researchers revealed on Wednesday .
On May 31 , the Nereus was launched off the research vessel Kilo Moana in the western Pacific Ocean , between Papua New Guinea and Japan .
The unmanned aquatic vessel descended 10,902 metres into a part of the Mariana Trench known as Challenger Deep .
It is the first vessel to explore the remote area in more than a decade .
" It 's the deepest known part of the ocean , " said Andy Bowen , project manager of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , which led the dive .
" The trench is virtually unexplored , and I am absolutely certain Nereus will enable new discoveries . "
With a budget of $ 8 million US , the Nereus dive was the first voyage into the trench since a Japanese - built robot named Kaiko attempted a voyage in 1998 .
That robot disappeared when the cable connecting it snapped on a dive during a typhoon in 2003 .
Measuring a little more than four metres in length , Nereus was able to take pictures and video of the ocean floor and bring back samples of sea life , including shrimp and a sea cucumber .
" The samples collected by the vehicle include sediment from the subducting and overriding tectonic plates that meet at the trench , " said Patty Fryer , a geologist with the University of Hawaii .
Water pressure in the trench is more than 1,000 times what it is on land at sea level .
The nearly 11,000 metres that Nereus was able to dive is approximately the same as the cruising altitude of a commercial airliner and roughly two kilometres more than the summit of the tallest point on earth , Mount Everest .
Researchers are excited about the potential to investigate such extreme conditions .
" The ocean 's deepest regions [ were ] previously inaccessible " said Julie Morris , the ocean sciences division director of the U.S. National Science Foundation .
" We 're very pleased with the success of these sea trials . "
Connecting tether was the width of a human hair
Nereus was able to succeed where other devices had failed because of a unique new design , researchers say .
The unmanned vehicle is remotely operated by pilots aboard a surface ship via a lightweight , micro - thin , fibre optic tether .
But Nereus can also be turned into a free - swimming , autonomous vehicle even at great depths .
Conventional diving systems use steel - reinforced cables to maintain control of the probe , but such systems would snap under their own weight in the pressure conditions of the Mariana Trench .
The tether the Nereus used during its 10 - hour stint on the ocean floor used a combination of fibre optic cables and plastic sheath and was roughly the same diameter as a human hair .
Testing will continue over the next few days , and the team will return to port on June 5 .
A studio not named Valve believes the PlayStation 3 is a “ complicated ” platform .
In an interview with That Video Games Blog , Spider Games CEO Jehanne Rousseau said the lead platform for the upcoming role - playing game Mars is the PlayStation 3 , however , it ’s not because they 're in love with the shiny black box .
According to Spider brass , the choice was made because “ the PS3 is a very complicated platform . ”
“ [ If ] we concentrate now on all the difficulties and strong points of this console and if we can go over them , the other platforms should be simple to approach . ”
Sounds like Spider Games has the right idea : start hard , and then take it easy .
Interestingly , Rousseau would n’t say if Mars would truly hit another platform .
The CEO did comment that Spider did n’t want to swindle Xbox 360 owners with a crappy port if a publisher desired to take the game to the platform .
[ UPDATE : I took out the Valve quote .
I decided it was too much . ]
Someone by the name of cathy commented on the “ Logically Disproving the Christian God ” post a couple of days ago posing an interesting question :
There is also the stone paradox which takes down most definitions of omnipotence .
‘ Can god create a stone so big he can not lift it ? ’
If he can , then there is something he cannot do ( lift the stone ) .
If he can ’t , there is something he cannot do ( create said stone ) .
This is a question I ’ve seen elsewhere , and it ’s always fun to explore with a theist .
There are other , related questions which together form the omnipotence paradox .
Essentially , it ’s a set of paradoxes which makes the existence of any truly omnipotent being impossible .
I thought it would be an interesting exercise to give some examples of these paradoxes and questions , and throw them open to debate .
To kick off , I thought I ’d offer the definition of Omnipotent :
om·nip·o·tent ( ŏm-nĭp ’ə - tənt )
adj .
Having unlimited or universal power , authority , or force ; all - powerful .
See Usage Note at infinite .
n .
1 . One having unlimited power or authority : the bureaucratic omnipotents .
2. Omnipotent God .
Used with the .
It is the unlimited power attribute that the omnipotence paradoxes call into question .
Essentially , the paradox is whether an omnipotent being has the power to limit themselves .
If they do , then they no longer have unlimited power ( because of the self - imposed limit ) .
If not , then there is something that cannot do , also meaning their power is not limitless .
Some examples :
The Stone Paradox is the most popular , it posits the simple question of whether an omnipotent being can create a stone so heavy that that they can not lift it .
Personally , I feel this particular paradox is somewhat dated given what we understand of the physical attributes and forces involved with objects , particularly their gravitational force .

The Triangle Paradox was posed by Aquinas in Summa contra Gentiles and asks whether God could create a triangle with three internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees .
Again , I do n’t think this is a particularly useful or valid paradox as it relies on our definition of a triangle .
Could God create an object that has internal angles that do not add up to 180 degrees ?
Yes , and so can I .

Yes , and so can I . The Atom Paradox comes from Descartes ’ Principles of Philosophy , and questions whether God could create something so small it was no longer divisible .
The examples above have been known , discussed and debated for some time .
Each , in my opinion , has problems .
So with that in mind , I thought I ’d offer the following :
Could God kill himself ?
One might question why God would have the desire to kill himself , but that is not a valid reason for dismissing the question .
If God can kill himself , then he lacks the power of immortality ( perhaps a poor choice of words , maybe ever - existence would be better ) , if he cannot , then he lacks the ability to kill himself .

Could God create a truly immortal being ?
Similar to the above but a step removed .
If God can create a truly immortal being , then he lacks the ability to end the life of that being , if he cannot create a truly immortal being , or if he can create a truly immortal being that he can then kill , then either he lacks the ability to create a truly immortal being or that being he creates is not truly immortal .
Similar to the above but a step removed .
If God can create a truly immortal being , then he lacks the ability to end the life of that being , if he cannot create a truly immortal being , or if he can create a truly immortal being that he can then kill , then either he lacks the ability to create a truly immortal being or that being he creates is not truly immortal .
Could God create a being more powerful than himself ?
You might also ask whether God can create a more powerful God ?
This is particularly interesting as it applies across multiple definitions of the word omnipotent ( see below ) .
If God can create such a being , then he is clearly not of unlimited power ( for a being to be more powerful , there must , by definition , be something the new God can do that the old one cannot ) , and if he cannot , then that is an ability God lacks .

Could God make himself no longer omnipotent ?
Rather than questioning whether God is omnipotent , this dispenses with that and rather asks whether God can make so that he is no longer omnipotent , or such that he is no longer a God .
If so , then what impact does that have on the established belief systems , and how would we know ?
These are just a selection of the paradoxes one can pose that question the possibility of an omnipotent being .
I ’d love to see your responses to the paradoxes .
Typically , theist responses debate the definition of omnipotent suggesting that an omnipotent being has only the power to perform logically possible actions .
One could argue in response that the existence of an omnipotent being is not logical in itself , thereby creating another paradox of sorts .
There is also some debate as to whether a God is omnipotent , or just Almighty , where Almighty is simply a definition of a God that lacks some of the logical fallacies and vulnerabilities of an omnipotent God .
Much like theists changing their holy books , and selectively accepting them , this feels like a desperate move to maintain their beliefs .
What are your thoughts ?
American mass murderer
Charles Joseph Whitman ( June 24 , 1941 – August 1 , 1966 ) was an American mass murderer who became infamous as the " Texas Tower Sniper " .
On August 1 , 1966 , he used knives to kill his mother and his wife in their respective homes , then went to the University of Texas in Austin with multiple firearms and began indiscriminately shooting at people .
He fatally shot three people inside the university tower .
He then went to the tower 's 28th - floor observation deck , where he fired at random people for some 96 minutes , killing an additional 11 people ( plus an unborn child ) and wounding 31 others , including a woman whose injuries prevented her pregnancy from coming to term , before he was shot dead by Austin police officers .
Whitman killed a total of 16 people ; the 16th victim died 35 years later from injuries sustained in the attack . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Early life and education [ edit ]
Whitman was born on June 24 , 1941 , in Lake Worth , Florida , the eldest of three sons born to Margaret E. ( Hodges ) and Charles Adolphus " C. A. " Whitman Jr. [ 6 ]
Whitman 's father was raised in an orphanage in Savannah , Georgia , [ 7 ] and described himself as a self - made man .
He married Margaret , then 17 years old .
The marriage of Whitman 's parents was marred by domestic violence ; Whitman 's father was an admitted authoritarian who provided for his family but demanded near perfection from all of them .
He was known to physically and emotionally abuse his wife and children . [ 8 ]
As a boy , Whitman was described as a polite child who seldom lost his temper . [ 9 ]
He was extremely intelligent — an examination at the age of six revealed his IQ to be 139 . [ 10 ]
Whitman 's academic achievements were encouraged by his parents , and any indication of failure or a lethargic attitude were met with discipline — often physical — from his father . [ 11 ]
Margaret Whitman was a devout Roman Catholic who raised her sons in the same religion .
The Whitman brothers regularly attended Mass with their mother , and all three brothers served as altar boys at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church . [ 12 ]
Whitman 's father was a firearms collector and enthusiast , who taught each of his young sons to shoot , clean , and maintain weapons .
He regularly took them on hunting trips , and Charles became an avid hunter and accomplished marksman .
His father said of him : " Charlie could plug the eye out of a squirrel by the time he was sixteen . " [ 13 ]
Whitman joined the Boy Scouts at age 11 . [ 10 ]
He became an Eagle Scout at 12 years three months , reportedly the youngest of any Eagle Scout up to that time . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Whitman also became an accomplished pianist at the age of 12 . [ 14 ]
At around the same time , he began an extensive newspaper route . [ 15 ]
High school [ edit ]
Whitman around 1959 ( age 18 )
On September 1 , 1955 , Whitman entered St. Ann 's High School in West Palm Beach , where he was regarded as a moderately popular student whose intelligence was noted by his teachers and peers . [ 16 ]
By the next month , he had saved enough money from his newspaper route to purchase a Harley - Davidson motorcycle , which he used on his route . [ 17 ]
Without telling his father beforehand , Whitman enlisted in the United States Marine Corps one month after his June 1959 graduation from high school , where he had graduated seventh in a class of 72 students .
[ 7 ]
Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst for his enlistment was an incident a month earlier , in which his father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool because Whitman had come home drunk .
[ 8 ]
Whitman left home on July 6 , having been assigned an 18 - month tour of duty with the Marines at Guantánamo Bay .
His father still did not know he had enlisted . [ 7 ]
As Whitman traveled toward Parris Island , his father learned of his action and telephoned a branch of the federal government , trying to have his son 's enlistment canceled . [ 12 ]
U.S. Marine and college student [ edit ]
During Whitman 's initial 18 - month service in 1959 and 1960 , he earned a sharpshooter 's badge and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal .
He achieved 215 of 250 possible points on marksmanship tests , doing well when shooting rapidly over long distances as well as at moving targets .
After completing his assignment , Whitman applied to a U.S. Navy and Marine Corps scholarship program , intending to complete college and become a commissioned officer . [ 18 ]
Whitman earned high scores on the required examination , and the selection committee approved his enrollment at a preparatory school in Maryland , where he completed courses in mathematics and physics before being approved to transfer to the University of Texas at Austin to study mechanical engineering . [ 18 ]
University life [ edit ]
On September 15 , 1961 , Whitman entered the mechanical engineering program at the University of Texas at Austin .
He was initially a poor student .
His hobbies included karate , scuba diving , gambling , and hunting . [ 19 ]
Shortly after his enrollment at the university , Whitman and two friends were observed poaching a deer , with a passer - by noting his license plate number and reporting them to the police .
The trio were butchering the deer in the shower at Whitman 's dormitory when they were arrested . [ 12 ]
Whitman was fined $ 100 ( $ 900 in 2019 ) for the offense . [ 20 ]
Whitman earned a reputation as a practical joker in his years as an engineering student , but his friends also noted he made some morbid and chilling statements .
On one occasion in 1962 , as Whitman and a fellow student named Francis Schuck Jr. browsed in the bookstore in the main building of the University of Texas , Whitman remarked , " A person could stand off an army from atop of it [ the tower ] before they got him . " [ 21 ]
Marriage [ edit ]
In February 1962 , 20 - year - old Whitman met Kathleen Frances Leissner , an education major two years his junior .
Leissner was Whitman 's first serious girlfriend .
They courted for five months before announcing their engagement on July 19 . [ 22 ]
On August 17 , 1962 , Whitman and Leissner were married in a Catholic ceremony held in Leissner 's hometown of Needville , Texas . [ 23 ]
The couple chose the 22nd wedding anniversary of Whitman 's parents as the date for their wedding .
[ 21 ]
Whitman 's family drove from Florida to Texas to attend the event , and his younger brother Patrick served as best man .
Fr. Leduc , a Whitman family friend , presided over the ceremony .
Leissner 's family and friends approved of her choice of husband , describing Whitman as a " handsome young man " who was both intelligent , and aspirational . [ 24 ]
Although Whitman 's grades improved somewhat during his second and third semesters , the Marines considered them insufficient for continuation of his scholarship .
He was ordered to active duty in February 1963 [ 25 ] and went to Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , for the remainder of his five - year enlistment . [ 26 ]
Camp Lejeune [ edit ]
Whitman apparently resented his college studies being ended , although he was automatically promoted to the rank of lance corporal .
At Camp Lejeune , he was hospitalized for four days [ 27 ] after single - handedly freeing another marine by lifting a Jeep which had rolled over an embankment . [ 28 ]
Despite his reputation as an exemplary Marine , he continued to gamble .
In November 1963 , he was court - martialed for gambling , usury , possession of a personal firearm on base , and for threatening another Marine over a $ 30 loan ( $ 300 in 2019 ) , for which he had demanded $ 15 in interest .
Sentenced to 30 days of confinement and 90 days of hard labor , he was demoted from lance corporal ( E - 3 ) to private ( E - 1 ) . [ 29 ]
Documented stressors [ edit ]
Whitman 's journal
While awaiting his court martial in 1963 , Whitman began to write a diary titled Daily Record of C. J. Whitman . [ 30 ]
In it , he wrote about his daily life in the Marine Corps and his interactions with Kathy and other family members .
He also wrote about his upcoming court martial and contempt for the Marine Corps , criticizing them for inefficiencies .
In his writings about his wife , Whitman often praised her and expressed his longing to be with her .
He also wrote about his efforts and plans to free himself from financial dependence on his father . [ 31 ]
In December 1964 , Whitman was honorably discharged from the Marines .
He returned to the University of Texas at Austin , enrolling in the architectural engineering program .
To support his wife Kathy and himself , he worked as a bill collector for the Standard Finance Company .
Later , he worked as a bank teller at the Austin National Bank .
In January 1965 , Whitman took a temporary job with Central Freight Lines as a traffic surveyor for the Texas Highway Department . [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
He also volunteered as a scout leader for Austin Scout Troop 5 , while his wife worked as a biology teacher at Lanier High School . [ 34 ]
Friends later said that Whitman had told them that he struck his wife on two occasions . [ 35 ]
They said that Whitman despised himself for this and confessed to being " mortally afraid of being like his father . " [ 36 ]
In his journal , Whitman lamented his actions and resolved to be a good husband and not abusive as his father had been . [ 36 ]
Separation of Whitman 's parents [ edit ]
In May 1966 , Margaret Whitman announced her decision to divorce her husband because of his continued physical abuse . [ 37 ]
Charles Whitman drove to Florida to help his mother move to Austin .
Whitman was reportedly so afraid that his father would resort to violence against his mother as she prepared to leave , that he summoned a local policeman to remain outside the house while his mother packed her belongings . [ 37 ]
Whitman 's youngest brother , John , also left Lake Worth and moved to Austin with his mother .
Patrick Whitman , the middle son , remained in Florida and worked in his father 's plumbing supply business . [ 38 ]
In Austin , Whitman 's mother took a job in a cafeteria and moved into her own apartment , though she remained in close contact with Charles . [ 37 ]
Whitman 's father later said he had spent more than a thousand dollars ( $ 8,400 in 2019 ) on long - distance phone calls to both his wife and Charles , begging his wife to return and asking his son to convince her to come back . [ 37 ]
During this stressful time , Whitman was abusing amphetamines and began experiencing severe headaches , which he described as being " tremendous " .
Events leading to the shooting [ edit ]
Main building of the University of Texas at Austin .
Whitman went up to the observation deck and fired upon people at ground level .
The day before the shootings , Whitman bought a pair of binoculars and a knife from a hardware store , and some Spam from a 7 - Eleven convenience store .
He picked up his wife from her summer job as a telephone operator before he met his mother for lunch at the Wyatt Cafeteria , which was close to the university . [ 39 ]
At about 4:00 p.m. on July 31 , 1966 , Charles and Kathy Whitman visited their close friends John and Fran Morgan .
They left the Morgans ' apartment at 5:50 p.m. so Kathy could get to her 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. shift . [ 39 ]
At 6:45 p.m. , Whitman began typing his suicide note , a portion of which read :
I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter .
Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed .
I do not really understand myself these days .
I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man .
However , lately ( I can not recall when it started ) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts .
These thoughts constantly recur , and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks . [ 40 ]
In his note , he went on to request an autopsy be performed on his remains after he was dead to determine if there had been a discernible biological contributory cause for his actions and for his continuing and increasingly intense headaches .
He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife .
Expressing uncertainty about his reasons , he nonetheless stated he did not believe his mother had " ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to " , [ 39 ] and that his wife had " been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever hope to have " .
Whitman further explained that he wanted to relieve both his wife and mother of the suffering of this world , and to save them the embarrassment of his actions .
He did not mention planning the attack at the university . [ 41 ]
Just after midnight on August 1 , Whitman drove to his mother 's apartment at 1212 Guadalupe Street .
After killing his mother , he placed her body on her bed and covered it with sheets . [ 42 ]
Just how he murdered his mother is disputed , but officials believed he rendered her unconscious before stabbing her in the heart . [ 42 ]
He left a handwritten note beside her body , which read in part :
To Whom It May Concern : I have just taken my mother 's life .
I am very upset over having done it .
However , I feel that if there is a heaven she is definitely there now [...]
I am truly sorry [...]
Let there be no doubt in your mind that I loved this woman with all my heart . [ 43 ]
Whitman then returned to his home at 906 Jewell Street , where he killed his wife by stabbing her three times in the heart as she slept .
He covered her body with sheets , then resumed the typewritten note he had begun the previous evening . [ 44 ]
Using a ballpoint pen , he wrote at the side of the page :
Friends interrupted .
8-1-66 Mon. 3:00 A.M. BOTH DEAD . [ 42 ]
Whitman continued the note , finishing it by pen :
I imagine it appears that I brutally killed both of my loved ones .
I was only trying to do a quick thorough job [...]
If my life insurance policy is valid please pay off my debts [...] donate the rest anonymously to a mental health foundation .
Maybe research can prevent further tragedies of this type [...]
Give our dog to my in - laws .
Tell them Kathy loved " Schocie " very much [...]
If you can find in yourselves to grant my last wish , cremate me after the autopsy . [ 40 ]
He also left instructions in the rented house requesting that two rolls of camera film be developed and wrote personal notes to each of his brothers . [ 42 ]
Whitman last wrote on an envelope labeled " Thoughts for the Day " , in which he stored a collection of written admonitions .
He added on the outside of the envelope :
8-1-66 .
I never could quite make it .
These thoughts are too much for me . [ 42 ]
At 5:45 a.m. on August 1 , 1966 , Whitman phoned his wife 's supervisor at Bell System to explain that Kathy was ill and unable to work that day .
He made a similar phone call to his mother 's workplace five hours later .
Whitman 's final journal entries were written in the past tense , suggesting that he had already killed his wife and mother . [ 40 ]
University of Texas Tower shooting [ edit ]
The tower observation deck
At approximately 11:35 a.m. , [ 45 ]
Whitman arrived on the University of Texas at Austin campus .
He falsely identified himself as a research assistant and told a security guard he was there to deliver equipment . [ 45 ]
He then climbed to the 28th floor of the UT tower , killing three people within the tower , and opened fire from the observation deck with a hunting rifle and other weapons . [ 46 ]
Altogether , Whitman killed fourteen people and wounded thirty - one [ 47 ] in the 96 minutes [ 48 ] before he was shot and killed by Austin police officers Sergeant Ramiro Martinez and Patrolman Houston McCoy .
They had raced to the top of the tower to stop Whitman . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
Death and inquest [ edit ]
Medical history [ edit ]
Investigating officers found that Whitman had visited several university physicians in the year before the shootings ; they prescribed various medications for him .
Whitman had seen a minimum of five doctors between the fall and winter of 1965 , before he visited a psychiatrist from whom he received no prescription .
At some other time he was prescribed Valium by Dr. Jan Cochrum , who recommended he visit the campus psychiatrist . [ 51 ]
Whitman met with Maurice Dean Heatly , the staff psychiatrist at the University of Texas Health Center , on March 29 , 1966 . [ 52 ]
Whitman referred to his visit with Heatly in his final suicide note , writing , " I talked with a Doctor once for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come [ sic ] overwhelming violent impulses .
After one visit , I never saw the Doctor again , and since then have been fighting my mental turmoil alone , and seemingly to no avail . " [ 40 ]
Heatly 's notes on the visit said , " This massive , muscular youth seemed to be oozing with hostility [...] that something seemed to be happening to him and that he did n't seem to be himself . " [ 53 ]
" He readily admits having overwhelming periods of hostility with a very minimum of provocation .
Repeated inquiries attempting to analyze his exact experiences were not too successful with the exception of his vivid reference to ' thinking about going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people . ' " [ 54 ]
Autopsy [ edit ]
Although Whitman had been prescribed drugs and was in possession of Dexedrine at the time of his death , the toxicology was delayed because Whitman had been embalmed on August 1 , after his body was brought to the Cook Funeral Home in Austin .
However , an autopsy had been requested in the suicide notes left by Whitman and was then approved by his father . [ 55 ]
On August 2 , an autopsy was conducted by Coleman de Chenar ( a neuropathologist at Austin State Hospital ) at the funeral home .
Urine and blood were removed to test for traces of amphetamines or other substances . [ 56 ] [ 57 ]
During the autopsy , Chenar discovered a " pecan - sized " brain tumor , [ 58 ] which he labeled an astrocytoma and which exhibited a small amount of necrosis .
Chenar concluded that the tumor had no effect on Whitman 's actions .
These findings were later revised by the Connally Commission : " It is the opinion of the task force that the relationship between the brain tumor and Charles J. Whitman 's actions on the last day of his life cannot be established with clarity . " [ 59 ]
Connally Commission [ edit ]
Texas Governor John Connally commissioned a task force to examine the autopsy findings and material related to Whitman 's actions and motives .
The commission was composed of neurosurgeons , psychiatrists , pathologists , psychologists , including Stuart Brown , M.D. , and the University of Texas Health Center Directors , John White and Maurice Heatly .
The Commission 's toxicology tests revealed nothing significant .
They examined Chenar 's paraffin blocks of the tumor , stained specimens of it and Whitman 's other brain tissue , in addition to the remainder of the autopsy specimens available . [ 60 ]
Following a three - hour hearing on August 5 , [ 61 ] the Commission concluded that Chenar 's finding had been in error . [ 62 ]
They found that the tumor had features of a glioblastoma multiforme , with widespread areas of necrosis , palisading [ a ] of cells , [ 59 ] and a " remarkable vascular component " described as having " the nature of a small congenital vascular malformation " .
Psychiatric contributors to the report concluded that " the relationship between the brain tumor and [...]
Whitman 's actions [...] cannot be established with clarity .
However , the [ ...] tumor conceivably could have contributed to his inability to control his emotions and actions " , [ 63 ] while the neurologists and neuropathologists concluded : " The application of existing knowledge of organic brain function does not enable us to explain the actions of Whitman on August first . " [ 64 ]
Forensic investigators have theorized that the tumor pressed against Whitman 's amygdala , a part of the brain related to anxiety and fight - or - flight responses . [ 65 ] [ 66 ]
Funeral [ edit ]
A joint Catholic funeral service for Whitman and his mother was held in Lake Worth , Florida , on August 5 , 1966 .
They were buried in Florida 's Hillcrest Memorial Park .
Since he was a military veteran , Whitman was buried with military honors ; his casket was draped with the American flag . [ 67 ] [ 68 ]

Scientists have taken a big step towards treating a rare inherited disease by creating healthy cells from flakes of skin and strands of hair plucked from patients .
The study is the first to demonstrate that it is possible to repair genetic faults in human cells and make batches of healthy replacements that could potentially be used to treat a disease .
In a report in the journal Nature , researchers describe how they took skin and hair cells from six patients with a rare inherited blood disorder called Fanconi anaemia .
The disease is caused by a genetic defect that leads to bone marrow failure and a greater risk of cancers , such as leukaemia .
People who are born with Fanconi anaemia are usually diagnosed in early childhood and rarely survive beyond 30 years old .
In a three - stage procedure , the researchers used gene therapy to fix the faulty DNA in the cells they had taken from patients .
Next , they used a technique called cell reprogramming to convert these cells into healthy stem cells , which are unique in being able to grow into any kind of tissue in the body .
In the final stage of the process , the researchers grew the stem cells in petri dishes into early stage bone marrow cells , which in principle could be injected into patients to treat their condition .
" We have n't cured a human being , but we have cured a cell , " said Juan - Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte , who led the study at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , California .
" [ But ] in theory we could transplant it into a human and cure the disease . "
The feat will raise the hopes of stem cell scientists all over the world who are working on similar techniques to treat other inherited diseases .
The technique is appealing because it uses a patient 's own cells , which would not be rejected by the immune system .
The California team stopped short of injecting the healthy cells back into the six patients because they are not considered safe enough to be transplanted .
The reason is that harmless viruses are used in the procedure , which could cause the cells to turn into tumours .
Scientists are developing alternatives that do not rely on viruses .
" [ This work shows ] it is possible to reprogram skin cells from these patients into stem cells in which the genetic defect has been corrected .
In future it may become possible to transfer the corrected stem cells back into the patient , but much work remains to be done before this can be transferred from the lab bench to the bedside . " said Chris Matthews , professor of molecular genetics at King 's College London .
Chris Mason , professor of regenerative medicine at University College London , added : " There is no doubt that this paper will be the first of many to offer hope for conditions where today there is no real therapy , let alone a cure . "
PIDA is the Python Integrated Development Application .
It is an IDE ( integrated development environment ) written in Python and the GTK + graphical toolkit .
Pida is an IDE , but one that is slightly different from other IDEs .
Rather than attempting to write a set of development tools of its own , Pida uses tools that the developer has available .
In this regards Pida can be used as a framework for putting together your own bespoke IDE .
Although still a young application , Pida can already boast a huge number of features because of the power of some of the tools it integrates .
For example features such as code completion and syntax highlighting are well implemented in Pida 's integrated editors far better than any editor built for a commercial IDE .
Pida currently features :
Full code editing ( syntax highlighting , code completion , automatic indenting , block commenting etc ) Project management , version control management , Python debugger and profiler , GTK + graphical user interface building and rapid application design , Pastebin integration .

The Queen and the Royal Family cost the taxpayer 69 p per person last year - an increase of 3 p , Buckingham Palace accounts showed today .
The total cost of keeping the monarchy increased by £ 1.5 million to £ 41.5 million during the 2008 - 09 financial year .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Palace accounts also showed that the Queen dipped into a reserve fund to boost her Civil List by £ 6 million .
This is the highest amount ever drawn from the reserve which comes from surplus Civil List money accumulated in the 1990s .
The total cost of the Queen 's Civil List - which pays for the running of the Royal Household including staff salaries - was £ 13.9 million in 2008 .
It was made up of £ 7.9 million from the Government and £ 6 million from the reserve .
The boost from the reserve accounted for 43 % of the total .
This prompts speculation as to how much the Queen will ask the Government to increase the Civil List by when the current financial deal runs out in December 2010 .
If she continues drawing on the reserve at the current rate , she will run out of funds by the start of 2012 - the year of her Diamond Jubilee .
The pot of money has gone down from £ 35 million to £ 21 million over the last decade .
The current deal - in which the Queen gets £ 7.9 million a year - was agreed by Sir John Major in 1990 .

RE : Air Hockey Table
Hello ,
I saw your ad for an air hockey table and had a question about it .
My girlfriend tells me has always wanted to have sex on an air hockey table .
Before I shell out $ 150 for this , I just wanted to know if sex on an air hockey table is practical and / or really even worth it .
I told her if she wanted air blowing on her we could just lay on a window fan , but she is insisting that I get an air hockey table .
What do you think ?
Tim

Homebuyers are facing their first rise in mortgage rates for a year in a move by banks and building societies that could extinguish the nascent recovery in the housing market .
Nationwide was one of several leading mortgage lenders that today hiked the cost of its most popular deals , with others likely to follow suit in the coming days .
Banks and building societies are increasing the cost of their fixed - rate mortgages , the type of deal that around 80 % of homebuyers are opting for at the moment .
Nationwide has upped the cost of its fixed - rate deals by up to 0.86 % , and state - owned Northern Rock has raised its five - year fixed rates by 0.2 % , both with effect from tomorrow .
Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol said most , and possibly all , of the part - nationalised Lloyds Banking Group – which includes Halifax , Bank of Scotland , Lloyds TSB and Cheltenham & Gloucester – were expected to increase their fixed rates this weekend or on Monday , " in some cases by quite large amounts " .
Yorkshire Building Society has already hiked the cost of its deals , and Principality Building Society also made changes to its range today .
Boulger warned that if rates rise too far , too fast , " it could very easily nip the recovery in the housing market in the bud " .
Britain's banks are raising mortgage costs after an increase in their own funding driven by government bond yields .
As investors have become more optimistic about the health of the UK economy , they have begun to fret about the return of inflation .
That has prompted them to sell government bonds , known as gilts , whose long - term value is eroded by high inflation .
When the price of gilts falls , their yield – the interest rate the government must pay to borrow – goes up .
Today the yield on 10 - year gilts hit a seven - month high of 4.01 % .
Since many other interest rates across the economy are set with reference to gilt yields , this increase is feeding through to borrowing costs for ordinary families and businesses .
Fears of inflation are rising , because :
• Oil prices have more than doubled , hitting an eight - month high of $ 72 a barrel yesterday ;
• Manufacturing output in the UK increased in April , prompting predictions that the recession is coming to an end ;
• There are fears the Bank of England 's £ 125 bn quantitative easing policy could feed through into rising prices if consumer demand recovers rapidly .
The news that mortgage costs are rising came as the Bank of England announced that up to 1.1 million households have been plunged into negative equity by the property crash .
With prices down by 20 % from their peak in autumn 2007 , research by the Bank published tomorrow suggests that between 700,000 and 1.1 million homeowners now owe more on their mortgage than their house is worth .
The Bank 's nine - member monetary policy committee will be alarmed at the rise in mortgage costs .
After slashing interest rates to just 0.5 % , their lowest level ever , they embarked on the drastic policy of quantitative easing – buying up billions of pounds worth of government bonds – to bring down borrowing costs and boost lending to cash - strapped families and businesses .
There are growing signs that the housing market is experiencing a spring bounce .
Figures issued by the Council of Mortgage Lenders today showed a 16 % jump in mortgage lending to people buying a home during April .
Darren Cook , a spokesman for the financial data firm Moneyfacts , said the price of two - year fixed - rate mortgages had been falling for 12 months , until now .
" The last time mortgage lenders were stumbling over each other trying to increase their fixed - rate mortgages was back in June 2008 .
At that time , inflation was nearly hitting 4 % , " he added .
David Hollingworth at mortgage broker London & Country said a " tipping point " had been reached .
" You have to remember that mortgage rates have been at all - time lows , and at the end of such a period there always comes a tipping point .
It looks as though we 're now there , and all the signs suggest fixed - rate mortgage rates are only heading one way – upwards .
The fear is that once interest rates start rising , they will go up quite rapidly .
When a few lenders start raising rates , the rest of the market are quick to follow . "
History | Ambassador | Testimonials The Vietnam War gave rise to many tragedies , some more familiar than others .
A photograph of a young girl running naked down a road , her skin on fire with napalm , changed the way the world looked at the Vietnam War , and indeed at all wars .
That photograph was seen around the world , and later won a Pulitzer Prize .
The girl in that photograph is Kim Phuc .
Phan Thi Kim Phuc was born and raised in the village of Trang Bang , 30 minutes north of Saigon .
During the Vietnam War , the strategic Route 1 that runs through the village became the main supply road between Saigon and Phnom Penh .
On June 8 , 1972 , an American military advisor coordinated the napalm bombing of Kim 's village by the South Vietnamese .
Nine - year - old Kim fled from a pagoda , where she and her family had been hiding .
Two of her infant cousins did not survive the attack , and Kim was badly burned .
Kim was photographed running down the road , screaming from the burns to her skin .
Nick Ut , the Associated Press photographer who was there to cover the siege , took the photograph of young Kim .
Moved by her pain , he rushed her to a South Vietnamese hospital .
She then spent 14 months recovering in Barsky Hospital , the American hospital in Saigon , where her care was paid for by a private Foundation .
Ut 's photograph of Kim remains one of the most unforgettable images of the Vietnam War.
Kim Phuc was not expected to live .
Third degree burns covered half of her body , and she would require many operations and years of therapy .
After two years , against all odds and with the help of doctors who were committed to her care , she was able to return to her village , where she and her family began to rebuild their lives .
In 1982 , 10 years after the famous photograph was taken , a German photographer located Kim .
In the interim , the Vietnamese Government had subjected her to endless interviews , communist officials had summoned her to Ho Chi Minh City to be used in propaganda films , and Kim had been forced to leave school and move back to her province where , as a " national symbol of war " , she was supervised daily .
In 1986 , Kim seized the opportunity to study in Cuba , but once again her studies were cut short .
She was beset with physical problems , including diabetes , which blurred her vision .
While in Cuba , she met a fellow Vietnamese student , Bui Huy Toan .
They married in 1992 , and spent their honeymoon in Moscow .
Returning to Cuba , the couple defected when their plane stopped to refuel in Gander , Newfoundland .
They settled in Canada with the help of some Quakers .
Her husband , a computer specialist , was able to find employment as a nurse 's aid working with the disabled .
In 1996 , the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund invited Kim to attend the Veterans Day ceremonies at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington , D.C. Kim spoke to a group of several thousand Vietnam War veterans about her experiences after the napalm attack on her village .
She used that opportunity to share with the verterans about how she finally found happiness and freedom after years of pain and suffering ; she spoke about pain and suffering .
She even met a pilot who coordinated the air strike on her village - she forgave him !
During her visit to Washington , DC , she met Ron Gibbs , a Vietnam veteran and a member of the Board of Directors for the Memorial Fund .
They shared their experiences from the war and their hopes for the future .
The idea for the Kim Foundation International was born out of that meeting .
The Foundation is a way for Kim to give something back in return for all the help she received .
It also provides a means for her to promote peace and forgiveness .
Now Mrs. Kim Phuc lives in the Toronto area of Canada with her husband and two sons , Thomas and Stephen .
In 1997 UNESCO named her a Goodwill Ambassador for Peace .
She is also an Honorary Member of Kingston Rotary , an Honorary Member of St. Albert Rotary , a member of the Advisory Board for the Wheelchair Foundation , an Honorary Member of the Canadian Commission for UNESCO , a Member of the Advisory Board of Free Children 's Foundation in Canada , and the World Children 's Center in Atlanta Ga. , USA .
Kim is also a recipient of the Queen 's Golden Jubilee Medal and the 2004 " Order of Ontario " .
History | Ambassador | Testimonials
As a UNESCO ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) Goodwill Ambassador for the Culture of Peace , Kim will spread the message of the need for reconciliation , mutual understanding , dialogue , and negotiation to replace confrontation and violence as a means of settling conflicts .
The culture of peace , as envisioned by UNESCO , seeks to eliminate the root causes of violence by promoting a set of attitudes , values and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing based on principles of freedom , justice , democracy , human rights , tolerance and solidarity .
" Kim Phuc is a living symbol throughout the world of the atrocity of war .
These horrors must be transformed into a symbol of reconciliation world - wide .

What follows are only few of the hundreds of testimonials written or expressed by the many who have attended Kim 's presentations , read her book , seen her on television , read her articles , or heard her on radio .
Throughout the world , Kim has touched the hearts of thousands with her inspirational message .
" Kim Phuc was recently a featured speaker at Mackenzie University , our travelling institution of continuing education .
And to put it mildly , she was a big hit across Canada .
The feedback we received from audience members in all parts of the country closely paralleled my own experience :
Kim makes you think about your country and your life - and appreciate both much more .
Given the subject matter , you might think her presentation would be a ' downer ' .
But , while her life story is an emotional one that tugs at the heartstrings , the impact is intensely and powerfully uplifting .
Kim Phuc is n't a traditional ' motivational speaker ' ; but her presence and her message are highly motivating - in all the right ways .
I could n't recommend her more highly . "
Phil Cunningham
President

" The lights go down , the speaker is introduced , the audience goes quiet and a beautiful young lady walks out on the stage .
For the next few minutes , this lady keeps the audience so mesmerized with her story that you cannot even hear anyone breathe .
Those of you who have not met Kim Phuc personally cannot possibly know the impact that she has on everyone who meets her .
For most of us , the naked little girl running down the street crying is an image of war that will live forever in our memory .
However , the horror of war turns to a warm feeling when you listen to Kim speak about her life and how she has overcome the adversities inflicted by napalm on that day so long ago .
The work that Kim does to help other children of war situations is known throughout the world .
She has travelled thousands of miles to spread her message , and she has a true commitment to her cause .
As an ambassador for her cause , she brings peace and happiness to those she meets and an understanding of forgiveness to all of us .
As she says in her speech , she is no longer running , she is flying !
Your spirit will soar also as you hear Kim 's moving message of her life and how she has overcome many adversities to be one of the most recognized and respected young women in the world today . "
Beryl " Buffy " Sutherland
Rotary International Past District Governor
District 7790
United States of America " I was amazed at Kim 's attitude .
I 'm sure that I have never met anyone who has gone through such trauma , at such an early age , and come out so totally positive and forgiving .
Her presentation reassured me about the strength that we all possess .
When we mix this element with the power of love and forgiveness , miracles can happen . "

" Kim 's presentation at the Royal Canadian Military Institute was very well received .
She told her story of ' The Girl in the Picture ' in a quiet , dignified and very vivid manner .
It touched all in attendance about the horror and waste of those terrible times in her country .
Considerable emotion was visible in that audience , many of whom are veterans .
I thanked Kim for her message and her time with us .
As a veteran of WW2 and the Normandy invasion I commented that Kim went through much more than many of us at that time . "
Andrew Irwin
National Board Naval Officers Association of Canada and Past President - Toronto Branch
" When I heard that Kim was coming I saved up my money for a ticket , I got up early and drove in miles to see and hear her speak .
Listening to her message was something I will never forget .
She is an inspiration for all of us who heard her speak to that large and attentive crowd . "
Comment from a ticket holder at a sold out presentation at Unique Lives and Experiences in Denver USA " I was really pleased to meet Kim and hear her moving message .
I remember that historic photograph .
Her presence and comments were one of the most memorable things that I took away from our International Conference . "
Convention delegate from Uganda " You came to Dartmouth and Halifax to tell people your life story .
Everyone in that packed stadium was touched by your presence .
I had seen your famous picture in various places over the years but had not taken much real notice .
Recently I realized that one of the strongest thoughts I had whenever I saw it was : ' who will take care of that little girl ? '
It created a feeling of helplessness and powerlessness .
Your painful journey through life and to Canada coupled with your Christian message of forgiveness was an inspiration to all who heard and met you that memorable evening . "
Ed Smallhorn Nova Scotia - Canada
" As I watched the presentation , it seemed as though time stood still .
The little girl in that famous picture has turned her life into an incredible success story .
Her passion remains in the soft yet serious tone of her voice .
These pictures need no description .
For many of us , the horror of war has not been felt personally .
It is difficult to imagine the despair anyone would feel .
As a child trapped in war , Kim has found a way to survive and prosper .
Her story should encourage us all to look out for the most innocent of all victims of war children . "
John Hughes

" It is always an honor to be in the company of Kim .
She is an extraordinary woman with an extraordinary story .
" Kim 's Story " is one of tragedy , strength , and forgiveness and each of those elements is reflected in Kim 's warm and caring attitude .
The image portrayed in the famous photo of Kim is forever etched in our minds and our hearts .
Likewise , Kim 's message of helping others , especially innocent children , is one that truly inspires me . "
Bill Kurtis
President of Kurtis Productions
and renowned producer of many A&E Programs
What strikes me the most about Kim is her ability to move past all that she has gone through in order to derive a positive message from so much pain .
As a child Kim was severely injured by an attack that she had no part in inciting .
However , upon meeting Kim it is clear that she holds no resentment , only love .
Kim is truly concerned for those who suffer as she did and has dedicated herself to helping them .
She is an exceptional woman with an incredible message of love and forgiveness . "
Lieutenant Governor Corrine Wood
State of Illinois " Through the alliance between The Kim Foundation International and Save The Children I have had the pleasure of meeting with Kim .
She is an outstanding woman who lacks nothing in the areas of courage , kindness , and charity .
Despite her own suffering , she never seems to focus on herself ; rather , she has taken every opportunity to help others .
I am truly proud to be working with her and her Foundation . "
Charlie McCormick
President of Save The Children " Shortly after the fall of the Communist block , I spent more than one year coordinating a Doctors of the World project in Romania .
Along with our Romanian colleagues , and thanks to a partnership forged between several universities , contributors , and public authorities , we evaluated the health and the educational psychological and social situation of institutionalized children .
Needless to say , we visited some of the dark areas of the totalitarian system , which reminded us of the sheer tragedy of removing a child from his or her natural environment because of family and social problems that cause physical or spiritual suffering .
More importantly , in cooperation with many Romanian and international players , we had the opportunity to participate in the overhaul of Romania 's child and family protection system .
The mission of Doctors of the World Canada is to support the Romanian professionals at the Counselling Centre for the Bucharest Children 's Foundation , with the assistance of the Kim International Foundation .
This mission relies heavily on the belief that the people who have suffered from institutionalized violence , as well as the authorities and professionals , are open to change . "

Joyce 's story expertly covers the foreign policy dimensions of the story as well as the religious freedom issues defended by the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , which defends freedom of worship , and fights improper evangelizing , in the United States Military .
But another aspect is only hinted at in the Newsweek story :
Through the late 1990's and up into the 2008 presidential election , Retired Colonel Jim Ammerman has been engaged in a pattern of seditious incitement against the United States government and has promoted overtly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories of the type that experts who study the relationship between conspiracy theory and right wing violence , such as Political Research Associates Senior Analyst Chip Berlet , suggest feed a cultural climate that can provoke acts of violence that target demonized groups in society .
In a speech he gave in January 1997 during a national speaking tour , broadcast across America on scores of radio and television stations , Jim Ammerman called for the execution of then - President Bill Clinton , for treason .
For over a decade Ammerman , and one of his top chaplains noted in the Newsweek story , James Linzey , have aggressively incited the American anti-government militia movement -- sometimes by promoting overtly racialist , anti-immigrant conspiracy theories .
As Joyce 's story describes , Jim Ammerman and his chaplain endorsement agency are unabashedly Christian supremacist , and that posture often spills over into domestic politics :
Department of Defense policy says that chaplain - endorsing agencies should " express willingness " for their chaplains to cooperate with other religious traditions .
But Schulcz claims that Ammerman , who is not a paid government official , and his chaplains , who are , are entitled to say whatever they want unless they 're advocating insurrection .
On this point , MRFF charges they come close .
Ammerman and chaplain Linzey have espoused conspiracy theories about " Satanic forces " at work in the U.S. government facilitating a military takeover by foreign troops ; Ammerman even appears in a video favored by militia groups titled The Imminent Military Takeover of the USA .
In 2008 , Ammerman implied that four presidential candidates should be " arrested , quickly tried and hanged " for not voting to designate English America 's official language , and speculated that Barack Obama would be assassinated as a secret Muslim .
[ note : Ammerman appeared in two videos with similar titles , " Imminent Military Takeover of the United States " , based on a 1996 speaking tour , and " Imminent Military Takeover of the United States II " , based in a 1997 speaking tour . ]
As Kathryn Joyce frames the foreign policy aspect of her Newsweek story ,
Ever since former President George W. Bush referred to the war on terror as a " crusade " in the days after the September 11 attacks , many have charged that the United States was conducting a holy war , pitting a Christian America against the Muslim world ...
A May article in Harper 's by Jeff Sharlet illustrated a military engaged in an internal battle over religious practice .
Then came news about former Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's Scripture - themed briefings to President Bush that paired war scenes with Bible verses ...
Later in May , Al - Jazeera broadcast clips filmed in 2008 showing stacks of Bibles translated into Pashto and Dari at the U.S. air base in Bagram and featuring the chief of U.S. military chaplains in Afghanistan , Lt. Col .
Gary Hensley , telling soldiers to " hunt people for Jesus . "
At the center of the Bible distribution scheme was Jim Ammerman who , through his military chaplain endorsing agency , The Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , wields power , over his chaplains , to terminate their jobs by pulling his agency 's endorsement .
All active duty military chaplains must carry such endorsements as a precondition to their employment .
You probably do n’t know much about Sheila Bair , but she is looking out for you , and that is why the big guys on Wall Street and their allies in the Obama administration are out to get her .
Bair is the Republican whom President Obama reappointed to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , but she is protecting the interest of taxpayers as no Democrat has in this administration , and she needs your support .
Huge financial decisions are being made by this government , involving trillions in future obligations of U.S. taxpayers , and Bair has been a rare effective voice for the interests of ordinary folk .
Once an aide to then - Sen. Robert Dole ( R - Kan. ) , Bair was appointed by the first President Bush to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and reappointed by President Clinton .
Later she was named head of the FDIC by President George W. Bush .
Throughout her public service she has proved to be a vigilant protector of consumer interests .
Bair angered people on both sides of the political aisle by repeatedly raising questions about the radical deregulation policies that unfettered Wall Street ’s greed .
She has been a great watchdog of the public ’s interest .
That was acknowledged recently when she and former CFTC Chair Brooksley Born , the prescient hero who warned most clearly of the coming debacle , each won a John F. Kennedy Library “ Profile in Courage ” Award .
Bair has continued to show courage in her work .
As The Wall Street Journal noted : “ The FDIC ’s influence has grown in the past year because of Ms. Bair ’s willingness to challenge her peers , as well as her agency ’s central role responding to the financial crisis .
Ms. Bair warned about the housing crisis before many of her colleagues . ”
The current point of conflict between Bair and the hacks who got us into this mess — and who have resurfaced as the key players running the bailout — is financial industry accountability .
She started demanding that accountability last fall when the Bush administration began the TARP bailout and she continues to do so under Obama .
Throughout , her nemesis has been Timothy Geithner , former head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and now secretary of the treasury .
The most glaring example of this conflict has been the battle over the management of Citigroup , the “ too big to fail ” banking conglomerate that became the largest in the world thanks to changes in the law advocated by Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin .
Rubin then left the government to become chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup , a post he occupied as it made risky bets on derivatives and incurred record losses .
Citigroup was saved from oblivion by a plan engineered by Geithner , whom Rubin had successfully pushed for the top job at the New York Fed .
That plan , endorsed by the Bush administration , left the U.S. government pumping $ 50 billion into Citigroup and guaranteeing an additional $ 300 billion of its “ toxic ” holdings .
In return , we taxpayers were to receive preferred stock with the promise of significant interest payments , but now the terms have been changed .
Thanks to Geithner ’s intervention , Citigroup will be allowed to convert half of the government ’s preferred stock into almost worthless common stock .
Enter Bair , who has been insisting , over Geithner ’s objection , that major changes occur in the leadership of Citigroup to give the taxpayers a better chance to get some of that money back .
She has an obligation to make that demand because the FDIC is a part guarantor not only of Citigroup banking deposits but also of the $ 300 billion toxic assets package .
In her role of protecting the taxpayer interest , she has been pressing for replacing Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit or at least more fully overseeing his performance .
He took over Citigroup in December 2007 , and while he now claims to be committed to reforming his bank ’s operation , as The Wall Street Journal concluded , “ For his first year on the job , Mr. Pandit insisted Citigroup ’s business model was basically sound . ”
Bair did n’t believe that the model was sound , and she has doubts about the ability of Pandit and other top banking executives to change their high - roller ways .
As David Weidner put it on MarketWatch , “ By threatening the things most precious to bank executives — their pay and jobs — she has sent a clear message to the industry :
Your bailout is not without a price .
We expect results . ”
But , he added ominously : “ Bair ’s hardball tactics are n’t just irritating bankers , though .
She ’s also making enemies of career bureaucrats and Wall Street sympathizers .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner … reportedly tried to push out Bair before he took office in December . ”
Rest assured , if Bair loses out and Geithner has his way , Citigroup ’s CEO and the other Wall Street moguls will be thrilled .
But the public will have lost its most effective advocate .
this happens to almost every bankrupt company
if a company goes bankrupt , buy enough that you can afford right away ( the day of ) people will want to off load ( dumb ) and then you make like a bandit .
give the stock two to three weeks , the stock price will rise ; usually double due to legal proceedings or ( in GM 's case ) bailout hopes .
there will always be someone who'll buy your stock when your ready to sell just be sure to sell before it normalizes again ( i think 200 - 300 % increase is the proper sell time , as is the case with GM ) I bought $ 20,000 of lehman brothers two years ago when they went bankrupt AT .03 A SHARE !
when the bailout talks happened , the stock rose to .50 !
now I have an S63 .
Those who bought into the slogans " Hope " and " Change " last fall should have read the fine print .
We were warned .
Over and over during the campaign for the presidency Barack Obama made it clear that " withdrawal " from Iraq on his flexible 16 - month timetable meant only the removal of " combat forces . "
He has also made it clear all along that " combat forces " means whatever he wants it to mean  until he decides to change his mind .
At least he ’s honest .
On Friday , Obama announced in a speech at Camp Lejeune that 16 months have become 18 , and that 50,000 soldiers and Marines will be continuing the occupation until 2012 under the guise of training Iraqi army and police forces , " counter - terrorism , " and force protection .
No mention was made of the largest embassy one nation has ever built in another , the future use of air power , or the 100,000 - plus contractors and mercenaries still inside the country .
These glaring omissions , along with the announced intention to maintain 50,000 - plus troops in the country after the summer of 2010 , add up to nothing but a ruse , a loophole for mission creep right back to full - blown occupation .
Since many of the troops scheduled to leave the country will only be headed off to another war zone in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the entire exercise may end up amounting to nothing but an escalation of the Afghanistan occupation while the door is left wide open for more troops to be sent back into Iraq .
The alleged need to leave " counter - terrorism " forces in country is a farce .
" Al - Qaeda in Iraq " only came into existence in opposition to the U.S. invasion and occupation , and it never amounted to anything but the smallest percentage of the Sunni insurgency , which tolerated them only as allies against the occupation .
Long before the " surge " of 2007 - 2008 and the so - called Awakening movement surrounding those insurgents eventually put on the payroll by Gen.
Petraeus , Iraqi Sunnis had decided they had had enough and marginalized al - Qaeda in Iraq virtually out of existence .
The idea that without U.S. troops there , foreign jihadists would be able to take over and use their land as a safe haven to provoke the United States into invading again is beyond far - fetched .
Worse is the belief that leaving " counter - terrorism " forces inside the country will make terrorism less likely .
It was , of course , in part , the blockade and ritual bombing of Iraq from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s that provoked the 9/11 attacks on America in the first place , and it has been the occupation that has provoked the hundreds of suicide bombings in Iraq over the last six years .
Obama ’s claim that the mission is now changing from combat to training the Iraqi military to take our soldiers ’ place ought to be considered no different from George W. Bush ’s claim , when debuting his " Strategy for Victory " in December 2005 , that " as they stand up , we ’ll stand down . "
It was a sham to delay leaving then , and it remains so .
The U.S. " embassy " in Baghdad  a monument to the hubris that gripped America ’s imperial court as it rushed to launch this war , and a symbol of their contempt for the democracy they proclaim so loudly to uphold and deliver to the world  is now the size of a small city - state within the heart of Baghdad .
Its construction alone is proof of the widely held belief in the American establishment that they have stolen Iraq fair and square and intend to hold onto it until the last helicopter leaves the roof .
Which brings us to " force protection . "
This is the most obvious excuse to leave infantry divisions in the country beyond the summer of 2010 .
In the speech , the president said he remained committed to the status of forces agreement ( SOFA ) and its mandate for the withdrawal of the entire U.S. military presence by the end of 2011 , but if the withdrawal agreement remains the law up to 2012 and all forces are removed , it will have been at the insistence of the Iraqi people and government despite all of the best efforts of the empire to find a reason to stay .
Gareth Porter ’s recent series for IPS News has examined the push by Secretary of Defense Gates and Generals Petraeus and Odierno to convince President Obama to extend the timetable for the combat troops ’ withdrawal and begin renaming infantry divisions as " force protection " for the long haul .
He does n’t seem to have required too much convincing .
The generals seem to be betting that the SOFA can be renegotiated indefinitely , as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki will certainly , they believe , ask them to stay and help him maintain his grip on power .
However , the War Party ’s ability to count on Maliki to backtrack on the withdrawal agreement in favor of prolonging the occupation may be in real doubt .
Middle East corespondent Patrick Cockburn of England ’s Independent newspaper reports that Maliki and his Da’wa Party ’s position has increased relative to other major Shi’ite factions led by the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army , and that the day when the Green Zone government is able to maintain itself in power without U.S. help may have already come .
When Cockburn first broke the story of the negotiations over the SOFA early last summer , the Bush administration was pushing to keep 58 bases in Iraq indefinitely , but over the course of the rest of the year , Maliki stuck to his position and forced Bush to agree to the 2011 timeline for complete withdrawal of all forces .
As Iraqi public opinion remains in opposition to the occupation by supermajorities , whatever legitimacy Maliki does have among them is mostly a function of his resistance to U.S. demands .
There seems to be little incentive for him to back down now , though NBC News is reporting that the Pentagon wants to stay for another 15 - 20 years and is already negotiating the option of retaining a permanent airbase near Kirkuk , an idea floated by Secretary of State Clinton during the presidential campaign last year , as though the SOFA never existed .
Despite all the propaganda about how " the surge worked , " no one seems to notice that most of the political benchmarks the surge was supposed to accomplish by October 2007 have yet to be achieved , and that a temporary strategy of buying off  and arming up  every faction can only be temporary .
Whether the Sunni tribal councils and the Shi’ite - dominated Iraqi government can work out a long - term power - sharing deal remains to be seen , as does the fate of Kirkuk and many other parts of Iraq that are still in dispute .
The " surge " has done nothing to resolve these problems .
Any violence over these outstanding issues will undoubtedly serve as an excuse to abandon the withdrawal and continue the war indefinitely .
Many Iraqis watching Obama ’s speech may have been surprised to hear what a great favor the U.S. has done them by invading and destroying their country .
They may be sorry to find out there ’s more help where that came from .
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
A top Taliban commander has issued a new threat to foreign aid workers , saying that under the insurgent group 's new " constitution " they will execute them as spies or hold them in exchange for the release of Taliban fighters .
Taliban militants pose with their weapons as they drive their car in Wardak province .

In an exclusive telephone interview Friday night with CNN , Mohammed Ibrahim Hanafi said the Taliban intelligence wing was actively gathering information on foreign aid workers .
" If we get someone , that is how we will deal with it under our new constitution , " he said .
He added that he was telling " Afghan brothers not to work with NGOs . "
In the 15 - minute interview , arranged by an intermediary for CNN , Hanafi repeated the Taliban 's pledge to keep girls out of public schools .
" Our law is still the same old law which was in place during our rule in Afghanistan , " he said .
" Mullah Mohammad Omar was our leader and he is still our head and leader and so we will follow the same law as before . "
" In my opinion , " he added , " Taliban are n't allowing girls to go to schools because Taliban want women to preserve their respect by staying in their homes , not to work as laborers for others . "
Dozens of crimes across the country , especially acid attacks , have marred the opening of the new school year in Afghanistan .
Afghan girls have been burned and scared randomly with acid as punishment for going to school .
More than 600 schools did not open this year because of security issues , according to the Afghanistan Education Ministry .
Watch what females face in Afghanistan »
The schools that did open , however , remain defiant .
Young women admitted to CNN being fearful but also said they are determined to get an education and better their lives .
It is a sentiment echoed by their principal , a 35 - year veteran of Afghanistan 's girls schools .
" I am asking those who close schools and throw acid on girls to let the children of this country go to school because it 's crime to close the schools , a crime against the children of this country , " said Safia Hayat , principal of the Zarghona Girls School in Kabul .
Hanafi , meanwhile , went on to discuss possible reconciliation talks with the Afghan government .
" I do n't think there can be any discussion of peace until the the foreigners leave Afghanistan , " he said referring to the presence of coalition troops .
While he seemed to confirm that some reconciliation talks were ongoing , Hanafi also said he wondered what kind of peace was possible as long as Afghans are still dying in NATO bombardments .
Hanafi described himself as a commander in the southern province of Helmand , but announced a new Taliban offensive in the north was about to begin and that he would be playing a key role there .

FOOTNOTE : Some of you who know of my opposition to the war in Iraq may be taken aback by this post .
And that I support our effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan against al Qaeda and the Taliban .
You should know that I ’m neither a pacifist nor do I oppose all war , a rote response .
I grew up within the boundaries of World War 2 .
My family and my best friend fought as soldiers and guerillas against Fascism in many of the theatres of that war – and in the hills of Italy .
I have always supported the just cause of wars of national liberation against colonial armies – against all the Western nations who took false pride in their control of foreign lands .
I respect the comradeship of arms .
Some portion of that – from the time of Sun Tzu to the Marine Corp which turned away from official American racism – stands outside the dirty little world of politics .

Ozier Muhammad / The New York Times
Updated President Obama said on Wednesday that he is seeking to block the release of photographs that depict American military personnel abusing captives in Iraq and Afghanistan , worrying that the images could “ further inflame anti-American opinion . ”
As he left the White House to fly to Arizona for an evening commencement address , Mr. Obama briefly explained his abrupt reversal on releasing the photographs .
He said the pictures , which he has reviewed , “ are not particularly sensational , but the conduct did not conform with the Army manual . ”
He did not take questions from reporters , but said disclosing the photos would have “ a chilling effect ” on future attempts to investigate detainee abuse .
The president ’s decision marks a sharp reversal from a decision made last month by the Pentagon , which agreed in a case with the American Civil Liberties Union to release photographs showing incidents at Abu Ghraib and a half - dozen other prisons .
At the time , the president signed off on the decision , saying he agreed with releasing the photos .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said that the president met last week “ with his legal team and told them that he did not feel comfortable with the release of the D.O.D. photos because he believes their release would endanger our troops . ”
Mr. Obama has examined a sampling of the photographs within the last two weeks , Mr. Gibbs said , as he “ spent some time reflecting on ” the case to make the decision that was announced Wednesday .
Mr. Obama advised his top military commanders about his decision in a meeting on Tuesday at the White House .
Several military officials had argued against the immediate release of the photographs , saying such action could harm American troops in the field .
“ The president strongly believes that the release of these photos , particularly at this time , would only serve the purpose of inflaming the theaters of war , jeopardizing U.S. forces , ” the official said , “ and making our job more difficult in places like Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
Officials said that one argument made to delay releasing the pictures was that the missions in both Iraq and Afghanistan were entering risky , new phases .
In Iraq , American combat forces are withdrawing from urban areas and are reducing their numbers nationwide .
In Afghanistan , more than 20,000 new troops are flowing in to combat an insurgency that has grown in potency .
At a Defense budget hearing on Capitol Hill later on Wednesday afternoon , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates indicated that the White House might appeal the decision to the Supreme Court .
“ I believe that ’s under consideration , ” Mr. Gates told the House Armed Services Committee .
Mr. Gates also said that he had changed his opinion about releasing the photographs because of the strong views of his commanders .
“ Both General McKiernan and General Odierno have expressed very serious reservations about this and their very great worry that release of these photographs will cost American lives , ” Mr. Gates said .
Geoff Morrell , the Pentagon press secretary , said earlier that Generals Odierno , McKiernan and also David Petraeus “ have all voiced real concern about this .
Particularly in Afghanistan , this is the last thing they need . ”
Mr. Gates shared the concerns of his commanders about the impact of the photo release on the troops and the battlefield , and had had a “ multitude of conversations ” with Mr. Obama on the issue .
The Pentagon ’s decision to release the pictures came after the A.C.L.U. prevailed at the Federal District Court level and before a panel of the Second Circuit .
The photographs were set to be released on May 28 .
But as that date approached , a growing sense of unease among military officials was expressed to Mr. Gates , who relayed the concerns to the president .
Many also recalled the Abu Ghraib photographs , showing prisoners naked or in degrading positions , sometimes with Americans posing smugly nearby , caused an uproar in the Arab world and concerns within the military that the actions of a relatively few service members had tainted the entire forces .
In this more recent case , the A.C.L.U. argued that disclosing the pictures was “ critical for helping the public understand the scope and scale of prisoner abuse as well as for holding senior officials accountable for authorizing or permitting such abuse , ” said Amrit Singh , who argued the case on behalf of the group before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan .
The A.C.L.U. sharply criticized the president ’s decision .
In a statement , its executive director , Anthony D. Romero said :
“ The Obama administration ’s adoption of the stonewalling tactics and opaque policies of the Bush administration flies in the face of the president ’s stated desire to restore the rule of law , to revive our moral standing in the world and to lead a transparent government .
This decision is particularly disturbing given the Justice Department ’s failure to initiate a criminal investigation of torture crimes under the Bush administration .
“ It is true that these photos would be disturbing ; the day we are no longer disturbed by such repugnant acts would be a sad one .
In America , every fact and document gets known – whether now or years from now .
And when these photos do see the light of day , the outrage will focus not only on the commission of torture by the Bush administration but on the Obama administration ’s complicity in covering them up .
Any outrage related to these photos should be due not to their release but to the very crimes depicted in them .
Only by looking squarely in the mirror , acknowledging the crimes of the past and achieving accountability can we move forward and ensure that these atrocities are not repeated . ”
A senior administration official said that the president met last week with his legal team and reached the conclusion that the interests of the military and the U.S. government would not be served by releasing the photos .
“ The president would be the last to excuse the actions depicted in these photos , ” the administration official said .
“ That is why the Department of Defense investigated these cases , and why individuals have been punished through prison sentences , discharges , and a range of other punitive measures . ”
The next step was not immediately clear .
White House officials said a court filing was due on Wednesday , which would outline the administration ’s legal approach .
During the court case , defense officials had fought the release of the photographs , connected with investigations between 2003 and 2006 , on the grounds that the release could endanger American military personnel overseas and that the privacy of detainees would be violated .
But the Second Circuit , in upholding a lower court ruling , said the public interest involved in release of the pictures outweighed a vague , speculative fear of danger to the American military or violation of the detainees ’ privacy .
One Pentagon official involved in the discussion said the photos show detainees in humiliating positions , but stressed that they were not as provocative as pictures of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib .
The official said the photos show detainee nudity , and that some include images of detainees shackled for transfer .
Other photographs show American military personnel with weapons drawn and pointed at detainees in what another official said had the appearance of “ a war trophy . ”
One argument made by Pentagon and military officials who oppose the release is that they do not contribute to public knowledge of American policy , as might the release of other memos by the Office of the Legal Counsel .
One example cited in internal discussions was the series of riots that followed publication of cartoons by Danish newspapers that were viewed as hostile and insulting to Islam .
The release of these detainee photographs , Pentagon and military officials said , would only serve to provoke outrage and , in particular , might be used by violent extremists to stoke attacks and recruit suicide bombers .
Military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were said to be particular targets of such attacks , but officials said that civilian targets might be chosen by extremists , as well .
In a letter dated April 23 , Lev L. Dassin , the acting United States Attorney in this case , wrote to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District , to say that the Pentagon had agreed to release 44 photographs involved in the case , plus ” a substantial number of other images ” gathered by Army investigators .

It was a modern twist on the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale as a 9 - year - old lost hiker who had been separated from his family on Saturday used techniques he saw on the television reality show " Man vs. Wild " to leave clues for searchers who eventually found the boy Sunday morning .
A trail of clues left by Grayson Wynne , who was lost in the woods in Daggett County overnight Saturday , led to his successful rescue Sunday morning by two searchers on horseback , said Karen Peterson Daggett County Sheriff 's office spokeswoman .
Grayson , a resident of Heber City , became separated from his family while on a 4 - mile hike to Daggett Lake Saturday afternoon .
" I was really scared , " Grayson said Sunday night .
" But ' Man vs. Wild ' tells you how to survive all different terrains . "
Searchers were called out Saturday evening , including the Daggett County Search and Rescue team , Uintah County sheriff 's personnel and volunteers on horses , mules and on foot .
Teams searched through the night without success and were joined Sunday morning by a Utah Department of Public Safety helicopter and a Daggett County bloodhound team .
Using survival strategies shown in the show , Grayson said he tied pieces of his rain parka to trees as he hiked hoping they would help someone find him more easily .
Grayson 's mother , Kimberly Wynne , said her son had been hiking back to the family 's camper with a cousin when he fell behind and strayed onto a different trail .
When family members noticed Grayson was missing , they began a search , but once dusk neared they contacted emergency personal for help .
" I climbed a pine tree to see if I could see anyone , but I did n't , " Grayson said .
" So I just kept following the river . "
In a statement released Sunday , Peterson said the first clue in the search — a granola bar wrapper — was found Saturday night about 300 yards from the trail the family had been hiking .
Early Sunday morning , a small footprint was discovered near a creek about 400 yards from the spot where the wrapper was discovered .
Farther up the stream , searchers found the black backpack the boy had been carrying .
Kimberly
Wynne said that when rescuers found the backpack , she and her husband were devastated .
" He had his sleeping bag , snacks and an extra jacket in his backpack , " Kimberly said .
" It was cold out and we worried how he 'd manage without it . "
Peterson said the boy , who had spent the night under a log , had cold , wet feet but was in good health and spirits when found .
Search teams concluded the boy was following the creek based on the layout of items they found and concentrated efforts on that area .
Two searchers on horses , Dave Potter and Rusty Burnside of McKinnon , Wyo. , found Grayson at around 10 a.m. in a meadow near the stream .
He was waving strips he had torn from a yellow rain slicker hoping to get the attention of the helicopter he heard flying overhead .
" I 'm just very humbled , " Kimberly Wynne said .
" There were times I was worried Grayson would n't make it and I would n't ever see him again , and I 'm just humbled that I can . "
" I was just really happy to see the horses .
I missed my parents a lot , " Grayson said .
" I almost broke into tears when I saw them , but I did n't . "
When Grayson was reunited with his father , he greeted him with the words , " Happy Father 's Day . "

From scientists to everyday people acting as “ Citizen Scientists , ” people all over the United States are starting to find evidence of how climate change is starting to affect the harbingers of spring .

Interviewee : Richard Primack , Boston University

Spring Fever
Of Walden Pond , writer and philosopher Henry David Thoreau wrote , “ One attraction in coming to the woods to live was that I should have leisure and opportunity to see the Spring come in . ”
But , Thoreau did more than write and wonder , he took meticulous notes on when various flowers bloomed , birds arrived and the ice on Walden Pond melted .
More than 150 years later , researchers are using Thoreau ’s records to gather evidence of how the climate has warmed in the area of Walden Pond , in Concord , Massachusetts , a few miles from Boston .
Spring Ahead
Richard Primack , conservation biologist at Boston University , says , “ The result of our analysis shows that plants are now flowering one week earlier than in Thoreau ’s time . ”
Like Thoreau , Primack makes repeated visits to Walden Pond .
He says , “ We ( are ) comparing when plants were first in flower in Thoreau ’s time and then seeing when they were flowering … today . ”
While Thoreau ’s records are the oldest regarding plant flowering times in the area , they are not the only records .
Primack notes how in the late 1800s , local shopkeeper and amateur botanist Alfred Hosmer looked at the first flowering time of more than 500 plant species .
Primack , who writes textbooks in the field of conservation biology , noticed that the examples he was using for his books , in his words , “ seemed to be from very far away . ”
That led him to start searching for local evidence of climate change .
Primack says the researchers started looking for old records , “ So we started going to all different kinds of small scientific gatherings that we have in the Boston area . ”
They soon realized that Thoreau had keep records and , says Primack , “ We realized that this was probably the most outstanding set of records that we could find . “
Primack ’s research is also showing a change in the kind of plants found near Concord from those found in Thoreau ’s time .
He says they realized that " about one quarter of the plants that Thoreau had observed … were no longer present in Concord . ”
Working with a group of Harvard researchers , including Professor Charles Davis , Primack says they found that “ species that had very flexible flowering times and presumably very flexible times for leafing out and starting their life cycle earlier , were the species which were tending to persist in Concord . ”
He adds that shows that “ the effects of warming temperatures are already having an impact on the flora of Concord . ”
Primack says people who keep records of flowering times and bird arrivals where they live can , after a few years , also spot evidence of climate change causing spring to arrive earlier .
He notes that a woman now living near Boston has for several decades tracked when the birds arrive at her feeders , and that some species that migrate from the mid-Atlantic states are arriving “ sometimes as much as several weeks earlier . ”
He adds there will be temperature changes everywhere in the United States , and that , “ This is something that everybody will be able to see …if they start keeping diaries now . ”
These differences do n’t happen every year , which is why a diary yields a better long - term record than memory .
It also illustrates the confusion that some people have between weather and climate .
Primack explains , " Weather is really the day - to - day variation that we experience in terms of temperature and rainfall , snow , dry conditions ; and climate is really the long - term averages of these things . ”
He adds , there were warm years and cold years in Thoreau ’s time , just the same way there are warmer years and colder years today .
But , it ’s just we have much more of these warmer years now than there were during Thoreau ’s time .
This research appeared the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , online for the week of October 27 , 2008 , and was funded by the National Science Foundation , with additional support from a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship and a fellowship from the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University .

There 's something about grilling food outdoors that 's both exhilarating and terrifying .
It 's great to commune with your food in such a straight - up way , but what if it goes wrong ?
We 're here to help overcome your fear of the flame , or step up your grilling game , with these 10 techniques .

10 . DIY marinades
Advertisement
Not every cut can be filet mignon , and some meats , like pork , almost always deserve a lengthy dip in some flavor - infusing sweet and salty stuff .
Your grocery store wants to sell you a 12 oz .
bottle of sickly - sweet stuff for a hefty markup .
But you 've got oil , acids , and flavoring agents at home , so learn to make a basic marinade , and open up your grill to a whole cabinet of ideas .
You wo n't turn super - tough meat into tender tournadoes , but you 'll learn a lot about how to impart flavor to big , seemingly impenetrable cuts of the good stuff .
9 . Steak improvement through salt
It makes your grandmother cry , but totally covering cheap , firm meat with salt , especially cheaper cuts of steak , just an hour before grilling or otherwise cooking is like giving it a really , really deep Shiatsu rubdown .
The salt you cover the surface with — and then wipe off , rinse , and pat dry — denaturizes the long protein strands and mixes up the moisture spread in your steak .
That turns them , in the Steamy Kitchen blog 's words , from cheap " choice " steak into Gucci " Prime " steak .
8. Chill soda , beer , or wine in two minutes
Waiting for meat to cook leaves you with a good amount of time to stand around and , well , drink something .
But what if you forgot to drop your Coke / Sam Adams / Pinot grigio in the cooler or fridge before you cranked up the coals ?
Mythbuster Adam Savage , one of our favorite interviewees , explains a last - minute chilling technique at Metafilter : Spin it around in some heavily salted ice water .
Savage claims it 's based in science instead of backyard lore , and I believe him — it 's amazed many a dinner party host with a " I forgot to " dilemma .

7 . Easy grill cleaning
Advertisement
Maybe you 're pulling out the grilling can for the first time this weekend , and ... eee-yuck .
Here 's what you do .
Swipe off whatever big , grungy stuff you can with a stiff ( preferably wire ) brush and then toss it in your oven on self - clean .
Now that a majority of the tough stuff is off , or at least loosened , you probably wo n't have to swing for any specialty tools — a wad of aluminum foil can suffice .
For light , between - meal cleaning , rubbing a face - down half onion on a heated grill is an eco-friendly way to get in and around the bars without burning your hands or leaving non-compatible scents for your food .

6 . Use your broiler as a backup
Advertisement
Unless you live in Hawaii , you really can't count on the weather to hold for your grilling just because you bought buns and paper plates .
If it 's just a drizzle and you can make do with the garage door open , go to it .
If the weather or temperature really put a crimp in your style , or you just lack for grill space , consider braising and browning with your broiler .
Slow - cooking the food in liquid , then crisping the exterior with a quick broil , gives you surprisingly grill - like results .
For big groups or days when it just does n't seem like standing outside is feasible , consider the tiny grill your already own in your kitchen .
5 . Get started with smoking
Advertisement
There exists a comfortable middle ground between having spent a summer working for the barbecue kings of Kansas City and just wanting a little hickory flavor in your food .
Hank Shaw , who 's one serious meat fan , knows exactly where that sweet spot .
Using just two grocery - store - standard aluminum pans and some wood chips , he turns a kettle grill into a smoker , one that turns out certifiably tasty ribs with real smoke flavor .
Like any barbecue exercise , the real secret ingredients are time , patience , and a tasty rub or sauce .
4 . Make your own BBQ sauce
Advertisement
You 've already put the time and care into tending to your flame , your meat , and your sides , so why settle for a bottle of stuff found next to the ketchup , laced with corn syrup ?
The BBQ Recipe Secrets blog runs down three basic sauces , covering the traditional tomato sauce , a Carolina - esque vinegar version , and a basic mustard variant .
We 've made this tomato sauce template and been happy to tweak it in different ways , which you can , too .

3 . Use a cheat sheet
Advertisement
We like Real Simple 's grid - style grilling cheat sheet , as it provides both basic , reassuring timings for a standard grill that wo n't leave anyone with undercooked food , and wo n't turn out dried - out cinders or hockey pucks , either .
It also helps you arrange items across your cooking surface , as you move items from direct flame heat to indirect , ambient cooking .
Got another favorite , printable guide ?
Link it for everyone in the comments .
2 . Know when meat is done
Advertisement
Unless you 've got a serious instant - read thermometer , it 's a pain to keep stabbing your meal - to - be , or , even worse , cut it open , to determine just when it 's just at the edge of safe to eat .
Skip the torture and use your hands .
By touching your thumb to each of your fingers , and then pressing on your thumb muscle as it changes firmness , you 'll get an idea of how your steak should feel , moving from rare to well done as your thumb muscle moves from your index to your pinky finger .
Whole chickens are a similar matter of intuitive touch , or , actually , a twist of the chicken leg .
If the leg wo n't move , it 's not quite ready — you want there to be a slight amount of tension , and then feel the joints release as you apply soft pressure .
1. Perfect burgers
Advertisement
We asked and our commenters responded about what makes the perfect grilled burger :
Good meat , preferably ground while you watch , kept at room temperature right before grilling , and not pressed and overly handled .
We 'd just add that you should n't try to compress your homemade patties into chain - restaurant - style discs , and that seasoning your patties with salt and pepper right before they hit the heat makes a big difference .
Advertisement
Our list covers a lot of what the average griller would cook up for their friends or family , but we 're certainly open to suggestions — especially vegetarian ideas and technique suggestions .
And be sure to check out last year 's guide to becoming the memorial day grill master for more techniques and basic starter tips .
Many drivers these days tend to spend a lot of money buying alloy wheels for their vehicles .
Whether it was because of their looks or due to technical reasons , alloy wheels have long been a popular option among drivers .
However , steel wheels remain to be more in demand among car owners up to this day and age .
Steel and alloy wheels are among the two most common types of car wheels .
There are still many other types such as carbon fiber although those are somewhat rare .
The primary difference between steel and alloy wheels lie in terms of their appearance , …

ROCKVILLE , Md. — A Maryland woman has been indicted on charges of killing two adopted daughters and storing their bodies in her freezer .
State ’s Attorney John McCarthy says 43 - year - old Renee Bowman will face murder and child abuse charges in the deaths of the two girls and abuse of her surviving daughter .
The case began in September 2008 when Bowman ’s 7 - year - old daughter jumped out a window and was found in their Calvert County neighborhood .
The family lived in Montgomery County between 2005 and 2007 .
Investigators believe that ’s where Bowman killed the girls and that ’s where a grand jury indicted her on those charges .
The girls were adopted in the District of Columbia .
Bowman continued collecting payments from a D.C. agency after their deaths .

( New York ) - Iran 's paramilitary Basij are carrying out brutal nighttime raids , destroying property in private homes and beating civilians in an attempt to stop nightly protest chants , Human Rights Watch said today .
Human Rights
Watch also said the Iranian authorities are confiscating satellite dishes from private homes to prevent citizens from seeing foreign news .
" While most of the world 's attention is focused on the beatings in the streets of Iran during the day , the Basijis are carrying out brutal raids on people 's apartments during the night , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" Witnesses are telling us that the Basijis are trashing entire streets and even neighborhoods as well as individual homes trying to stop the nightly rooftop protest chants . "
Since the onset of protests against the disputed presidential election results on June 12 , 2009 , residents throughout Tehran and in other cities in Iran have carried out nightly rooftop protest chants of " God is Great " ( Allahu Akbar ) and other similar slogans .
The nighttime shouting of such slogans at designated hours is a powerful form of protest in Iran , as it was one of the emblematic forms of protests during the Iranian revolution 30 years ago , which toppled the ruling Pahlavi monarchy and led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic .
Opposition leaders had asked their supporters to chant these slogans as a form of peaceful protest .
With the increasingly severe crackdown on the current street protests in Iran appearing to make large - scale daytime protests impossible , the nightly chanting has become one of the few remaining forms of mass public protests against the disputed results of the June 12 presidential election .
A middle - aged resident from Vanak neighborhood gave Human Rights Watch an overview of his participation each day in the protests .
He explained that by June 22 , virtually the only form of protest still available to him was to shout slogans from his rooftop at night .
But then the Basiji came to attack his neighborhood .
" On June 22 , while we were shouting ‘ Allahu Akbar ' from the rooftops , the only form of protests we could still undertake , the Basiji entered our neighborhood and started firing live rounds into the air , in the direction of the buildings from which they believe the shouting of ‘ Allahu Akbar ' is coming from .
I did n't see any rounds hitting our buildings .
Shortly thereafter , my cousin arrived at our apartment .
He was very shaken .
The Basijis had entered their house in Yousef Abad neighborhood , and they had destroyed their doors and destroyed cars in the street .
" There are many things happening that are n't being reported [ in the media ] .
In every neighborhood of Tehran , people are talking about how the Basijis and other security services are coming into their houses and are terrorizing people for shouting ‘ Allahu Akbar ' from the rooftops , and for congregating . "
A second witness , a woman from the affluent Velenjak neighborhood in northern Tehran , gave a similar account of Basiji attacks in her neighborhood on the night of June 23 :
" Last night [ June 23 ] , the Basijis entered our neighborhood to intimidate those who were shouting ‘ Allahu Akbar ' from their rooftops .
They started kicking down doors , and when they could n't succeed , they would climb over the garden walls and open the interior doors .
When they entered the homes , they beat the residents .
The neighbors took to cursing the Basijis and throwing stones at them to divert them from beating the residents , but then the Basijis attacked those neighbors ' houses and tried to enter them . "
A third witness told Human Rights Watch how he had witnessed Basijis attacking private homes where they believed protesters had fled to escape attack :
" In my neighborhood , downtown Tehran , there were protesters who escaped into people 's homes when the Basijis chased them .
The Basijis who were chasing them then knocked harshly on the doors .
The residents were too afraid to open the doors .
Then the Basijis sprayed a mark on the door with spray paint .
A few minutes later , they came back and attacked the marked houses , breaking down the doors and entering them .
They beat the owners , and broke the windows in the house and of their cars . "
Human Rights
Watch has collected similar accounts of violent nighttime raids by the Basij and other security forces in neighborhoods throughout Tehran , including Niavaran , Farmaneih , Saadat Abad , Shahrak Gharb , and Vanak Square .
The Basiji ( Nirooye Moghavemate Basij , the Resistance Mobilization Force ) is a volunteer paramilitary force of men and women , " a large people 's militia , " created by Ayatollah Khomeini in November 1979 to advance the aims of the Islamic Revolution .
The Basijis are under the control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and have branches throughout Iran , including in many social institutions such as schools , universities , mosques , and government offices .
They engage in a wide range of activities , but one of their core duties is to help maintain law and order , repress dissent , and enforce their conservative interpretation of Islamic codes of dress and behavior .
During times of protests , they frequently beat and intimidate protesters .
Security agents are also forcing residents in Tehran to take down their satellite dishes , which allow them to view foreign media , one of the few sources of uncensored information in the face of the severe government restrictions on domestic media in Iran .
According to a reliable source in Tehran , on June 24 , uniformed police officers forced residents in the Niavaran and Dorous neighborhoods of Tehran to take down their satellite receiving dishes , and returned later to confiscate many of the satellite dishes .
In addition to placing severe restrictions on access to internet - based news providers , Iran is also trying to jam the signals of foreign news media that broadcast into Iran .
A resident from the Saadat Abad neighborhood of Tehran described a police raid to Human Rights Watch :
" Five policemen knocked on the door of our apartment building .
People went to open the door and asked them what they wanted .
The police said they wanted to come and destroy the satellite dishes on the rooftop .
The landlord asked them if they had any permission documents to do this .
The policemen replied that there was no need for any documents because the stairs and the rooftops are n't private property ; they are common ( shared ) property .
Then they threatened the landlord , ‘ If you want us to go get permission documents , we 'll come back later with them , but then we will also search the apartments as well . '
They were trying to intimidate the landlord , so he let them in .
Then they went to the rooftop and threw the dishes into the street .
The landlord told me they behaved so harshly with him there was no room to complain . "
" After clamping down on the local media and expelling foreign correspondents , Iran 's security forces are now trying to shut down people 's access to foreign news , " said Whitson .
" Clearly , they do n't want their own citizens to know what is actually happening inside Iran today . "
Human Rights
Watch called upon the authorities to ensure that everyone whose property had been destroyed by security forces received compensation in full .

Flu of misinformation and hypocrisy
by Thanos Kalamidas

More from this Author Conspiracy theories are not my thing and I have to admit that I always laughed at most of them .
After all , turning to conspiracy theories means that you ’re having problems accepting logic , ignoring how crazy any theory might sound .
Back in the eighties when HIV AIDS stormed into our lives , especially when the first celebrities were caught in the storm , conspiracy theories blossomed .
CIA had created the virus and lost control ; there was even a laboratory somewhere in the USA that had created the virus as a lethal weapon against gays .
Everybody seemed to forget that even cancer has existed throughout history , but doctors only identified it the last three centuries , and started focusing on it and doing research .
Humanity has experienced a lot of illnesses throughout history , many of them lethal .
Illnesses often also became the focus of superstition , for instance the plague was blamed on Satan and heretics during the medieval period , instead of the lack of hygiene in the growing cities .
Recently , Robert Mugabe , Africa ’s caricature Hitler , blamed British intelligence for the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe , instead of his own inability to help the people with basic needs such as clean water and food .
The common factor in these cases , and I suppose in the majority of all cases , is not any kind of conspiracy theory , but the lack of necessary action .
With this I mean distributing the right kind of information to deal with the problem – which points directly at the states and this is not … a conspiracy theory !
There is no conspiracy theory behind the swine flu and scientists have , often cynically , used their logic to explain in detail how the flu started and how it expands .
They have exhibited studies and statistics that are not new – there is nothing new about swine flu – and they have explained defences and all that with the help of the World Health Organization , WHO .
Doctors have been warned and informed on local levels , and most of them are prepared to deal with it .
But despite all the information , people have stopped eating pork , and the number of flu victims is increasing internationally , adding one dead in USA and twelve in Mexico .
When I wrote that people have stopped buying pork meat , I was not joking .
Actually the US Government , joined by Russia , China and another fifteen countries , have imposed restrictions on pork products imports from Mexico – I suppose you never know what a well made pork chop might give you .
The best of all was when American Vice President Joe Biden said in a televised interview that he would not let his family fly by plane or be in an enclosed public place , like a cinema , while this thing is still going on .
Biden ’s interview was broadcast in the news all around the world .
I saw them in Finland , and especially these comments gave the message that if the American vice president prefers to keep his family indoors to protect them , I better not move from my room !
The swine flu , according to most scientists , is not lethal , and I trust they know what they are talking about .
Its lethality depends on the prevention and treatment of suspected patients , as well as the patient ’s immune system .
But apart from babies and very young people , or if somebody has serious problems with their immune system , swine flu is not the only enemy .
So here we have , once again , misinformation and mishandled situations , from the very people that are obliged to protect us from exactly these situations , leading us to widespread panic !
Because how is anybody supposed to react to Biden ’s comments and the American administration ’s restrictions on import of pork products from Mexico , if not with panic ?
The Mexican government correctly demands explanations from the governments of the states that put on these restrictions .
The Mexicans are demanding explanations based on a scientific basis , highlighting the fact that consumers are not likely to check the origin of the pork steak or pork sausage they buy from the supermarket - they will just quit buying any pork product !
Amazing !
The EU on the other hand , tries to be clever by using marketing tricks and changing the name of the flu from swine flu to … a novel flu virus !
Wow , that will definitely solve all the problems !
Personally I have to admit that I have never seen a sausage or a pork steak sneeze at me , and if I ever see that I will definitely start believing that aliens have taken over the main governments and that together with Hoover they are all responsible for J.F. Kennedy ’s assassination !
What the World Health Organization has failed to protect us from is the flu of misinformation and hypocrisy !

Europe plans to hunt more whales than Japan for the first time in many years , dividing EU countries and dismaying conservationists who say that whaling is escalating in response to the worldwide recession .
Figures seen by the Guardian before a meeting of more than 80 countries next week , show that Norway , Denmark and Iceland propose to hunt 1,478 whales compared to Japan 's 1,280 in 2009 .
This would be an increase of nearly 20 % by Europe on last year .
" Europe likes to point the finger at Japan as a rogue whaling nation but Europeans are killing whales in increasing numbers in their own waters .
Europe has become whale enemy number one " , said Kate O'Connell , campaigner for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) .
Iceland – which today began its 2009 hunt by killing the first two of 150 fin whales – and Norway , are the only two countries to hunt whales commercially .
This breaches a 23 - year - old worldwide moratorium introduced to preserve critically endangered whale populations .
This year , Norway proposes to kill 885 minke whales , and Iceland 350 whales in total .
Denmark will apply to hunt 245 on behalf of indigenous Inuit hunters in its semi-autonomous territory Greenland .
Most of the whale meat caught in European waters will be sold to Japan .
Japan , which practises thinly disguised commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research , plans to kill 850 whales in Antarctic waters this season , as well as more than 400 in the Pacific .
It wants to kill fewer whales than last year but is seeking permission to hunt more in its coastal waters .
Britain today increased diplomatic pressure on Iceland to stop its whaling , warning that it intended to make it a condition of the country 's expected application to join the EU that it abandon commercial whaling .
Fisheries minister Huw Irranca - Davies said : " If Iceland were to join Europe then Britain would expect they would be obliged to end their whaling operation .
We would urge renegotiation . "
A spokesman for the new Iceland government said : " The government has said it will honour this year 's quota but will reassess the whaling situation by the end of the year .
A study is being done by the economic institute of the University of Iceland .
Whaling will obviously be part of the talks when Iceland negotiates its entry to the EU . "
An independent economic report commissioned by conservation groups WWF and WDCS released today in advance of the International whaling commission ( IWC ) summit in Madeira , concludes that whaling is no longer economically viable .
Japan , it claimed , has spent $ 164 m ( £ 100 m ) backing its whaling industry since 1988 , and Norwegian subsidies equal almost half of the gross value of all whale - meat landings .
Sales of whale meat , blubber , and other whale products in Japan " have made financial losses for most of the last 20 years " , it said .
The research says that killing more whales will only hurt the growing whale - watching industry , and damage the international image of Norway and Japan .
" Norway and Japan are hurting tourism , a potential growth industry in both countries in order to spend millions of dollars obtaining whale meat , the sale of which makes no profit .
How much longer are they going to keep wasting their taxpayer 's money ? " said a spokeswoman for WWF .
Earlier this year more than 115,000 people pledged to visit Iceland as soon as the government announced an end to whaling .
The number of pro- and anti-whaling countries are finely balanced within the IWC , with both sides continuing to recruit as many countries as possible to boost their positions .
Japan in the past has offered many small countries development aid to vote with them , but Britain and other countries have also leaned on eastern European countries to join .
Australia and New Zealand said this week that they would mount a non-lethal whale research expedition to the Antarctic , as a direct challenge to Japan 's research programme , which maintains it must kill whales to study them .
The six - week expedition aims to prove that whales need n't be killed for study , the two governments said in a joint statement .
The IWC meeting is being held amidst are fears that environment groups are stepping up campaigns to stop whaling .
A previously unknown Norwegian group called Agenda 21 attacked a whaling ship in April , bringing to six the number of whaling boats sabotaged in Norway .
Sea Shepherd , a radical California - based group which has admitted sabotaging whalers in Iceland and elsewhere , has also threatened to return to Europe .
Today , the Icelandic whaling ship Hvalur 9 returned to the Hvalfjord whaling station to process its first catch .

COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - Thousands more civilians surged out of Sri Lanka ’s war zone on Wednesday while soldiers and Tamil Tiger rebels fought the apparent endgame of Asia ’s longest - running war despite calls to protect those still trapped .
In the third day since troops blasted through a massive earthen wall built by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and unleashed the exodus , the military said at least 100,000 people had been registered for onward transit to refugee camps .
Among those who came out was the LTTE ’s ex-spokesman Daya Master , a former schoolteacher who was the Tigers ’ voice to the English - speaking world for years and arranged media visits to the self - declared state the separatists had fought to create .
The military said he was the most senior rebel to surrender , an act that is in contravention of LTTE founder - leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran ’s dictate that followers wear cyanide vials to be taken in case of capture .
He surrendered along with the translator for the late LTTE political head S.P. Thamilselvan , as troops thrust deeper into a former army - declared no - fire zone that is now the last battleground in a war that erupted in 1983 .
For a third straight day , the military progress drove the Colombo Stock Exchange higher , traders said .
It closed up 1.4 percent , near a three - month high .
The military says troops now control all but 13 square km ( 5 sq miles ) of the Indian Ocean island , where the remnants of the LTTE and Prabhakaran fought to create a separate state for Sri Lanka ’s Tamil minority .
“ Confrontations are taking place .
Whenever we come across LTTE cadres , we are fighting them .
The rescue operation is continuing , ” military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said .
The number of people who have fled this year is now around 173,439 , according to the military tally .
UN CONFIRMS EXODUS
The United Nations confirmed this week ’s outflow .
“ It is 60,000 plus and counting , and we have heard various reports of up to 110,000 coming out , ” said the U.N. spokesman in Colombo , Gordon Weiss .
He cautioned the reports were preliminary and not confirmed .
The LTTE has accused the military of fabricating the numbers and of capturing people it says are staying by choice .
It has ignored all calls to free civilians while urging a truce , and on Tuesday vowed no surrender despite facing overwhelming firepower .
Independent confirmation of battlefield accounts is difficult because outsiders are generally kept out .
Dashing the LTTE ’s hope India would step in to help a group it trained in the 1980s , Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee on Wednesday told reporters :
“ We have no sympathy for the terrorists , but every sympathy for the civilians . ”
In Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Sri Lanka for the civilians ’ plight .
“ I think that the Sri Lankan government knows that the entire world is very disappointed that in its efforts to end what it sees as 25 years of conflict , it is causing such untold suffering , ” Clinton told a U.S. Senate hearing .

France and other countries also raised alarm about those still trapped .
The International Committee of the Red Cross on Tuesday warned the situation was “ catastrophic ” for the 50,000 or more still there with little , food , water or medicine .
In New York , U.N. diplomats said the Security Council was expected to hold an informal meeting at 2100 GMT on Wednesday to hear a report by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon ’s chief of staff Vijay Nambiar , who visited Sri Lanka last week .
China and Russia so far have opposed attempts to bring up Sri Lanka at the council .
Earlier , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said France and Britain would try to send ships to Sri Lanka to evacuate the people .

POLITICAL PROCESS
French Ambassador Jean - Maurice Ripert told reporters the LTTE “ have to stop fighting , they have to surrender , they have to join the political process and of course they have to free the hostages . ”
The massive civilian presence in the no-fire zone had been the last crucial defense for the Tigers , who refused repeated calls from the United Nations , Western governments and neighboring India to release them .
They ignored a two - day pause by the government last week .
Sri Lanka ’s government has rejected LTTE and international calls for a new truce , saying it cannot allow a group designated as a terrorist organization by more than 30 countries to use the time to rearm as it has done before .
Aid agencies have warned refugee camp conditions could quickly turn poor with the anticipated population doubling , but Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has ordered extra food and relief supplies to be sent .
After the conventional end of the war , Sri Lanka will face the challenges of healing divisions between the Tamil minority and Sinhalese majority , and boosting a $ 40 billion economy suffering on many fronts including a weakening rupee .
Sri Lanka is seeking a $ 1.9 billion International Monetary Fund loan to ease a balance of payments crisis and boost flagging foreign exchange reserves .

Huffington Post : Jane Hamsher of firedoglake.com says the Tax Day Tea Parties are organized by " lobbyists and influence peddlers . "
Instapundit Glenn Reynolds :
It 's not " astroturfing , " it 's " grassroots . "
BuffaloPundit blogs about the Tea Party held March 30 in Buffalo .
Opinion :
The income tax system is broken
Today 's the deadline to file state and federal returns -- how late are the post offices open ?
Talk about it in the CNY Politics forum .
IRS
Syracuse , NY -- Joanne Wilder has never protested anything in public before .
She 's never boxed with City Hall , let alone Washington .
" I 've been a quiet little person my whole life , " she said .
But today in downtown Syracuse , the 60 - year - old great - grandmother will lead a Tax Day Tea Party protest against the spending policies of the Obama administration and Congress .
The demonstration -- at 11:30 a.m. outside the James M. Hanley Federal Building -- which Wilder estimates will draw 2,000 people , is one of more than 1,500 rallies planned in 550 American cities on the deadline day for Americans to pay their 2008 income taxes .
The protests are being coordinated by a coalition of national conservative groups and promoted by celebrity conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh .
But they 're being carried out across the country by new grass - roots leaders like Wilder , who are upset that the government seems to be bailing out everyone but them .
A second demonstration , scheduled for 5 to 7 p.m. today at Long Branch Park in Liverpool , is being organized by Jim Smith , of Radisson , who is also making his debut as a protester .
( Clarification : Today 's Post - Standard incorrectly reported the demonstration would be near the Salt Museum .
The demonstration will be at the north end of Onondaga Lake Park off of Long Branch Road . ) :
Smith predicted his protest will draw 4,000 to 5,000 people .
In Rome , a third tea party protest is being planned at 4 p.m. outside Fort Stanwix .
The Central New York efforts are a small piece of the picture .
Organizers expect 50,000 people , including Beck , to attend the tea party outside the Alamo , in San Antonio .
Fox News commentator Sean Hannity will broadcast from the event in Atlanta .
Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich will be at the tea party in New York City .
Wilder and Smith said the events are not political , not aimed solely at Obama or the Democrats in Congress .
" This is not a Democratic problem .
Not a Republican problem .
It 's all of them together , " Wilder said .
They concede they did not publicly object as the federal budget deficit soared during the Bush administration .
" President Bush kept me safe , " Wilder said as an explanation .
The grievances against the government that she and Smith talk about sound identical to the complaints raised by their favorite conservative talk radio show hosts : wasteful bailout spending approved by Obama and the Congress ; assistance to poorer homeowners with bad credit who are defaulting on subprime mortgages ; Obama 's plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans ; affirmative action ; and entitlement programs that undercut capitalism .
The two credited the February televised rant by CNBC commentator Rick Santelli against a federal bailout of poor homeowners who can't pay their mortgages for transforming them from passive listeners of conservative talk radio into rabble rousers .
In his remarks , Santelli said he was thinking of organizing a tea party on Lake Michigan to protest the direction Obama was leading America .
" The first shot of the revolution was fired by Rick Santelli .
It was the first wake - up call , " Smith said .
The two organizers have been using social networking Internet sites and e-mail to connect with others who are angry about the government .
In March , Wilder and a friend formed Central New York Patriots , a group with a home page on Meetup.com to spread the news about her protest .
The same month , Smith formed a group called Glenn Beck 's Central New York We Surround Them Meetup Group -- with a Web page at www.cny912.com to promote his demonstration .
" People wonder if we 're militant .
No .
Not even close , " Smith said .
" Each and every one of us believes in the system . "
But they are mad .
After a lifetime of working , paying taxes and raising three children on her own , Wilder is struggling .
She said she retired on disability from M&T Bank three years ago after undergoing knee replacement and back surgeries .
She lives on her Social Security and disability benefits .
Last year , she petitioned the bankruptcy court for protection from creditors .
She said she did not have to pay federal income taxes last year because her income was too low .
" I do n't want to see this country turn into a welfare , nanny state , where we stand in line for groceries , and we 're in welfare lines , and in socialized medicine lines , " Wilder said .
Divorced and raising a teenage son , Smith , 49 , owns a driveway sealing business .
He is organizing the protest in Liverpool even though the National Tax Day Tea Party Coalition is not sanctioning or promoting it on its Web site .
The national coalition thinks the Syracuse community is too small to support two events , said Amy Kremer , the nationwide event coordinator .
She said she pushed Smith to join forces with Wilder , but he declined .
Smith said he became involved because Obama is causing class and racial divisiveness by promoting policies that benefit select groups of Americans .
Americans need safety nets , but Obama and Congress are pushing programs that foster dependency and weaken capitalism , said Smith , who acknowledged he collected food stamp benefits for a few months last year .
" Obama is horribly divisive , " Smith said .

JUNE 10 -- The anonymous author of the purported sequel to ' The Catcher in the Rye , ' which has triggered a lawsuit by J.D. Salinger , is a Swedish man whose previous published works include ' The Macho Man 's ( Bad ) Joke Book , ' ' The Erotic A - Z , ' and a volume listing the 100 best heavy metal albums .
Fredrik Colting , 32 , acknowledged in an interview this week that he wrote the book ' 60 Years Later : Coming Through the Rye , ' which Salinger has branded a ' rip - off pure and simple ' and triggered the reclusive 90 - year - old author to file a federal copyright lawsuit .
In a June 5 U.S. District Court order signed by Judge Deborah Batts , Colting is identified as ' Fredrik Colting writing under the pseudonym John David California , ' or J.D. California .
A copy of the Batts order can be found here .
Colting told TSG that , along with a partner , he has produced a variety of humor or ' quirk ' titles , but that ' 60 Years Later ' was his ' first published novel . '
Colting , pictured at left , denied that the book was a ' Catcher ' sequel and said he was surprised that Salinger filed a copyright claim : ' I 'm Swedish , we do n't sue people here . '
Pending a June 17 court hearing , Colting , who runs Nicotext , a small Sweden - based publishing company , has agreed not to distribute ' 60 Years Later ' in the United States .
Additionally , since the book recently went on sale in England , Colting agreed to ask Amazon.com and another online retailer to not ship the book to U.S. customers .
A purported photo of ' California ' appeared last month in England 's Daily Telegraph , but the picture was actually of actor Gustav Roth , a friend of Colting .
' It was a bit tricky of us but we did it without any bad intentions , ' Colting wrote in an e-mail .
' I mean , the whole point of a pseudonym is it being a secret . ' ( 3 pages )
I can see no way in which this carefully laid plan could ever fail .

LOS ANGELES
SACHA BARON COHEN recently approached Elton John through a representative .
Could he use “ Can You Feel the Love Tonight , ” Mr. John ’s hit song from “ The Lion King , ” for a pivotal scene in his forthcoming movie ?
“ Brüno , ” an R - rated comedy set for wide release by Universal Pictures on July 10 , stars Mr. Baron Cohen as a flamboyantly gay fashion journalist from Austria .
The filmmakers wanted to play the song during a scene in which the title character , participating in a cage - fighting match , pulls down his opponent ’s pants and kisses him on the mouth , prompting a horrified crowd to throw garbage at him .
The answer was no .
Mr. John , along with the Walt Disney Company , which owns the copyright to the song but seeks his approval in such matters , learned of the scene ’s particulars and blanched , according to one of Mr. John ’s advisers .
But then Mr. John reversed himself  kind of .
He did n’t want to be associated with the provocative scene , but he ultimately agreed to perform part of another song that functions as a coda to the film .
So it goes for “ Brüno , ” a movie that , in mercilessly exploiting the discomfort created when straight men are ambushed by aggressive gayness , happens to ( surprise ! ) expose homophobia .
Gay groups are reacting with deeply mixed emotions , heightened by the recent triumphs ( Iowa ) and losses ( California ) in efforts to legalize gay marriage .
Is the film then vulgar , inappropriate and harmful ?
Or bold , timely and necessary ?
All of the above ?
A reader writes :
I was a freshman at University of Maryland College Park in the fall of 1996 .
Back then , smoking pot then was stigmatized , but pretty common anyway .
My roommate knew about my occasional habit ( once or twice a month , tops ) and did not approve .
He knew I had a bowl in my part of our closet .
One morning , when returning from calc class , I found a campus officer in my room , being shown my bowl which had been removed from my closet by my roommate .
He had called the police simply because he feared his future placement in the Israeli army was at jeopardy due to the bowl 's presence in our room .
This gave the police probable cause to search all of my belongings , finding a very small amount of 3 month old " shake " in the process .
Since the cocaine - related death of Len Bias in 1988 , the university had implemented a zero tolerance policy to drugs .
That policy led to me being removed from campus 4 weeks into my freshman year , and put on mandatory drug testing .
I 'm very fortunate that I have since pulled out of that dark time professionally , and now have a good job and career .
But this incident was definitely a catalyst for my academic decline .
Was it my fault ?
Yes .
I should have known better than to breach the very clear university guidelines on campus .
But what is very frustrating to me is that pot is treated like deadly drugs in terms of policy .
If we are going to advance a sane marijuana policy , we have to decouple pot from " drugs " .
Another writes :
I 'm a 23 year old finishing up with school .
I 've smoked weed on and off since high school .
In college , I actually made a rule for myself ; I could smoke weed if / when / as much as I wanted , as long as my grades stayed up .
And they did .
And I 've held two steady part time jobs , been active in extra curricular activities , traveled and completed an internship .
But early in college , I was caught with weed on campus .
I was arrested and kicked out of my dorm .
And during that ordeal , everyone - I mean EVERYONE ; my parents , my lawyer , my RA , even the dean of the college - are handing me my punishments while saying , " ... even though I think it should be legalized . "
Another :
A few years ago , I was arrested for possession of about a dime bag 's worth of weed .
Being that this took place in CT , while my residence was in NYC , this got a little complicated .
I was offered 240 hours of community service plus 1 year of weekly drug treatment meetings every Wednesday .
In exchange , they would wave the conviction and expunge my record completely .
I said sure , but can I do this in New York City ?
The prosecutor said no , the community service and treatment had to be done in New Haven , Connecticut .
That meant that every Wednesday for a year , I would have to take off of work , drive 2 hours to New Haven , attend the meeting , and drive 2 hours back .
No Monday - Friday , 9 - 5 job is interested in keeping an employee that has to inexplicably take off every Wednesday for some unstated or ill - explained reason .
Not to mention the 240 hours of community service .
I realized that financially speaking , it was better to fight it .
Even though I am a low - income office worker , I hired an attorney .
After 2 years of bruising legal action , my drug attorney ( that 's all he did : drug cases like mine ) got my sentence nullified , which means I admitted guilt without it actually entered as a conviction .
Along the way , I lost my job due to their background checkers finding out about the bust , and I blew through $ 3,000 in legal fees .
I do n't smoke pot anymore .
It 's not that I do n't enjoy it , or that I " learned my lesson , " it 's just that the possibility of getting caught outweighs the value of getting high .
Should the law change , I 'll be toking up that night .
Another :
I 've noticed a disturbing uptick in random drug testing .
Two people I am very close to have been fired in the past week ( from separate employers ) for doing nothing more than showing up for work , getting their names pulled out of a hat , and having smoked a joint the night before .
This tactic allows companies to trim their workforce with increasing their unemployment insurance while leaving the worker unable to collect benefits or use the former employer as a work reference when applying for a new job .
I 'm not an economist , but I took enough Econ in college to know that increasing unemployment while simultaneously leaving the unemployed with no means of support and hindering their future employment prospects is a bad idea in any economic condition , much less a recession / depression .

Drum Boogie
Continuing our A Blog Supreme - inspired series of great jazz - on - film moments , here ’s a sequence featuring Barbara Stanwyck and legendary jazz / swing drummer Gene Krupa — pretty much the Keith Moon of his day — from one of my personal favorite classic - era comedies , Howard Hawks ’ 1941 “ Ball of Fire . ”
You ’ll also notice Gary Cooper in there , playing an extremely sheltered professor researching the urban slang of the time .
One hallmark of classic era films is that you can be watching a noir mystery , a western , or a non-musical screwball comedy , and sometimes things will just stop for a song .
As you ’ll see here , that was n’t a bad thing if the right talent was available .
And , whatever you do , do n’t stop watching before seeing what Krup could do with a matchbook cover , starting at about 4:17 or so .
In case anyone ’s wondering , no , that ’s not Ms. Stanwyck singing .
The terrific vocals are by Martha Tilton .
And here ’s a bonus — Krupa with the Benny Goodman band in an amazing performance of their signature tune , Louis Prima ’s “ Sing , Sing , Sing . ”
If you are looking for the perfect evening wear for a full night of harassing vegans , this sleek , sexy meat dress might be the answer .
Produced by costume hobbyist Jia and modeled on her website , this salami and bacon number is a perfect way to express your carnivorous style .
Salami and bacon were Jia ’s meats of choice based on their workability and meatiness , although she admits that ham , prosciutto , jerky , and even hamburger are possible substitutes .
“ I chose salami because it ’s thin , keeps in one piece , and is quite cheap , and bacon because it looks very , um , meaty , ” she writes .
After layering the meat over a cotton liner dress , Jia placed a layer of clear vinyl on top .
It is very important to seal the bottom of the dress in order to catch the inevitable meat drippings .
So if you want to make friends with a lot of dogs , or piss off the hoards of self righteous vegans , give the meat dress a try .
Just remember , it is recommended that you store the meat dress in the refrigerator , not the closet .

Adour ’s virtual sommelier forms part of Potion ’s efforts to liberate computing from the confines of the computer by reinventing it as an interactive experience that can come in different physical forms and be shared with other people .
Working from a studio above a bustling street in New York ’s Chinatown , they have already transformed floors , walls and furniture , as well as the bars at Azour and another New York wine bar , Clo , into communal “ screens ” that are controlled by human gestures or movement , rather than with a keyboard and mouse .
The duo first met as computer science students on a course run by the software designer John Maeda at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab .
Mr. Tiongson then studied filmmaking at Columbia University , and Mr. Schiffman taught at High Tech High School in San Diego .
They met again at a lecture given by Mr. Maeda in New York .
“ We were chatting afterwards and John said : ‘ You two should start something together .
Tell me the name of your company and I ’ll get you a job , ’ ” recalled Mr. Tiongson .
“ We quickly came up with a name — TS Design — and John made an introduction .
Nothing came of it , but our own ball began rolling .
It turned out that Jared and I shared the same interest — how to get things out of the box and off the screen . ”

After they founded Potion in 2005 , much of their early work was for museums including the National World War I Museum in Kansas City , New York ’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Building Museum in Washington .
Those institutions wanted to find more inspiring ways of enabling visitors to learn more about their exhibits than conventional rows of computers .
Potion ’s alternatives combine advanced projection technology with human interaction software that allows visitors to call up the information and images they would like to see by making physical gestures , such as jumping on a digital symbol on the floor or stroking one on a table .
One such project was to develop a digital version of the Star - Spangled Banner , the flag that flew above Fort McHenry during the British bombardment in 1812 , for the National Museum of American History in Washington .
The original is so fragile that it has to be exhibited behind glass .
Potion designed an interactive table on which images of fragments of the flag are projected at full scale and such high resolution that you , and anyone standing beside you , can see details , like tiny stitches and tattered edges that are barely visible on the original .
“ A shared experience is always a better experience , because the brain attaches different emotions to it , ” said Mr. Schiffman .
“ It ’s not always easy , but when we get it right it ’s a real success .
You ’d be surprised by how many conversations are started between total strangers standing at the flag . ”
Perusing our friend Timberwraith ’s blog , Haunted Timber , I came across an amazing story I had to share .
It is about two 24 year old Swedish parents who are raising their child not as a boy or a girl , but as a child .
I recommend reading what Timberwraith had to say here .
You can go here to read the story in english , or here for some Swedish .
Let me start by saying that this was not intended to be a Pseudoscience Chronicles post ( I just enjoyed the story ) until I read what one of the interviewees had to say ten paragraphs in .
I was shocked at first by what Susan Pinker said ( in the english version of the story ) , but then was not surprised to find out that she is a psychologist and journalist :
‘“ Ignoring children ’s natures simply does n’t work , ” says Susan Pinker , a psychologist and newspaper columnist from Toronto , Canada , who wrote the book The Sexual Paradox , which focuses on sex differences in the workplace . ’
‘“ Child - rearing should not be about providing an opportunity to prove an ideological point , but about responding to each child ’s needs as an individual , ” Pinker tells The Local . ’
It ’s ironic how she claims that raising a child should be about responding to each child ’s individual needs , then goes on to say we should force children into preconceived gender - roles .
If anything , keeping the child ’s sex a secret allows the parents to respond to their child ’s actual needs rather than the artificial needs implanted by a cultural construction that attempts to fit every single person in the world into one of two restricted categories .
So I guess what she was actually trying to say was that child - rearing should only be about providing an opportunity to prove an ideological point if that ideological point is ‘ gender exists get used to it ’ .
Pinker goes on to make some more crazy claims :
‘ “ I do n’t think that trying to keep a child ’s sex a secret will fool anyone , nor do I think it ’s wise or ethical , ” says Pinker .
“ As with any family secret , when we try to keep an elemental truth from children , it usually blows up in the parent ’s face , via psychosomatic illness or rebellious behaviour . ” ’
Of course , the parents are not keeping any truth from the child ( I do n’t even know how they would do that ) .
They are simply allowing the child to grow into what it wants to be .
They are responding to their child ’s needs as an individual .
They are being good parents .
With that , I would like to welcome Susan Pinker to the Pseudoscience Chronicles .

Ennis House was placed on a list on most endangered house in 2005
US architect Frank Lloyd Wright 's Ennis mansion , used as a backdrop for films including Blade Runner , has been put on the market for $ 15 m ( £ 9.1 m ) .
Guardians of the striking Los Angeles house , built from Mayan - inspired concrete blocks in 1924 , are hoping to find a private buyer to preserve it .
The building was also used for Buffy The Vampire Slayer , Twin Peaks and the video to S Club 7's hit Have You Ever ?
Wright , who died in 1959 , was one of the world 's most prolific architects .
South Park appearance
His grandson Eric has backed the decision of the Ennis House Foundation to put the estate on the market , saying his grandfather " designed homes to be occupied by people " .
The organisation recently completed part of a restoration programme after the house was damaged by years of decay and heavy rains .
The house is made up of 27,000 concrete blocks
Its president James DeMeo said an individual would be better placed to save the house for future generations .
Actress Diane Keaton , who is one of the foundation 's directors , is expected to take a public role in the sale of the house .
Ennis 's other big screen appearances include the films Black Rain , The Karate Kid III and 1975 's The Day of the Locust .
It was used in an episode of animated TV series South Park as the base for a Chinese gang .
If you ’ve traveled through the same Colorado ( or most other western states ) forests for decades , you ’ve probably noticed they keep getting denser , overgrown , filled with ever more snags and deadfall .
Due to the environmental indoctrination I got as a youth at NOLS and elsewhere , I used to think such dense forests were natural , that logging and otherwise managing for forest products was a sin , and that somehow convenient fires would clear things out once in a while .
Boy , was I wrong .
I got to audit a forest health presentation at a conference ( Colorado Counties ) in Vail a few days ago .
The presenters laid it on the line .
What I heard is that we ’ve blown it .
Yeah , I knew that already — but I did n’t know just how messed up our forests have become .
Fire used to be a natural part of the forest — but only when it could burn frequently enough to keep vegetation density low .
Once the fire cycle is suppressed , the fuel load becomes so great that resulting mega - fires sterilize the ground .
Such damage is unnatural and re-vegetates poorly , causing problems such as erosion and damaged water supplies .
What is more , when an overly dense backcountry forest borders on towns and cities you ’re in a catch - 22 because you ca n’t let it burn and risk a catastrophic mega - fire that could take out a town or ruin their watershed for centuries to come , but the fuel load keeps getting worse because you do n’t let it burn , thus making the consequences of a fire ever more serious .
Just how bad have we let our forests get ?
I was stunned to learn that in many western conifer forests , the natural number of trees per acre is around 50 , with an almost park - like feel to the grounds .
Instead , we ’ve got many areas with tree populations upwards of 1,000 an acre !
Not only does this change the forest ’s fire parameters and aesthetics , but it ’s arguable that the present pine beetle epidemic is caused at least in part and possibly totally by the highly unnatural forest density .
The fix for this is difficult and will take years .
It involves everything from thinning / logging to controlled burns where they ’re possible .
In some areas , we ’ll be able to eventually return to a natural fire cycle , especially in legal wilderness without private property issues .
But mostly , according to one presenter , the fix involves changing the culture of the west to a more realistic view of what a healthy forest is ; to get away from the view that cutting even one tree down is some kind of negative event bordering on original sin .
Along with that , rural private land owners will need to be held accountable to managing any forest they own so it stays healthy .
And they ’ll need to maintain the proper amount of cleared “ defensible ” space around their structures so when fires do happen , they ’re not as much of threat to private property and the fire can be managed for forest health instead of property defense .
I was amused when one presenter mentioned that many people move from the city to rural Colorado so they do n’t have to mow a lawn .
But little do they know that to be good stewards of their property , they ’ll need to spend the same amount of time squeezing the throttle of a chain saw as they used to spend perched on their rider mower .
Ultimate solution ?
More than one presenter at the conference mentioned that the only way most of our forest will heal is if we again have a viable forest products industry , only managed with modern forestry science .
Government funding simply can’t take care of the cost .
While logging for structural wood was mentioned , the consensus seemed to be that our savior will be using biomass for energy production .
Several excellent projects around Colorado are showing this is possible — and sustainable .
What I ’m hoping is we ’ll see smaller biomass energy plants spring up around the west , which utilize wood culled from surrounding forests .
I ’ve seen how they do this in Europe and it ’s quite impressive .
As for our personal contributions to all this : will we be able to help the USFS do some “ thinning ” up at our favorite backcountry skiing locations ?
Now that ’s the kind of culture shift I can live with .

Updates to Team Fortress 2 , Half - Life 2 : Episode 1 & 2 , and Portal have been released .
The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted .
The specific changes include :
Profile of jailed women A court in North Korea has sentenced two US journalists to 12 years ' hard labour , state media say .
Euna Lee and Laura Ling were found guilty of " hostile acts " and illegal entry into the communist state .
They were arrested in March after allegedly crossing into North Korea from China .
The US said it was " deeply concerned " by the sentence and called for the release of the two women on humanitarian grounds .
The trial comes amid growing tensions over North Korea 's nuclear programme and recent missile tests .
" The trial confirmed the grave crime they [ the reporters ] committed against the Korean nation and their illegal border crossing , " state - run KCNA news agency said in a brief report , adding that they were sentenced to 12 years of " reform through labour " .
The news agency gave no further details .
Outside observers were not allowed to witness the hearing at Pyongyang 's court .
The verdict means that the journalists face the prospect of spending years in one of the North 's prison camps , where conditions are reported to be extremely harsh , the BBC's Chris Hogg in Seoul says .
US envoy ?
In a statement , the US State Department said : " We are deeply concerned by the reported sentencing of the two American citizen journalists by North Korean authorities , and we are engaged through all possible channels to secure their release . "
US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton earlier described the charges against the two women as " baseless " .
She is thought to be considering sending an envoy to try to negotiate their release .
There has been speculation that former US Vice - President Al Gore might travel to Pyongyang .
He is the co-founder of Current TV , the California - based internet broadcaster the two journalists were working for .
Euna Lee , a Korean - American , and Laura Ling , a Chinese - American , were arrested by North Korean guards on 17 March while working on the China - North Korea border on a story about refugees .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - il wants direct talks with the US Some reports have suggested that the women were held while on Chinese soil , but Pyongyang 's state media say they had illegally entered North Korea .
The pair have been held in detention since their arrest .
There are fears they will now be used as " bargaining chips " by North Korean leader Kim Jong -il in his efforts to win concessions from Washington , our correspondent says .
These concessions could include humanitarian aid or direct talks with Washington , analysts say .
The US has so far said negotiations can only be held under the currently - stalled six - party talks on nuclear disarmament , which also includes South Korea , China , Japan and Russia .
The women 's families have appealed for clemency and asked Pyongyang and Washington not to link their case with the current diplomatic stand - off .
Tensions have increased in the region since North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May and then test - fired several missiles .
Another long - range missile test is believed to be planned for later this month .
The UN Security Council is discussing tightening sanctions against Pyongyang , and Mrs Clinton said on Sunday that the US was considering reinstating North Korea in its list of state sponsors of terrorism .

[ If this building was priced like an equivalently famous painting , it would cost more than the entire US GDP ]
The top floor of Corbusier ’s Villa Stein ( one of perhaps the top 500 most important houses of the late 19th / early 20th centuries – i.e. a Van Gogh of houses ) is for sale for the same price per sq.ft .
( approx $ 1400 ) as buildings in the same area of suburban Paris , designed by nobody in particular .
Meanwhile , Van Gogh ’s Portrait of Dr. Gachet sold for an inflation adjusted price of $ 136 million yet a poster of similar square footage and style costs around $ 10 .
In other words , a work of art that you can actually live in has zero premium over a commodity item , but one that you can look at has a premium factor of 13 million over a commodity one .
There are 2 possible conclusions : architecture is vastly under valued or painting prices are almost entirely irrational .
Given that the cost of a single floor of the Villa Stein would be almost exactly the same as entire US GDP ( $ 13 trillion ) in the former case , and that Le Corbusier ’s mediocre paintings sell at a vast premium compared to the buildings he is famous for , it ’s the paintings that are too pricey .
The world ’s two most expensive painting purchases were by Steven Cohen the Hedge Fund manager and David Martinez the corporate debt financier .
Both work in finance , where the creative output is money rather than painting , quantitative rather than qualitative .
Money hidden in a vault , is a less visible form of status than a picture , so the two can be exchanged , where the highest quantitative measure , status , can be accrued by buying the most famous paintings .
If it were a purchase based upon qualitative measures such as the highest value to the buyer , then the sentimental subject matter of the painting would override or skew the ownership of the most famous paintings with the richest people , but that tends not to be the case .
Famous painting prices are based upon the idea that fame equals talent and that absolute fame is absolutely priceless .
They are bought for quantitative price rather than qualitative value .
They are a form or elite rather than mass hysteria where the wealthy attempt to buy prized individual taste , something you can’t really buy , by purchasing mass taste and therefore inevitably get ripped off .
The sub -conscious force that drives this bubble market is that the action of buying famous paintings is not to buy for private enjoyment but for pubic ( even if it ’s just your friends ) prestige .
This is perhaps based on the underlying psychosis that actually possessing rather than merely being surrounded by an acknowledged work of art somehow bestows a portion of the artist ’s great taste and vision on the one who possesses it .
Is this really any different from magical flesh diets such as the primitive practice of swallowing a lion ’s heart for strength or eating powdered Rhino horn to get an erection ?
The portability and size of paintings allow them to be possessed and coveted in a way that buildings can’t , but there is another factor .
You can move a Van Gogh to the Upper East Side , but its more difficult to do that with the Villa Stein .
Paintings are an historical , but irrational , standard benchmark of wealth , rather like diamonds .
But the reason for their prestige is no more permanent than the prestige of lyre playing which was the pinnacle art form of ancient Greece , but is not coveted today .
Painting is the reserve currency of art – but reserve currencies can change .
The fact that the obvious , near total , fallacy of the art market is rarely questioned seems conspicuously odd .
Is there a form of sub - conscious cultural censorship at work ?
Perhaps the preservation of the painting myth is based on the fear that to challenge it means that you ca n’t appreciate or understand it ?
To even suggest that the Emperor is naked is to sound cliched .
But perhaps painting is a religion ?
When you read a book you can enjoy it even if you know its not true , but for the religious , the Bible cannot purely be a work of fiction , it has to have some truth .
Art allows you to have a quasi- spiritual feeling by temporarily suspending reason and disbelief , unlike religion which requires you to permanently do so .
Why should art ( temporary belief over reason ) be any different from religion ( permanent belief over reason ) ?
Why is it more surprising that people worship Van Gogh irrespective of true merit when people worship god ?
Somehow , to suggest that art is largely religion is , well , heresy , or at least philistinism .
Bizarrely , in our secular culture , where Madonna has replaced The Madonna , art is more sacrosanct than religion when it comes to questioning value .
Value is difficult to judge , but perhaps it ’s the mark of a true Philistine like a money - is - everything Hedge Fund manager to believe in the price of a Van Gogh .
Perhaps painting is a specific case of an art form that has become a religion , the opiate of the rich .
Two of March 's most high - profile albums , U2's No Line on the Horizon and Kelly Clarkson 's All I Ever Wanted , have already dropped off of Billboard 's top 10 , suggesting that neither one may have much staying power .
Released with great fanfare ( and in the case of U2's album , a five - night stint on David Letterman ) on March 3 and March 10 , U2 and Clarkson both debuted at No. 1 , with 484,000 copies and 255,000 copies sold in their first weeks .
But they 've since sunk like a couple of stones , each selling less than 42,000 copies this week .
In fact , last week , Clarkson 's album was in fifth place with 52,000 copies and U2's latest sold 51,000 to land at No. 6 .
There were a lot of new releases last week ( Keith Urban , Prince , Diana Krall , hip - hop act UGK , and former digital downloads champion Flo Rida ) , which probably took some of the sales attention away from Clarkson and U2 , but there are plenty of other albums in this week 's top 10 , including the Twilight soundtrack , no doubt getting a boost from the film 's DVD sales ; Lady GaGa 's The Fame and Taylor Swift 's Fearless — all of which are older , and still more popular , than U2 and Kelly Clarkson .
Perhaps one of the most useful things I learned in Austin this weekend is what to do when you 're in a hotel room with a cold beer and no bottle opener in sight : take any strong , small object - like the bottom of a lighter - and push it up against the cap using your finger for leverage .

The video here demonstrates with a piece of paper folded tight ; I did it with a lighter after only a few tries .
It 's not a matter of hand strength , only a matter of leverage , so anyone can do it .

Google last month reserved 1 million phone numbers with Level 3 , signaling that it may finally be ready to roll out its long - anticipated Google Voice service .
The free service , announced in March , lets users unify their phone numbers , allowing them to have a single number through Google Voice that rings a call through to all their phones .
Sources could not say when the 1 million numbers may be assigned .
Level 3 has been supplying Google with phone numbers since the introduction of Google Voice , so the 1 million numbers are an indication Google is close to adding a significant amount of users .
A Google spokesperson would only say " as a matter of policy , we typically do not comment on contracts with third - party technology suppliers . "
A public launch has been anticipated since Google said in March the service would be " open to new users soon . "
There has been speculation that the service would begin today – June 18 – but Google has yet to make an announcement .
" I 've only been using Google Voice for a few months , but it 's completely changed the way I use voicemail and communicate , just in general , " said Kevin Dando , director of digital and education communications for PBS .
" When it goes public , I think the rush to grab Google Voice numbers is going to be stunning .
I know some of my friends check the Google Voice page almost every day to see when they can grab a number and get started using it . "
Google Voice has a number of unique features including call transfer between a user 's devices , multi-party conferencing , conversion of voice calls to text messages , cut -rate international calling , and call transcription .
Google also has integrated the Voice service with Gmail contact lists .
But the gem is the fact that a user can have one phone number people can dial to reach them regardless of where they are located , either home or mobile .
Google Voice uses VoIP to link collections of phone numbers .
Google Voice is a product of Google 's March 2007 acquisition of GrandCentral .
For the past two years , however , it appeared the GrandCentral technology had been tossed into a black hole .
But on March 11 , Google announced Google Voice and opened the service up only to former GrandCentral users .
Last week , TechCrunch reported that Google would add number portability later this year to Google Voice , which would let users keep one of their existing phone numbers as their Google Voice number .
For example , users could make their cell phone number their Google Voice number .
The feature is significant because switching to a new Google Voice number comes with a cost such as having to distribute the new number to friends and family .
In addition , outbound calls and text messages show the phone number you are calling from and not your Google Voice number .

Farmers are installing nest boxes to encourage the owls
Enlarge Image
Owls and kestrels are being employed as agricultural pest controllers in the Middle East .
Many farmers are installing nest boxes to encourage the birds , which hunt the crop - damaging rodents .
In Israel , where there is a drive to reduce the use of toxic chemical pesticides , this has been turned into a government - funded national programme .
Jordanian and Palestinian scientists and conservation charities have joined the scheme .
According to the charity BirdLife International , hundreds of birds of prey - including many endangered species - have been killed in the region through eating rodents containing poisonous " rodenticides " sprayed on to crop fields .
But scientists in Israel are now working with farmers to combat this problem - deploying the birds as natural pest controllers .
" There is a real need to reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture here , " said Motti Charter , a researcher from Tel Aviv University and team leader of the Global Owl Project in Israel .
No boundaries " Many farmers think that chemicals are their only option .
They use very large amounts of them - spraying them on to their fields from planes , " said Mr Charter .
Barn owl nest boxes can be installed very close together in Israel " We have been reaching out to the farmers , to encourage them to reduce their use of rodenticides and install nest boxes instead . "
The scheme started in 1983 , when a few nesting boxes were erected near a kibbutz , or farming village , in the Bet - She 'an Valley , south of the Sea of Galilee .
The project has gradually been expanded to include boxes for nesting kestrels .
" Kestrels hunt during the day and barn owls at night , " said Mr Charter .
" This constant 24 - hour threat of predation has caused changes in the pests ' behaviour , resulting in less crop damage . "
According to the World Owl Trust , who have funded some of Mr Charter 's research , there are currently about 1,000 barn owl nest boxes in various locations around Israel .
Along with owls , kestrels provide 24 - hour pest control
The trust has even installed a webcam in one of those boxes .
Because the sub -species of barn owl in Israel is less territorial than those in Europe , and because the population of rodents is stable throughout the year , the nest boxes can be placed relatively close together .
" Jordan recently came on board to take part in the scheme , " said Tony Warburton , honourary president of the World Owl Trust .
" So the project is really bringing people together . "
Mr Charter added : " The birds will nest wherever there is food and a suitable habitat .
They do n't know the national boundaries . "

Hydrogen peroxide , the colourless liquid often poured over cuts and scrapes , seems to marshal infection - fighting cells to wounded animal tissue , researchers have found .
Zebrafish are small , colourful fish that reproduce quickly and are often used as a laboratory model in medical research .
In Wednesday 's online issue of the journal Nature , researchers in the U.S. said that within minutes of injuring the tail fins of zebrafish , hydrogen peroxide was released from the wound and entered the surrounding tissue .
Teams of white blood cells quickly responded to the chemical signal from the hydrogen peroxide and came to repair the damage .
" We 've known for quite some time that when the body is wounded , white blood cells show up , and it 's really a spectacular piece of biology because these cells detect the wound at some distance , " said Timothy Mitchison , a professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School .
" We do know something about what summons white blood cells to areas that are chronically inflamed , but in the case of an isolated physical wound , we have n't really known what the signal is . "
Disease role
When the experiment was repeated in zebrafish without a working protein known to produce hydrogen peroxide in the human thyroid gland , hydrogen peroxide did not appear at the wound site and no white blood cells showed up .
This proves white blood cells need hydrogen peroxide to sense the wound and move toward it , said study co-author Philipp Niethammer , a postdoctoral researcher in Mitchison 's lab .
In humans , hydrogen peroxide is produced mainly in the lungs , gut and thyroid gland .
The researchers speculate that hydrogen peroxide might play a role in diseases that involve excess levels of white blood cells , such as asthma , chronic pulmonary obstruction and some inflammatory bowel diseases .
" Perhaps in conditions like asthma , the lung epithelia is producing too much hydrogen peroxide because it 's chronically irritated , which , if our findings translate to humans , would explain inappropriate levels of white blood cells , " said Mitchison , who plans to investigate the hypothesis .
The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health .

( CNN ) --
The killing last weekend of a Catholic priest and two seminary students in southwest Mexico marked the first time that drug cartel hit men have purposefully targeted a clergyman , said Manuel Corral , public relations secretary for Mexico 's Council of Bishops .
The Rev. Habacuc Hernandez Benitez , 39 , was gunned down as he traveled in a vehicle in the town of Arcelia in the state of Guerrero , together with two seminary students , Eduardo Oregon Benitez , 19 , and Silvestre Gonzalez Cambron , 21 .
" In this case the drug traffickers followed them and ambushed them , " said Corral , who declined to name which cartel is suspected behind the incident .
Authorities have not stated a motive in the case , but Corral said one line of investigation is that one of the seminary students had a family member involved with a drug cartel , and that the three were killed as revenge for some cause .
At least seven priests have been killed in Mexico since 2005 under violent circumstances , including being kidnapped , shot and beaten .
Organized crime has been suspected in some of these cases , but Saturday 's killing in Guerrero left no doubt of the perpetrators ' business , Corral said .
Hernandez and the two seminarians had just celebrated Mass in Arcelia and were leaving the area when a group of unknown gunmen pulled up next to their vehicle and opened fire , according to the local human rights organization Montana Tlachinollan .
Local reports added that after shooting the priest 's vehicle , the gunmen pulled the men outside and shot them in the back .
The incident paralyzed area residents to the point that no one in the town would go to identify the bodies , Montana Tlachinollan reported .
The three victims remained " unknown " until someone from out of town came to officially identify them .
Since taking office in 2006 , Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made the fight against drug cartels a priority .
He has dispatched more than 25,000 troops to augment local police forces .
Last year , drug violence was blamed for the deaths of 78 Mexican soldiers and more than 6,000 others .
This year , the drug violence has claimed more than 2,900 lives , according to the newspaper El Universal .
The clergy has not been spared from the spike in drug - related violence that has afflicted regions of Mexico , Corral said .
" The threats are not new , " he said .
" As drug trafficking continued to grow , from about 2004 on , the priests continued to denounce it , and they themselves were threatened . "
In April , the archbishop of the northern state of Durango raised fears of attacks on the clergy after he said that Mexico 's most wanted man , Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman , lives in a Durango town and that " everybody knows it except the authorities . "
The comment , which was made in private conversation , stirred fears of retaliation and the archbishop backed off his statement after it quickly spread .
Of the 15,000 priests in Mexico , Corral estimated that 1,000 had been threatened in some form , and that 300 priests have been threatened directly .
Those direct threats -- usually in the form of " shut up , or we 'll shut you up " -- have come from intermediaries for organized crime or anonymously , Corral said .
The threats against the clergy have been serious enough that in some 20 cases , priests in Mexico were transferred to other parishes out of regard for their safety , he said .
The targeting of a priest is significant because it marks another boundary crossed by drug cartels , Corral said .
Bishops have noted that in surveys they conduct with families in their dioceses , drug dealing and domestic drug use top the list of problems families face , whereas three or five years ago it did n't make the list .
As enforcement action in Mexico and the United States has increased , domestic drug consumption in Mexico has increased .
Domestic drug use has torn families apart and made the new generation of traffickers more violent and less respectful of institutions like the church , Corral said .
But these same traffickers who threaten priests are paradoxically the same people that the church wants to reach .
" Rebuilding the social fabric has been a mission of the church , " Corral said .
" We can't live in fear . "
Another notable killing , the 1993 murder of Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo , has been attributed by some as a case of mistaken identity by drug traffickers , though church officials have publicly expressed doubts that the killers were traffickers .
The state of Guerrero , known for its beach destination of Acapulco , in recent years has been the setting of turf wars over drug trafficking routes between the Gulf cartel , the Sinaloa cartel , and an organization known as La Familia .

Advertisement Greek President Karolos Papoulias has renewed his country 's call for Britain to return sculptures removed from the Parthenon in Athens 200 years ago .
At the opening of the Acropolis Museum , Mr Papoulias said it was " time to heal the wounds " of the ancient temple .
The new museum , opened five years behind schedule , houses sculptures from the golden age of Athens .
The British Museum houses many of the surviving scultpures from the temple , and has refused to return them .
Greek President Karolos Papoulias greeted guests from all over the world " Today the whole world can see the most important sculptures of the Parthenon assembled , but some are missing , " said Mr Papoulias .
" It 's time to heal the wounds of the monument with the return of the marbles which belong to it . "
The British Museum sculptures , also known as the Elgin Marbles , originally decorated the Parthenon temple and have been in London since they were sold to the museum in 1817 by Lord Elgin .
He had them removed from the Acropolis when he was visiting Greece , then under the rule of the Ottoman Empire .
The British Museum long argued that Greece had no proper place to put them - an argument the Greek government hopes the Acropolis Museum addresses .
The opening ceremony was attended by heads of state and government and cultural envoys from about 30 countries , the UN and the EU .
After several adventures , obstructions and criticism , the new Acropolis Museum is ready
Greek Culture Minister Antonis Samaras
In pictures : Acropolis Museum Museum raises Marbles ' hopes
There were no government officials from Britain , but the most senior British guest , Bonnie Greer , the deputy head of the board of trustees of the British Museum , said she believed more strongly than ever that the marbles should remain in London .
She argued that in London they are displayed in an international cultural context .
She said a loan was possible , but that would require Greece to acknowledge British ownership , something Greece refuses .
The British Museum holds 75 m of the original 160 m of the frieze that ran round the inner core of the building .
' Act of barbarism '
Their reconstruction in the Acropolis Museum is based on several elements that remain in Athens , as well as copies of the marbles in London .
The modern glass and concrete building , at the foot of the Acropolis , holds about 350 artefacts and sculptures from the golden age of Athens that were previously held in a small museum on top of the Acropolis .
The structure is Greece 's answer to the British argument that there is nowhere in their country to house the Elgin marbles
Razia Iqbal , BBC arts correspondent
Read Razia 's blog
The £ 110 m ( $ 182 m ; 130 m euros ) structure , set out over three levels , also offers panoramic views of the stone citadel where they came from .
The third floor features the reconstruction of the Parthenon Marbles .
The copies are differentiated by their white colour - because they are plaster casts , contrasting with the weathered marble of the originals .
Museum director Prof Dimitris Pandermalis said the opening of the museum provides an opportunity to correct " an act of barbarism " in the sculptures ' removal .
" Tragic fate has forced them apart but their creators meant them to be together , " he said .
Bernard Tschumi , the building 's US - based architect , said : " It is a beautiful space that shows the frieze itself as a narrative - even with the plaster copies of what is in the British Museum - in the context of the Parthenon itself . "

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama on Monday warned doctors the U.S. healthcare system was a ticking time bomb and urged them to support his overhaul plan , which includes a public insurance program that many of them view with skepticism .
President Obama arrives to deliver remarks on the health care system at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in Chicago , June 15 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
Obama took his healthcare campaign to the annual meeting of the influential American Medical Association in Chicago , where he likened the U.S. healthcare system to struggling General Motors , which has filed for bankruptcy protection .
“ If we do not fix our healthcare system , America may go the way of GM ; paying more , getting less , and going broke , ” he said .
“ Make no mistake : the cost of our healthcare is a threat to our economy , ” said Obama , who wants a healthcare reform bill on his desk by October .
“ It is a ticking time bomb for the federal budget .
And it is unsustainable for the United States of America . ”
The president ’s speech comes as debate sharpens over elements of the healthcare overhaul being drafted by Congress , including how to pay for the plan and whether it should include a public insurance program to compete with private insurers .
Many opposition Republicans reject a public plan and say there is not enough support in Congress for it .
They argue it would ultimately drive private insurers out of business .
The AMA also has expressed doubts about any public plan that would be similar to the Medicare program for the elderly .
But the group said last week it was willing to consider other public options being considered by Congress , including member - owned cooperatives .
The U.S. healthcare industry costs about $ 2.5 trillion annually but leaves 46 million Americans uninsured and with little access to medical care .
Despite the cost , the U.S. system consistently ranks worse than other developed countries on many key measures .
MORE COMPETITION
Obama said a public healthcare plan would “ inject competition into the healthcare market that forces waste out of the system and keeps the insurance companies honest . ”
He acknowledged that expanding coverage to all Americans would have a short - term cost but stressed it would be deficit neutral in the next decade .
With some estimates putting the cost of healthcare reform at $ 1.2 trillion , critics say the reforms will only add to the country ’s growing mountain of debt .
“ There are already voices saying the numbers do n’t add up .
They are wrong , ” Obama said , outlining how he planned to pay for the reforms , including tax increases on wealthier Americans and savings in spending cuts .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
He took a swipe at Republicans and others who accuse him of trying to create a single , government - controlled healthcare system , accusing them of “ fear - mongering . ”
“ They ’ll give dire warnings about socialized medicine and government takeovers , long lines and rationed care , decisions made by bureaucrats and not doctors , ” he said .
“ We ’ve heard it all before and because these fear tactics have worked , things have kept getting worse . ”
In Washington , Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl predicted momentum for healthcare reform would slow as the public learns more about Democrats ’ plans .
“ There is a reason why the president says , ‘ If we do n’t get this done soon , it is not going to happen , ’ ” Kyl told reporters on Capitol Hill .
“ He knows momentum will inevitably slow for something that is extraordinarily costly , will deny people coverage that they already have , will ration their healthcare and could provide some kind of government insurance company that is going to drive out private insurance companies . ”
While Obama insisted he was not advocating caps on malpractice awards , he also called for exploring a range of ideas to scale back “ excessive defensive medicine . ”
Doctors have long complained they have to shoulder high malpractice insurance premiums because of the lack of limits on malpractice suits and those costs are often passed on to patients in the form of higher fees .
But the jury of four men and eight women rejected the defense argument , finding Rockefeller guilty on two of the four counts against him : parental kidnapping and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon .
He was acquitted of two lesser charges , assault and battery and providing a false name to police .
The verdict capped an extraordinary two - week trial , during which Deakin painted the defendant as a " self - centered , controlling , and manipulative " con man extraordinaire who has used a slew of aliases and bogus biographical details since coming to the United States from Bavaria in 1978 .
Rockefeller 's two lawyers tried to cast him as a mentally disturbed man who believed in the fantasy world he had created and said he should be acquitted on grounds of insanity .
" While Reigh was gone , I faced a mother 's worst nightmare : the possibility of losing a child without a trace , " Boss said in a victim impact statement read by Deakin .
" Since Reigh 's recovery and return , I have struggled to distance us both from the events of that terrifying week , to regain the normalcy of our lives , and to restore a sense of trust and well - being in Reigh . "
His former wife , Sandra Boss , who testified against him during the trial , was relieved when she learned of the conviction , said prosecutor David Deakin , who called her in Britain to tell her about the verdict .
According to his lawyers , Rockefeller 's brother and mother in Germany and his 8 - year - old daughter , Reigh , with whom he fled the city for six days , had not been in touch with him .
Once , his witty stories made him the center of attention at cocktail parties and fund - raising galas .
Yesterday , not one family member or friend sat in the courtroom as a jury convicted him of parental kidnapping and assault charges in the case that has drawn widespread attention for its tales of schemes , aliases , and betrayal .
He stood stoically as the verdict was read , his body rigid and his face devoid of emotion .
As he stood in Suffolk Superior Court yesterday listening first to the jury hand down its verdict and later a judge hand out his punishment , Rockefeller , whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter , wore a navy blue blazer and preppy red-striped tie .
But his reddish hair , once tousled , hung in long , limp tendrils .
His feet and wrists were shackled .
His face was pale .
Yesterday , the man who calls himself Clark Rockefeller was sentenced to four to five years in state prison for his conviction in the kidnapping of his daughter last summer , ending a colorful chapter in the bizarre saga of the German national whom police call a " person of interest " in an ongoing California homicide investigation .
He came to America at 17 to strike it rich , and for most of the last three decades he succeeded , mingling with the power elite of Southern California , the Upper East Side of Manhattan , and Beacon Hill in Boston .
Rockefeller , who had been held without bail since his arrest , has already served 314 days in jail , which will be credited to his sentence .
The jurors said the only facts they weighed in their decision were the ones presented during the trial .
" Expert witness testimony figured prominently , " jury foreman Michael Gregory said .
The defense presented two experts who testified that Rockefeller 's mental illnesses caused him to believe in his invented lives , including that he was a member of the storied Rockefeller family .
The state 's expert witness countered that Rockefeller suffers from a mental disorder but exaggerated his symptoms and was legally sane when he abducted his daughter .
" This was a complicated case and not as clear - cut as it might seem to those who have followed it only in the media , " said Gregory , a Harvard lecturer on law , who read from a prepared statement .
" We were very thorough in our deliberations . "
Before sentencing , one of Rockefeller 's lawyers , Jeffrey Denner , implored Judge Frank Gaziano to sentence his client to no more than two years , describing the defendant as a deeply troubled person who was a father " who loved his daughter too much . "
Gaziano acknowledged that Rockefeller was motivated partly by the despair he felt over the minor role he would play in his daughter 's life following the bitter divorce that gave Boss full custody of Reigh .
" The defendant was by all accounts a loving and devoted father to his daughter , " Gaziano said .
But the well - planned abduction was not the act of a desperate , impulsive man , he said .
" The defendant 's conduct cannot be brushed aside as a technical violation of a custody order where a distraught parent fails to return a child over a weekend , " Gaziano said .
" The defendant committed this crime with complete disregard for the anguish this would cause Ms. Boss . "
Denner also said that no matter what kind of sentence his client received , he would still be incarcerated for a substantial period of time .
Federal immigration officials have filed a request to detain Rockefeller , which means he will go into federal custody following his sentence and could wait for at least six months for a deportation hearing .
Also looming is an ongoing investigation in California , where prosecutors are reexamining the 1985 disappearance and presumed killing of John and Linda Sohus , a San Marino couple .
Rockefeller , who was the couple 's tenant at the time , has been described as a " person of interest " in that case .
Steve Whitmore , a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department , said yesterday that investigators monitored the trial in Boston , but that the verdict is not " directly of interest to us . "
" We are actively pursuing all leads with one goal in mind , and that is to solve this 24 - year - old case , " Whitmore said .
" We encourage [ Rockefeller ] to talk to investigators . "
The Rockefeller jury , made up mostly of people of college age , deliberated for more than four days , a tense stretch that Deakin admitted caused him to lose some sleep .
" It 's clear to me that this was an extremely intelligent and attentive jury , regardless of their age or any demographics , " Deakin said .
Juror Rachel Kenner told WCVB-TV : " It was very interesting to hear all the testimony .
I 've never served on a jury before .
The process was interesting .
It was a good group of people to work with . "
The case drew particular attention because of the many aliases Rockefeller used to charm his way into tony circles and because of the interest California authorities have shown in him .
Yesterday the courtroom was packed with local and national reporters .
Among the aliases Rockefeller used in the United States , according to testimony , was C. Mountbatten , Christopher C. Crowe , and Dr. Reiter , a cardiovascular surgeon in Las Vegas .
Even Boss , a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. , believed his outlandish tales of an aristocratic pedigree .
Her ordeal began on July 27 .
Rockefeller was walking down Marlborough Street , Reigh on his shoulders .
With them was Howard Yaffe , a social worker hired to supervise the visit .
A waiting sport utility vehicle driven by Rockefeller 's regular livery driver pulled up , and Rockefeller suddenly shoved Yaffe to the ground and threw his daughter into the SUV driven by Darrell Hopkins .
Yaffe tried to hold onto the car but fell to the ground , bruising his chin , knee , and hip .
He said he also suffered a concussion .
Six days later , police arrested Rockefeller in Baltimore , where he had bought an apartment for him and his daughter .
Asked about an appeal , Denner said that will be up to his client to decide .

MUSIC NEW - EMusic , NYC based on line music provider with 400,000 + subscribers paying a monthly fee to download is announcing today a deal that will add all Sony Music tunes over two years old to its roster , including material from key Sony artists like Michael Jackson , Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel .
From some time now , major labels have been skeptical of the economics behind eMusic ’s offer to consumers .
Subscribers to the eMusic “ basic ” plan , pay $ 11.99 a month to download 30 songs , or about 40 cents a song , far below the prices on Apple ’s iTunes .
Songs are in the MP3 format and do not have restrictions against copying .
As part of the new Sony deal , eMusic says it will slightly raise prices and reduce the number of downloads for some of its monthly plans .
Danny Stein , eMusic ’s chief executive , said the company had been in discussion with the major labels about adding their music for some time now .
It would seem that with the continued decline in music revenue , the labels are more willing to work with alternative revenue streams !
E-Music continues to talk with Warner Music , the Universal Music Group and EMI , said Mr Stein .

I posted something about Prop 8 on Facebook a week or two ago and one of my conservative - and - proud - of - it friends tried to make the argument : " Should we also allow polygamy and incestuous marriages ?
Because people are in LOVE ? "
I wanted to smack him .
Apples and oranges , people .
Apples and oranges .
If left up to me , the law would say that marriage is between TWO CONSENTING ADULTS ( that are not related to each other ) .
On the topic of : Control theory
Yesterday , PJ Eby sent the subscribers of his mailing list a link to an article describing a control theory / mindhacking insight he'd had .
With his permission , here 's a summary of that article .
I found it potentially life - changing .
The article seeks to answer the question , " why is it that people often stumble upon great self - help techniques or productivity tips , find that they work great , and then after a short while the techniques either become ineffectual or the people just plain stop using them anyway ? " , but I found it to have far greater applicability than just that .
Richard Kennaway already mentioned the case of driving a car as an example where the human brain uses control systems , and Eby mentioned another : ask a friend to hold their arm out straight , and tell them that when you push down on their hand , they should lower their arm .
And what you ’ll generally find is that when you push down on their hand , the arm will spring back up before they lower it ... and the harder you push down on the hand , the harder the arm will pop back up !
That 's because the control system in charge of maintaining the arm 's position will try to keep up the old position , until one consciously realizes that the arm has been pushed and changes the setting .
Control circuits are n't used just for guiding physical sequences of actions , they also regulate the workings of our mind .
A few hours before typing out a previous version of this post , I was starting to feel restless because I had n't accomplished any work that morning .
This has often happened to me in the past - if , at some point during the day , I have n't yet gotten started on doing anything , I begin to feel anxious and restless .
In other words , in my brain there 's a control circuit monitoring some estimate of " accomplishments today " .
If that value is n't high enough , it starts sending an error signal - creating a feeling of anxiety - in an attempt to bring that value into the desired range .
The problem with this is that more often than not , that anxiety does n't push me into action .
Instead I become paralyzed and incapable of getting anything started .
Eby proposes that this is because of two things : one , the control circuits are dumb and do n't actually realize what they 're doing , so they may actually take counter - productive action .
Two , there may be several control circuits in the brain which are actually opposed to each other .
Here we come to the part about productivity techniques often not working .
We also have higher - level controllers - control circuits influencing other control circuits .
Eby 's theory is that many of us have circuits that try to prevent us from doing the things we want to do .
When they notice that we 've found a method to actually accomplish something we 've been struggling with for a long time , they start sending an error signal ... causing neural reorganization , eventually ending up at a stage where we do n't use those productivity techniques anymore and solving the " crisis " of us actually accomplishing things .
Moreover , these circuits are to a certain degree predictive , and they can start firing when they pick up on a behavior that only even possibly leads to success - that 's when we hear about a great - sounding technique and for some reason never even try it .
A higher - level circuit , or a lower - level one set up by the higher - level circuit , actively suppresses the " let 's try that out " signals sent by the other circuits .
But why would we have such self - sabotaging circuits ?
This ties into Eby 's more general theory of the hazards of some kinds of self - motivation .
He uses the example of a predator who 's chased a human up to a tree .
The human , sitting on a tree branch , is in a safe position now , so circuits developed to protect his life send signals telling him to stay there and not to move until the danger is gone .
Only if the predator actually starts climbing the tree does the danger become more urgent and the human is pushed to actively flee .
Eby then extends this example into a social environment .
In a primitive , tribal culture , being seen as useless to the tribe could easily be a death sentence , so we evolved mechanisms to avoid giving the impression of being useless .
A good way to avoid showing your incompetence is to simply not do the things you 're incompetent at , or things which you suspect you might be incompetent at and that have a great associated cost for failure .
If it 's important for your image within the tribe that you do not fail at something , then you attempt to avoid doing that .
You might already be seeing where this is leading .
The things many of us procrastinate on are exactly the kinds of things that are important to us .
We 're deathly afraid of the consequences of what might happen if we fail at them , so there are powerful forces in play trying to make us not work on them at all .
Unfortunately , for beings living in modern society , this behavior is maladaptive and buggy .
It leads to us having control circuits which try to keep us unproductive , and when they pick up on things that might make us more productive , they start suppressing our use of those techniques .
Furthermore , the control circuits are stupid .
They are occasionally capable of being somewhat predictive , but they are fundamentally just doing some simple pattern - matching , oblivious to deeper subtleties .
They may end up reacting to wholly wrong inputs .
Consider the example of developing a phobia for a particular place , or a particular kind of environment .
Something very bad happens to you in that place once , and as a result , a circuit is formed in your brain that 's designed to keep you out of such situations in the future .
Whenever it detects that you are in a place resembling the one where the incident happened , it starts sending error signals to get you away from there .
Only that this is a very crude and unoptimal way of keeping you out of trouble - if a car hit you while you were crossing the road , you might develop a phobia for crossing the road .
Needless to say , this is more trouble than it 's worth .
Another common example might be a musician learning to play an instrument .
Learning musicians are taught to practice their instrument in a variety of postures , for otherwise a flutist who 's always played his flute sitting down may realize he can't play it while standing up !
The reason being that while practicing , he 's been setting up a number of control circuits designed to guide his muscles the right way .
Those control circuits have no innate knowledge of what muscle postures are integral for a good performance , however .
As a result , the flutist may end up with circuits that try to make sure they are sitting down when playing .
This kind of malcalibration extends to higher - level circuits as well .
Eby writes :
I know this now , because in the last month or so , I ’ve been struggling to identify my “ top - level ” master control circuits .
And you know what I found they were controlling for ?
Things like :
* Being “ good ”
* Doing the “ right ” thing
* “ Fairness ”
But do n’t be fooled by how harmless or even “ good ” these phrases sound .
Because , when I broke them down to what subcontrollers they were actually driving , it turned out that “ being good ” meant “ do things for others while ignoring your own needs and being resentful ” !
“ Fairness ” , meanwhile , meant , “ accumulate resentment and injustices in order to be able to justify being selfish later . ”
And “ doing the right thing ” translated to , “ do n’t do anything unless you can come up with a logical justification for why it ’s right , so you do n’t get in trouble , and no - one can criticize you . ”
Ouch !
Now , if you look at that list , nowhere on there is something like , “ go after what I really want and make it happen ” .
Actually doing anything – in fact , even deciding to do anything !
– was entirely conditional on being able to justify my decisions as “ fair ” or “ right ” or “ good ” , within some extremely twisted definitions of those words !
So that 's the crux of the issue .
We are wired with a multitude of circuits designed for controlling our behavior ... but because those circuits are often stupid , they end up in conflict with each other , and end up monitoring values that do n't actually represent the things they ought to .
While Eby provides few references and no peer - reviewed experimental work to support his case of motivation systems being controlled in this way , I find it to mesh very well with everything I know about the brain .
I took the phobia example from a textbook on biological psychology , while the flutist example came from a lecture by a neuroscientist emphasizing the stupidity of the cerebellum 's control systems .
Building on systems that were originally developed to control motion and hacking them to also control higher behavior is a very evolution - like thing to do .
We already develop control systems for muscle behavior starting from the time when we first learn to control our body as infants , so it 's very plausible that we'd also develop such mechanisms for all kinds of higher cognition .
The mechanism by they work is also fundamentally very simple , making it easy for new circuits to form : a person ends up in an unpleasant situation , causing an emotional subsystem to flood the whole brain with negative feedback , leading to pattern recognizers which were active at the time to start activating the same kind of negative feedback the next time when they pick up on the same input .
( At its simplest , it 's probably a case of simple Hebbian learning . )
Furthermore , since reading his text , I have noticed several things in myself which could only be described as control circuits .
After reading Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong for a long time , I 've found myself noticing whenever I have a train of thought that seems to be indicative of a number of certain kinds of cognitive biases .
In retrospect , that is probably a control circuit that has developed to detect the general appearance of a biased thought and to alert me about it .
The anxiety circuit I already mentioned .
A closely related circuit is one that causes me to need plenty of time to accomplish whatever it is that I 'm doing - if I only have a couple of hours before a deadline , I often freeze up and end up unable of doing anything .
This leads to me being at my most productive in the mornings , when I have a feeling of having the whole day for myself and of not being in any rush .
That 's easily interpreted as a circuit that looks at the remaining time and sends sending an alarm when the time runs low .
Actually , the circuit in question is probably even stupid than that , as the feeling of not having any time is often tied only what the clock is , not to the time when I 'll be going to bed .
If I get up at 2 PM and go to bed at 4 AM , I have just as much time as if I 'd get up at 9 AM and went to bed at 11 PM , but the circuit in question does n't recognize this .
So , what can we do about conflicting circuits ?
Simply recognizing them for what they are is already a big step forward , one which I feel has already helped me overcome some of their effects .
Some of them can probably be dismantled simply by identifying them , working out their purpose and deciding it to be unnecessary .
( I suspect that this process might actually set up new circuits whose function is to counteract the signals sent by the harmful ones .
Maybe .
I 'm not very sure of what the actual neural mechanism might be . )
Eby writes :
So , you want to build Desire and Awareness by tuning in to the right qualities to perceive .
Then , you need to eliminate any conflicts that come up .
Now , a lot of times , you can do this by simple negotiation with yourself .
Just sit and write down all your objections or issues about something , and then go through them one at a time , to figure out how you can either work around the problem , or find another way to get your other needs met .
Of course , you have to enter this process in good faith ; if you judge yourself for say , wanting lots of chocolate , and decide that you should n’t want it , that ’s not going to work .
But it might work , to be willing to give up chocolate for a while , in order to lose weight .
The key is that you need to actually imagine what it would be like to give it up , and then find out whether you can be “ okay ” with that .
Now , sadly , about 97 % of the people who read this are going to take that last paragraph and go , “ yeah , sure , I ’m going to give up [ whatever ] ” , but without actually considering what it would be like to do so .
And those people are going to fail .
And I kind of debated whether or not I should even mention this method here , because frankly , I do n’t trust most people ’s controllers any further than I can reprogram them ( so to speak ) .
See , I know from bitter experience that my own controllers for things like “ being smart ” used to make me rationalize this sort of thing , skipping the actual mental work involved in a technique , because “ clearly I ’m smart enough not to need to do all that . ”
And so I ’d assume that just “ thinking ” about it was enough , without really going through the mental experience needed to make it work .
So , most of the people who read this , are going to take that paragraph above where I explained the deep , dark , master - level mindhacking secret , and find a way to ignore it .
They ’re going to say things like , “ Is that all ? ” “ Oh , I already knew that . ”
And they ’re not going to really sit down and consider all the things that might conflict with what they say they want .
If they want to be wealthy , for example , they ’re almost certainly not going to sit down and consider whether they ’ll lose their friends by doing so , or end up having strained family relations .
They ’re not considering whether they ’re going to feel guilty for making a lot of money when other people in the world do n’t have any , or for doing it easily when other people are working so hard .
They ’re not going to consider whether being wealthy or fit or confident will make them like the people they hate , or whether maybe they ’re really only afraid of being broke !
But all of them will read everything I ’ve just written , and assume it does n’t apply to them , or that they ’ve already taken all that into account .
Only they have n’t .
Because if they had , they would have already changed .
That 's a pretty powerful reminder not to ignore your controllers .
When you 've been reading this , some controller that tries to keep you from doing things has probably already picked up on the excitement some emotional system might now be generating ... meaning that you might be about to stumble upon a technique that might actually make you more productive ... causing signals to be sent out to suppress attempts to even try it out .
Simply acknowleding its existence is n't going to be enough - you need to actively think things out , identify different controllers within you , and dismantle them .
I feel I 've managed to avoid the first step , of not doing anything even after becoming aware of the problem .
I 've been actively looking at different control circuits , some of which have plagued me for quite a long time , and I at least seem to have managed to overcome them .
My worry is that there might be some high - level circuit which is even now coming online to prevent me from using this technique - to make me forget about the whole thing , or to simply not use it even though I know of it .
It feels that the best way to counteract that is to try to consciously set up new circuits dedicated to the task of monitoring for the presence of new circuits , and alarming me of their presence .
In other words , keep actively looking for anything that might be a mental control circuit , and teach myself to notice them .
( And now , Eby , please post any kind of comment here so that we can vote it up and give you your fair share of this post 's karma . :) )
This post is a sneak preview about building Haskell shared libraries on Linux .
We 'll look at how to use ghc to make a standalone Haskell shared library that exports C functions .
We could use this shared library as part of a bigger project ( without having to use ghc for the final linking ) or we could load it dynamically , e.g. as a plugin in some other program .
This work is being supported by the IHG and it builds on the hard work of several other people over the last few years ( see the first post in this series for the history and credits )
Building GHC with shared libs support
For starters you need the latest development version of GHC .
See these instructions on getting the sources and doing the configure , build and install steps .
The only non-standard thing you need to do is to use ./ configure -- enable - shared .
Note that this has only been tested on Linux x86 - 64 and x86 , though in the past , the shared lib support has also worked on Linux PPC and OSX PPC .
Currently what you get is a ghc that itself is statically linked but it can build programs and shared libraries that dynamically link against the runtime system and base libraries .
Building programs that use shared libs
For example , for " hello world " :
$ ghc -- make - dynamic Hello.hs
It is interesting to look at the output of the ldd program :
$ ldd ./ Hello
I 'll not paste the whole output , but here 's a bit of it :
libHSbase - 4.0.0.0-ghc6.11.so =>
/opt/ghc/lib/ghc-6.11/base-4.0.0.0/libHSbase-4.0.0.0-ghc6.11.so ( 0x00007f8959aff000 )
( I 've simplified the ghc version slightly )
If you were to look at the full output what you would notice is that it links against each Haskell package as a separate . so file .
What is more , it is able to find the shared libs even though they are not in a standard location like / usr / local / lib .
This is because by default it is using the - rpath mechanism .
It is also possible to build binaries in a mode that does not embed an rpath which might be more suitable for deployment .
Building shared libs
Suppose we have a module Foo.hs that uses the FFI to export a C function called foo ( ) :
module Foo where import Foreign .
C foreign export ccall foo :: CInt ->
CInt foo :: CInt -> CInt foo = ...
we can build it into a shared library :
$ ghc -- make - dynamic - shared - fPIC Foo.hs -o libfoo.so
We need to use - dynamic , - shared and - fPIC .
The - dynamic flag tells ghc at the compile step to produce code so that it can link dynamically to dependent packages .
At the link step it tells ghc to actually link dynamically to dependent packages .
The - shared flag tells ghc to link a shared library rather than a program .
The - fPIC flag tells ghc to make code that is suitable to include into a shared library .
If we were to break it down into separate compile and link steps then we would use :
$ ghc - dynamic - fPIC -c Foo.hs $ ghc - dynamic - shared Foo.o Foo_stub . o -o libfoo.so
In principle you can use - shared without - dynamic in the link step .
That would mean to statically link the rts all the base libraries into your new shared library .
This would make a very big , but standalone shared library .
However that would require all the static libraries to have been built with - fPIC so that the code is suitable to include into a shared library and we do n't do that at the moment .
If we use ldd again to look at the libfoo .
so that we 've made we will notice that it is missing a dependency on the rts library .
This is problem that we 've yet to sort out , so for the moment we can just add the dependency ourselves :
$ ghc -- make - dynamic - shared - fPIC Foo.hs -o libfoo .
so \ - lHSrts - ghc6.11 - optl - Wl , - rpath,/opt/ghc/lib/ghc-6.11/
The reason it's not linked in yet is because we need to be able to switch which version of the rts we 're using without having to relink every library .
For example we want to be able to switch between the debug , threaded and normal rts versions .
It 's quite possible to do this and it just needs a bit more rearranging in the build system to sort it out .
Once it 's done you 'll even be able to switch rts at runtime , eg :
$ LD_PRELOAD=/opt/ghc/lib/ghc-6.11/libHSrts_debug-ghc6.11.so $ ./ Hello
Going back to our libfoo .
so , now that it is linked against the rts it is completely standalone , we can link it into a C program using just gcc , or we can use dlopen ( ) to load libfoo .
so at runtime .
Assuming we 've got libfoo .
so in the current directory , we can link it into a C program :
$ gcc main .c -o main - lfoo -L .
If you use ldd now it 'll tell you that libfoo .
so is not found .
Remember that the runtime linker does n't look in the same places as the static linker .
We told the static linker to look in the current directory with the flag - L. .
For the dynamic linker we can either move our libfoo .
so to /usr / local / lib or we can embed a path into the binary that tells the runtime linker where to look .
One particularly neat way to do this is to tell it to look for the library not at an absolute path , but relative to the program itself :
$ gcc main .c -o main - lfoo - L. - Wl , - rpath , '$ ORIGIN '
The Linux runtime linker understands the special variable $ ORIGIN and interprets it as the location of the executable .
This also works on Solaris .
Windows and OS X have something similar .
This makes it possible to distribute binaries along with shared libraries and have the whole lot fully relocatable .
If we want to load the library and call functions at runtime we would use C code like :
void * dl = dlopen ( "./libfoo.so " , RTLD_LAZY ) ; int ( * foo ) ( int a ) = dlsym ( dl , " foo " ) ; printf ( " %d
" , foo ( 2500 ) ) ;
In this case we do not need to link our C program against libfoo .
so ( we just need - ldl for the dynamic linking functions like dlopen ) .
$ gcc main .c -o main - ldl
Now one thing to watch out for is that before you call any exported Haskell function , you have to start up the runtime system .
If you just call foo ( ) directly then it 'll emit a helpful error message to remind you .
We have to use the C API of the Haskell FFI to initialise the runtime system .
This is a little tiresome .
In our case it 'll look like :
hs_init ( &argc , &argv ) ; hs_add_root(__stginit_Foo ) ;
The first line is specified by the Haskell FFI .
The second is a GHC 'ism .
It initialises the module containing the function we 're going to call .
If you 're exporting a plugin API then hopefully the API will support some kind of plugin initialisation .
In that case you can include the above C code to initialise the rts before any of the Haskell functions get called .
We can do that by adding the above initialisation code into a C function and export that from our shared lib :
void init ( void ) ; void init ( void ) { ... }
Then we would add init into our shared lib :
$ ghc - fPIC -c init.c $ ghc - dynamic - shared Foo.o Foo_stub . o init.o -o libfoo.so \ - lHSrts - ghc6.11 - optl - Wl , - rpath,/opt/ghc/lib/ghc-6.11/
Of course the calling program has to call init ( ) first .
If you have to support a C API where there is no initialiser then we can use this trick :
static void init ( void ) __attribute__ ( ( constructor ) ) ; void init ( void ) { ... }
GOP ’s New Attack on Health Care Reform Bill : It Promotes Walking !
Despite a growing awareness among conservatives that walking and biking are causes worth backing , Republicans on Capitol Hill continue to condemn bike - ped programs as wasteful " pork " .
The GOP ’s latest potshots at sustainable transportation come during debate over a health care bill that focuses mainly on insurance and hospitals , but also includes a public health grant program aimed at encouraging exercise .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) does n’t think walking has much to do with public health .
Photo : MSNBC
Sen. Mike Enzi ( WY ) , senior Republican on the health committee , slammed the legislation for seeking to " pave sidewalks , build jungle gyms " and expand bike access to help improve public health :
We need to root out the waste , fraud and abuse
that is driving up health care costs — not create a whole slew of new
wasteful programs .
It ’s unclear whether Enzi knows that the federal government already has a program to encourage biking and walking , nor whether he ’s aware of their demonstrated public health benefits .
But his talking point is already migrating to other Republicans , who have twisted the health care bill ’s proposed " community transformation " grants into a big - government bogeyman .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) picked up Enzi ’s baton today in a speech against the health bill :
The Obama administration 's proposal for reforming financial regulation has many useful features .
In particular , the proposed consumer financial protection agency likely would have prevented many of the worst abuses in the subprime market over the last decade , as well as in other areas of consumer lending .
Other measures , like requiring that standardised derivatives be traded as clearing houses and that hedge funds register their interests with the Securities and Exchange Commission are positive steps towards modernising regulation , although they do not go far enough .
The US Treasury should be trying to standardise all derivatives and have them exchange traded to maximise transparency .
There also should be increased public disclosure of hedge fund dealings .
But , these are not the biggest flaw in the administration 's regulatory proposals .
The biggest flaw is that they help to support the view that the main problem was inadequate regulations , rather than failed regulators .
The basic story of this crisis was not that the regulatory authorities lacked the ability to rein in this disaster before it was too late .
Rather , the regulators – most importantly the Fed – opted not to use their power to rein in the housing bubble .
The Fed had ample tools at its disposal to burst the housing bubble before it expanded to such a dangerous size .
To start , the Fed could have tried just providing information .
First , Alan Greenspan could have devoted his congressional testimonies and other public appearances to warning about the housing bubble .
These warnings would include both a careful description of the evidence for the bubble ( with tables and charts ) and a detailed account of the damage that would be caused to both the economy and the financial sector from its collapse .
The Fed could have also committed its staff of thousands of economists to detailing the case for a housing bubble and drawing out the implications for various regions and sectors of its collapse .
If Greenspan had followed this route , rather than insisting that there was no bubble , it is likely that it would have been sufficient by itself to burst the bubble .
No major financial institution can simply ignore the Fed , and there was no plausible response to the argument showing the existence of a housing bubble .
If talk proved insufficient , the Fed should have used its regulatory authority to clamp down on many of the bad loans that were feeding the bubble .
It eventually did issue guidelines that would have precluded many of these loans , but not until the middle of 2008 .
Finally , if necessary , the Fed should have raised interest rates until the bubble burst .
This would have been undesirable , since it would slow growth and raise unemployment , but it still would have been better than letting the bubble grow and create the basis for even more pain later .
And the story of the crisis is the story of a collapsed housing bubble .
The discussion of financial issues has largely worked to hide the centrality of the housing bubble to the crisis .
If there had been no credit default swaps , collateralised debt obligations or subprime and Alt - A mortgages but the housing bubble had still grown to $ 8tn , we would be in pretty much the same economic situation that we are in today .
Residential construction would have collapsed due to a huge glut in the housing market , and consumption would have plunged as a result of the loss of $ 8tn in household wealth .
The financial problems created by failed regulation do complicate the picture , but the fundamental picture is a very simple one of a collapsed bubble causing demand to plummet .
Politicians and regulators have a direct interest in portraying the crisis as being the result of an inadequate regulatory apparatus rather than failed regulators , because failed regulators should get fired .
However , by not holding failed regulators accountable , this reform proposal is setting the grounds for the next crisis .
Even a perfect regulatory structure will not work if the regulators do not do their job .
They will not have an incentive to do their job if there are no consequences for failure .
In this case , we have seen the most disastrous possible regulatory failure .
This is like a drunken school bus driver who gets all his passengers killed driving into oncoming traffic , and no one is held accountable .
The message to future regulators is , therefore , to simply go along with the powers that be ( ie the financial industry ) , and you will never suffer any negative consequences .

Hey .
What 're you doing all the way down here ?
You get lost ?
Just looking around ?
Cool .
I like you .
Three decades ago , Santa Clara County gave a nonprofit agency the job of helping those harmed by crime .
The experiment proved successful , and the supervisors should stick with it .
On Thursday , they should renew the contract with the agency , FACES , and reject District Attorney Dolores Carr ’s proposal to assume control of the $ 2.2 million state - funded program .
In all but four California counties , the prosecutor ’s office already runs the program for crime victims .
Carr promises to do it more efficiently , using paralegals who can be cross - trained in victim assistance .
But FACES ’ prominent supporters , including retired judges LaDoris Cordell and Len Edwards , make a compelling case that FACES should remain in control .
With a staff of 22 , FACES helps people traumatized by crime and guides them through complex applications for compensation .
It represents victims regardless of whether they plan to testify and whether the crimes against them will be prosecuted .
When a district attorney runs the program , some victims may feel pressure to serve as witnesses or may simply not seek help — particularly ethnic minorities and immigrants distrustful of authorities .
Edwards , a FACES board member , said Carr ’s proposal would be “ an unfortunate step backward . ”
He said prosecutors in other counties have resisted judges ’ calls to follow FACES ’ lead and expand the program to family courts , where victims of domestic violence need an advocate .
The district attorney oversees the FACES grant , so Carr had good reason to scrutinize the program .
Last summer , after the executive director and two senior managers left the agency in an office shake - up , Carr requested an audit .
It found no financial malfeasance , but it did cite poor management , including subpar data and few measurements of performance .
The audit also noted that the grant has not been competitively bid for years .
That is not illegal , but the supervisors need to justify it — which will be difficult without better measures of effectiveness .
Pat Mitchell took over as executive director last summer and has begun to improve management controls .
The auditor commended her for it and praised the better communication between her and Carr.
FACES also has significantly increased the number of victims served .
Carr and the supervisors should hold FACES accountable for performance , but the nonprofit model overall has worked well .
Rather than see it end here , other counties should adopt it .
The most successful hybrid of old and new media comes from the last place you ’d expect .
How NPR ’s digital smarts , nonprofit structure , and good old - fashioned shoe leather just might save the news .
Days before the inauguration of Barack Obama , three dozen essential employees of the country ’s largest news organization are finalizing logistics in their Washington , D.C. , war room .
The A team of editors and producers will arrive the night before and sleep in cots on - premises , while reporters take up positions around D.C. in subfreezing temperatures , to go live at 5 a.m .
Remote broadcasting units will be powered with battery packs stuck inside insulated pizza boxes , heated with chemical hand warmers .
The rambunctious room quiets when the silver - haired editorial director delivers his Hill Street Blues speech :
Be careful out there .
“ What I worry about is something bad happening in the real world , ” he says .
“ We are planning coverage of a scripted event , but it may not be scripted . ”

As the world now knows , the big day went off with scarcely a hitch .
And National Public Radio proved once again that it ’s the country ’s brainiest , brawniest news - gathering giant , as several million people tuned in and more than 40,000 sent in updates from across the Mall and around the world by YouTube , SMS , Twitter , Flickr , and iPhone .
Yes , it ’s true :
In one of the great under - told media success stories of the past decade , NPR has emerged not as the bespectacled schoolmarm of our imagination but as a massive news machine poised for what Dick Meyer , editorial director for digital media , half - jokingly calls “ world domination . ”
NPR ’s listenership has nearly doubled since 1999 , even as newspaper circulation dropped off a cliff .
Its programming now reaches 26.4 million listeners weekly — far more than USA Today ‘s 2.3 million daily circ or Fox News ’ 2.8 million prime - time audience .
When newspapers were closing bureaus , NPR was opening them , and now runs 38 around the world , better than CNN .
It has 860 member stations — “ boots on the ground in every town ” that no newspaper or TV network can claim .
It has moved boldly into new media as well : 14 million monthly podcast downloads , 8 million Web visitors , NPR Mobile , an open platform , a social network , even crowdsourcing .
And although the nonprofit has been hit by the downturn like everyone else , its multiple revenue streams look far healthier long term than the ad - driven model of commercial media .
( In 2003 , Joan Kroc , widow of McDonald ’s founder Ray , gave a $ 200 million endowment to NPR , the largest gift ever to an American cultural institution .
She must have gotten one hell of a tote bag . )
In one of the great undertold media success stories of the past decade , NPR has emerged as a massive news machine poised for what one exec half - jokingly calls “ world domination . ”
In the past few months , a fresh crop of new executives and editors have arrived at NPR from the storm - tossed commercial media world .
Meyer came from CBS ; Kinsey Wilson landed from USA Today as general manager for digital media ; and in January , Vivian Schiller joined from NYTimes.com as the new CEO .
Their mission — seizing even greater audience share — is more aggressive than most for - profit operations ’ in this age of retrenchment .
But with that ambition comes great responsibility .
“ Part of our desire to bring more NPR to more people is that , with the evisceration of commercial journalism , there ’s a dire need for it , ” Meyer says .
“ Major mainstream stories are increasingly going uncovered .
And I think it might be the nonprofit journalism world that meets that huge market need , which is also a basic need of a democratic society and an information - based economy . ” ■ ■ ■
It ’s a bit of a mystery how NPR managed to grow its audience so dramatically even as other news outlets suffered .
Brand - new CEO
Schiller has one of the most popular theories .
On her ninth day of work , her office is still full of congratulatory flower arrangements — the perfect setting for her rosy take on the source of NPR ’s true strength : the human element .
When her appointment was announced , she explains , she got more than a thousand emails from family , friends , and old coworkers , and each had a personal anecdote about a local station or drive - time ritual .
“ I ’ve worked in a lot of big media companies now , ” she says .
“ I mean , this is my fifth [ The New York Times , Discovery Channel , CNN , TBS ] , and I ’ve never seen such a connection between the institution and the audience members .
The power of that is extraordinary .
The journalism and the credibility — that ’s the obvious stuff .
It ’s the personal connection that ’s the secret sauce . ”
That intimate , knowing voice in your ear is just one of several characteristics of public radio that adapt shockingly well to a world of information overload .
Another is its lower cost , which is helped by the near - absence of a star system or marketing budget .
( “ There are TV news anchors whose salary is three times the budget of Morning Edition , ” says veteran VP for news Ellen Weiss . )
Then there ’s convenience .
NPR board chair and Harvard Business School professor Howard Stevenson says , “ As commutes lengthen , the importance of drive - time radio has grown .
People do n’t have 15 minutes to sit at home and read the newspaper , but you can get accurate , in - depth reporting as you sit in traffic , ” or make dinner , or clean out the garage .
It ’s a screen - free complement to online browsing .
At least as important as those factors — or so journalists would like to believe — is NPR ’s commitment to doing better work .
Former CEO Ken Stern and Kevin Klose , president of NPR from 1998 to 2008 , are both credited with shelving musty classical music programming to beef up the news operation .
That evolution began with Tiananmen Square in 1989 , the Gulf War in 1990 , and the debut of cable news as a competitor , says Weiss .
When she started 27 years ago , “ it was n’t really a primary news organization , ” she recalls .
“ We used to say we ’ll do a story a day late and call it ‘ analysis . ’
Now we get up earlier in the morning . ”
That means key news managers now come in at 7 a.m. , and there ’s a 24 - hour staff for flagship Morning Edition .

Combine the personal touch with the patience to do serious explanatory journalism , and you get one of NPR ’s major editorial triumphs of the past year : “ The Giant Pool of Money , ” an hour - long episode of This American Life about the financial crisis first broadcast in May 2008 .
The show was the first - ever coproduction between NPR and TAL ( Ira Glass & Co. are produced by WBEZ in Chicago and Public Radio International , an independent production company ) .
NPR business reporter Adam Davidson and TAL producer Alex Blumberg coaxed global economists into breaking down terms such as derivatives , tranches , short selling , and credit swaps .
They used vivid narrative and humor to bring these stultifying concepts to life .
You hear from guys like Glen Pizzolorusso , who spent his days approving “ liar loans ” and his nights at Marquee with Christina Aguilera .
Throughout , Blumberg and Davidson ’s frank dismay at the chicanery comes through .
To hear Davidson tell it , the economic crisis demands public - radio - style journalism .
“ I do n’t think this is a good story for newspapers , to be honest with you .
Because it ’s an emotional story , it ’s a shocking story .
We ’re used to all the people who formed the architecture of our economic infrastructure having the voice of God — like Alan Greenspan .
They ’re the experts and they understand the world and they ’re going to explain it .
And business journalists had that tone too .
We ’re now in a world where anybody who tells you they know exactly what ’s going on , you can just dismiss them as a liar . ”
To continue to get that kind of programming out to as many consumers as possible , everyone from Schiller on down sees technology as the key .
“ We have to skate where the puck is going , ” she says ( in what may be the first use of a hockey metaphor by an NPR CEO ) .
Certainly “ The Giant Pool of Money ” demonstrated how easily a strong NPR show can be repurposed as multiple digital streams .
It has been downloaded as a podcast more than half a million times and spawned a thrice - weekly NPR podcast and blog , Planet Money , which are getting 1 million downloads and 400,000 page views a month , respectively .
But NPR ’s digital efforts are much broader .
It was the first mainstream - media organization to enter podcasting and often has several programs in the iTunes top 10 .
An open platform introduced last year allows listeners to mix their own podcasts and otherwise play around with NPR content — one fan built an NPR iPhone app .
And NPR is putting all of its editorial employees — every editor , producer , and reporter — through multimedia training , with support from the Knight Foundation .
Traffic on NPR.org grew 78 % from 2007 to 2008 .
New - media pundits , such as Buzzmachine ’s Jeff Jarvis , author of What Would Google Do ? , applaud NPR ’s catholic approach .
“ It ’s got very smart people thinking about its online strategy , ” Jarvis says .
“ Like the BBC , it sees itself as a public trust , so its aim is to get its content distributed as widely as possible .
Old media expected us to come to them .
Now they need to come to us . ”
Multiplatform distribution dovetails nicely with NPR ’s public - service mission , and — significantly — helps attract a younger audience too : NPR ’s median radio listener is 49 ; its median podcast listener is 33 .

New technology may be the key to NPR ’s future success , but it also represents a significant threat to its current revenue model .
Like many families , NPR and its member stations are fighting about money .
Public radio has a highly collaborative structure that inverts that of most commercial media .
The nation ’s public - broadcasting stations pooled their resources to start National Public Radio in 1970 , and they still control its board .
NPR does n’t broadcast , but produces Morning Edition , All Things Considered , and several other shows and sends them to local stations where they ’re blended with regional coverage and shows produced elsewhere , such as Fresh Air from WHYY in Philadelphia .
Forty - three percent of NPR ’s budget comes from the dues and fees member stations send in for those rebroadcast rights , prorated by audience — $ 1.4 million a year from L.A. ’s KCRW , for example .
Twenty - nine percent comes from corporate underwriting ( the 10 - second spots that stand in for ads ) and another 15 % from foundations and grants , less than 2 % of which is government money .
That means the money you send in to your local station ’s pledge drive really is the biggest piece of the pie .
By offering its content online , however , NPR effectively becomes a competitor to its member stations , undercutting the exclusive broadcast rights they pay for .
Paul Farhi , who covers public media for The Washington Post , explains , “ If I ’m running a station in Chapel Hill or Bloomington , I pay dues to NPR to get the marquee programming that brings people to my station — All Things Considered and Morning Edition .
I do n’t care about your digital initiative , or your All Songs Considered [ primarily a podcast ] — you ’re siphoning my dues to build your national brand .
That ’s the essence of the conflict . ”
For now , audio streams of the tent - pole programs are posted on NPR.org with a time delay and are not offered as podcasts , a compromise that satisfies no one .

It was Schiller ’s predecessor , Ken Stern , who oversaw the aggressive move into live streaming and podcasting , making member stations unhappy enough to push him out last year .
Many insiders say Schiller was chosen in part for her diplomatic skills on this very issue .
Indeed , she tells me she does n’t see conflict in NPR ’s digital divide , but rather an “ enormous opportunity … to build the future of media in partnership with those stations . ”
Her challenge , she says , is to “ figure out a way to work together so that people in every community who go to their local NPR - member - station sites can get the benefit of NPR ’s international , national , and local coverage in a seamless experience . ”
Not so fast , says Ruth Seymour , who has been at KCRW in Los Angeles since the early 1970s and is now the general manager .
“ There is a hope on NPR ’s part that somehow we can work collaboratively online .
I am truly dubious about it .
In online , everybody is competitive with everybody else .
You are not limited anymore by your coverage area . ”
KCRW , for example , is known for the indie - and world - music show Morning Becomes Eclectic , which is streamed online , placing kcrw.com in direct competition with a new national site , npr.org / music .
The latter features lots of video content , streams of live concerts , and exclusive “ First Listens ” of albums from artists ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Animal Collective .
It also works with 12 partner stations around the country — emphatically not including KCRW .
“ This is our turf , ” Seymour says .
“ We happen to be in a market that is a capital for the entertainment business .
I do n’t know how you can be connected in Washington .
The business is n’t there . ”
NPR ’s new staffers in digital media say they should be able to tamp down the conflict by goosing online fund - raising to support digital initiatives and supplement member - station dues .
They ’re helped along by an audience that is perhaps more ready than most for the radical concept of paying for the content they consume .
“ One ca n’t help but look at the success the Obama campaign had in direct engagement with the base that they were trying to mobilize and in fund - raising , ” says Wilson , the head of digital media .
“ They were not just making a direct appeal but creating an ecosystem and a culture that encouraged steady low - level giving . ”
Meyer agrees , “ When we had to announce layoffs and cuts in December , there were comments on some of our stories : ‘ How can we help ?
Where ’s the give button ? ’
There ’s a sense that the organization is leaving money on the table .
People would like to contribute more to this service that they adore and depend on . ”
Of course , if anyone knew how to support quality journalism exclusively online , the media business would n’t be hemorrhaging jobs .
Currently , digital underwriting on NPR.org makes up 12 % of total corporate - sponsorship revenue , a figure that ’s growing but has a long way to go before it matches the power of the on-air appeal .
Last fall , NPR folded a youth - skewed news show called The Bryant Park Project , which had found an audience online but for which stations were reluctant to pay .
Besides , even if NPR.org somehow became a fund - raising powerhouse , it would still have to work out a revenue - and content - sharing scheme to please reluctant station managers like Seymour .
This is where having 860 stations becomes more of a block than a boon .
“ The business aspect of online , no one wants to pay too much attention to , ” says Seymour , “ because the promise is so enticing and seductive and overwhelming that we ’re all like groupies .
But the fact is , no one has come up with a feasible business plan , and that ’s a major concern .
So how do you sustain this gorgeous blonde ?
How do you keep her in furs ? ” ■ ■ ■
Before it can become the king of all media , NPR has to weather this downturn like everybody else .
All sources of funding , from corporate underwriting to foundation grants , dipped last year , causing a projected $ 23 million budget shortfall for fiscal 2009 .
NPR cut staff by 7 % and canceled two shows ( News and Notes and Day to Day ) , both out of NPR West , the L.A. production outpost opened to great fanfare just a few years ago .
It ’s NPR ’s worst budget crunch since the early 1980s , although it now has a protected endowment and was able to draw on up to $ 15 million in reserves to make up the shortfall .

Yet execs and reporters alike are confident that because audiences have stayed strong , and because NPR does n’t depend primarily on advertising , it will make it through this down cycle and come out even healthier .
“ One of the things that struck me as a newcomer is the strong sense of optimism that still pervades the organization , ” says digital media GM Wilson .
“ It stands in quite stark contrast to the atmosphere you encounter in newsrooms these days .
There is still a very strong passion around the mission , what we ’re able to do on a day - to - day basis .
And that may be fairly unique . ”
As a result , someday soon we may be looking at a world where public radio emerges as the main local - news source in many communities coast to coast .
In Minneapolis , where the Star - Tribune is in bankruptcy , for example , the population may be about to get a lot less of columnist Chip Scoggins on the Vikings and a lot more of Garrison Keillor musing about Powdermilk Biscuits .
It ’s worth asking what might be lost in the transition .
NPR ’s audience may be surprisingly balanced among liberals , conservatives , and moderates , but it ’s overwhelmingly college - educated and affluent .
“ I think people like to listen to us because at the end of the day it makes them feel a little smarter , ” says Weiss .
So will NPR have to bone up on the wildcat offense , or will the rest of America learn to love WTO coverage from Singapore ?
Either way , to cement NPR ’s success in this climate , Schiller must bring to bear all of her considerable skill and charm to get people to hit that give button .
“ It ’s tough , ” she says .
“ I do n’t want to sugarcoat it .
However , this is an opportunity to make our case , which is that NPR is one of the most , if not the most , vital news and information organizations .
I certainly plan to pitch that case to our listeners who give to local stations , to foundations , to corporations , internally to our constituents , to anyone who will listen .
And I believe it to be true . ”
“ It ’s quicker and far more accurate , ” Mr. Biddiscombe said .
But the system is valuable not only for speeding checkout times and for keeping track of different varieties of bulk vegetables and fruits sold .
It also prevents another checkout problem : cashiers mistaking organic vegetables for less expensive , conventionally grown ones , and ringing them up for the lower price .
“ The price difference between organic and field tomatoes may be 40 cents a pound or more , ” he said .
“ When they are n’t rung up as organic , that bites into our profit margins . ”
Kelly Kirschner , senior marketing manager at Sinclair International , a company in Fresno , Calif. , that makes labeling for produce , said DataBars were gradually becoming popular because of limitations of the standard bar code .
The standard code , she said , “ takes up too much space to be used on loose produce , plus it is for fixed - weight items ”  for example , 12 - ounce boxes of cereal .
The DataBar , by contrast , allows stores to scan for variable weight information .
The labels help stores keep better records , she said .
If retailers are receiving Red Delicious apples from three separate suppliers at prices of $ 8 to $ 10 a carton , and all the apples are dumped into a single bin , retailers can still tell how many they sold of each lot , as each DataBar is tied to a purchase record .
The next use of DataBars at the supermarket will probably be for goods bought at the delicatessen counter , and for fresh meats and poultry , said Stephen Arens , director , industry development , at GS1 US in Lawrenceville , N.J. GS1 US is the trade organization working to move the DataBar standard forward in the United States .
A poultry DataBar , for example , might contain not only the price and product category , but also a sell - by date .
If a consumer chose an outdated package , the label would alert the cashier at checkout .

For U.S. Reps. Dennis Kucinich and Steve LaTourette , the avalanche of newly released court documents about National City Corp. is bittersweet vindication .
The pair of Northeast Ohio congressmen loudly opposed last year 's forced sale of National City , in part because the region stands to lose thousands of its 8,000 National City jobs .
Kucinich , a Cleveland Democrat , and LaTourette , a Bainbridge Township Republican , insisted on hearings and inquiries but could n't undo the deal .
The court documents show all that Kucinich and LaTourette suspected , and more .
Primarily , National City was forced into a low - ball sale under a deadline set by the U.S. Treasury .
" We saw it from the start , that National City could have been saved , " Kucinich said Friday .
" The federal government could have made it possible for National City to continue . "
LaTourette agreed : " These records confirm the narrative we feared last fall , that there was a Wild West atmosphere where the regulators and Treasury did what they wanted , when they wanted , and National City was in the crosshairs .
" Regulators and Treasury played God with TARP money and strong - armed National City into a sale in a matter of days , with little concern how shareholders would fare and no regard for the thousands of jobs and lives that would be forever changed , " he said .
National City might have eventually decided to sell , Kucinich said .
But it could have been at a much higher price .
National City at one point was negotiating an offer of 92 cents a share .
The board approved a sale for $ 2.23 a share to avoid possibly being seized by the government .
" Treasury set a false deadline that put extraordinary pressure on National City and forced them to sell at a point where shareholders took a great loss , " Kucinich said .
Shares of National City traded at $ 39 at their height in 2007 .
" The government should never , never , never be in position of picking winners and losers .
That 's what happened here . "

Oy .
Only on FoxNews .
EASTON : Well , I thought this whole -- the two speeches this week were just a high - pitched -- unfortunate high - pitched partisan duel between the two of them .
I know the press focused a lot on -- and has focused a lot on Dick Cheney and his provocative comments that the administration is keeping us less safe .
And frankly , I think Cheney should give this president some credit on things like his very difficult decision to not to release the photos of alleged detainee abuse , for example , his flip on military tribunals .
But if you look at the Obama speech , that was equally partisan , and there was n’t a lot of focus on that .
I mean , he talked about this mess that he had inherited .
He talked about the administration sort of fitting facts for an ideological agenda .
Why ca n’t this president give the previous president credit for keeping us safe for seven years ?
And by the way , we know from the C- SPAN interview that he ’s in touch with President Bush .
They ’ve actually talked since he ’s been in office .
But I think it would carry this White House a long way past the problems that Ceci talks about and get the support of somebody like McCain , Senator McCain , or Senator Lindsey Graham , who also supported closing Gitmo and also had concerns about enhanced interrogation techniques .
I think it would buy him a lot of credit or a lot of good will on the other side of the aisle and with centrist Democrats if he gave this -- he gave the Bush administration some credit .

is amirror of the canonical SVN repository .
It works like this : the SVN server pushes out , with svnsync , a mirror to another machine .
That machine then has a cron job that runs git - svn against the local svnsync'd repo .
( Part of this design was so this mirror machine does n't have any access to the writable repo . )
By the way , there 's info on our wiki about how to set up git - svn such that you can fetch with a fastfrom the mirror while still using the slow SVN server when it 's time to commit .
This has been working fine for quite a while but I noticed that occasionally ( rarely ) it was getting the proper commit data but the author wrong .
Half a percent of commits .
I asked around and the best guess is this surprising gotcha : SVN commits are n't atomic .
:( The author metadata is a separate property of a commit and so it 's possible for my mirror to grab a commit before the author data has synced over .
What 's the fix ?
svnsync puts a lock in the repo before syncing .
Right now I check the lock .
To be correct I 'd need to grab the svnsync lock myself while I 'm doing my copy .
Another option is to rewind and try again whenever I see a bad commit get mirrored , but git - svn does n't really like having history rewound without clobbering its metadata and I can't let it just rebuild its metadata from the commit history for complicated reasons outside the scope of this post .
In summary , now I have this git repo that has the wrong authors in some commits .
Fixing it would require rebuilding history from the earliest instance of the problem , invalidating everyone else 's copies .
I have n't done it since I 'm not convinced it 's too important .
Now that I look at the logs , it seems to have gotten much worse recently ...
Henry Badenhorst has certainly been a quiet revolutionary .
As Gaydar , the website he co-founded 10 years ago , became the world 's most successful online dating site , Badenhorst remained silent .
The site has transformed the way people relate to each other on and offline , an influence reaching far beyond its original ambition of hooking up single gay men .
But apart from Badenhorst 's regular namechecks on gay power lists - he tends to vie for position alongside the likes of Elton John , Ian McKellen and Evan Davis - we know almost nothing about him .
He 's had his reasons to keep quiet .
Gaydar has hardly lacked for publicity - on the contrary , it has been a godsend to media scandal stories .
When Lib Dem MP Mark Oaten was found to have engaged in a sex act with a rent boy " too disgusting to describe in a family newspaper " - as one paper noted - it was Gaydar that was implicated as the place where they 'd met .
When Labour MP Chris Bryant was found pictured on the internet sporting nothing but his pants , that was Gaydar , too .
And when Boy George was convicted for falsely imprisoning a male escort earlier this year , it emerged that he had found the escort - you guessed it - on Gaydar .
But through all the success and infamy , Badenhorst has remained publicly mute .
Especially , since Gary Frisch , the co-founder of the site and his former life partner , died after jumping off his eighth - floor balcony in a drugs haze in early 2007 .
Now Badenhorst is finally ready to speak , but not before a preliminary off - the - record chat in a central London hotel .
I pass the test , it seems , because I 'm invited to his office : Gaydar HQ .
Not the chrome Soho penthouse one might expect , but a characterless 60s office block set back from a residential side street in Twickenham , southwest London , not far from the rugby ground .
At first I struggle to hear him .
He speaks in such a gentle voice that I have to lean in to make out what he 's saying .
He starts at the beginning of the Gaydar story .
" It was June 1999 , " he recalls .
" We [ he and Frisch ] had a Dutch friend called Frank who was single and said : ' I need a boyfriend - can you help me ? ' "
Frank did n't have time , it seems , to visit bars so , recalls Badenhorst , " we put him on Excite [ a search engine ] , which had a dating section where you could upload a picture .
But it took two weeks for him to get a response , so we said that we were sure we could create something specifically for the gay market . "
By November the site had launched .
Badenhorst and Frisch had moved to London from South Africa in 1997 to set up the IT firm QSoft , which provided revenue - management systems for airlines .
They launched and ran Gaydar together - the innovation that set the site apart from Gay.com ( the other destination for the date - hunting homosexual ) and ensured its success was the creation of " profiles " .
These are simply a single web page for each user , an idea that 's now standard on dating sites from Match.com to Mysinglefriend.com ( neither of which are as popular as Gaydar , despite their larger target market ) .
Pictures were uploaded on to the profile pages , and information - basic , personal , sexual - could be written .
There were sections for " stats " - height , weight , hair colour , as well as hobbies and interests , adult or otherwise , and a section on what members were looking for .
The profile provided an opportunity to imprint some humanity on the anonymity of cyberspace .
And to inform people as to whether or not , for instance , you still have your foreskin .
" Gaydar started as something we did on the side , " says Badenhorst .
" We did n't realise what we were creating , but then people started coming to the site .
I placed some ads in [ free gay magazine ]
Boyz , which drew in a few people , and slowly it grew .
It certainly did n't take off from day one - the first year we had a several thousand , then the second year was 75,000 and then suddenly , in the third year , in 2001 - 02 , there were more like 220,000 . "
Initially the site was targeted at those who already led an active gay life , going to bars and clubs .
" I had a friend who helped me create the first ad .
It said : ' 3 am , the club was crap , I 'm horny as hell , use your Gaydar . ' "
Ten years on , the success of the site has been blamed for gay bars and clubs going under .
" Just an excuse , " retorts Badenhorst .
" If you have a good venue , people will not stay at home night in , night out . "
Now the majority of people who use Gaydar are not what in gay parlance would be called " scene queens " .
But the greatest transformation of all has been the way it has enabled those in rural areas - or countries where homosexuality is illegal or taboo - to connect with each other .
" When I was a teenager , " Badenhorst recalls , " I knew I was gay but I thought I was the only one ; but these days boys go online and see there are plenty of gay men . "
Plenty indeed .
Five million people around the world subscribe , spending on average more than an hour on the site with each visit .
Most pay a monthly £ 5 subscription , with the rest of the company 's revenue coming from advertising .
Now advertising is not difficult for Gaydar to come by , but in the early years " no one would come close , " says Badenhorst .
" We would n't even get as far as pitching - potential clients would just say they were n't interested . "
In 2004 that began to change .
" Ford was the first .
One of the people working on its campaigns was a Gaydar user ! "
American Express , BMW and Virgin followed .
Until then , they had even more fundamental problems with other companies .
" The Royal Bank of Scotland closed our merchant account with just 24 hours ' notice .
They said someone had complained about it and so took the view that it was too much of a reputational risk . "
Now , of course , RBS has slightly bigger risks to its reputation than a few snaps of unclad gay men .
But that was n't all .
" No hosting companies would deal with us either ; they would n't touch anything with even remotely sexual content - but I 'm sure the gay thing came into play .
So we had to host the site ourselves - we had fibre - optic cables running into our house . "
( They initially ran the business out of their home in Twickenham . )
But by 2004 , the success of the site could not be ignored by those eager to benefit from the pink pound .
Also , by that stage the website had a new , " cleaner " sibling : GaydarRadio ( which now has 1.6 m listeners ) .
" Suddenly here was a brand that people could associate with because it was nonsexual , " says Badenhorst .
The site had already been very publicly associated with sleaziness .
In 2003 the MP for Rhondda , Chris Bryant , could be found in his Y - fronts helpfully offering details of his requirements to anyone who chanced upon his profile .
Then there was the Mark Oaten affair .
" I think it 's most unfortunate when these things happen , because it 's just people going about their lives and it gets blown out of proportion , " says Badenhorst .
" It makes me angry because this [ Gaydar ] is for the gay community - who are you to judge them ?
If this was a straight site , would it be such an issue ? "
Are there other politicians signed up to Gaydar ?
" I 'm sure there are .
But I certainly do n't search the database to see who 's on there .
If politicians want to use the site we 'll do our damnedest to make sure their identity is protected . "
The most recent Gaydar - related scandal involved Boy George .
The singer was jailed in January for falsely imprisoning Norwegian escort Auden Carlsen after meeting him on Gaydar ; he 's since been released .
" George was always a great supporter of Gaydar , and in the early days he had a whole lot about it on his radio show , which we were always very grateful for . "
Presumably Badenhorst felt distinctly less grateful after the escort episode .
" The Gaydar brand gets pulled into it , " he agrees .
" It 's one thing using the site to meet people , but what you do thereafter is your problem .
It was wrong what George did to that guy .
It 's not something you do to another human being . "
But it is precisely the way in which gay men treat each other on Gaydar that has caused much of the controversy about the brand .
Particularly surrounding the issue of " barebacking " - the practice of wanton , unsafe sex .
Last year a More4
News report about how Gaydar has changed the lives of gay people concluded that Gaydar makes it easier to indulge an interest in barebacking .
But Badenhorst is unrepentant .
" People are going to have unsafe sex whether you tell them to or not . "
But you allow people to advertise on their profiles that they are looking for condom - free sex - surely you could intervene ?
" That would create more damage , because all you would do is push the whole barebacking thing underground .
I would rather be in a situation where people are honest about their sexual practices , so whoever contacts them can make informed decisions about whether to meet up with that person . "
Badenhorst also points to the work he and the site do to encourage safer sex .
They have volunteers from the Terrence Higgins Trust in the chatrooms for any user to speak to whenever they want , and the company has a history of supporting other such charities , like Freedoms , a free condom - distribution company , and the National Aids Trust .
Another common concern is the extent to which Gaydar can encourage the baser aspects of male sexuality , objectifying potential mates into a sexual shopping list of attributes .
Badenhorst agrees - in part .
" Online , " he says , " it 's easier for coupling to become a criteria of things you want . "
One of the more practical of the site 's facilities is the " GPS " ( Gaydar Positioning System ) , where you can locate all members who live within a mile radius .
This can lead to your neighbourhood morphing into a veritable minefield of former conquests .
One imagines .
But on the more starkly dial - a - pizza - and - choose - your - toppings end is the " power search " .
Here , if you want to seek out a Middle Eastern 33 - year - old with blue eyes who practises safe sex , is circumcised , has a stocky build , a hairy body but a bald head , who wears sporty clothes , is sexually passive , who smokes socially , drinks often but never takes drugs , who is a Sagittarius and has a small penis , then you can .
It really is that specific .
But when I press Badenhorst further on this topic , a hilarious admission spills out .
" Well , I do n't always see how people interact on there , " he says .
" Because I do n't use the system . "
What ?
I splutter .
You do n't have your own profile on there ?
Badenhorst laughs .
" No ... no ... can you imagine ? " he says .
But why not ?
" I had a few bad experiences of people stalking me .
When Gary died they got my name and then found my details from Companies House , so I would get weird things sent to me and people would phone my house in the middle of the night or leave abusive messages .
I had to get lawyers involved . "
So how does Badenhorst meet people ?
" The old - fashioned way , " he replies .
" I go to bars . "
For the first and only time in our conversation , Badenhorst clams up when I probe him on his current personal life .
Have you been dating recently ?
" Yes , " he says , his eyes sparkling .
Has that been a recent thing ?
" Absolutely . "
How does that feel ?
" Exciting . "
Do you feel any twinges of guilt ?
" Not any more , " he replies , sadly .
Having worked relentlessly on the site for 10 years now , he seems somewhat fatigued by it all .
" You see so many images [ of nudity ] that you start noticing things in the person 's room - ' Ooh , look at the wallpaper ! ' "
He is , however , proud of the many millions of connections - fleeting or otherwise - he has facilitated .
" It 's only when you meet people and they tell you how it 's affected their lives that you go back and think : ' This is what I 've done . ' "
Badenhorst 's success , however , has not been unerring .
Last year , QSoft had to lay off a few editorial staff from GaydarNation , their offshoot entertainment website .
In March , Badenhorst closed Profile , the Soho bar he co-owned .
But , he insists , this was not for commercial reasons , and the bar will reopen under a different name .
The lesbian arm of the site , GaydarGirls , while in no way a failure ( 325,000 users ) has not caught on with anywhere near the same whoosh as Gaydar .
" The product is not right for them , " he says , with Gerald Ratner - esque honesty .
" The behaviour of gay men and lesbians is different . "
Badenhorst was born and raised in suburban Johannesburg .
His mother gave up her job as a theatre nurse when she married his father , who worked for the transport services .
The second of four boys , young Henry was always different .
" My mother must have known [ that he was gay ] .
I never played with my older brother , or played rugby - I was always in the kitchen doing things .
But I had a normal Afrikaans upbringing . "
Popular at school and never bullied , he instead had the Afrikaans church to contend with .
" I had to go to a church that believes it 's a sin to be gay and you 'll burn in hell for it , so for years I struggled with why the church would n't accept me for who I was . "
Unresolved , he later left suburbia to move to Hillbrow - " the Soho of Johannesburg " - where he started attending a church " that was OK to be gay in " .
So OK , in fact , that " It turned out to be just a huge cruising ground - so that did n't last long . "
Military service came at 18 .
" I had a great time , " he says , laughing mischievously .
Badenhorst was still not " out " to his parents .
In fact , he says it was only " two or three years ago that I had an open conversation with my mother about it " .
Only then did his parents realise exactly what he did for a living .
In 1991 , Badenhorst , who is now 42 , met fellow South African Gary Frisch , two years his junior , in a " cruising ground ...
I always make jokes that he was the one - night stand that never went away . "
The laugh that follows is almost forced .
On 10 February 2007 , Frisch did finally go away .
That Saturday afternoon he took ketamine , the animal tranquiliser and recreational drug , and jumped off the eighth - floor balcony of his Battersea home .
The inquest recorded a verdict of " misadventure " .
They had n't been a couple in the last few months of Frisch 's life .
After 15 years together , and eight years running Gaydar , Frisch moved out .
" We got to a point where we had become friends and because we worked together were seeing each other 24/7 , so it was a mutual decision to break up .
And Gary got to a point where he was tired of working the hours and wanted to have a bit of fun and live a bit , so he did things in that last six months before he died that he 'd always wanted to do .
He went white - water rafting in Zimbabwe , he went bungee jumping , he was recapturing his youth .
He was going to bars and clubs and loved it .
I could n't understand it because I 'd been there and done that . "
And it was that recapturing of youth , that wanting to feel alive that led to his death ?
Badenhorst goes to say yes , but his voice cracks .
" That was what I struggled with the most - if we had n't parted , would the outcome have been different ? "
How did he learn of Frisch 's death ?
" I got a call from the police that day ...
It was about 6 pm that Saturday , and I was at home . "
The memory registers on his face like physical pain .
What did the police say ?
" That he had died ; how he had died .
And they said : ' I 'll phone you back in 10 minutes .
Phone somebody , get someone round and get yourself together . '
I was alone at home . "
So what did he do ?
Henry makes an exhalation from the back of his throat .
" You know , it is ... it was the worst day of my life , the realisation that this had happened .
I had shared a life with him for 15 years ; I absolutely loved him .
For minutes I would stop and think : ' Maybe it 's not true , maybe I 'm just imagining this , ' and I think what I did was phone [ friends and colleagues ]
Anna and Trevor , and they immediately came over . "
The police questioned Badenhorst .
" They wanted to be sure there was no reason it was anything other than an accident . "
But Badenhorst knew it was nothing more than that .
" I knew because I spoke to him 10 minutes before he died .
He phoned me , we had a decent conversation .
On the Friday I was quite worried about him because his frame of mind was not right .
So he phoned me about 12 o'clock on the Saturday afternoon .
He was busy getting ready , about to go shopping .
I knew there was somebody there and I knew he was uncomfortable telling me who it was , and I did n't ask .
But I got off the phone and thought : ' You know what ?
He 's going to be OK . '
They took the drugs prior to going shopping and so never made it out . "
The man with Gary was Darren Morris , who later told the inquest that Frisch had stayed up all night on his own , and in the morning he found Frisch sitting on the floor with some magazines , saying : " Thank you , Lord ; praise you , Lord . "
Then , according to Morris , Frisch put music on , started dancing and talking incoherently : " I came into the living room and I saw him standing on the balcony with his hands on the rail .
He somersaulted over the top . "
Stephen Ruddock , an estate agent , was outside when it happened , and revealed that Gary made a " Waheey " sound as he jumped .
" It was a celebratory thing , " said Ruddock .
" I saw his body come into my line of sight .
It arced in the air and hit the ground . "
On the Monday morning the story was out .
Speculation as to the cause of Frisch 's death and his " mental wellbeing " began to grow .
Was it an accident ?
Was it drugs ?
Depression ?
Badenhorst was besieged by reporters .
" The media was camping outside my door , trying to get an interview , trying to find out if I was with Gary when it happened .
I just said : ' I 'm not going to talk to you . '
It got so bad the police phoned a few papers and said : ' Please stop doing this . ' "
Knowing that the press would run with the story on the Monday , Badenhorst was desperate to tell his employees of Gary 's death before they read about it .
So , first thing , he assembled the 70 employees at the offices and told them .
" We did it in a group situation and made sure we had grief counsellors on hand for everyone .
There was a lot of shock - some people cried uncontrollably , some people could talk about it , and some people are still uncomfortable with me talking about it . "
Thousands of tributes poured in from gay men around the world whose lives had been changed for the better because of the website .
But Badenhorst was busy taking care of the grimmest task of all - doing the ring - round , telling Gary 's brother ( his parents were dead ) and friends .
Then he had to clear out Frisch 's flat .
" That was the hardest thing , especially going back to the place where it happened . "
At the funeral Henry was too distressed to speak .
" I wrote something but somebody read it for me .
I was n't able to . "
At this , his eyes begin to glisten .
In the aftermath of the funeral and the inquest , there was something else going on .
An old " friend " of Frisch 's was suing Gaydar for a percentage of the company .
" He wanted huge amounts of money .
He claimed he supported Gary in the beginning , that there was a conversation between Gary and him that he would get a percentage . "
Proceedings had begun before Frisch 's death .
" He was never somebody who could deal with stress very well .
There was a lot of emotion going on with him dealing with issues around his mother 's [ recent ] death , so adding litigation on top of that did n't exactly help . "
Badenhorst concedes , however , that what led Frisch to taking ketamine - known for its hallucinatory effects - was " a combination of things " : the stress coupled with his determination to recapture his youth .
Badenhorst 's anger over the court case is palpable - a low , rumbling rage .
" I was fighting for what Gary and I had built together .
It meant I could n't come to peace with Gary 's death and I could n't let it go , because every single day I was digging into the past to prepare for the case .
I held our position , and he [ the litigator ] eventually went away .
It went on for more than a year . "
They settled out of court .
What does Badenhorst miss most about Frisch ?
A long pause follows .
" His honesty .
He would say what he thought , whether or not it would embarrass himself or anybody else .
And his kindness .
If anything bad ever happened to me it was amazing how much concern and compassion he would have .
He always protected me . "
Indeed , even in his death , he did so , leaving Badenhorst the bulk of his estimated £ 6.5 m estate .
The long - term implications have been profound .
Even the website needed a year 's work on it to unravel all the programming Frisch had done for it .
" He hated documentation , so it was all in his head . "
But only when that and the court case were over did Badenhorst begin to take stock .
" I am finally looking at my life and realising what I 've been through - at the time you 're just on survival mode . "
Badenhorst says he wants to cut down his hours , and admits that now , with Frisch gone , his passion is n't what it was .
" If you had asked me before he died if I would ever retire , I would have said : ' Absolutely not . '
I always wanted to be in control , and it was something that we were passionate about together .
So you start viewing your life differently and start thinking : ' Maybe there is more to life than just working on Gaydar . ' "
Communities Secretary Hazel Blears is to pay £ 13,332 to the Inland Revenue , the sum she would have paid in capital gains tax when she sold a flat in London had she not classified it as a " main residence " .
The move comes as MPs face growing scrutiny over their expense claims , following a series of embarrassing newspaper revelations .
She said " People feel incredibly angry about the whole system ... and that 's why I 've taken a personal decision to send a cheque " .

The government hopes the project will lead to better protective measures such as sea walls
Detailed forecasts of how climate change may affect the UK during this century are to be released by the government later .
The report will predict how temperature and rainfall are likely to change at regional and local scales .
Scientists believe winters will be wetter , particularly in the north , and summers drier , especially in the south .
The projected impacts are " worse than the government had feared , " according to a source familiar with the project .
The government hopes the UK Climate Projections 2009 report ( UKCP09 ) will allow citizens , local authorities and businesses to plan better for future decades .
The picture it paints is an alarming one
Keith Allott , WWF -UK
Using a range of online tools including a " weather generator " , people will be able to enter their postcodes and see projections of how conditions are likely to change within 25 sq km grid squares at different points in the future .
" [ This is ] the most comprehensive set of probabilistic climate projections at the regional scale compiled anywhere in the world , " said John Mitchell , director of climate science at the UK Met Office , which has taken charge of the computer modelling of climate used in the report .
' Serious impact '
The previous report - UKCIP2002 - is now seven years old , and included projections from just one computer model .
By contrast , UKCP09 has collated data from 400 variations of the model developed by the Hadley Centre , part of the Met Office .
Each variant has been checked to see how well it predicted the climate of past decades ; and the numbers have been compared with projections of other computer models .

This allowed scientists to assign probabilities to various forecasts .
The idea of the impact assessment has been well received by environment groups .
" It 's great that the government has decided to put together such a scientifically robust analysis of the potential impacts of climate change in the UK , but the picture it paints is an alarming one , " said Keith Allott , head of climate change at WWF - UK .
" This research confirms that not only is climate change already having a serious impact in Britain , but that we are also locked into further impacts , and that these impacts will get much worse unless we act now to tackle the problem . "
Campaigners say that the UK impacts are likely to be minor compared to other parts of the world .
Last month a report from the Global Humanitarian Forum , the think tank chaired by former UN secretary - general Kofi Annan , said that the UK was among the 12 countries likely to be least affected by climate change .
On Friday , the Environment Agency will release an assessment of how the changing climate will affect the risk of impacts such as flooding in England and Wales .

We 've learned Michael Jackson never adopted his three children , even though he 's not the biological father .
We broke the story that neither Jackson nor Debbie Rowe are the biological parents of Michael Jr. and Paris .
And Michael was not the biological parent of Prince Michael II either .
Now here 's the rub .
We 've learned Jackson never filed legal papers to adopt any of his children .
Legal experts tell us Jackson would be presumed the father but it 's not conclusive by any means .
As for why Jackson did n't formally adopt -- we 're told at the time the kids were born there was no third party whom he believed would try and claim custody .
For some reason , Jackson never thought Debbie Rowe would mount a custody challenge .

An ongoing FDA investigation of the side effects of Ritalin and other ADHD medications is raising concerns that the drugs may be linked to sudden , fatal heart problems in children .
In a statement issued on June 15 , the FDA warns that a very limited study of the rate of death among children using stimulants to treat Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) found that there may be an association with sudden death due to heart problems in healthy children .
However , the FDA cautioned that parents should not stop their child ’s medication based on the study .
The FDA noted that the study , which was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and the FDA , had several limitations which make the data inconclusive .
A larger , more focused , study is being funded by the FDA to specifically investigate if there is truly a link between heart problems and ADHD drugs like Ritalin , Concerta , Cylert and Dexedrine .
The study , which was published Monday in the American Journal of Psychiatry compared the use of ADHD drugs in 564 healthy children who died suddenly , most likely due to sudden cardiac problems , to the use of the drugs among 564 children who died in automobile accidents .
Although there was a low frequency of stimulant use reported in both the study group and the control group , the study found that 10 children who died from problems like sudden cardiac disturbance were taking the drugs , compared with only two who died in a motor vehicle accident .
ADHD medications are used by nearly 3.3 million American children under the age of 20 .
Some estimates have placed usage of ADHD drugs as high as 10 % among 10 year old American boys , and many experts believe that the drugs are often prescribed to individuals for whom the benefits do not outweigh the risks associated with the medications .
For years , healthcare professionals have warned of a link between stimulant drugs meant to treat ADHD , such as Concerta , Adderal XR , and Ritalin , and heart problems like cardiac arrest .
In 2007 , mounting evidence led the FDA to require more stringent warning labels on the medications , highlighting the possible link between ADHD drugs and increased blood pressure , rapid heart rate , and risk of sudden death for those with cardiovascular problems .
However , the new study raises concerns about a potential risk for children who were considered healthy .
The FDA advises parents not to take their children off the medications at this time , but to discuss any concerns with their child ’s doctor .
There were several problems with the study ’s methodology that could have skewed the findings , FDA said .
First , the deaths occurred between 1985 and 1996 , but the data on their medication was collected from 1997 to January 2008 , leading to potential errors due to the time lag .
Additionally , the FDA points out that the differences in the circumstances of the deaths may have accounted for differences in the family ’s recall of what medications were being used , with a sudden unexplained death of a child being more likely to trigger an inquiry into the cause of death than a fatality suffered in an automobile accident .
These and other questions about the study have led the FDA and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) to sponsor a large epidemiological study .
The FDA estimates that data collection for the new study will be available later this year .

Tesla et. al. – I 've spent many months getting hammered shorting overvalued Momos , until , finally , I internalized Phil 's message .
Play small ; give yourself plenty of room to double / move up the [ lack of value ] chain in terms of price .
Play short ; take [ Musk's , eg. ] latest bleep and sell the spike for a short time frame , because his tweets always come to naught .
I 've been coining money doing it , I just watch that premium melt away with scarcely veiled amusement .
Swinging for the fences is for suckers [ me , for a long time ] .
Those little gains really add up — $ 2 k per week of evaporated premium and you could actually buy a Tesla by the end of the year !!

Newer member here , but just wanted to say thank you too .
I 've learned so much and I hope you 'll be around for a long time helping us learn along the way .
Where
I 've been trading / investing since the early 80's ( my dad started me out young ) .
I 've had seven figure accounts ( in the past ) and I 've done lots of trading , so I can say that I 'm a well seasoned investor .
Phil is the real deal .
His trades make sense and his strategy is sound .
He sees things that others miss and he's one of the best at finding price anomalies .
When he makes a mistake , he has an exit strategy already planned .
He hedges very well and he has an instict which tells him to go to cash or to be all in .

Its been a " perfect " month .
Every stock I wrote calls against looks like it will be called away next week , every put I wrote will expire worthless .
Thanks Phil , now I need some new buy / write candidates , or the new 100 K portfolio… .

I have to trump your sentiments regarding the wisdom of the board .
I have to thank Phil and the many contruibutors for a 80 % profit for 2009 .
I have learned a lot and am still learning ( even occasionally about political issues - ha ! ) Iflantheman & Gel1
What a great post today , Phil .
A veritable feast of ideas !
I 've been reading your posts for years and have modeled my whole trading style after yours .
You should be taking 2 and 20 off of me at this point ????

your our guiding light !

Phil : That NFLX call was awesome .
The speed at which NFLX options decayed was precipitous .
The blow out spike that allowed me to double and roll my callers to 190 ( ! ) and the ridiculous 170 weeklies @ 3.50 a day away from Op - Ex .
The gains I realized in that trade floored me when I took a long at my portfolio value on Friday .
What a great way to start the 3rd Quarter .

Phil I have been applying your arsenal ( matresses , Edz plays , Ugl verticals etc. ) to my gold holdings .
So a big thank you for " teaching me how to fish " rather than just giving me the fish ...

All I can say is — I understand that the Universe sent me to PSW for a reason .
So , I 'm listening !!
… and studying .
Your commentary is literally outstanding .
… and your members are impressive as well .

Thanks
Phil for helping make this a much , much better year this year than last .
Your tutelage has been so very helpful .
Do n't think I can say Thanks enough .
And I thanks all the members here who were work hard in helping us all to become better traders , and I would say better people as well .
The support many of you offered when we evacuated during the fire this past year helped me immeasurably .
Happy New Years to you all !

Phil – BTW , the new STP / LTP coupled with the income portfolio is Perfect !
I do not trade all of them , very few actually since I work during market hours .
However , following the trades real - time is very educational .
I did enter the ABX call if you recall , I rolled to July on that nonsense news that sent it tumbling .
Out today for 110 % gain ( 2.00 stop ) not counting covering the loss from the earlier roll .
Nonetheless , a good trade .
Keep it up … .
Thanks JFawcett
GLD I took out my callers and rolled down my longs this morning , woo hoo !

Hi Phil ,
Thanks for the free disaster hedge ideas .
I implemented variations of two of them on SDS bull call spreads and EEM bear put spreads ( have n't done the TZA yet ) and they really hedged my short term longs nicely today .
Makes it seem a lot less like gambling .
You are the man ( of the people ) !

Phil ….. You have absolutely NAILED IT !
This is not a bull market , nor is it a bear market .
It is a Rangeish market , and it 's going to stay that way for a long time ( the latter is my prediction .
I love the word .
What I love more is the fact that I 've found someone with some investing intelligence greater than mine who can assist me in playing this type of market .
Your description today of how it 's playing out is right on .
I predict some media ‘ guru ' will steal your word and your description within the next few days and we 'll all get to read about what ‘ they ' discovered about this market .
Thanks Phil ! Iflantheman
I have been a member of Phil 's site for three years and counting , and my advice is that all investing takes time .
There are o shortcuts , no secret way to riches .
Same with Phil 's site - you need time and patience to start benefitting fully from his advice .
But it is often spot on and also very useful , especially to me as I try to keep a level head in this turbulent stock market environment .

Thanks for the USO mention , Phil , 140 % on my USO lottery ticket in 12 hours , and no hesitation in taking the money and running — you have trained us well .
Sometimes it 's teaching , but with this kind of stuff , where you get whipped like a dog if you let 250 % profit melt away , it 's definitely training .
Happy Fourth !!!
Zeroxzero
Your discussion during your web seminar on SPX and SDS today was great .
It really let me see how you look at the numbers and use the 5 % rule to see where inflection points occur and what the bands look like .
This was incredibly helpful .
I actually sold out of my small short position at a good profit ( which was more a bet on a short term fluctuation rather than a hedge after listening to you ) and will look more deeply at my portfolio and how to hedge it .
In addition your view on hedging was also very helpful looking at the leverage you can get w/ a small spread , and protect portfolio against a big move against me .
Thank you for your sharing this .
Very helpful .

Phil – I wanted to tell you how much of a privilege it is to learn from your every day .
You are a shining beacon in the life of so many investors .
You have assembled probably the best group of people in the history of financial blogging and you , yourself have done more to help investors in the last 6 months than all previous financial advisors combined .

Thanks Phil , for banging the table on getting short and getting to cash .
Usually when this happens in the market I am freaking out but I actually made money this week thanks to you .
That HOV trade was a great way to re-deploy some of my cash .

Phil : I am always able to figure out your trades , including the rational when put in the right context of previous comments , etc .
Keep doing what you 're doing .
It is much appreciated , and invaluable .
Your hit rate of successful trades has been very high in my 1.5 months as a member , but even more importantly is your teaching of how to repair and DD positions that have n't gone your way yet .
As with most members , we all have our ‘ pet ' trading interests , and learning how to think about trading is much more important than a specific trade , which could see the conditions behind it change an hour later .
This is the classic case , of ‘ Teach us to Fish ' , rather than just giving us a fish once in a while .
Thank you !
Neverworkagain
By the way thank you Phil for the DNDN idea .

Phil / USO Adjustment ~~
Thanks for showing us the make it even ( maybe even profitable ) tricks for ' fixing ' a losing position .
I would have never known the trick if you did n't explain it .
The option adjustment techniques are very helpful .
Trading stocks would probably never offer that kind of flexibilities !

Democrats are more likely to be moderate or liberal , Hispanic , or black or other races
PRINCETON , NJ --
More than 6 in 10 Republicans today are white conservatives , while most of the rest are whites with other ideological leanings ; only 11 % of Republicans are Hispanics , or are blacks or members of other races .
By contrast , only 12 % of Democrats are white conservatives , while about half are white moderates or liberals and a third are nonwhite .
These data reinforce the basic challenge facing the Republican Party today as it ponders how best to remedy a situation that finds Democrats in control of the White House and both houses of Congress .
Republicans have a clear monopoly on the allegiance of white conservative Americans , but the GOP 's challenge is figuring out whether this is enough of a base on which to build for the future .
The alternative is for the GOP to broaden its base to include more minorities and / or more whites who are moderate or liberal in their ideological outlook -- groups now predominantly loyal to the Democratic Party .
The current analysis is based on a sample of more than 26,000 interviews Gallup conducted May 1 - 27 , 2009 .
Each of the three major political groupings -- those who identify themselves as Republicans , as Democrats , and as independents -- was decomposed into five mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories :
Hispanics Non-Hispanic blacks Non-Hispanics who identity their race as something other than white or black Non-Hispanic whites who identify themselves as conservative Non-Hispanic whites who identify their ideology as something other than conservative -- including moderates , liberals , and those who do n't express an ideological preference
The results show clearly that the Republican Party today is first and foremost a political entity dominated by white Americans .
Eighty - nine percent of rank - and - file Republicans are non-Hispanic whites , leaving just 5 % who are Hispanic ( of any race ) , 2 % who are black , and 4 % of other races .
Further , by well over a 2 - to - 1 ratio , whites who identify as Republicans claim a conservative , rather than a moderate or liberal , ideology ( or have no opinion when asked about their ideology ) .
Democrats have a significantly more diverse party composition .
Well over a third ( 36 % ) of Democrats are nonwhite ( Hispanic , or black or some other race ) and the 64 % of Democrats who are white are strongly skewed -- by more than a 4 - to - 1 ratio -- toward an ideological position that is moderate or liberal rather than conservative .
Independents , as would be expected , are somewhere between Republicans and Democrats in terms of their racial , ethnic , and ideological composition .
Twenty - seven percent of independents are Hispanic , or are black or identify with another race , and , by about a 2 - to - 1 ratio , white independents split toward the nonconservative ideological position .
Religiosity
A similar pattern is found when the three partisan groups are broken down into segments based on race , ethnicity , and religious intensity ( among whites , as measured by church attendance ) .
About half of Republicans are non-Hispanic whites who are strongly religious , defined as those who attend church about once a week or more frequently .
Forty percent of Republicans are whites who attend less frequently .
Democrats , on the other hand , comprise only 20 % highly religious whites , with more than twice as many whites who attend church less frequently .
The pattern of church attendance among independents is similar to that among Democrats , but independents have higher percentages of whites in both the religious and the nonreligious categories .
Implications
A great deal of attention has been paid to the plight of Republicans who at this juncture in history find themselves not controlling the presidency , the House , or the Senate .
Plus , numerous surveys conducted by Gallup and other firms have shown that the GOP appears to be suffering on a number of perceptual dimensions compared to the Democrats ( as measured by Gallup and by other recent surveys ) .
The data reviewed here highlight an essential dilemma the Republicans face as they ponder their future .
The Republican Party 's constituency is overwhelmingly white -- and the significant majority of those whites are ideologically conservative , while a majority are highly religious , as defined by church attendance .
The Democratic Party , on the other hand , has more than three times the percentage of nonwhites among its identifiers as does the GOP .
And white Democrats are much more likely to be moderate or liberal than conservative , and are much more likely to be infrequent church attenders rather than frequent church attenders .
Does the Republican Party in essence " stick to the knitting " and cling to its core conservative principles ?
Or should the Republicans make an effort to expand their base -- among whites who are moderate or less religious , and / or the various nonwhite groups who to this point are largely ignoring the Republican Party in favor of the Democrats ?
The decision the party makes in response to this question could be pivotal in helping determine its future .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 26,314 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 1 - 27 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
The first Nepomuk workshop and the first KDE workshop held in Freiburg ever is over .
It was great but short .
I could have worked on with these guys for much longer .
It was a lot of fun to explain the Nepomuk ideas directly and having people not only listening but also understanding and realizing them .
On Friday we started out slowly .
Due to different travel times and also some stupidity from travel agencies and German bus drivers we were only complete at around sixish .
To get in the mood I had everyone explain what they wanted to achieve over the weekend or what they thought could be interesting to work on with Nepomuk .
The beginning was not easy , at least I feared that we would have trouble to actually getting to work .
After all , you do not start to work with Nepomuk just like that .
It is too confusing and different for that .
But the ideas were very good and the people very interested and eager .
So on Saturday my fears of me not being able to handle it were vanished .
I explained about PIMO ( just to confuse everyone for real ) and showed what I had done with respect to NLP in the Scribo project ( Tom already mentioned it in his blog although he confused it with PIMO .
No big deal , there are way too many project and technology names to get mixed up ) .
Sebastian Faubel showed his very interesting work on a replacement for the Gnome open and save file dialog .
He also uses RDF to store meta data and then based on that decides on a location for the documents in a fixed ( not really fixed but based on a template ) folder tree .
After that coding began .
What did we do ?
Well , I did not really code anything .
There was no time for that .
I was too busy discussing with and helping the others .
And they did do cool stuff .
Let me start by mentioning my hero of the weekend : Tobias König aka tokoe .
He wanted to improve the performance of the Akonadi Nepomuk feeder agents which export contact and email meta data from Akonadi to Nepomuk .
He did that by introducing a new fast mode into the nepomuk resource generator .
Now he would not be tokoe if he would not have been shocked by the hack that is rcgen .
So over the weekend he cleaned it up .
He cursed , he sweated , he nearly went mad , but he did it !
And since we defined it as a bug fix it is even in 4.3 .
Great work , Tobias .
Then there was Tom Albers .
Now he already blogged about what he did himself .
But I will summarize it anyway : he actually dared and integrated the Scribo - based annotation suggestions into Mailody .
I will blog about details on that later .
But the idea is that the email body is analysed and a plugin system generates possible annotations such as dates , cities , persons , and also possible events that are mentioned in the email .
Not only did he integrate it into Mailody , he also found two bugs that would have been showstoppers for the Mandriva Scribo demo yesterday .
So thanks a lot , Tom .
Raptor .
Now Raptor is a cool project .
Raptor sets out to replace or provide an alternative to Kickoff .
And their idea for Nepomuk integration is to remember the launches of applications .
For starters “ only ” when an application was launched .
This then allows to show more frequently used applications with bigger icons .
But it will not stop there .
Application launches can be linked to the current context ( or the current Plasma activity ) .
I might use KPresenter at work all the time but never at home .
Also it would be possible to link files to the application launch that was used to open them .
And so on .
Alessandro , Francesco , and Lukas quickly understood how to create and ontology and use it in KDE .
They now have their dedicated application launch ontology and use it via the Nepomuk libs in Raptor .
I hope that the ontology can at some point be made into somewhat of a standard in the desktop ontology project .
Daniel , while normally being an Amarok developer ( he did the Nepomuk integration in the GSoC last year ) , was very eager on making Nepomuk really useful on the basic level .
So we discussed handling of removable storage and nicer resource URI design a lot .
In the end we decided :
All files will have a random URI that never changes .
All file systems will be represented in Nepomuk with their mount point and their mount status ( Daniel already started working on the service that handles that .
Also the tracker guys are working on something similar .
Matching the ontologies should be fairly easy as the concepts are the same . )
All file URLs will be relative .
All files will have a link to their storing file system .
This helps in solving a bunch of problems .
Files on removable storages like USB sticks which can be mounted in different places are handled the exact same way as files on local file systems .
Moving a file in most cases only means to update one property : the relative URL .
Only if the file is moved to another file system that link has to be changed , too .
Through the mount state flag on the file system in Nepomuk it is very simple to see if a file is currently available or not .
A search client can simply tell the user that they have to mount the file system in question to access the file .
I think this is a fine solution and since I tried to design everything without relying on the file resource ’s URI being the file ’s URL the transition should be fairly simply .
A goal for 4.4 .
George already blogged about his Nepomuk integration work with Telepathy .
What is so great about his work is that he actually uses PIMO in a productive way : one PIMO Person represents one person that can be contacted via Telepathy .
And this one pimo : Person has a set of occurrences being the actual contacts like jabber accounts and so on .
Thus , if you want to chat with a person you simply click their icon and Telepathy will open one of the available systems , depending on their online status .
One could even think of email as a fallback .
I find this especially interesting since it so clearly uses the two different layers of information defined via the PIMO ontology : on the lower level we have all the desktop resources like files and emails and jabber accounts and so on .
And on a higher level we have all the real world entities like the actual person or a project or a city represented by PIMO concepts .
I hope that we will see more integration like this is the future .
( I know , I know , I need to write better documentation on this . )
Marcel worked on the Nepomuk integration in Digikam .
Since the Digikam team does not want to entirely rely on Nepomuk yet ( with it being optional and all ) he created a Nepomuk service that keeps the Digikam database and Nepomuk in sync .
So rating and tagging your images in Digikam would directly be reflected in Nepomuk and the other way around .
Very nice .
I hope to see this hitting a stable release soon .
I had hoped to have more time to work with Peter on the meta data display in Dolphin .
But sadly that dropped under the table a bit .
But I was at least able to show him my crappy formatting rule system I drafted a while back and we cleaned up the display a bit : nicer labels and less useless properties shown .
What did we look like ?
What about the future ?
I hope that we can do this again soon .
I think it was really worth it and am very happy to have done it .
Thanks again to all of you .
You made this a successful event .
PS : I wanted to blog earlier but first I had to sleep for two days straight .
I am too old for this shit ! ;)
Thinking Outside of the Box
Fast Food
__________Of the 1,000 + posts on Strobist at this writing , one of the most popular is the $ 10 Macro Studio -- a cardboard box hack that makes it almost impossible to take a bad shot of a small object .
With a little alteration , that same concept can be used to create classic food photography lighting with a light source as simple as a desk lamp .
Of course , a speedlight will work great , too ... The classic direction for lighting food is from the top / back .
In typical presentation , food has more width and depth than it does height .
So the top / back is a logical position from which light can rake across the food to reveal texture and form .
For this walk - through I raided the fridge for some fresh tomatoes .
Not complex , but nice and 3 -d for illustrative purposes .
Here they are with a bare light hitting them from the classic , top / back position .
This hard light almost makes the ' maters look as if they are made of wood and painted glossy red .
You can do a lot to manipulate the visual perception of surface quality with different lighting techniques .
Here is the same shot with a wider lens .
The light source is a bare SB - 800 , but it could just as easily be a desk lamp .
You could easily soften that light with an umbrella if you have one .
But if your food or setting is specular , those ribs ( ) are gonna give you problems .
This is one of those instances where a soft box is much better than a shoot - through .
But there is no need to shell out for one if you are not shooting this kind of stuff all of the time .
Instead , you can hack a large cardboard box ( quite literally ) and essentially turn the soft box inside out .
So , here is the basic box -- use a big one -- cut up and placed back together to give you a sense of where the cuts are .
The more of an angle you put on that diagonal cut , the more your light will come from the back .
I did this one kinda middle - of - the - road , but you might want to crank it up a notch or two .
And if you use a razor knife like I did , please be careful .
Or at least bookmark this page before you start .
Just sayin' .
That big open square on the top is gonna get some diffusion material , so the window will do its job and improve your harsh light source .
Tracing paper is ideal , but tissue paper ( big , like from a gift ) works great .
Stretch it smooth .
Wax paper will do in a pinch , too .
I scrounged a little Rosco Tuff Frost , which is tough ( duh ) and uniform , not to mention color - neutral .
That last part is important , if you are using some type of mystery diffusor .
Also , if you are using this with a desk lamp , use an incandescent bulb ( no CFLs ) and set your camera 's white balance to tungsten .
Everything will work fine .
Here is the part you keep , and by now it should be getting pretty self explanatory as to how to use it to soften that bare flash or desk lamp .
If you are more of a food blogger than a photographer , you can do this all with continuous light and a tripod -- just crank that aperture wayyy down for lots of depth of field .
( Not that this is a foodie blog , but you regulars would be surprised at who passes through here while learning to shoot stuff for their site . )
Okay , so lets stick our box in between the light and the subject and see what happens .
Right away , the tomatoes look way better .
I am using a sheet of black plexi as a background , to get a clean reflection of the new , slicker light source .
( The umbrella would suck for this background , because of the ribs ' reflection . )
Here is a pullback , which actually is a pretty cool composition .
But looking at this ( and the photo just above ) our next problem is that the bottoms of the tomatoes are too dark .
This is because all of the light is coming from the back / top .
That 's an easy fix , and we do not need another light , either .
We can get double - duty out of our nice main light by adding a reflector :
Since this is a no-wallet Monday , let 's fix this with a folded sheet of printer paper ( or , if you are over 50 , paper ...)
Just fold it and stand it in front of the tomatoes -- maybe to one side , as shown .
( You could stick it right in front , too for a different look . )
As you can now see , that one sheet of paper makes a huge difference .
By default , it will not overpower the main light source , either .
It 's a reflector , and cannot give out more light than it is receiving .
So , let 's try another reflector on the other side .
It may be that the second reflected light source ends up being too much .
But at two cents a pop , go for it and see what happens .
Here it is close - up , which is the same photo at the top of the post .
Maybe you like the extra detail , or maybe the second highlight turns you off .
That 's up to you -- add salt to taste .
Here is a pullback with two reflectors for clarity 's sake .
Depending on the topography of what you are shooting , these reflectors do not need to be big , or symmetrical -- or even white .
You can illuminate those shadows exactly the way you want by placing as many reflectors -- large and / or small -- wherever you want .
Need more light ?
Try aluminum foil reflectors .
That 's what I used for this cake .
Crinkle it up , then straighten it back out for a nice , smooth , pebbled reflector surface .
You can choose the shiny or matte surface , too , for different looks .
Here it is , from the side angle .
Again , that SB - 800 flash could easily be a desk or floor lamp .
And the grey backdrop was just to hide the white wall reflection in the initial shot .
Once you get the diffusor panel up , that problem solves itself .
__________So , there you go -- an easy entré into food photography .
If this kind of thing floats your boat , you might want to consider a medium - sized soft box , which will of course make this kind of light very easy .
And it travels well , too .
If you 're a food blogger and you decide to play with it , link in and spread the luv -- and post a comment so we can see what a hotshot food photographer you are now ...
Last year ’s version of Madden was a big improvement , but still suffered from a large number of bugs .
Well all that seems to have changed with this year ’s version .
Even the small improvements come across as significant .
For example , when you trained before a game in past versions , you would run the 40 yard dash for a speed improvement , or bench press for strength .
It felt like doing the NFL Combine every single week , which is very unrealistic .
Well now they have completely taken that out of the Franchise mode .
The players are evaluated at the end of every seasons , just as they should be .
The Franchise mode can be controlled online via a PC , but this is through the “ Online Franchise ” mode .
Essentially you can create a “ Online Franchise ” , and this makes you the commisioner .
You can have up to 31 other players that control their respective teams .
Or if you want , you can just have yourself and 31 other A.I. controlled teams and still have PC access to your franchise .
Pregame , Postgame , and Weekly shows have been implemented as well into Franchise mode .
As well as a central hub that appears on the left side of the screen showing all necessary information to the gamer .
Gameplay wise is a huge difference .
Everything is smoother , and when controlling the ball carrier it feels like you can actually move the pile , because you essentially can .
Now on the opposite side of the ball you feel like a force to be reckoned with .
This is because your defense swarms to the ball and will have huge gang tackles to take down the ball carrier .
This is honestly the first time in about 3 - 4 years that I have been looking forward to Madden more than NCAA Football .
That is not taking anything away from my experience with NCAA Football at E3 , because it was phenomenal .
But the new Madden felt that much better when I played it .
There were n’t any of the hiccups that we all experienced in the past years ’ versions .
Keep your eyes peeled for Madden 2010 when it hits stores in August .
Below is a gameplay video from the E3 show floor .

Installing MQSeries module on Windows XP is a piece of cake , as long as you get the right tools before you even try .
Update : October 29 , 2018 I have n’t worked on Windows for the past 8 years when we switched to Macs company wide so I have n’t really been keeping up with the MS world .
Fortunately , a kind soul reached out to tell me that Visual Studio Express has been discontinued in favor of Visual Studio Community ( thanks , Laura ! ) .
I ’ve updated the download link to get C++ below .
Feel free to read more about VSC in this post that Laura wrote .
Update : July 2 , 2009
I had to install the module on a new computer running Windows XP and it looks like I had missed a few steps in the original how - to below .
It ’s been updated with the manual editing steps .
From step 3 down , it ’s all new .
This is what you need :
MQSeries installed ( get the 90 - day trial version here .
You will need to register , but there ’s no charge for that ) Microsoft Visual C++ ( it ’s free , and you can get it here ) Perl ( I use ActiveState )
Steps to get it installed :
Open a command prompt ( Start -> Run->cmd.exe ) ( Extremely important !! )
Set up your build environment by running vcvarsall.bat .
Mine is under C: Program FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 9.0VC
An alternative to this step is to open a Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt ( Start - > All Programs -> Microsoft C++ 2008 Express Edition -> Visual Studio Tools -> Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt )
Make sure your environment variables are set with MQ data : INCLUDE =pathtotoolscinclude directory , LIB=pathtotoolslib directory ( typing set will show you your env vars ) Install pre-requisite Params : : Validate by running perl - MCPAN -e “ install Params : : Validate ” Download MQSeries manually by running perl - MCPAN -e “ get MQSeries ” cd into the directory where you have your cpan ( mine is c: Perlcpanbuild ) and enter MQSeries - x.xx -* ( where * is a series of random chars if you ’re using the latest CPAN ) With a decent text editor ( I ’m using Notepad + + and also like Crimson Editor and Programmer ’s Notepad 2 ) , edit CONFIG file : uncomment MQMTOP = … and replace the path with the path to your MQ Tools directory .
It ’s OK to use long directory and file names ( e.g c: Program FilesIBMWebsphere MQTools )
Now cd into the utils directory , open parse_headers file and comment out or delete the line near the top where it says “ my $ include = ‘/ opt/mqm/inc ’ ; ” .
The reason for this is that my overwrites the $ include variable previously populated by parse_config file .
Save your changes and in the base directory for the MQSeries build , run perl Makefile .
PL .
It might complain about some libs not being found , but that was n’t a show stopper for me .
Run nmake .
It came with your MS Visual C++ install and should be in your PATH .
Run nmake test .
It ’ll fail , since you did n’t set any valid data in the CONFIG file .
If you have any valid data such as QM and Queues to test it with , go ahead and set them in the CONFIG file and run nmake test again .
If not , that ’s OK .
If nmake test was the only place where it failed , then you ’re good to run nmake install .
That ’s it – Perl MQSeries module should now be installed .
I 've talked a bunch about the Rails 3 architecture in various talks , and it 's finally come together enough to do a full blog post on it .
With that said , there 's a few things to keep in mind .
We 've done a lot of work on ActionController , but have only mildly refactored ActionView .
We 're going to tackle that next , but I do n't expect nearly as many internal changes as there were for ActionController .
Also , we 've been working on the ActionController changes for a few months , and have focused quite a bit on maintaining backward compatibility ( for the user - facing API ) with Rails 2.3 .
If you try edge and find that we 've broken something , definitely let us know .
AbstractController :: Base
One of the biggest internal changes is creating a base superclass that is separated from the notions of HTTP .
This AbstractController handles the basic notion of controllers , actions , and action dispatching , and not much else .
At that level of abstraction , there are also a number of modules that can be added in , such as Renderer , Layouts , and Callbacks .
The API in the AbstractController is very normalized , and it's not intended to be used directly by end users .
For instance , the template renderer takes an Action View : : Template object and renders it .
Developers working with Rails should n't have to know about Template objects ; this is simply an internal API to make it easier to work with the Rails internals and build things on top of Rails .
Another example is related to action dispatching .
At its core , action dispatching is simply taking an action name , calling the method if it exists , or raising an exception if it does n't .
However , other parts of Rails have different semantics .
For instance , method_missing is used if the action name is not a public method , and the action is dispatched if no action is present but a template with the same name is present .
In order to make it easy to implement these features at different levels of abstraction , AbstractController : : Base calls method_for_action to determine what method to call for an action .
By default , that method simply checks to see if the action is present .
In ActionController : : HideActions , that method is overridden to return nil if actions are explicitly removed using hide_action .
ActionController :: Base further overrides it to return " default_render " , which handles the rendering .
That 's , in a nutshell , how the new architecture works : simple abstractions that represent a bunch of functionality that you can layer on if you need it .
ActionController ::
Http
ActionController :: Http layers a Rack abstraction on top of the core controller abstraction so that actions can be called as Rack endpoints .
On top of the core rendering functionality available in AbstractController : : Base , ActionController provides rendering functionality that builds on top of HTTP constructs .
For instance , the ActionController renderer knows how to set the content type based on the template it rendered .
Additionally , ActionController implements more developer - friendly APIs .
Instead of having to know about the ActionView : : Template object , developers can just use the name of the template ( pretty much the Rails 2.3 rendering API ) .
ActionController normalizes the developer 's inputs into the inputs that AbstractController is expecting , before calling super ( ActionController : : Http inherits from AbstractController : : Base ) .
Additional functionality is added via the ActionController : : Rails2Compatibility module , which provides support for things like stripping a leading " / " off of template names , and ActionController : : Base , which provides a final layer of normalization ( for instance , normalizing render : action => " foo " and render " foo " ) .
As a result , ActionController : : Base ends up being identical to the fully - featured ActionController : : Base that you used in Rails 2.3 , and none of your app code needs to change .
As an example , let 's look at rendering .
If you call render : template => " hello " , the first thing that happens is the normalization pass on ActionController : : Base .
Since we used a relatively normalized form , not much happens , and the options hash is passed up into the compatibility module , which checks to see if there 's a leading " / " in the template name .
Since there is n't , it passes the options hash up again into the AbstractController : : Renderer module .
There , Renderer checks to see if we 've already set the response body .
If we have , a DoubleRenderError is raised .
If not , render_to_body is called with the options hash .
The first place in the chain we find render_to_body is in ActionController : : Renderer , where it processes options like : content_type or : status .
It then calls super , passing control back into AbstractController , which promptly calls _determine_template , again with the options .
The job of _determine_template is to take in some options and return the template to render .
This hook point is provided so that other modules , like the Layouts module , can use the template that was looked up to control something they care about .
In this case , the Layouts module wants to limit the search for a layout to the formats and locale of the template that was actually rendered .
This solves a long - standing problem in Rails where templates and layouts were looked up separately , so it was possible for an HTML layout to be implicitly wrapped around an XML template .
No longer :)
The Layouts module gets called first with _determine_template .
It calls super , allowing the default template lookup to occur , which populates options [ : _template ] .
It then uses options [ : _template ] to look up the layout to use , populating options [ : _layout ] .
I had n't mentioned it before , but AbstractController uses options with leading underscores , leaving undecorated options for subclasses like ActionController : : Base .
After the template to render is determined , Renderer calls _render_template , which makes the call into ActionView .
I know it sounds rather complicated , but a graphic showing the relationships is forthcoming , which should clean things up .
The nice thing is that there are several layers of abstraction , and while the final system is complex ( mostly because the functionality is complex ) , it 's reasonably easy to understand the higher levels of abstraction on their own .
It 's also easy to put various kinds of normalization into standard places , so the code you 're reading at any given point is code that expects normalized inputs .
Since the normalization that Rails does can sometimes be quite gnarly ( in the service of making the user experience really pleasant ) , separating that stuff out can reduce the amount of gnarliness in the internals themselves .
Finally , an important part of an architecture like this is making sure that there is great internal documentation ( which we 've already started with ) , and some visualizations that show what 's going on .
If you were forced to track down the control flow above on your own for the first time , it would probably be non-trivial .
So a key part of this architecture is making sure you never have to do that .
I would also note that I 'm not particularly good at expressing code reading in blog posts , so the process definitely sounds a lot more complex than it actually is ;)

There has been one member of Congress that has been willing to stand up to the Federal Reserve more than any other , and now that it has been revealed that Barack Obama ’s “ financial reform ” plan would give the Federal Reserve almost dictatorial power over the U.S. economy , Ron Paul is hopping mad .
On MSNBC the other day , Ron Paul was not shy about telling the nation that the U.S. government should not be handing massive new powers to the institution most responsible for creating this current financial mess .
In fact , Ron Paul told MSNBC that he believes that the Federal Reserve is already more powerful than Congress …..
“ The regulations should be on the Federal Reserve .
We should have transparency of the Federal Reserve .
They can create trillions of dollars to bail out their friends , and we do n’t even have any transparency of this .
They ’re more powerful than the Congress . ”
The truth is that the Federal Reserve is about as “ federal ” as Federal Express is .
The Federal Reserve is a private bank that is designed to maximize profits for the elite international central bankers that own it .
The most frightening thing is that they are accountable to nobody .
Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke have reinforced this point repeatedly in media interviews and in front of Congress .
In fact , when Congress asked the Fed where all the bailout money went , the Fed told Congress that they did not have to answer .
And now Obama wants to give them massive new powers ?
Obama ’s plan would give the Federal Reserve unprecedented regulatory power over virtually every sector of the U.S. economy , and would allow the U.S. government , in conjunction with the Fed , to take over any company they want if they feel that there is “ a threat ” to the financial system .
Ron Paul understands that the Federal Reserve is at the very heart of America ’s financial problems .
During the same MSNBC interview , he diagnosed the current situation brilliantly …..
“ Too much regulations to begin with , so they give it more .
The Federal Reserve creates the problem , so we give them more power .
It ’s fiat money that ’s the problem , so we allow them to double the money supply – you ca n’t solve the problems that way .
That ’s like saying you can take care of a drug addict by just giving them more drugs . ”
Below you can see the entire interview .
It is probably one of the best Ron Paul interviews that has appeared on the mainstream news …..
But now even other members of Congress are starting to speak out against the Federal Reserve .
Senator Chris Dodd recently said that giving the Federal Reserve more power is like rewarding a son with a “ bigger , faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon ” .
But Timothy Geithner , who ran the New York Federal Reserve until he became Treasury Secretary , is vigorously defending the plan to give huge new power to the Fed , and is arguing that the Fed will not need any oversight as they exercise these new powers as it is “ very important ” that the Federal Reserve “ preserve its independence ” .
In other words , the Federal Reserve wants almost total control over the entire U.S. economy , but wants to be accountable to absolutely nobody .
Does that sound like a good plan to you ?
That is why it is so important to support Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the Federal Reserve ( H.R. 1207 ) .
The Federal Reserve Transparency
Act , as it is called , now has over 200 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives , and recently it was reported that it will move out of committee to be debated by the full House of Representatives .
However , a similar bill is reportedly being severely watered down in the U.S. Senate .
The fact is that the Federal Reserve needs to be audited .
If Ron Paul ’s bill passes , the private bank that creates and regulates all U.S. currency will be forced by law to open its books for the first time since 1950 .
That is almost 60 years ago .
It is time for the American people to learn what is going on at the financial institution that controls all of our economic lives , and it is time for the American people to learn what happened to all of the trillions in bailout money .
But the Federal Reserve will not let this happen without a fight .
They have vast resources and tremendous power at their disposal , and they are n’t going to let someone like Ron Paul upset their apple cart so easily .
Let us hope that Ron Paul is victorious in this fight so that the American people can finally get a true idea of what his really going on at the Federal Reserve .

Under the scrutiny of criminal investigators , election workers in Phoenix have spent the past week in a painstaking recount of 120,821 ballots that were cast three years ago for a Pima County transit tax .
The primary objective is to determine whether someone rigged the election by tampering with the optical - scan polling machines in Pima County , transforming " no " votes into " yes " votes .
The ballot measures wound up securing a half - cent increase in sales tax to provide cash for roads , buses and other transportation projects .
But ramifications of the ballot review may be even bigger than the $ 2.1 billion spending package : Voting machines in Pima County , which includes Tucson , are similar to those used in 12 of Arizona 's 15 counties and in hundreds of jurisdictions across the country .
If it turns out the election was rigged by manipulating the computer programs , some fear , it will show weaknesses in electronic balloting that could endanger the democratic process .
Independent analysts and academic experts already have assailed Diebold Elections Systems , now known as Premier Election Solutions Inc. , which manufactured the devices used in Tucson .
They contend the electronic - voting machines are ripe for fraud .
And , no matter what happens with the recount , state Attorney General Terry Goddard said he is convinced the equipment jeopardizes election integrity .
" These ( Premier ) systems are very , very bad , " Goddard said .
" ( They ) are not state of the art in terms of security .
They are not state of the art in terms of transparency . "
Chris Riggall , a spokesman for Premier , said his company uses the most advanced technology available and urges clients to establish security protocols .
Although there are internal safety features to prevent and detect tampering , Riggall added , those must be supported by external controls over election workers who handle the equipment .
" You can manipulate any voting system devised by man , " he said , noting that even paper ballots are subject to fraud .
The Premier machines tabulate elections in about 1,700 U.S. cities , counties , states and other jurisdictions .
Riggall said Pima County has a GEMS mainframe linked to AccuVote TSX touch - screen voting terminals .
Grand jurors are reviewing allegations that an election technician in Tucson tampered with software , reversing the outcome of a funding vote for Pima County 's Regional Transportation Authority .
Premier 's machines showed a 60 percent vote in favor of a measure for the transit plan and 58 percent in favor of another measure imposing a half - cent sales - tax increase .
Officials with the Democratic and Libertarian parties alleged the financing measure , which failed four times previously and was far behind in pre-election polls , succeeded in 2006 because of fraud .
During an initial investigation , the Attorney General 's Office hired an independent company to analyze the machines .
Experts at iBeta Software Quality Assurance found a number of " irregularities " and determined that the Premier system had " fundamental security flaws . "
They reported that a trained technician could have altered the vote and removed all evidence of the crime .
However , they concluded that human error was a more likely culprit than fraud because evidence of tampering had not been erased .
The Attorney General 's Office dropped the case in 2007 , but the Democratic and Libertarian parties continued private investigations and filed lawsuits for election records against the Pima County Board of Supervisors , whose members all endorsed the RTA measure .
During the case , county lawyers complained in a brief that they could not put up an adequate defense because of a concern that every employee who worked on the election computer might assert a Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination .
Jim March , a Libertarian Party officer in Tucson , said he and John Brakey of the Pima County Democratic Party discovered that chief election technician Bryan Crane ran computer checks five days before the polling date to determine the vote tally based on more than 16,000 mail - in ballots .
Although it is not illegal to conduct such a check , it is unlawful to divulge the results because partisan activists could use pre-election tallies to decide on campaign finance and advertising strategies .
Something ' squirrelly '
March said testimony in the open - records case showed Pima County election staffers " were basically passing these results around like baseball scores . "
" They were peeking into where votes were going , " he added , " and there was something particularly squirrelly about the RTA election . "
Brad Nelson , elections director for Pima County , said he does not believe there was any wrongdoing by employees .
Crane did not respond to an interview offer made through Nelson .
He has not been charged with any offense and continues overseeing Pima County 's election technology .
Former Pima County employee Zbigniew Osmolski filed an affidavit in July alleging that he was in a Tucson lounge when Crane admitted that he had " fixed the RTA election on the instructions of his bosses " and was fearful of indictment .
That same month , Democratic Party attorney Bill Risner submitted a letter to Goddard asking that the criminal probe be reopened .
Risner offered new evidence and complained of a cover - up during the first investigation , which was assisted by Pima County election officials .
Risner noted that , according to sworn courtroom testimony , Crane routinely took voting data home during elections and had his office computer connected to the GEMS system .
He also claimed that Crane purchased a hacking device before the election , one with " no other purpose than to illegally alter the programming of precinct voting machines . "
No county employee has been disciplined , Risner said , despite criminal and policy violations .
Goddard said he agreed to reinvestigate based on the " worrisome number of puzzling coincidences . "
To establish whether a crime took place , he added , the state must first learn whether the election outcome was bogus .
That is why poll workers are hand - counting 105 boxes of ballots at a cost of over $ 12,000 .
The review is being done in Maricopa County , where Premier machines are not used , to avoid a conflict of interest .
Yet even the review , expected to end today , has been controversial .
Critics questioned ballot security before the count and complained that Goddard 's office limited their ability to observe the tabulation .
' Plenty annoyed '
" They 're doing it in a way to make sure that the political parties do n't know what 's going on , " Risner complained .
" We 're plenty annoyed with the secrecy . "
The RTA has collected about $ 210 million since the sales - tax increase began three years ago .
If the recount shows that the measure should have failed , Goddard said , election results will not automatically be overturned .
However , he said , such a finding could lead critics to seek court orders overturning the outcome .
But Nelson , the Pima County elections director , said he is convinced the original vote count was right .
He said no new security has been added to the Premier system , " one of the best out there . "
However , Nelson added , the county has instituted external safeguards to reduce the risk of tampering .
The list includes a password system so no single employee can access the computer and 24 - hour video surveillance of computers , beamed live on the Internet .
Risner 's letter to Goddard portrays the more sinister image of election - fraud , adding , " Anything less than an honest count of the ballots is a crime that strikes at the heart of our democratic system . "
I recently finished my first iPhone app and submitted it to Apple to get a feel for the iPhone App Store .
I did n’t want to invest a lot of time into this experiment , so I decided to add some polish to a very simple game I had already written for my own amusement , and put it out there .
I ’m probably going to write a second article detailing some sales numbers ( they ’re practically non-existant , so I ’m not sure how interesting that is going to be ) , but since sales never were the goal of the app , I ’m going to start out with some more important things I ’ve learned when writing and releasing this app .
Search
This is just something weird I have noticed .
Different stores show different results for the same search term .
Searching for the exact name of my app in the Swiss store shows it as the first search result , while the search position in the US store fluctuates :
I have no idea what causes the difference .
Reviews
Most larger sites are swamped with review requests and wo n’t even respond to mail .
Smaller sites and YouTube Channels are happy to get promo codes , but they do n’t have much reach .
Some sites encourage posting gaming news to their forums , which is pretty cool because it gives you quick feedback from people who actually play your games .
To my surprise , some sites and podcasts actually request money for reviews or frontpage placement of news items .
Some even take money for reviews , and offer to not release the review if it turns out to be negative .
Others have written about this :
But when I find out that certain sites are using gutter tactics like selling reviews on the sly , that ’s where I draw the line .
I recently lost an advertiser to a competitor that offered him a review along with his advertising package – « impartial , » of course - to better promote his game .
Needless to say that this is not the kind of behaviour the iPhone app market needs .
Perhaps this might help .
iTunes App Loader
Since « Release » versions of iPhone applications are signed with a specific App Store Provisioning Profile , there ’s no obvious way to test them ( there is , however , a non-obvious way ) .
In fact , you ca n’t even be entirely sure that the application is signed properly .
To get around that , you can use the Application Loader to upload apps to iTunes Connect .
It seems that the Application Loader will verify the signature when uploading the app , although I have n’t tested this ( signing worked fine for me ) .
The bickbot blog explains where to find the Application Loader .
Crashes
About a day after releasing the game , I got a mail saying basically « well , you got my money , but I ca n’t play your app because it crashes . »
To me , this feels like getting punched in the stomach : Somebody gave you his or her money , and the app does n’t work because you screwed up or did n’t test enough or did n’t think of some special case .
They have every right to be pissed off , because you basically stole their money .
From the description of the crash , it became obvious to me that the game crashed because it ran out of memory .
During beta testing , nobody had had this issue .
I assumed that my app ’s memory usage was well within the limits of what any iPhone should be able to handle .
So I made the boneheaded decision to ignore memory warnings ; I simply assumed that my app was small enough that it would always fit into the iPhone ’s available memory and never receive a memory warning .
Turns out the person who had the crash had a jailbroken phone that had n’t been restarted in a while .
Restarting solved the problem , but the other issue is the jailbreak .
Jailbroken iPhones tend to have less available memory , probably mainly due to background processes that some non-Apple - approved apps can create .
I have n’t found an easy way of testing my app for iPhones with memory issues .
What I did to check my fixes was to
Create a test build which allocates and retains a bunch of unused memory when the app starts Create a test build which constantly leaks memory , eventually triggering memory warnings
That should cover most situations people might actually encounter in real life .
Daniel Ericsson points out that memory warnings can also be tested by using « Hardware » -> « Simulate Memory Warning » in Simulator.app .
That that does n’t replicate the actual low - memory situation on the actual hardware , but it ’s useful for testing the code triggered by memory warnings .
For the record , my game simply turns off some animations when it receives the first memory warning , releasing the images used for those animations .
This seems to have fixed the problem .
2.2
Something else I discovered during beta testing is that a lot of people still use iPhone OS version 2.2 .
Some do n’t want to risk updating a well - running phone .
Another reason is that updating jailbroken phones requires quite a bit of time , and a lot of people with jailbroken phones simply wo n’t bother to do it .
So it ’s probably a good idea to support older versions if possible .
Performance is your Number 1 Problem
I started writing this particular game even before I got accepted into the iPhone developer program , simply to get acquainted with iPhone development .
It ran just fine in the simulator , but when I put it on an actual iPhone , I was able to get about two frames per second .
There was no way to salvage my code ; I had to rewrite the game , making entirely different assumptions about the iPhone ’s performance .
There ’s a saying in software engineering : premature optimization is the root of all evil .
As a general rule , this may be true , but on the iPhone , you should probably optimize constantly .
Otherwise , you might end up with an application you can’t possibly get to work .
Start out with a « performance prototype » simply to see whether your idea can actually work at all .
Then , during development , do on - device performance tests regularly .
Fix issues as soon as they come up if you do n’t want to get stuck with a wonderful application you ca n’t get to perform acceptably .
Finally , not all « Touch OS » devices have the same processor .
Some newer iPods have faster processors .
Make sure to also test your app on older , slower devices and perhaps allow the app to adapt to them in some way , either by measuring performance , or by checking what specific device your app is running on .
For example , some racing games show fewer opponents on slower devices .
Here ’s a way to detect what device your app is running on .
Memory is also your Number 1 Problem
As noted above , memory is a constant issue on the iPhone .
You may be tempted to improve performance by increasing memory consumption .
On desktop computers , this typically works just fine since the operating system can page out idle applications and give your app almost as much real memory as you ask for .
On the iPhone , this does n’t work .
You pretty much get the amount of memory that is currently free , and if you want to use more than that , you ’re shut down .
So it ’s often not a good idea to fix performance issues by increasing memory consumption .
As a general rule , you should probably keep memory consumption low and release stuff as soon as you can , even if it ’s bad for performance .
You ’ll be glad you did once the iPhone grows the ability to multitask .
Even if your app runs perfectly fine on your iPhone and your beta testers ’
iPhones , chances are your actual customers will run into memory issues you did not .
They will have jailbroken phones with background processes running .
They will have iPhones that have n’t been restarted in weeks or months .
So even if your app requires little memory and you never had any issues , it ’s probably a good idea to catch low - memory warnings anyway .
The lecture was about various examples in nature , financial markets and civilizations where previously correlated patterns were eventually sharply disrupted by small critical changes leading to phase transitions .
We 've had essays on the failure of networked systems , the ecological framing of collapse , and similar topics on TOD before , but while watching the 2 video lectures , I started to wonder : what impact does detailed knowledge of collapse dynamics have on collapse dynamics ?
This is the topic of tonight 's Campfire .
I just watched an excellent and thought provoking lecture by Noah Raford at London School of Economics ( hat tip Jason Bradford ) : ( Note : you can play around with these models on Netlogo online HERE )
Some summarizing points from the lecture itself ( little new to readers here but if pressed for time , I 'd rather you watch the video than read this post ) :
==> The more complicated a system , especially one involving automation , optimization , and human oversight , the more likely it is to fail ( tight optimization in a dynamic environment is bad ) .
== >( From Didier Sornettes " Why Stock Markets Crash " ) : " ... stock market crashes are caused by a slow build - up of long range correlations leading to global cooperative behaviour of the market eventually ending in a collapse in a short time interval .
1 . Individual behavior percolates throughout the system
2. Successful traders set examples for non-successful ones , who then imitate their actions and behaviour
3. Imitative behaviour then intenstifies as markets become more connected .
4. Leading to a crash " ( I think the above is interesting if we substitute ' society ' for ' market ' and ' citizens ' for ' traders ' . )
==> Complexity comes at a cost , it 's hard to turn back once you 've got it , and it 's value decreases the more of it you have ( Tainter ) .
==> ( Based on Panarchy - Gunderson / Holling )
* Multiple states are common in many systems
* It is impossible to predict where tipping points are until it's too late ( interactive complexity )
* Functional diversity builds resistance
* Management must cope with surprise and uncertainty == > Take Home Message :
* Stay light
* Stay smart
* Experiment
* Learn quickly
* Keep multiple options open
Though all these are topics worthy of discussion themselves , I 'd like to throw the following line of questions to tonights Campfire :
By definition , all previous ecosystem and non-human collapses were not ' understood as collapse ' by those organisms alive during the collapse .
Similarly , during historical human social collapses , ( Rome , Easter Island , Anasazi , Maya , etc. ) , people might have known they were in the middle of some unpleasant trajectory , but they did n't have the knowledge , historical record , technology or communication that modern society possesses in understanding / explaining what was transpiring .
As such , when this civilization ' collapses ' , ( which in the opinion of this writer is inevitable - the timing , direction , and severity of which remain the salient unknowns ) , it will be the first to have at least some portion of its inhabitants anticipate and understand its own collapse in a systems dynamics sense .
How will this odd ' collapse trivia ' manifest in steering / pulling / resisting actual collapse , if at all ?
Let 's presume that ~ 95 % of humans will be unaware of or unable to synthesize the idea of collapse into their existing belief systems .
I would put the remaining ~ 5 % in the following groups :
1. Academics tweaking the academic aspects of systems theories out of academic interest ( i.e. non-applied )
2 . Those following collapse dynamics for unexpected reward ( e.g. novelty without intent to change )
3 . Individuals and groups accelerating their own localities move towards more durable built / human / social capital .
( i.e. resilience and redundancy over efficiency and financial profit )
4. Government / corporate / BAU entities anticipating how to best defend their own power / advantage
5 . Other - individuals / groups that history will show as black swans , either purposeful or accidental .
Off the top of my head on this muggy Saturday afternoon , I would guess that groups 1 and 2 ( and the aforementioned 95 % ) are along for the ride .
Group 3 ( where many TOD readers reside ) will mirror the ' multiple strategies ' from Noah 's lecture - some strategies will work better than others but relocalization , more simplicity , substitution of time and labor for technology , etc. will likely make a portfolio of these groups more resilient to any number of future scenarios , almost exclusively out of self - interest in the medium term ( as opposed to long term , e.g. beyond their own lives ) .
Group # 4 , via ostensibly trying to avert collapse will actually accelerate it because by and large their definition of ' collapse aversion ' is embedded in the long - term correlated behavior that is squeezing us further into the chinese finger trap .
Group # 5 then is the wild card - those whose actions , advertent or otherwise will shift initial conditions enough so that reasonably predictable future events will now have different trajectories and speeds .
This group is also probably the tiniest minority ( perhaps as tiny as n=1 ) .
TONIGHT'S CAMPFIRE QUESTIONS
1 .
Will knowledge of upcoming collapse ( or at least the possibility of such ) change behaviour in anything other than self - interested , intermediate term ( 5 - 15 year ) preparation ?
2 . Will spreading knowledge of collapse dynamics ( such as Noahs video linked up top ) meaningfully change the initial conditions of future real - life iterations ?
If so , how ?
3 . Could educating our current leaders about collapse / system dynamics result in their adoption of behaviours outside of the current business as usual system ?
Or would it require new leaders and / or a different system ?
We know so much , yet are careening forward .... How to go beyond knowledge and synthesis into integration and implementation ?
Google Search Dropped Traffic To XahLee.org
hi , i have question about how google represent my website , and a sudden vertical drop of traffic from google , represented by this image :
http://trends.google.com/websites?q=xahlee.org
Google Trends on XahLee.org , as of 2009 - 06 - 16 .
I have this math project on my website : Visual Dictionary of Special Plane Curves .
This project is the primary content of my website .
It has been top search result and traffic for my site from 2000 to 2008 june .
( basically , roughly speaking , 70 % or more traffic on my website is about math topics in project and other math contents . )
However , i noticed today , that google webmasters sitelink does not even list it .
Instead , my website today is represented by keywords such as the following top 10 keywords result :
ass blondie orgy virgin young girl lara croft curves rebel flag girls girls girls parabola lady guy youporn.com sex position tony braxton debbie does dallas
which goes to 2 % of my website 's pages that are commentary about human sexuality .
Google Analytics basically reports the same .
( total number of pages on my site is about 3900 . )
There seems to be something drastic that happened within the past half year , starting in 2008 June .
Basically , the math content , which is the main content of my site , has been downplayed to almost non-existence , while about some 2 % of my website 's content , that are rather trivial blog style commentaries on human sexuality , became the main representation for my website .
My site traffic from google search has been reduced to some 1/3 of 2008 june .
Can anyone give me some idea about what 's going on ?
Here 's some specific question i have .
1. why is my major project http://xahlee.org/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/specialPlaneCurves.html that has been around for over a decade and widely linked by edu institutions , now seems largely delisted .
2. i do n't want the 5 % of my blog writings on lurid matters such as porn or sexuality , became my site 's representation , because 95 % of my site 's content are on strictly math and computer science topics .
How can i do this ?
3 . Starting maybe around 2006 , i noticed a huge amount of machine - generated spam sites or blogs that insert my name Xah Lee , or snippets of my site 's writings .
What can i do about this ?
( often , if i just search my name xah lee or my site xahlee.org on blogs , newsgroups , the results are mostly machine generated spam . )
Thanks .

I wrote a couple of nights ago , here -- ' 9/11 Commission Report -- Info Obtained Through Torture " -- as to how much of what was published in the 9/11 Commission report was obtained through torture , and is therefore completely without credibility .
Scandalous enough , right ?
Well , it gets worse .
The above described James Farmer has just come out with his new book .
It was released April 14 .
I have not read it ( I just heard about it maybe ten minutes ago ) and it is difficult to find any reviews of it by any mainstream book reviewers ( gee , what a surprise ! ) .
But according to the publisher , it 's quite a bombshell :
Description :
As of the 9/11 Commission ’s one of the primary authors report , John Farmer is proud of his and his colleagues ’ work .
Yet he came away from the experience convinced that there was a further story to be told , one he was uniquely qualified to write .
Now that story can be told .
Tape recordings , transcripts , and contemporaneous records that had been classified have since been declassified , and the inspector general ’s investigations of government conduct have been completed .
Drawing on his knowledge of those sources , as well as his years as an attorney in public and private practice , Farmer reconstructs the truth of what happened on that fateful day and the disastrous circumstances that allowed it : the institutionalized disconnect between what those on the ground knew and what those in power did .
He reveals — terrifyingly and illuminatingly — the key moments in the years , months , weeks , and days that preceded the attacks , then descends almost in real time through the attacks themselves , revealing them as they have never before been seen .
Ultimately Farmer builds the inescapably convincing case that the official version not only is almost entirely untrue but serves to create a false impression of order and security .
The ground truth that Farmer captures tells a very different story — a story that is doomed to be repeated unless the systemic failures he reveals are confronted and remedied .
So let me just repeat that to let it sink in ....
The official story is " almost entirely untrue . "
So what IS true ?
Hell if I know .
And check this out :
Farmer himself states that " at some level of the government , at some point in time ... there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened . "
So let 's let that sink in .... there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened .
This link also develops the story further :
In August 2006 , the Washington Post reported , " Some staff members and commissioners of the Sept. 11 panel concluded that the Pentagon ’s initial story of how it reacted to the 2001 terrorist attacks may have been part of a deliberate effort to mislead the commission and the public rather than a reflection of the fog of events on that day , according to sources involved in the debate . "
The report revealed how the 10 - member commission deeply suspected deception to the point where they considered referring the matter to the Justice Department for criminal investigation .
" We to this day do n’t know why NORAD told us what they told us , " said Thomas H. Kean , the former New Jersey Republican governor who led the commission .
" It was just so far from the truth .
. . .
It ’s one of those loose ends that never got tied .
Wow .
Let 's go to that Washington
Post story now , shall we ?
It 's 9/11 Panel Suspected Deception by Pentagon , from August 1 , 2006 :
For more than two years after the attacks , officials with NORAD and the FAA provided inaccurate information about the response to the hijackings in testimony and media appearances .
Authorities suggested that U.S. air defenses had reacted quickly , that jets had been scrambled in response to the last two hijackings and that fighters were prepared to shoot down United Airlines Flight 93 if it threatened Washington .
In fact , the commission reported a year later , audiotapes from NORAD 's Northeast headquarters and other evidence showed clearly that the military never had any of the hijacked airliners in its sights and at one point chased a phantom aircraft -- American Airlines Flight 11 -- long after it had crashed into the World Trade Center .
Maj. Gen. Larry Arnold and Col. Alan Scott told the commission that NORAD had begun tracking United 93 at 9:16 a.m. , but the commission determined that the airliner was not hijacked until 12 minutes later .
The military was not aware of the flight until after it had crashed in Pennsylvania .
These and other discrepancies did not become clear until the commission , forced to use subpoenas , obtained audiotapes from the FAA and NORAD , officials said .
The agencies ' reluctance to release the tapes -- along with e-mails , erroneous public statements and other evidence -- led some of the panel 's staff members and commissioners to believe that authorities sought to mislead the commission and the public about what happened on Sept. 11 .
Farmer was quoted in this story as well .
And according to the one review I did find :
Make no mistake , Farmer is not saying that 9/11 was an inside job ...
I 'm sure I 'll get flamed by a lot of people who do n't even read that quote .
But whatever .
Like I said , I have n't read the book myself , seeing as I just found out about it .
But it sure looks interesting .
Sure would be nice to find out what really happened that day .
And left wondering HOW such a monumentally huge fuck - up , at every level imaginable , both during the attacks , and after , and during the investigation that followed , could have possibly happened in this country .
And why people were tortured to deliberately give false information that could be used in a report everybody knew was bogus anyway .
And why we are now involved in two wars , both unnecessary and without end ...
And why we 're being lied to about it all , to this day .
1 The Man who divorced his wife for being ‘ too shy ’ to consummate their marriage … after a year !
A Tainan court granted a man ’s request for divorce because his wife was “ too shy ” to consummate their marriage , after a year !
The man surnamed Chen , a 38 - year - old teacher from Tainan County was introduced to a woman surnamed Lin , 29 , also a teacher , by a matchmaker .
After the couple dated for three months , they got married , but Lin refused to consummate the marriage .
On the wedding night , Lin slept fully dressed and wrapped with a quilt .
When Chen tried to sleep with her she pushed him away shouting : “ You are ridiculous ! ” , and returned to her mother ’s home the day next .
Through the matchmaker ’s mediation , Lin signed a contract agreeing to consummate the marriage but only for the purpose of procreation , and demanded to sleep separately .
However , she did not live up to the pledge , cause Chen filed for divorce .
Lin contested the divorce , claiming that she refused to consummate the marriage on the wedding night because she was too tired and was ill .
But the judge said it was strange for Lin to refuse to consummate the marriage for one year , so he granted the divorce and ruled that Lin must compensate Chen NT $ 300,000 for buying an apartment , giving Lin ’s family a dowry and losing face because she did not consummate the marriage .
2 The Woman who requested divorce because her husband tried to sneak one look at her face after 30 years of marriage
Saudi woman asked for divorce in 2008 because her husband tried to sneak one look at her face after 30 years of marriage .
A Saudi Arabian man lived with his wife for 30 years without setting eyes on her face .
His 50 - year - old wife followed the tradition of her native village near the south - western city of Khamis Mushayt and kept her features veiled at all times .
One night the husband was overcome by curiosity and tried to lift his wife ’s veil as she slept to take a look at her face .
It was an error he is unlikely to be given a chance to repeat for his outraged wife woke up during his sneak peek and decided to demand a divorce .
The betrayed wife said her husband apologized and promised never to do it again , but she insisted she wanted a divorce .
It may seem odd , but cases of Saudi husbands with wives forever shrouded in mystery are not uncommon .
3 The Woman who got divorced after her parrot started repeating “ Divorce ” and “ Be Patient ”
In 2001 , a Chinese woman launched divorce proceedings against her husband after the family ’s pet mynah bird reportedly spilled the beans on his marital indiscretions .
According to the Xinmin Evening News , the woman first suspected something was amiss when the bird began repeating words apparently picked up from her husband ’s secret telephone calls to his lover after she returned from a month - long visit to her parents .
She said words such as “ divorce ” , “ I love you ” , and “ be patient ” had become an increasingly frequent feature of the feathered telltale ’s idle twitterings .
She took her case — along with the bird — to a local law office for consultation , hoping it would testify in court against her husband ; lawyers however told her they were not optimistic that the bird ’s testimony would sway the court .
The wife filed for divorce but , for some bizarre reason , evidence from a bird was apparently not admissible in Chinese courts .
4 The 81 - year - old husband who got caught with his mistress after 60 years
An 83 - year - old German woman , divorced her 81 - year - old husband after 60 years of marriage because he was caught having sex with his mistress at work .
Georg Meister met his lover , 30 years younger , at work .

His wife Ruth who was told about her husband ’s antics threw him out of their home and he moved in with his younger lover who lives just two doors down the road .
The divorce court heard the couple had met over 60 years ago as Allied bombs fell on Bonn and have since raised three children together .
5 The Wife who divorced her man for cleaning too much
In April 2009 , a German woman divorced her husband because she was “ fed up ” with him cleaning everything all the time .

7 The Woman who demanded divorce because she just could n’t stand to have lunch with her mother - in- law
Romanian woman demanded a divorce in 2005 because she could n’t stand having lunch with her mother - in - law every day .
The 22 - year - old woman had been married for only 10 months when she claimed her life turned into a nightmare because of her mother - in - law .
Elena T. from Focsani , in Vrancea county , said to a judge that the presence of her mother - in - law at the most important meal of the day with her teasing remarks had ruined her marriage .
The court asked Mrs. Elena to reconsider her demand , advising her to find a better reason if she wants to separate from her husband .
8 The Woman who divorced her husband after 50 years for feeding stray dogs
A Romanian pensioner has filed for divorce after 50 years because she is fed up with her husband spending their entire pension on stray dogs .
Eliza Barbu , 70 , from Focsani , said her husband Mircea had begun giving scraps of food a few years ago to a pair of stray dogs .
But he then started feeding a pack of more than 20 strays three times a day , leaving no food for them .
She said she could n’t accept the fact that we are starving every week while he would use his entire pension to feed the dogs that gather around their house .
More and more dogs come every week .
Romanian cities have had a huge problem with packs of feral dogs ever since the country ’s animal loving dictator Nicolae Ceausescu refused to allow the killing of strays .
9 The Wife who divorced her man for running to promote Beijing Olympics

He spent the money on a six - man support team and a van , on which he ’s had painted ‘ Support Beijing Olympics ’ in both English and Chinese .
His wife promised to divorce him if he went ahead with the stunt , and so he did .
According to him , he was just running to promote the Olympic spirit .
10 The Man who faced divorce after his penis extension broke during sex

The advent of the the personal solar panel probably started with those solar powered calculators way back when .
I remember I used to rip those little sun suckers out of as many calculators as I could get a hold of and try and make something cool … it never worked out .
But nowadays , solar powered accessories are all the rage .
You find them on public trashcans , parking meters , boats , even stadiums .
Here are just a sampling of some of the things we have slapped solar panels on and called them better .
Solar Sunglasses
Why has n’t this been thought of sooner ?
It just makes so much sense , sunglasses = sun = solar energy , right ?
Something tells me you would have to be ON the sun ( or at least looking directly at the sun ) to even squeeze a watt out of those sexy little guys .
I ’d still rock them just for the green fashion prestige .
[via yanko design
Solar Tent
Now that is just one cool looking tent .
Makes me think of a big orange solar paneled armadillo .
Not very practical for hiking , but with the remote finder that actually lights up the tent and other ‘ gadgety ’ accessories , it would make for a great concert tent .
[ via engaget
Solar Cell Phone
Samsungs new solar powered cell phone , looks cool , and should be cool , however , I am still perplexed by this one .
It seems only logical , until you actually think about it .
Do n’t you usually want to keep your electronics OUT of the sun ?
How often do you have your phone chillin’ in the sun anyways ?
I ’m all for it , except that it would be totally useless for me .
I would rather have the Ulysse Nardin Chairman Kinetic Cellphone , but I digress .
[ via cnet
Solar Speakerphone
Things that make you go : uhhhh , Okaaayy ?
I did n’t even know there was a market for this , but apparently they are quite the hot item .
The Bluetooth Solar Speaker Phone is just that , a speakerphone that is solar powered .
I guess it would be pretty useful in the car - just stick it on the dash and you ’re good for a hands - free device .
Solar Backpack
The classic among this list , I added it just for familiarity .
If you have n’t seen Voltaic ’s Solar Panel Backpack yet , then you have been asleep for the ‘ personal solar panel revolution ’ .
Solar panels fitted to a backpack that house your electronics while you are on the move .
It ’s a pretty obvious use of harnessing the suns rays to do your bidding .
Solar Vest
For those who value function before fashion , I have a very practical vest for you .
It ’s much like the solar backpack , but without hassle of carrying a backpack .
Just in case people are fooled into thinking you are wearing the newest cutting edge clothing designer , it says “ Solar Vest ” across your back in big bold letters to alert would - be admirers to the fact that indeed you are a gadget - freak .
[ via Dvice
Solar Hat
It ’s probably not what you would expect .
The most popular ( and probably most intuitive ) solar hats consist of a solar chip driving a small fan on your forehead .
Very useful , but not very fashionable .
The solar light cap on the other hand helps you at night instead .
This version is actually pretty cool looking , and from the looks of it , very useful too !
Hey , it even won a best design award at the NZ TechnoFashion Awards show - watch out Versace !
Notepad is known to every Windows users .

" Well - built men , 18 - 30 , who would like to be eaten by me " was the typical advertisement Armin Meiwes took out on personals Web sites [ source : Harper's ] .
After hundreds of false starts , he found a willing partner in 43 - year - old Bernd - Jurgen Brandes .
The two men met on March 9 , 2001 .
It would be an odd night for both of them .
With Brandes high on painkillers and schnapps , yet consenting , Meiwes removed the man 's penis with a knife .
He flambéed it , and the two ate it together .
Bleeding heavily , Brandes took a bath .
He eventually lost consciousness , whereupon Meiwes slit his throat , butchered him and ate a little more of­ the man 's flesh .
Over the course of the next few months , Meiwes consumed 44 pounds of Brandes ' dead body [ source : Speigel ] .

The cannibal was eventually arrested and tried amid a media frenzy .
But at the time of Meiwes ' prosecution , Germany , like some other Western nations , had no law prohibiting cannibalism .
Instead , Meiwes and other cannibals like him , including serial murderers Albert Fish and Jeffrey Dahmer , was convicted of the killing , not the eating .
Murder is illegal ; cannibalism exists beyond the law .
It is taboo .
­ Cannibalism is as old as civilization , and likely older .
The Kemites believed that Osiris their god of agriculture , gifted them with crops to prevent them from cannibalism .
Greek mythology contains myriad tales of cannibalism , beginning with Chronos , the father of all gods .
The Hebrews wandering the African desert resort to cannibalism in the Old Testament [ source : Lukaschek ] .
Cannibalism is ancient , and yet -- as Meiwes , Dahmer , Fish and others remind us -- it 's modern as well .
It could be latent in every one of us : Recent events show that when the chips are down , even the most civilized humans will resort to cannibalism to survive .
Yet , we recoil from the thought of others consuming human flesh and refrain from exploring the possibility of our own ability to cannibalize others .
But cannibalism was a part of life and death for cultures around the world .
Those that gave it up as a practice did so unwillingly .
And if history is any indicator , an end to cannibalism has not come .
As Ted Turner predicted , in the face of climate change , those left to survive will resort to cannibalism [ source : AJC ] .
Turner is n't an authority on the subject of anthropophagy ( the clinical term for cannibalism ) , but he may not be far off .
People have shown that we will eat one another in times of strife .
If pupils are already able to tell the time and this takes the form of revising or consolidating their learning on time , they could be asked to attempt to write a letter explaining to Barry how the clock works and why he was wrong when he said that it was " one past five " .
If pupils are in the process of learning how to tell the time , they could be given their own miniature clocks to follow along with whilst watching the clip .
At an appropriate point , the clip could then be paused and pupils asked to display on the clock the time that they think the awaited guest will arrive .
Each person could be asked to say out loud or write on a mini whiteboard , the time they have predicted .
We can now add the sad - eyed Gov. Mark Sanford , making his tearful public confessional , to the galaxy of similar fallen stars we have seen in this state before .
The question no one has ever answered is how they all fell into the grip of the same delusion : namely , that the way to retrieving dignity is to go before the microphones to issue craven apologies to a list of purported victims .
Can these recitals , interrupted by barely suppressed sobs , acknowledgment of all the betrayed -- the family dog will be in there some day --...

BOSTON —
When he arrived on American soil two years ago , " King Raam " admitted to being afraid .
The young Iranian rocker , fresh from Tehran 's music underground , was not scared of failure , though the odds of U.S. music industry success were long for even the most well connected of rock wanna - be's .
Nor was he overly worried about JFK passport control : after all , he had a properly issued visa — though it had been delayed in Dubai because of a stand - off over the boatload of British sailors being held by Iran 's Revolutionary Guards not far from the coastal southern Iranian town of Bushehr , where he was born .
Raam 's biggest fear in those heady days of March 2007 , sleeping on friends ' floors and playing gigs in late - opening bars on Manhattan 's Lower East Side , was being seen publicly criticizing Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the fearsome band of mullahs pulling the strings in the Islamic Republic .
But now , spurred by the tumultuous events in Iran , Raam and his band , Hypernova , have seemingly found their voice in opposing the Iranian government .
" Because of the internet , the people of the world are being exposed to the horrific reality of the streets , " Raam said Wednesday .
" The oppressive government is continuously trying to clean up after itself through misinformation and propaganda .
" There have been many other fascists like Hitler , Stalin and Franco who have suppressed the people and the truth far too long before they were defeated , but thanks to the amazing flow of information there is only so much that this fascist government can do . "
While Raam admits that Hypernova has a way to go before realizing the rock stardom they crave , they can claim a measure of success .
The band is at the forefront of the Iranian rock movement , having achieved celebrity in the " underground " scene at home before coming to the U.S. , “ with a guitar , $ 400 and no expectations . ”
In Iran , bands compete to have their music played in online " festivals " as a way of getting around a 2005 ban on Western music that was part of Ahmadinejad 's efforts to roll back the reforms of his more liberal predecessor , Mohammad Khatami .
Defiance of the ban can lead to arrest , large fines and even a public flogging .
Once in the U.S. , Hypernova quickly found traction and have since toured nationally , supporting such major international acts as Sisters of Mercy , and have headlined at the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin , Texas .
Raam writes songs in English as opposed to Farsi , which he considers a " poetic and harmonious language " but not one well suited to the harsh , energetic rock sound .
The themes of his songs mostly stay off the topic of politics , but touch on world events .
Raam and his Iranian band mates Kodi , Jam , Kami and Poya , ranging in age from 19 to 28 , go by derivations of their first names but avoid using their last names to ensure their families do not receive undue attention at home .
Hypernova recently recorded their first album and have a major following — not only among the huge Iranian diaspora in the U.S. but among mainstream indie music fans .
With their growing success , Raam now feels confident in using the band 's profile to promote the causes of democracy and freedom in his home country .
" I 've actively been helping other kids in the underground , trying to get their visas , trying to get them into festivals , " he said .
" I got a CNN interview for one ( band ) on Inside the Middle East .
I try to help as many kids as I can because I feel like we owe it to them .
We even gave our CD away in Iran for free — because I know there 's no way for them to find it online or buy it . ”
Raam attended schools in the U.S. — thanks to a relatively privileged upbringing — but spent many of his formative years in Iran .
Like so many of his compatriots , he derives inspiration from Iran ’s rich history and culture and hopes one day to return , but sees a need to achieve overseas success in order to bring much - needed change at home .
" We 've so far avoided the Iranian press because we do n't want to be politicized in the Iranian context , ” Raam said .
“ What we represent is a much more universal and global thing .

Raam , whose parents and many friends still live in Tehran , said he kept in touch with family via Skype and friends on Facebook , but had rarely felt further away from them than during this week 's tumult .
" The people in Iran have been robbed of this election , " he said .
" Historically speaking whenever there is more voter turnout , it almost always goes in favor the reformer .
There are so many flaws in this election one does n't even know where to begin .
" Thanks to social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook , the people of Iran now have a voice .
Every single person I have talked to is willing to risk their lives in the name of freedom and justice . "
It is , he says , a stark contrast to the opportunities America has presented him thus far .
" I 've never been poorer than I am , but I 've never been happier , " he said .
" We 've traveled through 43 states or something .
I mean , I 've seen more of America than most Americans have .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
On a plot of soil , nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta , Georgia , a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self - empowerment .
Urban farming is a way for African - Americans to connect with the earth , says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA .
HABESHA
Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country .
Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville .
But the garden serves an even greater purpose .
The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood .
" It 's a reawakening going on .
It 's almost like it's a renaissance , " says Cashawn Myers , director of HABESHA Inc .
" There 's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa .
Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward .
Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement , we were brought here to cultivate the land because that 's something we did on the continent .
So really , that 's what many of the people are doing now , " he said .
Myers believes urban farming is a way for many African - Americans to reconnect with their past .
iReport.com : Show us your urban farm
" They are going through a process of Sankofa and going to what they traditionally did , which is connect to the Earth so they can move forward and grow , " he says .
But HABESHA
Gardens is n't unique .
Former pro basketball player Will Allen , who is considered to be one of the nation 's leading urban farmers and founder of Growing Power Inc. , estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of urban gardens in inner cities across America .
Urban farms help feed people , sustain neighorhoods »
" It 's beyond a movement at this point .
Its more like a revolution , " says Allen .
' Black in America 2 '
In July , Soledad O'Brien investigates what African - Americans are doing to confront the most challenging issues facing their communities .
You 'll meet people who are using groundbreaking solutions in innovative ways to transform the black experience .
Wednesday , 9 p.m. & Thursday , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Both Allen and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African - Americans is born out of necessity and not just echoing traditions .
" Minority people are affected by poor food , more than any other groups , " and many inner cities lack access to quality fruits and vegetables , Allen says .
" Our food system is broken . "
" When you 're poor , when you do n't have access to resources , you have to create your own , " says Myers .
" So this is a way for people of African descent to use their creativity to grow their own food . "
Many poorer communities do n't have full - scale grocery stores .
Allen charges that companies have red - lined those areas and wo n't build stores there .
So community activists like Myers have taken up the fight .
" [ Starting ] community gardens in local communities , specifically in urban areas , is important , so you create your own food security network , " says Myers .
" You 're not relying on large grocery stores to provide food for everyone because if those grocery stores have problems , your access to food is done . "
HABESHA
Gardens makes the fresh food accessible to people in Mechanicsville by opening up the garden to people in the community every Sunday from noon to 4 p.m .
" We invite people from the local community here , the immediate community but also from the greater Atlanta community ... to come out , work in the garden ; learn , reconnect with the Earth and also be able to take food home with them after the harvest . "
In addition to providing food for those that work in garden , HABESHA partners with organizations such as the Atlanta Community Food Bank and the MLK Senior Center to provide food from the garden to the hungry and elders in the community .
HABESHA is more than just an urban garden .
HABESHA , an acronym for Helping Africa By Establishing Schools at Home and Abroad .
The organization mentors young African - Americans by sending them on a yearly trip to Ghana and educates the youth in Mechanicsville through the garden 's after - school program called Sustainable Seeds .
" Not only are we teaching them about agriculture , [ we 're ] teaching them about solar technology , rainwater catching , " Myers says .
" A majority of the food that was planted here was done by the youth in the after - school program .
They helped to build the shed , they helped to build the greenhouse , they helped to build the shade nursery ...
They are very much a vital part of the process that goes on here . "
Malik Parks , 12 , is a member of HABESHA 's mentoring program .
" Well , it feeds us .
That 's a big thing -- to know that we 're helping the earth .
Us planting it , that gives us exercise ; then also , eating it gives us nutrients , " says Parks .
Sporting a " Black to Our Roots " T - shirt , Parks is already well aware of the higher purpose he and HABESHA have with their garden .
" I believe to some , its hope .
I know there are a lot of people over here that live in poverty .
I know you can come and pick food , so that 's food for them , " Parks says .
" So it 's hope to stay alive longer and be energized and do what you have to do to get back on your feet . "
Myers , who is his mentor , agrees .
" We encourage the people in the community to come , be a part of the process of growing the food , so it 's more empowerment than it is giving as charity , " says Myers .
And with urban farms like Will Allen 's becoming half - million dollar enterprises in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , Chicago , Illinois , and many other farms in New York City and Detroit , Michigan , urban gardening is spreading like the roots of the vegetables they grow .
" This has become a multicultural , multigenerational movement , a revolution , " says Allen .
" This is n't just the hippies and tree huggers .
Everyone is getting on board .
It 's really exciting . "
All About African - American Issues
Being as they obviously can’t afford to serve their own Internet files , both Rush Limbaugh and Fox News have been hotlinking the now - infamous Department of Homeland Security report this site recently released .
Since the report was published , we ’ve experienced a tremendous burst of traffic , and been working overtime ( special kudos to Brad ) merely to keep this site operational .
Hotlinking is a no -no in the Internet community .
If you are new to the Internet , here ’s a good explanation as to why it ’s so frowned upon .
It would be difficult to characterize Limbaugh or Fox as being an Internet newbies , however .
We ’d take to take time to offer a special thank you to Michelle Malkin for going out of her way to serve a copy of the report on her own site .
I first learned that Rush had hotlinked us last night .
The “ talent on loan from God ” webteam still does n’t seem to be aware of what their readers see when clicking on the link .
Here ’s what people coming from hotlinked sources will find .
In the meantime , if you came here to read the report , here ’s a copy of the .pdf file .
D in Sunderland , Mass .
received a piece of her previous manager ’s mail several months after he was fired .
“ I felt it was only right to contact him about a membership directory for an organization with which he was heavily involved , ” she says .
“ I was genuinely shocked to receive his reply , especially considering how careful he was to never put anything in print that could possibly damage his reputation as ‘ an internationally published poet . ’”
Hi [ redacted ] , Your NEIBA Membership directory arrived at the store today .
( I got your email from the listing . )
Would you like to come pick it up , or should I recycle it .
John says you are working on a play .
I hope it comes out well .
Please let me know if it is performed in the area – I would like to see it .
Have a great day !
Please recycle the directory .
A copy of the directory was mailed to me at my home address .
Also , please do not contact me again .
You are certainly not my friend , my colleague , or even an old acquaintance .
Thank you for refraining from making any further contact with me .

Millions of very hungry ladybirds are poised to create ecological havoc for hundreds of Britain 's native species , scientists warn today .
Experts said the anticipated warm summer would provide the perfect conditions for the Asian harlequin ladybird to breed and prepare for a springtime assault .
" They are creating a huge genetic stock ready for next year , " said Helen Roy , a scientist with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology .
The insect , a voracious predator , has spread across the UK since its arrival from continental Europe in 2004 .
The bugs have been spotted as far north as Orkney , though they remain strongest in south - east England , where they have overrun many of London 's parks .
" We believe that the negative impacts of the harlequin on Britain will be far - reaching and disruptive , with the potential to affect over a thousand of our native species , " she said .
" It 's a big and voracious predator , it will eat lots of different insects , soft fruit and all kinds of things . "
Unlike British ladybirds , such as the most common seven - spot , the harlequin does not need a cold winter for adults to reach sexual maturity , and so be able to breed .
" That gives them a massive advantage , " Roy said .
The ladybird , originally from Asia , was introduced to Holland and other European countries to control aphids on crops .
From there , it crossed the English Channel on the wind , or hidden on fruit and flowers .
A public survey launched in 2005 has tracked its progress using some 30,000 online records .
Roy said the results revealed a " staggering expansion " .
Scientists fear the harlequins will push out natural rivals through competition for food .
They can munch through more than 12,000 aphids a year , as well as feed on other species such as lacewing larvae .
The harlequin has even been recorded eating the large caterpillar of a brimstone butterfly .
Scientists from five organisations will present the latest findings on the spread of the harlequin this week at the Royal Society summer exhibition , and warn its arrival will mean " one winner , 1,000 losers " .
Scientists are exploring whether harlequin numbers could be controlled using their few native enemies , such as fungal disease , male - killing bacteria and parasitic wasps and flies .
One idea is to encourage the transmission of a sexually transmitted mite that makes some ladybirds infertile .
The researchers said people should not take matters into their own hands .
Vigilante action against the harlequin invaders would make no difference to the overall population and could inadvertently kill similar - looking native species .
“ When it comes to screenwriting , it ’s the writing .
You do n’t hear people who want to play professional tennis ask to be introduced to the head of Wimbledon .
No , they ’re out there hitting a thousand forehands and a thousand backhands .
But for some reason , in the case of screenwriting , people do n’t think that way .
The format makes it appear deceptively easy .
If they can type something up in the format that has a beginning , middle , and end , and has some dialogue in between , they think they ’ve written a screenplay .
But if you ’re a writer with an original voice , and with those other four qualities I just mentioned , somehow , some way , the world is going to find you . ”

Perpetual Storytelling Apparatus 2009
Julius von Bismarck , Benjamin Maus
Drawing machine illustrating a never - ending story by the use of patent drawings .
The “ Perpetual Storytelling Apparatus ” is a drawing machine illustrating a never - ending story by the use of patent drawings .
The machine translates words of a text ( e.g. a novel ) into a stream of patent drawings .
Eight million patents – linked by over 22 million references – form the vocabulary .
By using references to earlier patents , it is possible to find paths between the patents that have been found for word - combinations in the story .
Those connections form a subtext .
New visual connections and narrative layers emerge through the interweaving of the story with the depiction of technical developments .
References to the orginal patent document
Principle
The apparatus takes a combination of words in the story and searches for a patent document , whose text contains those words .
Then it extracts the main drawing from the patent document and draws it .
Advancing in the story , it finds the next patent document .
Between the found patent and the previously drawn patent , the patents that connect the two are drawn in between .
This process repeats and ingests one story after another , and generates an endless stream of patent drawings .
The first two instances of the “ Perpetual Storytelling Apparatus ” are using the database of the US Patent and Trademark Office .
The third apparatus , which has recently been installed at the German Patent Office in Munich , uses the whole backlog of patents applied for in Germany .
One Third of All Late Term Abortion Doctors Killed Today
Dr. Tiller , whose Wichita clinic performed late term abortions , was shot dead in front of his church today .
A lot of the focus is going to be on right wing terrorism , and the culture of hate created by folks who call abortion murder , setting up the justification for these sorts of murders .
Tiller was one of only three doctors in the US who performed these sorts of abortions .
That ’s not because they ’re illegal , it ’s because the level of physical and legal harassment they and their staffs face is horrific , and it never , ever ends .
It takes a very brave man or woman , and one who has decided to dedicate their life to the cause , to put up with constant threats , vandalism , legal harassment and the very real possibility of being murdered .
Tiller was incredibly brave and dedicated to do what he did .
It ’s highly unlikely that anyone will step up to replace him .
A theoretical right which cannot be practically accessed is not really a right .
The right to abortion , both late and early term , has been under constant assault for decades .
Unless other doctors step up , and start providing for that right ( and even early term abortions are hard to get in many States ) then what happened today is , in fact , a tragic loss for the right for women to be able to have abortions when they need .
In the meantime , I mourn Dr. Tiller .
People as brave and dedicated as he was are so rare , that , well , there were only three of them in the entire United States .
A lot of women will suffer , and yes , die , because he was murdered today .
Rest in peace Doctor Tiller .
Hopefully someone will pick up the torch which fell from your hand today .
S&P said the changes reflected its assessment that volatility will remain in the financial sector and the industry is expected to face tighter regulatory oversight .
S&P also said loan losses , which have plagued the industry for more than a year , are likely to continue to increase and could grow beyond expectations .
BB&T , Capital One Financial , Regions Financial and Wells Fargo were among the largest banks that saw their ratings cut by S&P .
Widescale changes to the industry because of the credit crisis and ongoing recession will dramatically alter the banking landscape , S&P credit analyst Rodrigo Quintanilla said in a release .
" We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions , " Quintanilla said .
" Financial institutions are now shedding balance - sheet risk and altering funding profiles and strategies for the marketplace 's new reality .
Such a transition period justifies lower ratings as industry players implement changes . "
S&P did note that recent capital raising efforts in the sector will help defray some of the losses banks are facing .
It is 1917 , and lunatic General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett is leading the British troops at the front lines against the Germans , while everyone waits for Field Marshall Haig 's big push .
There are various emotions throughout the camp about it .
For Captain Kevin Darling , Melchett 's bull - dog - like right - hand man , it makes no difference , as it appears he will be safe and sound with the general when the big push occurs .
For Lieutenant George Colhurst Saint Barleigh , he is overly excited at thrashing the Germans .
For Private S. ( probably for Sod- Off ) Baldrick , it 's a terrifying experience he is not looking forward to .
For Captain Edmund Blackadder , however , it 's something he 's too cowardly too face .
Self - centered , arrogant , and sarcastic , Blackadder is always constantly searching for a way out of this silly war , and will try various , often crazy , variations on escape , all of which will take a turn he never expected .

We could n't believe it either , but as it turns out , from the launcher screen of your Pre , simply type in the phrase " upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbastart " -- which if you parse with spacing might be more easily recognizable as the infamous Contra / Konami code ( look it up ) -- and up comes a hidden app called " Developer Mode Enabler .

Air Force Research Laboratory
As hitmen go , robots are clumsy killers .
The proof is in Pakistan , where local authorities claim that drone strikes on Al Qaeda and affiliate targets have killed at least 687 civilians .
Whether or not that figure is inflated , the real or imagined death toll continues to fuel anti-American sentiment around the world .
And that 's to say nothing of the anti-administration fervor inside Washington circles as to whether President Obama and newly promoted general Stanley McChrystal , in continuing Bush - era policies with Bush - era technologies ( even if they 're offering Pakistan surveillance data ) , should continue air strikes near the Afghan border at all .
Now , the Air Force is planning to build a more selective breed of military drones , with swarms of bird - size bots shadowing targets and new unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) capable of launching mini-missiles at multiple targets at once .
The mechanized assassin , it seems , is about to become a lot more professional .
Details of this new UAV development are limited — the Air Force Research Laboratory released a 87 - page briefing last month , sketching out individual plans for a number of drone - related systems .
The briefing , first obtained by Air Force Times but reviewed this morning for Esquire.com , offers the first detailed glimpse at an American military strategy that has adapted to conflicts in Pakistan and Afghanistan and " incorporates a vision and strategy ... that focus on delivery of warfighting capability " with new robots .
Perhaps the most significant concept in the briefing is a UAV called Suburb Warrior , which would carry a new kind of smaller , precision - guided missile .
Another project , called Sniper , is a targeting system that can lock on to multiple targets , allowing a single drone pilot to coordinate the attacks of a squadron of robots — or a single UAV to hit a group of enemies .
Picking through the dozens of systems in this briefing , many of which will be flight - tested within five years , there 's a clear set of goals : build smaller , even microscopic drones with smaller weapons that can hunt in swarms and engage targets in the close quarters of urban battlefields .
And hunt as soon as possible .
To understand the significance of this new plan — how it could affect U.S. diplomacy in the region , reduce potential troop counts there , and , you know , better hunt Al Qaeda — one need only look at the current state of unmanned assassination .
The least powerful weapons deployed by Predators — and their new big brother , the Reaper — are Hellfire missiles .
These antitank weapons have incredibly literal names ; they 're designed to penetrate armored vehicles with a jet of molten metal .
So if a U.S. target were sitting in a pickup truck , or even a second - floor window , a Hellfire is more than overkill .
It 's a collateral damage factory , turning a city street into hell on earth , and potentially flattening buildings .
To paraphrase the NRA , robots do n't kill civilians ; missiles do .
Theoretically , the smaller missiles launched by Suburb Warrior would wreak less havoc in crowded battlefields .
In asking for proposals for a " Miniature Weapon Demonstration , " the Air Force described the new weapon as an " air - launched , precision miniature munition capability , " which would provide a " mobile target kill capability against a broad set of targets in a suburban environment . "
In the new briefing , the system is described as " for application in a dense , all environment urban battlespace . "
That 's Pentagon speak for Obama - approved missiles that are ready for anything short of Mogadishu , that cover the Pentagon 's ass in smaller cities while they 're at it .
Notional drawings of Suburb Warrior show the drone loaded with four or more mini-missiles — far fewer munitions than a Reaper carries — but make clear that it 's much smaller than even the Predator .
The Sniper multiple - targeting system ( that Goodyear - blimp - meets - Star - Wars - X - wing craft pictured above ) is n't tied to a specific UAV , but it could be a perfect fit for delivering the Suburb Warrior .
Instead of dropping Hellfires or a 500 - pound bomb on an insurgent hideout , one or more Suburb Warriors could fire a volley of mini-missiles at confirmed targets , without vaporizing the wedding reception next door .
The drone is slated for flight tests by 2014 , and Sniper is scheduled to begin tests in cruise missiles and UAVs within two years .
The Air Force is reviewing white papers for miniature munitions now , and a contract could be awarded as early as September .
The problem , of course , is that even if the robotic upgrade continues on this fast track , five years is an eternity for America 's diplomatic arm to wait for its military one .
Who knows if Hillary Clinton will still have her job by then ?
If she does , what if the new robots still are n't precise enough ?
So if a squadron of low - flying drones and their micro-munitions do n't provide a clean kill in those packed communities , the Air Force Research Laboratory has a more point - blank Plan B : tiny , biologically - inspired micro air vehicles ( MAVs ) that can flap through alleys and inside buildings .
Like most UAVs , these robots would most likely be used for surveillance and reconnaissance .
But in an animated clip released by the Air Force late last year , a MAV lands on an enemy sniper , and , without so much as a prayer to its machine god , detonates itself .
The new Air Force briefing does n't elaborate on this miniature suicide - bomber concept , but it does include plans to have flocks of sparrow - size MAVs airborne by 2015 , and even smaller , dragonfly - size robots by 2030 .
And with the recent news that Israel is developing an explosives - laden snakebot , the writing is on the wall :
You can run from tomorrow 's robotic hitmen , and you can hide , and they 'll flap or squirm or glide into position and kill you anyway .

There may finally be some good news when it comes to colony collapse disorder .
Starting a few years ago , apiarists began noticing that honey bee colonies were dying off in record numbers .
A whole host of suggestions were put forward as to why — some reports even attempted to link cell phone usage with the loss of honey bees .
Oddball suggestions aside , detailed studies into the DNA and health of the bees found that fungal invaders or viruses were potential causes of the large - scale collapses .
A new study published in the journal Environmental Microbiology Reports may clarify things , as a team of Spanish researchers report the cause of the colony collapse disorder , and also suggest a cure .
The researchers isolated the parasitic fungi Nosema ceranae from a pair of Spanish apiaries , while finding none of the other proposed causes — Varroa destructor , IAPV , or pesticides .
With the identification of the invading pathogen , the team treated other diseased colonies with fumagillin — an antibiotic — and observed a complete recovery of the colony .
Honeybees play a key role in horticulture as they are significant pollinators of fruit , crops , and wild flowers .
They are indispensable to many sustainable agriculture farms , so keeping them healthy is of great concern .
While they are important , other research has suggested using wild bees — those that are solitary cavity - or soil - nesting insects — as opposed to large colonies of honey bees , can result in successful pollination as well .
While honey bees are presumably under constant attack from a variety of pathogens , many of these parasites have unknown or , at best , poorly understood molecular features .
" Now that we know one strain of parasite that could be responsible , we can look for signs of infection and treat any infected colonies before the infection spreads , " said Dr Higes , principle researcher on the project .
While this may not be a global solution to the colony collapse disorder , if it can save a few hives , it will be cause for celebration in the apiarist community .

PRETORIA , South Africa  FIFA removed television sets from sidelines for the remainder of the Confederations Cup to ensure there is no repeat of the controversy surrounding Brazil 's winning goal against Egypt .
Egypt protested referee Howard Webb 's decision to give a last - minute penalty kick to Brazil after appearing to consult with a match official who had watched a replay .
Kaka converted the penalty kick for a 4 - 3 victory Monday .
" To make sure there is no more doubt about the television set , about the match officials at the line , as from yesterday on there is no more television sets there , " FIFA president Sepp Blatter said .
" It is away .
It is finished , so nobody can say there is interference of videos . "
Blatter said the events in Bloemfontein confirmed his opinion that replay technology was not suitable for soccer .
" I am still of the opinion that we should not use video for decisions in the field of play , " Blatter said .
" And this principle is not my principle : it has been confirmed and reconfirmed by the International Football Association Board , the guardians and custodians of the laws of the game . "
Blatter also expressed his confidence that South Africa can provide the transport necessary for the 450,000 fans expected at next year 's World Cup .
He was 15 minutes late for his pre-match meeting with the media on Thursday after getting stuck in traffic .
" The traffic problem we have is because they are preparing the roads and so they have to try to take all the traffic on one lane , " Blatter said .
" I am sure these problems will be and must be solved for the World Cup .
There will be a lot more traffic than there is now .
We knew from the very beginning there will be logistic problems .
That 's why we also have this rehearsal . "

A FOREIGN or indigenous - sounding name gives people less chance of landing a job in Australia , a study has found .
Unless your name sounds Italian and you 're in Melbourne , in which case it can be an advantage .
Australian National University researchers Alison Booth , Andrew Leigh and Elena Vargonova sent out 4000 fake job applications to employers advertising on the internet for entry - level hospitality , data entry , customer service and sales jobs , changing only the racial origin of the supposed applicants ' names .
Applicants with Chinese names fared the worst , having only a one - in - five chance of getting asked in for interviews , compared to applicants with Anglo - Saxon names whose chances exceeded one - in - three .
Typically a Chinese - named applicant would need to put in 68 per cent more applications than an Anglo - named applicant to get the same number of calls back .
A Middle Eastern - named applicant needed 64 per cent more , an indigenous - named applicant 35 per cent more and an Italian - named applicant 12 per cent more .
What is left of the past in our cities ?
–
Of course there are exceptions , but many old monuments in our cities deal with human religious or metaphysical needs .
Many towns and villages have their holy places in the center , be it temples , shrines , churches , mosques , or stupas .
Of course , there are the really special cases , such as the Pyramids or Macchu Picchu .
The list is endless .
These buildings remind us of what was important at the time they were built .
What do we build today in our city centers ?
Take a moment to think about the latest building projects in your community .
What are the central monuments of our time ?
Secular times have given rise to secular monuments .
The last years before the financial crisis hanba followed the rise of malls all over the Western world with reservation .
The malls seem to be the modern monuments .
They have been given the best real - estate in the middle of our cities .
Our cities !
The centers of our cities have great cultural importance .
The buildings we erect in the middle of our cities have a great impact our daily practical lives , our social lives , our cultural , spiritual and metaphysical needs .
The malls are where many of us congregate in busy days , both weekdays and weekends .
To escape the elements , the citizens take cover under air - conditioned walkway plazas , perhaps indulging in a refreshing smoothie .
When in need of reassurance , a modern citizen may buy a new sweater .
A great example is Hiroyuki Miyake ’s ice cream parlour in Tokyo .
Here , the ice cream experience has been upgraded into something solemn , meditative .
Do not get me wrong , while I do not condemn consumerism as such , I oppose placing the shopping experience to a pedestal – upgrading commercial transactions into sacraments .
Having said that , however , I do not think we should build any more mastodont cathedrals either .
What to build then ?
All the suffering aside , the financial crisis may make us think more about this very question .
The mall era , I believe , has come to an end ( hanba is not the only one to have this view . )
I do n’t know what kind of places we revere after the crisis .
I do n’t know how our future holy places will look like , but I think it will be something different .
- What do you think ?
Ps 1 .
Writing this , I am reminded of a recent review of a new Westfield mall in London , England by William Wiles IconEye
19/12/2008
“ Maybe Westfield will prosper , draining money and life out of the surrounding boroughs .
It could be the shape of things to come , an air - con , CCTV - covered future where we swan about amassing Nectar points on our ID cards .
Or , alternatively , it could be a dinosaur with the poor luck to be born after the asteroid strike .
Westfield ’s timing , of course , could not have been worse , with the UK already in recession and joblessness soaring .
We ’re not likely to see another debt - driven retail boom like the one that birthed this beast any time soon ”
Ps2 .
Check out the next hanba post , tropicalizing a city , where a vision for post - mall urbanism is discussed .
Could Mexican cities become Latin Amsterdams , flooded by drug users seeking penalty - free tokes and toots ?
That is the fear , if somewhat overstated , of some Mexican officials , especially in northern border states that serve as a mecca for underage drinkers from the United States .
The anxiety stems from the Mexican legislature ’s quiet vote to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana , cocaine , methamphetamine and other drugs , an effort that in the past proved controversial .
There ’s been less protest this time , in part because there has n’t been much publicity .
Some critics have suggested that easing the punishment for drug possession sends the wrong message while President Felipe Calderon is waging a bloody war against major narcotics traffickers .
The battle between law enforcement authorities and drug suspects has claimed more than 11,000 lives since he took office in late 2006 .
But it was Calderon who proposed the decriminalization legislation .
His reasoning :
It makes sense to distinguish between small - time users and big - time dealers , while re-targeting major crime - fighting resources away from the consumers and toward the dealers and their drug lord bosses .
“ The important thing is . . . that consumers are not treated as criminals , ” said Rafael Ruiz Mena , secretary general of the National Institute of Penal Sciences .
“ It is a public health problem , not a penal problem . ”
The legislation was approved at the height of a swine flu outbreak that dominated the public ’s , and the world ’s , attention .
Meeting at times behind closed doors , the lower and upper houses of Congress passed the bill in the last days of April .
It now awaits Calderon ’s signature .
The bill says users caught with small amounts -- 5 grams of marijuana , 500 milligrams of cocaine -- clearly intended for “ personal and immediate use ” will not be criminally prosecuted .
They will be told of available clinics , and encouraged to enter a rehabilitation program .
Up to 40 milligrams of methamphetamine , a synthetic and especially harmful drug , is permitted under the legislation , as is up to 50 milligrams of heroin .
In May 2006 , then - President Vicente Fox , of the same right - wing party as Calderon , vetoed a similar bill that he initially had supported .
He backed down only under pressure from the Bush administration , which complained that decriminalization for even small amounts could increase use .
But with about two weeks to go before crucial mid-term elections in which his party is struggling to maintain control of Congress , Calderon cannot afford to be seen as bowing to the United States , analysts say .
Already under intense criticism for the drug - related violence , Calderon needs to maintain good relations with his nation ’s Congress , where much of the opposition voted in favor of the decriminalization bill .
And so , political observers say , he probably will sign it into law .
Calderon ’s office declined to comment for this article .
So far , the U.S. government has not publicly objected to the legislation .
Michele Leonhart , acting director of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , however , said in April that legalization “ would be a failed law enforcement strategy for both the U.S. and Mexico . ”
Mexican officials emphasize that they are not talking about legalization , but decriminalization .
Courts now decide on a case - by - case basis whether and how to punish first - time drug-use offenders .
There has been no standard criteria .
Calderon originally wanted the bill to allow users caught with amounts within the limits to avoid jail time only if they agreed to rehabilitation .
But the bill was changed to say only that treatment would be encouraged .
Then Calderon sought a provision in which a third - time offender would be obliged to seek treatment .
That measure was removed , Ruiz Mena said , after debate over whether mandatory rehabilitation is ever effective .
Mexico is woefully under - equipped to handle a rising drug - abuse problem .
For decades the country was a transit point for cocaine , marijuana and other drugs headed to the U.S.
But recently , domestic consumption has risen .
A 2007 study by the government found the number of addicts in Mexico to have doubled in the previous five years .
Drug abuse has grown worse in part because some of the cartels pay their people with cocaine or other drugs .
Clinics and other institutions that specialize in treatment and prevention have not kept up with the trend .
The government is building 310 centers to improve care , but experts say that is not enough .
The decriminalization legislation has been criticized by religious leaders and several officials in the northern border states , who fear that “ drug tourists ” will begin flocking to towns and cities already besieged by violence .
“ Allowing the carrying of certain amounts of drugs will create more consumers , ” Oscar Villalobos Chavez , social development secretary for Chihuahua state , which borders Texas , told local reporters .
An editorial in the official magazine of the Roman Catholic Church criticized legislators for relaxing the law “ when faced with the highly contagious and lethal sickness that drug addiction represents . ”
Mary Ellen Hernandez , director of the Rio Grande Safe Communities Coalition in El Paso , across the border from blood - soaked Ciudad Juarez , said she worried that decriminalization would lure Americans into a drug world they are n’t prepared for and increase violence on both sides of the border .
“ Already , the drugs that do n’t come over into the U.S. are being handed out by dealers to younger and younger children [ in Mexico ] , 8 , 9 , 10 - year - olds , hooking them , ” said Hernandez , whose agency specializes in drug prevention .
“ And then [ the youths ] steal to feed the habit . ”
The legislation “ is very disturbing and I think it will make things worse , ” she said .
Except for the relatively few voices , however , there has been minimal protest over the law , and some praise .
Luciano Pascoe , vice president of the small left - wing Social Democratic Party , said the law was a positive “ first step ” that helped “ shatter the stigma that consumers are criminals . ”
His party is running in next month ’s elections on a platform that includes legalization of all drugs as a way to make trafficking less lucrative .
It is not known whether that position has anything to do with four of his candidates being attacked in recent weeks .
None was seriously injured .

Obama directly addresses the Iranian government for the first time after a day of violence in Iran :
The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching .
We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost .
We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people .
The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected , and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights .
As I said in Cairo , suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away .
The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government .
If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community , it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent , not coercion .
Martin Luther King once said - “ The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . ” I believe that .
The international community believes that .
And right now , we are bearing witness to the Iranian peoples ’ belief in that truth , and we will continue to bear witness .
Times are hard , money is tight , interest in the Armed Forces is down and we have wars raging on foreign lands across the world .
So , if you are the US Air Force and you want to pack your squadrons with young eager mavericks , what should you do ?
Why , build two awesome supercars that shock and awe the visual senses , of course !
The Mustang X - 1 and Challenger Vapor were both constructed as part of the Air Force ’s Project Supercar initiative to drive interest in signing - up and joining the ranks .
After just returning from the DUB Show in Detroit and seeing all of the crazy modifications that people have performed at their own expense , I must say that the US Government has jumped head first into the custom car game .
With all of the tax payer dollars being thrown around to anyone with their hand out , why not build some badass rides .
In fact , let ’s get the Army , Navy and Marines involved and have an Armed Forces custom car show traveling around the country with tank drifting and humvee off - roading .
Truly , I jest , but I have to give the Air Force credit for these two initiatives , executed by Galpin Auto Sports .
Who else but the guys from GAS could create rides as far out as these two radical pony cars , which both feature airplane - like modifications and Lambo doors .
The all white Mustang X - 1 is laid out with a full jet cockpit complete with an actual flight control stick used to shift .
This may prove a bit tricky with a nitrogen - fed V8 engine capable of over 500 hp at your command .
Behind the seat is a custom A/C unit that get O2 via two NACA ducts located in the rear window slots .
The car has a custom wide - body kit that pushes out all four corners .
The rear track was widened a full foot to make room for a staggered wheel set that accomodates the fatest tires on the market .
The interior is constructed with off - white metal sheeting throughout .
No Alcantera uphostery in this bad boy .
The Dodge Challenger Vapor takes a different approach and features an all black matte finish designed to create a stealth bomber affect .
Everything is black except for the headlights and tail lamps .
Even the wheels are completely covered .
Inside , there is an infrared thermal imaging system paired with a heads - up display running the length of the windshield .
This car also features a jet cockpit with three large LCD screens and switches to run with just two mufflers in whisper quiet mode .

" Not to drink too much of the Kool - Aid , " said Josh Quittner in Time , " but the question has to be asked : Can anything stop Apple 's iPhone ? "
Apple has slashed the price of last year 's 3G model to $ 99 , and introduced the new iPhone 3G S , which can edit video and do other things other smart phones — including latest iPhone challenger , Palm 's Pre — can only dream of .
" Apple 's competition is that speck you now see in the rearview mirror . "
It 's possible to live without an iPhone , said Farhad Manjoo in Slate .
The 3G S is essentially the same as the old 3G , only faster .
Palm 's
Pre and other competitors — including the many phones based on Google 's Android OS , due out later this year — are worthy challengers .
But one thing gives Apple what might be an insurmountable edge — the more than 50,000 applications in the iPhone apps store , which puts Google 's 5,000 apps and Palm 's " comically small " list of 18 apps to shame .
Pre 's features nevertheless match up well against the iPhone 's , said Daniel Ionescu in PC World .
Both have 3 - megapixel cameras , for example .
Yes , the 3G S ' video capabilities are a plus , and with Apple 's price cuts you get more memory for your dollar with the iPhone .
But " AT&T did not reduce its iPhone tariffs , so the Pre on Sprint still offers more for the buck when it comes to data , voice , and text plans . "
Yes , Fox News the station that loves to talk about Democrats dirty laundry when caught , has been caught giving John Ensign heads up about a letter his former staffer sent to Megyn Kelly @ Fox News .
The letter was written by Doug Hampton , the husband of Cynthia L. Hampton , Senator John Ensign 's former lover .
Both Doug and Cynthia Hampton were employed by Ensign .
From Daily Kos :
A week before John Ensign 's admission that he'd carried on an affair with a former political aide , her husband wrote a letter to Fox anchor Megyn Kelly detailing the affair and appealing to Kelly and Fox for help .
The husband , Doug Hampton , told Kelly that Ensign 's actions had ruined his family .
" I am hoping you and Fox News can help , " he wrote .
Full Text of Hampton 's letter to Fox here .
Fox News passed up allegations that Sen. John Ensign had an extramarital affair with his former campaign treasurer , even after receiving a letter from the woman 's husband detailing the relationship .
After the Nevada Republican acknowledged the affair Tuesday , a Fox producer failed to tell his bosses that he had the letter from Douglas D. Hampton , also a former top aide to the senator , and Fox never reported it .
The Las Vegas Sun disclosed the letter 's contents today .
" Sometimes a ball gets by , " said Tom Lowell , senior producer of Fox 's " American Newsroom . "
" This one got by . "
It was , he said , " my mistake . "
Hampton had written to the program 's co-anchor , Megyn Kelly , saying he was not giving the information to any other news outlet .
Lowell said his primary concern was protecting Kelly , who " has any number of people who have stalked her . "
Hampton 's wife , Cynthia L. Hampton , has confirmed the affair through her attorney , but key questions about the couple 's compensation from Ensign 's office and campaign and other details remain unanswered .
Ensign apologized for his conduct and relinquished his Senate GOP leadership post , and his office had no comment today .
Fox says it never received the letter that Douglas Hampton says he mailed to Kelly , but it was later attached to an e-mail that the network received at 12:21 p.m. Monday .

" Interns for embattled Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) are apparently jumping ship in the wake of his acknowledgment that he had an affair with a former staffer .
In an e-mail sent to intern coordinators in Senate offices on Thursday afternoon , Ensign ’s coordinator Jessica Walton said she is looking to place an unspecified number of the Nevada Republican ’s interns in other offices . "
Fox News deliberately withheld this information , but did give Ensign a heads up so he could come clean .
Also , remember Ensign insinuated that he was being ?
He has totally walked that back .
From the Washington Post : To add insult to injury , This is opening up to be more than just an affair , but having both Hamptons on the payroll is bringing heavy questioning about federal dollars being spent on Ensign 's dalliance .
Sigh .
Lastly , Fox had no credibility .
They purposely not only leaked to Ensign , but was the last news organization to report this .
If this is not bias , what else is it .
No wonder the Obama Adminstration has little to do with Fox News .
To call themselves fair and balanced is a JOKE .
Marijuana and cocaine for personal use should be decriminalised because the " war on drugs " has been a disaster , according to some of Latin America 's most powerful politicians and writers .
The current international policy on drugs encourages corruption and violence that is threatening democracy throughout the continent , according to the former president of Brazil , Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who is a co-president of the Latin American commission on drugs and democracy .
As well as politicians , the commission includes the writers Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru , and Paulo Coelho of Brazil .
The election of Barack Obama has opened up the best opportunity for decades to address the failure of the " so - called drugs war " , Cardoso told the Guardian today on a visit to London .
He said he was hopeful that the international community would acknowledge that the time had come for a " paradigm shift " in the debate on drugs .
" The war on drugs has failed in spite of enormous efforts in places like Colombia – the area of coca crops is not reducing , " he said .
The current system of prohibition encouraged corruption among police officers , politicians and even judges .
" It poisons the whole system , it undermines democracy , " Cardoso said .
" The war on drugs is based on repression … How can people believe in democracy if the rule of law does n't work ? "
Users should be offered treatment rather than jail , he said .
" The starting point has to be the United States , " he said .
" Now we have a new American administration , which is much more open - minded than before . "
He said he had held talks with the US state department in the later years of the Bush administration and found that , privately , many of the officials there shared his views .
Cardoso said that the changes would have to be co-ordinated .
" We need an international convention , otherwise you will have different countries doing different things , " he said .
" But the climate is changing for the first time for many years .
Even in the US , they recognise we are in deadlock now . "
Obama had already made it clear that the idea of a " war on drugs " was not workable .
The need for change is urgent , said Cardoso , because of what is happening in Latin America .
" There is a very grave situation in Mexico , " he said .
" More people are being killed there ( through the drugs war ) than in Iraq . "
He said that it was easier for former presidents who were no longer in office or running for election to speak out on such a controversial issue .
He added that ending the war on drugs would be not be a signal that drugs were acceptable but a recognition that current policies had failed .
" You have to show that drugs are harmful , even light drugs , like marijuana - it is better not to use drugs - but tobacco is harmful also yet its use is being reduced by education , " said Cardoso .
He added that the vast quantities of money being used to enforce " repressive " policies on drugs could be put into treatment and education .
Hundreds of thousands of people were being unnecessarily criminalised and sent to prison , " which are schools of crime . "
The previous UN drugs policy that aimed to eliminate all drug use by this year was ill - conceived , he said .
" You can never stop drugs use , " he said , likening it to some of the failed policies in the past over HIV / Aids .
" You can't have zero drugs any more than you can have a zero sex policy but you can have a safe sex policy . "
He said that Brazil 's success in halting the HIV / Aids epidemic , which meant promoting the use of condoms in a Catholic country , was an example of how people 's behaviour could be changed by education rather than repression .

FREETOWN ( Reuters ) - Power hoses and AK - 47 assault rifles have succeeded where Sierra Leone ’s snake - charmers failed by removing 400 cobras and vipers that overran a police station .
Authorities in the southern district of Bo called in police , army and fire fighters after the snakes scared away police officers and residents reporting crimes .
“ We have forced water into the building and some of the snakes trying to escape were shot by our men carrying AK - 47s , ” said Brima Kontu , head of the police station in Gerihun .
About 250 of the estimated 400 snakes who had made the station their home have been killed .
“ Hopefully the combined force will be able to free the house from the snakes by next Tuesday , ” Kontu told Reuters .
Sierra Leone is slowly recovering from the effects of the 1991 - 2002 civil war and villagers frequently have run-ins with wild animals in areas of the country that were deserted during the years of fighting .

Sixteen gunmen thought to be linked to drug cartels and two soldiers have been killed in clashes in the Mexican resort of Acapulco , officials say .
Several soldiers and bystanders were wounded in the two - hour battle , in an old area of the Pacific coast city .
Tourists were evacuated from several hotels in the neighbourhood .
The battle began on Saturday evening , when troops received a tip - off that the gunmen had occupied a house , an officer in charge of the operation told AP .
The gunmen threw grenades at the soldiers and crashed their car when trying to flee , he added .
Others arrived as reinforcements but were killed in the fighting .
The BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City says the fighting will be another deadly blow for Acapulco , whose tourist industry has recently been badly hit by the swine flu outbreak .
' Rescue '
The officer says troops found four police officers when they entered the house , handcuffed and apparently held hostage .
" We found them like this , handcuffed , and they say they were kidnapped , " he said .
" So , if they were kidnapped , as they say , then we rescued them . "
Troops seized 36 rifles , 13 shotguns , two hand grenades , 13 fragmentation hand grenades , 3,525 cartridges , 180 magazines and eight vehicles in the operation , AFP news agency said .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon launched a military campaign against drug cartels in 2006 .
Tens of thousands of troops have since been deployed throughout the country to tackle drugs - related violence , which has claimed the lives of nearly 9,000 people in the last two years .
Acapulco has in the past been the scene of clashes between rival drug gangs but has been relatively free of violence in recent years , correspondents say .
The Boy Who Became a Pervy Old Man
When I was a boy I used to see these dirty old perverts and I ’d say to myself man that ’s cool , and I wanted to be one of those perverts .
In high school the closest I could get was a wispy perv-stache and AmberVision glasses .
I grew my hair longer and longer waiting for it to fall out .
I would look in the mirror at myself and I could see the beginnings of what I would look like bald with a curtain of stringy , greasy yellowed hair .
One day I looked in the mirror and looking back at me was the pervy old man I always dreamt of becoming .
There I was in all my pervy old glory , my dingy white hair hung past my greasy collar , with dark brown tobacco stained fingers ending in long curved nails , and glistening white beard stubble poked through the crusty flakes and scabs covering my face like one thousand tulips of spring pushing through last autumn ’s wet leaves .
I was magnificent !

There ’s unintentional brilliance buried deep in the heart of the classifieds .
I ’ve said this before , but I ’ll say it again : Enjoy newspapers while you can .
Even though they are on a path to being completely obsolete with the 24 - hour news cycle , you ’re going to miss them when they ’re gone .
One thing you ’re going to miss the most :
The hilarity of the classifieds in small - town newspapers .
Craigslist is never going to replace the unintentional comedy of a good , old - fashioned , paid classified ad .
Like these 11 .
The 11 greatest , most ridiculous , hilarious classified ads I ’ve ever seen .
1 | Do n’t you want at least a little ?
And you really can’t provide the tools ?
2 | Such a bad choice of words
Apparently , it never occurred to this person that maybe this phrasing would NOT help move his potty chair .
3 | Totally not important
Just like I do n’t care about numbers on this website , I ’m just doing it for the love of writing .
( Please join my Facebook fan page ASAP , thanks ! )
4 | Not sure how these things are related
I suppose it is fun to watch someone weed whack while moving their hips in a slight circle , but I ’m not sure if I ’m making that a prereq for my gardener .
5 | It ’s never too late to say you ’re sorry
This guy just wants to ketchup .
HI - YO !
( Professional comedy writer for almost six years now , folks . )
6 | Grandma ?
I just got laid off and need a favor
Remember how you said you hated the home we put you in and wanted to live in a place that ’s more exciting ?
Well this is n’t going to disappoint …
7 | Only done it once
This ad gets better with every sentence , culminating with the last one .
Pack your bo staff and saddle up for what ’s sure to be a wonderful time .
8 | No , this is the “ No HomerS ” club
But you let Homer HendelBergenHeinzel in !
9 | I ’m guessing it ’s the latter
But Peter might ’ve been pretty good too !
10 | Harsh
This is almost as insulting as having to buy two airplane tickets .
11 | 15 minutes of fame
For one day , until these cockblocking broads had to post a correction , George Brownridge was the coolest man in town .

From clouds and snow flakes , to crystals and blood vessels , approximate fractals are easily found in nature .
Coined by french mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 , a “ fractal ” is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts , each of which is ( at least approximately ) a reduced - size copy of the whole , a property called “ self - similarity ” .
In the case of natural fractals , they display self - similar structure over an extended - but finite - scale range .
Meet some of the most beautiful fractals we ’ve found in nature .
Adjective Order
Introduction
In English , it is common to use more than one adjective before a noun — for example , “ He 's a silly young fool , ” or “ She 's a smart energetic woman . ”
When you use more than one adjective , you have to put them in the right order , according to type .
This page will explain the different types of adjectives and the correct order for them .
1 . The basic types of adjectives
Opinion
An opinion adjective explains what you think about something ( other people may not agree with you ) .
For example : silly , beautiful , horrible , difficult Size A size adjective , of course , tells you how big or small something is .
For example : large , tiny , enormous , little Age An age adjective tells you how young or old something or someone is .
For example : ancient , new , young , old Shape A shape adjective describes the shape of something .
For example : square , round , flat , rectangular Colour A colour adjective , of course , describes the colour of something .
For example : blue , pink , reddish , grey Origin An origin adjective describes where something comes from .
For example : French , lunar , American , eastern , Greek Material A material adjective describes what something is made from .
For example : wooden , metal , cotton , paper Purpose A purpose adjective describes what something is used for .
These adjectives often end with “ - ing ” .
For example : sleeping ( as in “ sleeping bag ” ) , roasting ( as in “ roasting tin ” )
2 . Some examples of adjective order
Opinion Size Age Shape Colour Origin Material Purpose a silly young English man a huge round metal bowl a small red sleeping bag
When you are sure that you understand the lesson , you can continue with the exercises .
The Trackmania series of racing games is built around one simple , elegant rule :
Find the absolute fastest way to get from point A to point B .
There are no stats to decipher , car modifications to tweak or even much to master in the way of physics – only the unyielding drive to find the perfect line , flaunting your prowess on a particular track .
Trackmania DS is the latest in the series , and this Nintendo DS portable version mostly nails the charm and addictive nature of its big brothers on PC .
There are plenty of tracks to unlock and master , a functional level editor and even track - based puzzles to solve .
But running in circles alone gets old , and with no online multiplayer mode , your chances of really enjoying Trackmania DS come down to whether you have friends in the same room with you .
( Trackmania DS will be released March 17 . )
There is no competitive racing in Trackmania – at least , not in the traditional sense .
Every level is essentially a time trial , with gold , silver and bronze medals awarded for beating three different target race times .
There are n't any computer opponents to race against , but if you 'd prefer not to cruise along a barren track , you can opt to have " ghost cars " appear alongside you .
These computer - controlled ghosts will always travel the same path , and finish every race at the gold , silver and bronze completion times – they 're designed for tracking your progress as you race toward the finish line .
You can't collide into them or affect their driving , but mimic their maneuvers and you just might improve your own performance .
Falling behind or falling off the track happens rather often , as the game 's camera is positioned directly behind your vehicle , and the road ahead is often obscured .
Tapping the Y button will allow you to quickly restart a race , which is tantamount to offering nicotine addicts a carton of smokes and looking the other way .
Tracks barely three minutes long would take me half an hour to complete , as I kept compulsively restarting to perfect my technique .
The slightest adjustment to your course can dramatically affect your speed , forcing you to discover the most efficient way to complete a track – often through trial and error .
There are three distinct race types : Stadium , Desert and Rally , which will see you driving Formula 1 cars , 4x4s and Minis respectively .
You do n't have to complete races in any particular order ; collecting medals unlocks progressively harder tracks .
Stadium tracks are the bread and butter of the Trackmania series , featuring fiendishly complex circuit tracks with all manners of jumps , loops and hairpin turns .
Desert racing adds pitfalls , perilous inclines and track obstacles to the mix , while Rally races are largely concerned with fighting to gain mastery over the hyperactive Mini , to say nothing of off - road elements and constrictive , serpentine trails .
You can create your own tracks with the game 's built - in editor .
It is surprisingly robust , allowing you to save and trade up to 60 custom levels .
Using the Nintendo DS ' touchscreen , you need only draw the path you 'd like to create , and the game will figure out the general layout of twists and turns for you .
Adding jumps and more complex track features will require a bit of extra wrist work , but correcting any errors or adding extra features is all quite intuitive , once you 've gotten the hang of manipulating the camera .
Trackmania DS also features Platform and Puzzle modes .
Platform mode requires that you travel from one end of a track to the next , dodging various holes and pitfalls .
Hitting the X button will allow you to restart from the nearest checkpoint , which is helpful , as these tracks are usually quite long .
There is no time limit on Platform tracks ; medals are awarded for retrying as little as possible .
Puzzle mode is the oddest of the bunch , as it makes use of the track editor .
Presented with an incomplete race course consisting of a start point , an end point and a few checkpoints , you 're tasked with creating a track that connects them all .
You 'll then be required to race on the track you 've built , with medals awarded for speedy completion times .
Earning medals will also reward you with coppers , Trackmania 's currency .
You can use coppers to purchase more than 100 new tracks , new skins for your cars and new items and objects to use in the game 's track editor .
Trackmania lends itself to glorious multiplayer competition – provided you can actually find someone to race against .
As fun as the single - player modes can be , the Trackmania experience is primarily about shaving half a second off of a friend 's ( or a complete stranger 's ) best lap time , thus ruining their day .
Few handheld experiences are as satisfying as watching an opponent become utterly flummoxed by expert control on mind - bogglingly complex tracks .
But when you 're constrained to local games , the opportunity to find opponents to race against drops dramatically .
There are two multiplayer modes in Trackmania DS : a
Hotseat mode , which will see you passing a single DS among a number of friends , and a local Wi-Fi mode , which can be played a single copy of the game – although you will only be able to play in the Stadium environment and wo n't be able to use custom tracks if you and your racing pals only have one cartridge between you .
Let 's be realistic :
Your odds of getting four friends with four copies of the game and four DSes in one place for a dedicated racing session are n't very high .
That 's where the lack of online gameplay really hurts .
Trackmania DS is a great game .
But racing time trials and designing tracks starts to lose its appeal when you do n't have anyone to share the experience with .
If you 're having trouble convincing your friends to buy the DS game , remember that the PC version of Trackmania is incredibly popular – and free .

Of all the AC adapters stuffed into your personal item when globetrotting , the plug used in Merry Old England must surely be the most cumbersome -- its three copper prongs flung to the extremes of a giant block of plastic .
That Victorian holdover gets a major re-do with this UK Folding Plug concept .
The two horizontal prongs rotate themselves in - line with the top , vertical one , and the body of the adapter then folds in half , resulting in a thickness of about 1 cm .
Interestingly the plug would still work in either position , with a slimline power strip envisioned to accept three of these slender lovelies at once .
It 's positively brilliant , but is just a concept at this point , and while we do n't have any news to pass along about its likelihood for production , surely some manufacturer will watch the video after the break and start churning these out by the millions .

The least popular vice - president in memory is not helping the Republicans regroup - according to this piece from the Hill .
But Cheney is not giving these disgraceful and classless interviews to help the GOP .
He 's giving them because it is beginning to dawn on him that he is in very serious trouble - legally , politically , historically .
As the full details of his obsession with the torture program emerge , and as the gruesome nature of the actual torture becomes clearer , he knows he will go down in history as a war criminal , defined for all time as the man who took America and the West to the dark side with no easy way back .
He 's trying to prevent that with the usual bluff and bravado .
But even Bush is n't buying all of it any longer .
It seems to me that what we need is simply more disclosure of all the government knows about what Cheney and Bush did .
What Panetta and Rudman need to do is to find out and publish as much as possible about the facts of the torture techniques and , more saliently , what the results of the torture program were .
We need to see what actual actionable intelligence we got from it , to evaluate the balance between false information and accurate information , and to find out just how intimately Cheney was involved in orchestrating , monitoring and presiding over the torture , from whatever distance .
Until we know more facts , we can not fully assess the damage .
Right now , we just have blanket assurances from the accused that they did nothing wrong and saved many lives .
What if that is n't accurate ?
Cheney is out there hurting his party , helping the president , and sowing fear - because he has to if he is to survive as anything but a pariah .
The one thing he cannot stand is sunlight .
So let it in , Mr President .
Let it in .

Mayor Bill Cervenik has spent a lifetime celebrating the Fourth of July curled up on a blanket in this city ’s Memorial Park beneath bursts of fireworks across a darkened Ohio sky .
People have long considered the fireworks a treasure of this Cleveland suburb , where flags fly year - round in neighborhoods of bungalows and stores post signs for passersby to “ support our troops . ”
But the fireworks and singing along to “ The Star - Spangled Banner ” on a warm summer night -- and the police and firefighters needed to manage the 30,000 people who turn out -- do n’t come cheap .
So this year , Euclid will have no fireworks .
“ I ’m 55 years old and I ca n’t remember not going to one of these , ” Cervenik said .

As the economic crisis has dragged on , city leaders around the country say fireworks are a luxury they can no longer afford .
Big and small , urban and rural , the skies will remain dark over at least four dozen communities nationwide come July 4 .
“ It came down to this : Did we want to spend $ 150,000 on something that would be over in a few hours ? ” Cervenik said .
“ Or did we want to use that money to keep city workers employed ? ”
The news has sparked outrage and protests among residents who long to preserve an American tradition that dates to 1777 .
They say that fireworks displays are more than a nod to nostalgia :
They allow communities to come together , set aside their woes and build up town pride -- even if only for a few hours .
“ Good times , bad times , there ’s always been fireworks , ” said Robert Baker , who heads the Fourth of July festival committee in Abington , Mass .

Baker , a shipping foreman with a shoe manufacturer , has been out of work for a year .
The festival was quashed this month amid city budget fights .
“ This is one more blow in a year of blow after blow , ” Baker said .
In San Jose , slumping tourism and dwindling sales tax receipts shut down the city ’s America Festival and its evening display over a half - mile stretch of Highway 87 .
“ We ’re faced with balancing an $ 84 - million budget shortfall , ” said mayoral spokeswoman Michelle McGurk .
“ We do n’t have the money to support a lot of things we ’d like to . ”

Some cities would rather feed their residents than entertain them .
In the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello , where unemployment hovers at 12 % , the City Council unanimously voted to use its $ 39,000 fireworks budget on donations to local food banks .
“ The last food bank line I saw had more than 1,000 people in it , ” said Mayor Rosemarie Vasquez .
“ We figured that , instead of burning the money in the air , why not give it to people who need it . ”
In Lowell , Mass. , Mayor Edward Caulfield canceled the city ’s annual show to help save one city job .
He had already cut 48 .
Big cities , such as Chicago and New York , have been able to keep their shows thanks to corporate sponsors , according to the American Pyrotechnics Assn .
Advertisement
But Julie Heckman , executive director of the association , said that smaller communities tended to rely on a combination of city funds and local donations to pay for their displays of patriotism .
When budgets grow tight , she said , towns are forced to be creative with less .
That was the case for Punta Gorda , Fla. , a community of 17,000 on the Gulf Coast .
The city , devastated in 2004 by Hurricane Charley , is still rebuilding itself .
The recession has n’t helped .
When the city pulled its backing for the show over Charlotte Harbor last year , the town ’s Main Street association took over .
Advertisement
Fundraising has been slow .
The group has raised only two - thirds of what it needs .
The pyrotechnic company stepped in to help :
It offered a discount , a shorter show and fewer explosions .
So a much smaller show will go on , but the city came up with extra activities to make up for the abbreviated fireworks : three - legged races , water balloon tosses , hula - hooping and key lime pie-making contests .
“ What do those cost ? ” asked Linda Dobson , executive director of Main Street Punta Gorda .
“ Nothing . ”
In a few places , such as New Providence , N.J. , a last - minute benefactor has stepped in to save the show .
Advertisement
After local newspapers wrote about how the town of 12,000 was canceling its holiday fireworks because of economic troubles , the local Investors Savings Bank stepped in and offered to cover the $ 15,000 bill .
Elsewhere , towns have just given up .
This will be the second year Carrollton , Texas , has canceled its $ 20,000 fireworks order and wo n’t have street vendors hawking plates of barbecue and buttery corn on a stick .
Residents were furious last year , said Mayor Ronald Branson .
City leaders promised to try to bring the fireworks back in 2009 .
Advertisement
But as the economy grew worse in the north Texas town of 121,000 , those hopes fizzled .
Faced with a $ 2.3 - million budget shortfall , the city is weighing whether to close City Hall and its libraries one day a week and make City Council members -- who get paid $ 200 a month -- take a pay cut .
Voters are still calling , but not to complain .
Branson said they were pleading with him to use the fireworks money to put people to work fixing city sprinklers or planting trees .
Advertisement
Branson , though , is still hoping next year will be different .
“ We all would like to get the fireworks going again , ” he said , “ because it would mean the economy had turned around . ”

Former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld routinely used militaristic passages from the Bible on the cover pages of White House intelligence documents , according to new revelations by GQ magazine ….
One republished on the GQ website came from March 31 , 2003 , showing a US tank roaring through the desert about 10 days after the United States invaded Iraq to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein .
Over the image was printed a verse from Ephesians : “ Therefore put on the full armor of God , so that when the day of evil comes , you may be able to stand your ground , and after you have done everything , to stand . ”
Homosexuality is perceived as a new phenomenon in Africa and a taboo .
It is outlawed in many African countries .
Many African leaders have condemned homosexuality as being un -African .
The Zimbabwean President , Robert Mugabe once described gays as worse than dogs and pigs .
Former Namibia 's President , Sam Nujoma , once stated that “ Homosexuals must be condemned and rejected in our society . ”
Nigeria introduced a bill in 2007 banning same sex marriage .
According to Rod 2.0 the bill is the most comprehensive homophobic legislation ever proposed in the world .
Early this year homosexuals in Nigeria stormed the National Assembly seeking for legislation that will guarantee the protection .
Lifestyle , culture and religion have become the invisible fence to many homosexuals in Africa barring them from their freedom of sexual expression .
A Kenyan blogger , Wilde Yearnings , was quite optimistic after US President Barack Obama officially declared June being a gay pride month and decriminalizing of homosexuality all over the world earlier this month .
He posted Obama 's speech on his blog :
My Administration has partnered with the LGBT community to advance a wide range of initiatives .
At the international level , I have joined efforts at the United Nations to decriminalize homosexuality around the world … NOW , THEREFORE , I , BARACK OBAMA , President of the United States of America , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States , do hereby proclaim June 2009 as Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender Pride Month .
I call upon the people of the United States to turn back discrimination and prejudice everywhere it exists .
Naughy Feeling commented on the post :
It is great our comrades in America are getting recognition .
In our dear country we can't stick our necks in the sand and tell ourselves all will be well .
The gigantous task ahead demands of us that we kid not ourselves of the responsibility ahead of us .
It may require sacrifices but all for the greater good .
May
God bless LGBT kenya n give us strength for what is ahead .
But hey , look on the bright side , we can still have fun at it .
But will culture , religion and lifestyle factors derail the decriminalisation of homosexuality in most African countries or will it be as Wilde Yearnings described “ meanwhile in Kenya … The struggle continues … ” ?
It has been said that homosexuality is a lifestyle adapted by Africans from the West , SebaSpace a Ugandan blogger tries to points out that his “ sexuality ” and “ him ” are one , that homosexuality cannot be a lifestyle because for him to be involved with someone it has to be sexually , emotionally and spiritually bringing the fact that homosexuality is a physiological function too .
SebaSpace has been on a constant war with an anti-gay blogger also from Uganda and the war is always revolving around religion , culture and lifestyle .
This created a stir in the LGBT blogosphere and another gay Kenyan blogger wrotes a post to answer the three questions The Red Pepper had asked .
The questions were :
1 . If you try to drink water through the ear , you naturally spoil it because it was created by God to do the hearing function .
That 's physical harm .
2 . when they discovered you were gay .
You know very well how we love having grandchildren in Africa .
Imagine what goes on in your parents ’ minds to know that you will never give them grandchildren ( I am assuming that you a die - hard gay man but if you are bi , please forgive me ) .
So that is emotional harm .
3 . Spiritual harm .
You tamper with God 's plan of procreation .
Understand that the main reason of creating the sexual organs was procreation purposes .
For you in an attempt to be very creative , you put your organs at the disposal of pleasure only ( I hope it is fun ) .
If you have radical parents , they can start questioning God as to why he gave them such a child .
I know parents of a gay boy who visited scores of witchdoctors thinking that their child had been bewitched .
I can give you as many reasons as possible .
I hope you are an objective gentleman who looks at things objectively .
With so much hate from all sides , will the African Leaders put their priorities in order from all the pressure by the UN , IMF and World Bank and speak out for the sexual minorities or will still hold them in this invisible cage ?
His answers :
The Ugandan rag called Red Pepper has been engaging Afro gay , a fellow Gay blogger from Uganda in arguments regarding the situation on Homosexuality in Uganda .
Follow this link to see the full post .
Recently , the editor of red pepper wrote to Afro arguing that he ( Afro ) was causing Physical , emotional and Spiritual harm to his family by being gay .
I promised Afro that I will write my responses to the Editor on my blog and link back with him .
I have taken their questions , edited without altering the message and I have responded to each question .
I tend to disagree with you when you say that homos have never done anybody physical , emotional or spiritual harm .
Without any prejudice I want to tell you that they are guilty of all the three accounts .
Count 1 .
If you try to drink water through the ear , you naturally spoil it because it was created by God to do the hearing function .
That 's physical harm .
Red pepper has made three elementary mistakes ( assumptions ) 1 ) The common one that homosexuality is equal to sodomy ( their shallow analogy of the ear above ) 2 ) Following number 1 above that sodomy is practiced only by homosexuals and 3 ) That all homosexuals engage in anal sex .
I will deal with the last one first .
Is the paper saying they are ok with someone with homosexual orientation as long as they do n’t engage in sex ?
Have they ever heard of celibate gay people and gay people who do n’t engage in anal sex ?
Well , I have and know both types .
It 's worth noting , that from the very beginning sodomy and homosexuality were two categorically separate things .
The correct definition of sodomy–then and now–is simply non-procreative sex , whether practiced by heterosexuals or homosexuals .
It includes oral sex , masturbation , mutual masturbation , contraceptive sex , coitus interruptus , and anal sex–any sex in which semen does not find its way into a uterus .
The anal sex thing is one elephant in the room , but it 's not an inherent part of being gay , it is n't an activity engaged in exclusively by gay people .
SebaSpace refused to answer the questions from Red Pepper .
He gives reasons for his refusal :
If you look at the e-mail below , the editor of the Red Pepper has valid questions he is asking and , ordinarily , I would answer them – indeed I have answered these questions over the years more times than I have had hot dinners .
The problem for me now is I do n’t believe the people asking the questions are sincere .
Rightly or wrongly , I think all they are looking for is material to feed their tabloid frenzy and so I have refused to provide the answers .
That said , I think it would be okay for other bloggers to attempt to answer them on their blogs or wherever as they are legitimate .
Here is the e-mail I got from the Red Pepper and the questions they posed [ heavily emended for clarity ]
Thanks for the reply .
Well , you have not answered Phiona 's question and I am sure she will maintain her opinion .
I also have a feeling that you do n't have an answer for it .
The times I have interacted with you I have discovered that you are a clever man who cannot answer a question unless you are sure the answer is convincing .
Again I tend to disagree with you when you say that homos have never done anybody physical , emotional or spiritual harm .
Without any prejudice I want to tell you that they are guilty of all the three accounts .
While gay and lesbian bloggers in Africa use blogs to express themselves freely , there are also anti gay bloggers targeting them .
One of them , Blake , had a blog called Kenyans Against Gays before it was suspended for violating Blogger 's Terms of Service .
Kenyan
Gay wrote about the suspension :
A couple of years ago , a dude called Blake started this blog and I think the first thing he did was to announce its launch on my blog .
Over time , that blog grew with articles explaining why he felt he should take a position against us etc .
However , from propagating his position against homosexuality in recent times he moved to actually calling for gay people in Kenya to be killed .
I have been alerted by a reader that the blog has been suspended whilst being investigated for possible blogger rules violation .
I suspect it is because of his latest position that was quite militant .
I am a believer in freedom of expression and actually think that blog helped expose that there are some willing to propagate hate to get their point across .
But I draw the line when someone advocates for homosexuals to be killed .
I think his blog served us more than it aimed to destroy us .
This is because we have many Kenyan gay blogs and Blake used to visit all of them and in the comments section try to drive traffic to his site .
If you followed links , you would find that very many of the comments were from people who attempted to engage him intellectually on gay issues .
Unfortunately , there were those usual vile comments from both sides with most insults coming from him .
He was a troll on my blog until I decided to ignore him .
When you visit Kenyans Against Gays blog you get the following message :
This blog is in violation of Blogger 's Terms of Service and is open to authors only
However , Blake went on to start another blog using WordPress .
Choosing an appropriate content management system , or CMS , is usually an important decision that needs to be made when launching a new website or blog .
A popular choice these days seems to be the blogging platform known as WordPress , and for good reasons .

Religion in the WorkplaceFor the most part , your religion should have no part in what happens in the workplace , but there is one exception : when you ask for an accommodation because of your religious beliefs .
The concept of " accommodation " appears only in three places , as far as I know , in the context of workplace law .
Arguably , it may come up when employees request leave under the Family Medical Leave Act .
It certainly comes up in the context of workers with disabilities , who may be covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the NYS Human Rights Law , and who need changes in workplace procedures or policies to do their job .
It also comes up when employees need modifications most often of schedules , but sometimes also policies , to accommodate religious observances .
These employees may be covered by Title VII and the NYS Human Rights Law .
In these three narrow areas employers have an obligation to accommodate the needs of employees , but the way the law is set up employers do not have to blindly accept the basis for the employee 's request for accommodation .
In essence , the employer is entitled to verification , provided the employer 's request is reasonable .
Think of it as a conversation :
The employeee : I need an accommodation in my work schedule so that I can attend to my seriously ill husband .
Or : I need to change how this task is done because the way we do it now is impossible for me because I 'm in a wheelchair .
Or : I need to leave early on Fridays because I'm Jewish and observe the Sabbath .
The employer :
We'd be glad to accommdate you , but how do we know that what you are saying is true .
Is your husband really seriously ill ?
Why does the fact that you are in a wheelchair prevent you from following our usual procedures ?
Are you really an observant Jew ?
In contexts where employees are entitled to accommodation , employers are entitled to some form of documentation backing up the need for the accommodation .
Medical notes might suffice when it comes to the sick husband and wheelchair bound employee .
A note from a Rabbi or minister should suffice to establish the religious observance .
Sometimes an employer might take less .
Sometimes circumstances may require more .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - North Korea has suspended visas for tourists from Britain , a Beijing - based travel agency said , citing the state - run travel company .
The move comes as United Nations Security Council members consider tightened sanctions on North Korea , which conducted a nuclear test last month .
“ In connection with the recent measures taken by U.K. government not to allow DPRK citizens to enter the U.K. , we also will not receive any U.K. citizens as tourists to the DPRK for the time being , ” Korea International Travel Co said in a message to Koryo Tours , which specializes in North Korean travel .
About 2,000 western tourists a year visit North Korea , of which a few hundred are British .
“ It ’s a pity to me that measures like this prevent day - to - day engagement between ordinary people , ” said Koryo Tours ’ Nick Bonner , who has made a documentary about taking a team of North Korean football players on a trip to England .
Next year marks the tenth year of diplomatic relations between North Korea and Britain .
Tourists from the United States are currently restricted to visiting North Korea only during the Mass Games , which will be held in August and September this year .

I have been working really hard at changing my life .
I am down 35 lbs , up probably 10 in muscle .
The first thing to vanish was my boobs and the last thing will be my frickin ' belly .
I feel much better , my eyes are clear , my clothes are all too baggy and fried food bothers my stomach .
I also , for the first time in my life , find obese people upsetting and almost disgusting .
This bugs me , it is hypocritical at best , I am still a fat chick !
Here are a few things I have noticed so far - 1 .
Most men still think me vulgar and ugly , never mind my pretty face and personality .
But now , I am starting to see men at the gym doing one of two things - they either speak to me because I have somehow managed to be a gym rat in their eyes or they are starting to pay attention and be nice to me because they think that by some miracle I will screw them once I lose a bunch more weight , granted , this is my instinct speaking , I could be totally wrong .
Either way , anyone who was n't man enough for me as a really fat chick surely will not be man enough for me in the future , it kind of pisses me off .
2. 35 lbs is A LOT of fat .
Next time you go to the grocery store , take a look at packages of hamburger in 1 or 2 pounds .
Add it up , it seems massive .
It feels that way too .
Who knew that 6 months ago when walking on the treadmill hurt my feet so bad I could hardly walk that now I am biking and running .
3 . Women are for the most part , negative about my success .
Disguised as some sort of twisted cheering me on , most have something negative hidden in everything they say .
WTF is that ?
Women truly are insane !
4 . Trainers are useless to me !
Most of them are just slick salesmen who studied one book and took some test ( not all , but this has been my impression and I have made it my business to get to know them all ) .
The nicest people I have interacted with have been the biggest , baddest , buffest dudes and the most ripped ladies .
Somehow they can see beyond the obvious and pick up on the fact that I am absolutely driven and determined .
Some of them have been instrumental in proper form , putting together a solid work out and how to make a program work .
5 .
Chicks that wear a bunch of makeup and wear their hair down at the gym looking super hot are THE MOST SUPERFICIAL creatures walking the planet , AND they are dumb as rocks .
What a waste of such beauty .
6 . Building muscle and losing fat hide themselves and manifest themselves in the strangest of ways .
I plateaued at 35 lbs a month ago and yet people who have n't seen me in a month are still going " WOW you are losing weight ! " .
So do n't get so down when you hit one , your body is just adjusting , it is natural and a part of the whole deal .
7 .
It SUCKS being the fat one at the gym , it is not easy to walk into a place of sculpted beauties looking so pitiful .
You have to absolutely dismiss all of those feelings and it is not easy !
8 .
Gay guys absolutely hate fat women at the gym , it makes no sense to me but they have mad attitude .
9 .
There is so much to learn , un - learn in bad habits and re-learn in good ones .
Give yourself a break , you did n't get fat overnight , its not going away overnight .
You have to stick with it , invest time and time pays off .
10 .
Young guys are much nicer than the young ladies .
11 .
Do n't be a chicken !
People bigger than you feel just as awful and awkward as you do , dare to share your enthusiasm with them , it really does help .
12 . I hate brown rice and oatmeal , but they are my friends .
13 .
If you are gonna eat carbs , get your ass on the cardio machines and use them !
14 . Elyptical ( sp ? ) machines are supposed to be easy on the knees , what bullshit !
They are also usually made for people 5 foot 5 or taller .
15 .
Do n't freak out when you build muscle in your upper body and your bras get tight !
Build enough muscle and the fat will start to fade , it will pass .
16 .
6 meals a day really is a great ticket , eat protein with each and every one of them .
17 .
If you are really working the weights , start incorporating a protein shake of some sort immediately after your work out - if you wait more than 20 - 30 minutes your muscles will try and eat themselves .
18 .
One word - DERMAFINE -MD .
It WORKS just as well and is much cheaper than Strivectin.19 .
Please for the love of all things sacred , lose weight for YOURSELF .
Forget the porn / media driven body image and trying to be something for someone else .
You MUST strive above all to do it for YOU ( everyone else gets a bonus when YOU succeed ) .
20 . COUNT EACH AND EVERY CALORIE AND MAKE THEM COUNT .
If you do n't eat enough , your body will eat your muscles , if you eat too much and the wrong type , back comes fat .
21 .
YEP - that guy you absolutely could not believe was looking at your hoochie when you were doing leg presses really was .
Nope , he does n't want to screw you but somehow can't NOT look .
22 . YEP - that awful bimbo who looks at you with such disgust really does think you a loser , fuck her and the sugar daddy who bought her those boobs .
Well I am rambling , I just wanted to share a little of what I have learned and seen .
I hope it helps someone out there .
You really can be successful , just remember that courage is not the absence of fear but the judgment that something else is more important than fear - YOU !

If you 've ever wanted your very own Linux.com email address ( and did n't work for SourceForge / OSDN ) - you too can now get one .
All you need to do is join the Linux Foundation .
The Linux Foundation is set to formally announce a new individual membership program tomorrow that costs $ 99 that will include an @ Linux.com email address .
The Linux.com domain was acquired by the Linux Foundation in March and was re-launched in May .
Having an individual membership class is a far cry from how things were in the OSDL days ( prior to the creation of the Linux Foundation ) .
Then membership was a pricey affair often tipping $ 1 million or more .
The idea is that membership fees support the development of Linux since the Linux Foundation is the organization that employs Linus Torvalds .
Membership also gives individuals a voice in the structure of the foundation .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Freddie Mac 's chief executive , installed last year after the government took over the troubled mortgage finance company , is resigning , the company and its regulator said Monday .
David Moffett will step down by March 13 .
Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) said it would announce a successor by then .
Moffett said that he planned to return to the financial services sector .
He served as chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp from 1993 until 2007 .
" We are very sorry to see David go , " Freddie Chairman John Koskinen said in a statement .
" He made valuable contributions to Freddie Mac as the company transitioned into conservatorship . "
Moffett replaced Richard Syron as Freddie CEO in September , when Freddie and Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) were placed under conservatorship by its regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
Herb Allison , former CEO of pension provider TIAA - CREF , replaced Daniel Mudd as CEO of Fannie Mae .
Both companies back mortgages held by private homeowners , and have received massive cash infusions from the government .
Freddie Mac , which has accessed nearly $ 14 billion in government funds , said it may need up to $ 35 billion more when it reports its financial results in coming weeks .
According to Freddie Mac , Moffett was hired " to provide leadership for the company during one of the toughest housing markets in decades " and to work with the FHFA in bringing stability to the housing market .
Back in November , Freddie Mac reported a third - quarter loss of $ 25 billion , or $ 19.44 per share .
In the next few weeks , the company is expected to report a fourth - quarter loss of $ 10.27 per share , according to a consensus of analyst opinion compiled by Thomson Reuters .
Fannie
Mae reported a fourth - quarter loss of $ 25.2 billion , or $ 4.47 per share , its sixth straight quarter of losses .
President Obama announced last month that Fannie and Freddie will be used to provide access to low - cost refinancing for borrowers with little or no equity in their home .
The Obama administration intends to help five million home owners avoid foreclosure through this plan .

1. Entertain your dominant / submissive side .
2 . It is a terrific way to enhance your sex life .
3 . You will meet some of the most wonderful people .

Most people get into BDSM as a way to enhance their traditional relationship .
Often , they are looking for ways to " spice " things up within a marriage ( or some other arrangement ) .
A few use it as an alternative to the traditional mode of relationships .
Whatever the motivation , there are three main benefits for involving yourself in BDSM .
Most people have a particular style which is natural to them .
There are some who get sexually aroused at the idea of being tied up .
Others experience the same sensation when pondering being the one who is doing the tying .
Within each of us , there is a overriding trait ( either dominant or submissive ) which we are seeking to fulfill .
BDSM allows us to entertain this side of ourselves .
Many of us find ourselves in professions where we need to be a certain way .
Yet , oftentimes , this is something which goes against our basic makeup .
I have met more than one high - powered attorney who was completely submissive .
Also , the traditional relationship usually has an equal breakdown of power relying more on negotiation as opposed to domination or submission .
The drawback to most long - term relationships is that the sex tends to suffer over time .
Over the years , people tend to do all that they can reasonably think of .
However , getting involved in BDSM opens up a whole new world of sexual fantasy to be explored .
The possibilities become almost endless when one starts researching all that is available .
A wonderful aspect of this is that it is simple to get started .
Many seem to want to complicate the process .
Instead of shopping at the local sex shop ( where prices are incredibly high ) , travel to your local hardware store .
You will be amazed what you can do with some rope , wood , and rubber hoses .
People with active imaginations can get really creative with what they devise .
Whether it is online in a chatroom / forum or in your local community , there are some wonderful people involved in this lifestyle .
People come from every walk of life .
The majority of people I have met are simply interested in having a good time .
Since this tends to be off the " mainstream " path , most individuals seem to be less judging than the average person .
Enjoying ourselves while being considerate of others is of utmost importance .
These are some of the main reasons why many people get involved with BDSM .
It is a lifestyle which allows for a lot of variety .
Some elect to restrict it to their sex lives while others make it the primary foundation .
Regardless of what you prefer , BDSM offers something for everyone .
A banned jihadi charity accused of links to November 's Mumbai attacks has resurfaced in north - western Pakistan , where it is running an extensive aid programme for people fleeing fighting in Swat .
The Falah - i- Insaniat Foundation ( FIF ) offers food , medical care and transport to villagers fleeing into Mardan district , where authorities are struggling to cope with an influx of more than 500,000 people .
But the charity , according to experts , officials and some of its own members , is the renamed relief wing of Jamaat - ud - Dawa , a group the Pakistani government banned last December after the UN declared it a terrorist organisation .
Jamaat - ud - Dawa is considered to be the public face of Lashkar - e - Taiba , the militant group accused of orchestrating the Mumbai attack on hotels and cafes that killed at least 173 people .
The Pakistan government declared a crackdown on Jamaat - ud - Dawa , closing dozens of offices and placing the leadership under arrest , but during the past 12 days its volunteers have re-emerged under their new name on the frontline of aid efforts .
The first relief camp is located outside Sher Gur in Mardan , just a few hundred metres from the border with Malakand , the mountainous area comprising Swat , Dir and Buner where the fighting is concentrated .
On Tuesday evening a stream of trucks , tractors and even rickshaws , all loaded with war - weary refugees , was met by roadside volunteers offering water , fruit juice and plates of steaming hot rice .
The vehicles were marshalled into the camp by a bearded man waving a black - and - white flag depicting a long sword and the Kalma , the Islamic article of faith – the same as the Jamaat - ud - Dawa standard .
Also present was Hafiz Abdur Rauf , head of the FIF and the former head of Jamaat - ud - Dawa 's welfare wing .
In a rare interview , he described the charity 's expansive programme .
The group 's 24 - hour kitchens had fed 53,000 people in roadside camps and in schools where people were living , he said .
A fleet of 23 minibuses transported victims from the battle zone while seven ambulances took the injured to hospital .
It offers to pay bus fares for people fleeing to cities such as Lahore and Karachi , and is organising emergency lodgings in madrasas for those remaining behind .
It intends to build two tented camps catering for 3,000 displaced families in the coming month .
A serious young man with a scraggly beard , Rauf was visiting from his Lahore headquarters .
He arrived in a new saloon car accompanied by several burly men .
" People are very afraid and worried about what 's going on .
They are terrified by the shelling and the bombardment , especially the children , " he said , as volunteers stirred six large pots of food behind him .
He was careful to avoid direct criticism of either the army or the Taliban .
" We have no political aims or agenda , " he said .
He also skirted questions about the link with Jamaat - ud - Dawa , saying when pressed that it was " a different organisation " .
But in nearby Mardan city several people , including a member of his own organisation , said otherwise .
At a major traffic junction , bearded activists manned a fundraising tent festooned with FIF signs and the group 's distinctive black and white flags .
" Stop the killing of Muslims , " read a sign in Urdu , with blood dripping from its letters .
" The old name was Jamaat - ud - Dawa ; this is the new one , " said Amjad Ali , a 34 - year - old trader who described himself as a spokesman .
He said the organisation was led by Hafeez Saeed , the Jamaat - ud - Dawa emir currently under house arrest .
" Most of my colleagues are from Jamaat - ud - Dawa , " he said , adding that it had 80 volunteers in Mardan district .
He refused permission for an interview with the bearded young volunteers around him .
" No need to speak with anyone else , " he said .
Amir Rana , an expert on jihadi groups , said that Falah - i- Insaniat was the new name for Khidmat - i- Khalq , the relief wing of Jamaat - ud - Dawa , which the US designated as a terrorist organisation in 2005 .
Local media reports said the FIF name was first used to stage a protest rally against the Indian presence in Kashmir in Lahore last February .
It also ran relief operations for the victims of an earthquake in Baluchistan province last November .
" They have changed their identity and are continuing their humanitarian activities , " said Rana .
It may seem ironic that the people of Swat , escaping an area where an experimental peace deal with extremists has gone horribly wrong , should be welcomed to safety by a group with links to the Mumbai attacks .
But it highlights the ambiguities of the Pakistani government 's effort to dismantle Jamaat - ud - Dawa , which Rana said has " not been serious " .
The difficulty is that Jamaat - ud - Dawa 's charity operations – running schools , hospitals and relief organisations – are considered to be legitimate humanitarian activities .
Often they are better organised and funded than comparable government services .
Closing them down would also hurt their beneficiaries .
After Jamaat - ud - Dawa was banned in December , a group of Pakistani Hindus held a street protest against the UN action .
Another factor is the group 's close links to Pakistan 's powerful security establishment .
After the Kashmir earthquake in 2005 , President Pervez Musharraf praised Jamaat - ud - Dawa 's impressive relief operation .
These days , Rana said , Jamaat - ud - Dawa 's activities in Punjab were controlled directly by the government , but its aid operations in Baluchistan and the North - West Frontier province continued to operate autonomously .
For many , Jamaat - ud - Dawa is seen as an extension of the powerful ISI intelligence agency .
Despite its high profile , the FIF operation in Mardan has not been highlighted in the Pakistani press .
In Sher Gur , the FIF camp is conspicuously well funded and organised – particularly in comparison with the chaotic efforts of the government .
" We are very grateful to them , " said Bakht Nazar , a labourer from Lower Dir , as he hunkered down over a plate of rice at the FIF camp in Sher Gur , pausing between mouthfuls to rail against army shelling of civilian buildings in his home area .
Watching over him was Enamullah , a burly , thick - bearded volunteer in his 40s who leaned on a walking stick .
" We do n't seek media attention but we have a strong image among the masses .
Whatever we are doing is only for God , " he said , pointing to the sky .
Google で 「オーケン」を検索すると一発で出てくる。「大槻ケンヂが自分のエッセイで自作歌詞を載せたところ、ＪＡＳＲＡＣから使用料を払えと連絡があり、払ったが大槻には印税は還元されず、問い合わせてもなしのつぶてだったと大槻が憤った」というもの。
それをライブで言葉として言った、という書き込みもあれば、エッセイで書いていた、というものもあった。ぴあのエッセイだった、という説もあるが、「オーケンの、私は変な映画を観た!!」という本にあったようだ、という人もいる。楽曲については、筋肉少女帯の「高円寺心中」であるとの説があるそう。「オーケン事件」を事実としてＪＡＳＲＡＣに怒りを爆発させているかの書き込みもあった。逆に、ソースがはっきりしないので、都市伝説のたぐいなのではないか？
と事件の存在自体に疑問を投げかける書き込みもあった。
当事者たるオーケンから真相を告げるなら、おそらく後者である。都市伝説だと思う。
僕は自作詞を著作に多数引用している。どころか、自作詞を中心に集めた二冊の詩集も発売しているが、それらについてもＪＡＳＲＡＣから徴収義務をうったえてきたという話は覚えがない。「私は変な映画を観た!!」にＪＡＳＲＡＣについてボヤいた記述はない。オーケン事件自体、ネットで初めて知った。
「 高円寺心中 」 は 「大槻ケンヂのお蔵出し」というエッセイ集でも引用している。確認したところ、なるほど前出の二詩集にはなかった日本著作権協会の許諾を示す番号が、こちらには奥付に記載されている。ただこれはおそらく「高円寺心中」とは別に同著の中で引用した、郷五郎さんの歌詞に対してのものではないかと思う。
その大槻ケンヂ氏の最新のエッセイ集『人として軸がブレている』（ぴあ）を読んでいたら、「オーケン伝説」に関する記述があった。そうだったのかー！ごめんなさい、僕もそれ、都市伝説だとは気づかずに広めちゃってました！『史上最強のオタク座談会②
回収』（音楽専科社・2000）の123ページで、「有名な話で、大槻ケンヂが自分のエッセイの中で、自分の作詞した歌の歌詞書いたら、ＪＡＳＲＡＣに金取られた」と言っちゃってるんである。その後、気になって調べ直してみたがどうしてもソースが見つからず、僕自身、どこでその話を読んだか思い出せず、「あれは都市伝説だったのかしらん？」と疑っていたのである。今回、大槻氏自身によって、明快に否定されたのである。僕はジャン・ハロルド・ブルンヴァンの『消えるヒッチハイカー』（新宿書房・1988）が出た直後に読んでハマった、いわば古株の都市伝説ファンである。『妖魔夜行』シリーズも、僕の都市伝説趣味が反映されている。だから都市伝説のたいていのパターンは知っているし、ソース不明の怪しげな話は「都市伝説じゃないの？」と疑うことにしているのだが、この時ばかりはコロッとひっかかってしまった。やっぱり「ＪＡＳＲＡＣならやりそうだ」という偏見が心の中にあったのだろうな。人間は信じたいものを信じるものである。『オタク座談会』シリーズはとっくに増刷はストップしてるし、文庫化の予定もないので、もはや訂正は不可能な状態。
だからこの場で謝罪しておく。大槻さん、そしてＪＡＳＲＡＣのみなさん、間違った話を広めてしまって申し訳ありません！ＪＡＳＲＡＣについてはいろいろ批判したいことはあるけど、今後、「オーケン事件」を根拠として持ち出すのは不当である、ということははっきりさせておくべきだろう。
This is a guest post by André Diederen .
Diederen is a senior research scientist at TNO , Holland , where he has been working since 1997 on defence related matters .
His background is mechanical engineering ( 1987 ) .
Because a ruling paradigm in defence related matters is the precautionary principle and since this sector applies various non-abundant metals , he took a closer look at the availability of metals .
The implications of metals scarcity reach far beyond the " niche " of defence related materials and might affect our entire industrial civilization .

Abstract
If we keep following the ruling paradigm of sustained global economic growth , we will soon run out of cheap and plentiful metal minerals of most types .
Their extraction rates will no longer follow demand .
The looming metal minerals crisis is being caused primarily by the unfolding energy crisis .
Conventional mitigation strategies including recycling and substitution are necessary but insufficient without a different way of managing our world ’s resources .
The stakes are too high to gamble on timely and adequate future technological breakthroughs to solve our problems .
The precautionary principle urges us to take immediate action to prevent or at least postpone future shortages .
As soon as possible we should impose a co-ordinated policy of managed austerity , not only to address metal minerals shortages but other interrelated resource constraints ( energy , water , food ) as well .
The framework of managed austerity enables a transition towards application ( wherever possible ) of the ‘ elements of hope ’ : the most abundant metal ( and non-metal ) elements .
In this way we can save the many critical metal elements for essential applications where complete substitution with the elements of hope is not viable .
We call for a transition from growth in tangible possessions and instant , short - lived luxuries towards growth in consciousness , meaning and sense of purpose , connection with nature and reality and good stewardship for the sake of next generations .
Introducing metal minerals scarcity and managed austerity
Undoubtedly , the global economic growth of the last century , fuelled by and accompanied by exponential growth in population and consumption of resources like fossil fuels , water , food and metal minerals , is unsustainable .
Now that we are nearing the second decade of the 21st century , we are beginning to notice the consequences of supply gaps of various resources .
This paper focuses on the issue of metal minerals scarcity within the constellation of interconnected problems of scarcity of water and food , pollution and climate change and most notably scarcity of energy .
In case of unlimited energy supply , metal minerals extraction would only be limited by the total amount of mineral resources .
However , due to the scarcity of energy , the extraction rates of most types of metal minerals will cease to follow demand .
Probably the only acceptable long - term solution to avoid a global systemic collapse of industrial society , caused by these resource constraints , is a path towards managed austerity .
Managed austerity will have to be a combination of changes in technology and changes in both individual and collective human behaviour .
Managed austerity could prevent non-desirable ‘ solutions ’ by doing much too little much too late ( also known as ‘ business as usual ’ ) which could ultimately result in large scale conflicts , global chaos and mass starvation of the world ’s population .
Energy scarcity
Humanity has depleted a significant part of its inheritance of highly concentrated energy resources in the form of fossil fuels .
Although huge quantities of these resources remain untapped , the worldwide extraction rate ( production flow ) has reached a plateau and will soon begin to decline [ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ] .
The result is an ever widening supply gap because sustained global economic growth requires sustained growth in available energy .
Figure 1 gives the general depletion picture for oil and gas [ 1 ] in giga barrels of oil equivalent ( Gboe ) and the left part of the bell - shaped curve strongly resembles a logistic curve .
The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential , growth slows as saturation begins ( ‘ the low - hanging fruit has been picked ’ ) and at maturity growth stops and a maximum is reached .
The maximum production rate is referred to as the ‘ peak ’ and is not a sharp deflection point in the curve but rather a plateau region .
Figure 1 : Depletion curve for oil and gas [ 1 ]
It is important to realise that the peak date in the depletion graph ( figure 1 ) is not the same as the half date because production can continue for a long period after the peak .
The actual depletion curve will presumably be asymmetric , having a peak date before the half date .
Although the exact peak date for oil and gas is being contested ( ranging from 2005 to somewhere during the next few decades ) , experts and authorities seem to converge on a peak date within the next few years .
Oil and gas are currently the world ’s most important energy sources .
Transportation for instance is currently almost entirely dependent on oil .
Coal will not be able to fill the energy gap after the peak in oil and gas .
According to [ 7 ] coal may peak around 2025 .
Again , this does not imply exhaustion of coal reserves , it is quite possible that more coal will be left for extraction after the peak date than has been extracted in total in the years before .
The crucial point is that a maximum production rate will be reached after which supply can no longer follow demand .
It is estimated that oil , gas and coal combined will reach their ‘ peak all fossil fuels ’ close to 2020 [ 8 ] .
All other energy resources combined ( nuclear , hydro , wind , solar , biofuels , tidal , geothermal and so on ) cannot fill the supply gap in time [ 9,10,11,12 ] .
Timely and massive utilisation of these other energy resources is limited by various constraints like lack of concentration , intermittency , issues related to conversion and storage and last but not least the required massive input of fossil fuels and metal minerals .
Therefore we will probably be confronted with a peak in global energy production within the next 10 to 15 years , despite progress in technology .
Metal minerals scarcity
The depletion graphs of most metal minerals will resemble the curve for oil and gas ( figure 1 ) .
Figure 2 gives an example for zirconium mineral concentrates [ 13 ] .
Figure 2 : Depletion curve for zirconium mineral concentrates [ 13 ]
Many warnings in the past of impending metal minerals shortages have been proven wrong because of the availability of cheap and abundant fossil fuels .
Every time the ratio of reserves to production of a certain metal mineral became uncomfortably small , the reserves of that mineral were being revised upwards because it became economically feasible to extract metals from the so - called reserve base or resource base .
Reserves are defined as those ores that can be economically extracted at the time of determination and the term reserves need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative .
The decades - old paradigm which states that reserves will be revised upwards ( to include lower ore grades ) as soon as supply gaps are looming , is no longer valid without cheap and abundant energy .
Mining and extraction ( concentration ) consume huge amounts of energy .
The energy required for extraction grows exponentially with lower ore grades .
This is illustrated in figure 3 for iron ore and aluminium ore [ 14 ] .
The highest ore grades have already been depleted or are already being mined .
Because of energy constraints , the largest parts of mineral deposits are out of reach for economically viable exploitation , see figure 4 [ 15 ] .
Figure 3 : Relation between required energy for extraction and ore grade [ 14 ]
Figure 4 : Mineralogical barrier for most elements [ 15 ]
Below the so - called mineralogical barrier ( the red shaded area in figure 4 ) , one would essentially have to pull the rock chemically apart to extract all individual elements .
This is of course prohibitively energy intensive .
For this reason it is very doubtful that meaningful parts of the reserve base or resource base of many metal minerals will ever be upgraded to reserves [ 16 ] .
It is even questionable whether all currently stated reserves are fully exploitable given the ever growing constraints with regard to energy required [ 13 ] .
The trend of geologically and physically based minerals scarcity will be further enhanced by other factors .
Global ( ‘ average ’ ) shortages will most likely be preceded by spot shortages because of geopolitics and export restrictions , as many important metal minerals are concentrated in just a few countries , often outside the western industrialized world ( e.g. China ) .
Extraction rates and reserves of metal minerals
Known data of extraction and consumption rates of metal minerals and their reserves indicate that the so - called ‘ peak production ’ for most metal elements will lie in the near future .
The data from table 1 and figures 5 through 9 support this statement .
Table 1 represents an overview presented by the US Geological Survey [ 17 ] of global annual primary production and global reserves of a large number of metal minerals .
Their production goes into various products and compounds , part of them being steels , alloys and metal products .
The remaining ‘ lifetimes ’ are calculated based on a modest consumption growth of 2 % per year .
The elements predicted to have a ‘ lifetime ’ of less than 50 years are summarized in figure 5 .
Of course , these minerals are not completely depleted in this period , but their peak production lies well before the estimated moment .
Compare the result for zirconium with figure 2 : the remaining ‘ lifetime ’ of zirconium is 19 years and the peak date is already behind us ( 1994 ) .
Although exact data fail , the elements strontium through niobium ( of figure 5 ) will soon reach their peak production or have already passed their maximum extraction rates .
Figure 5 : Years left of reserves at a sustained annual global primary
production growth of 2 % ( based on table 1 )
Figure 6 through 9 depict in more detail global annual production rates and the known reserves .
The annual primary production of iron dwarfs all other metal elements combined .
Despite its huge reserves , iron will last less than 3 generations ( less than 50 years ) as far as cheap and abundant primary production is concerned , due to the enormous scale of its annual global consumption .
The only viable long - term alternative to iron and in fact all metals at this scale of consumption would be magnesium .
Magnesium reserves are virtually unlimited because of its abundance and associated accessibility in seawater [ 20 ] .
Figure 6 : Distribution of annual global primary production ( based on table 1 )
Figure 7 : Distribution of annual global primary production without iron
( based on table 1 )
Figure 8 : Distribution of global reserves excluding magnesium ( based on table 1 )
Figure 9 : Distribution of global reserves excluding magnesium and iron
( based on table 1 )
On a trajectory of ‘ business as usual ’ , we will have much less than 50 years left of cheap and abundant access to metal minerals .
The production rate of metal minerals will start to decline well in advance of the depletion of reserves as it will take exponentially more energy input and metal minerals input to grow or even sustain the current extraction rate of metal minerals .
To sustain and increase current production rates , resources have to be extracted at ever more distant locations ( including deep mining and ocean floor mining ) and at ever lower ore grades which require exponentially more energy to extract .
In this sense it could even be stated that metal minerals scarcity aggravates energy scarcity .
Consequences of unmitigated metal minerals scarcity
During the next few decades we will encounter serious problems mining many important metal minerals at the desired extraction rates .
Amongst them are all precious metals ( gold , silver and platinum - group metals ) , zinc , tin , indium , zirconium , cadmium , tungsten , copper , manganese , nickel and molybdenum .
A number of these metals are already in short supply ( e.g. indium ) .
Metals like gallium , germanium and scandium are not incorporated in table 1 by lack of data , but these metals suffer from a very low extraction rate as they are by - products ( in very low concentrations ) of other metal minerals ; independent production growth is therefore not an option , thus making an increasing role for these elements impossible .
Besides the minerals with obvious constraints ( low ratio of reserves relative to primary production ) , we can distinguish different ‘ categories ’ of metal minerals in table 1 .
First , several metal minerals which have a high ratio of reserves relative to primary production suffer from relatively low absolute amounts of reserves and associated low extraction rates , effectively making them non-viable large - scale substitutes for other metals which will be in short supply .
It is up for debate for example whether lithium is a viable large - scale substitute for nickel in accumulators for electric energy as far as land mined lithium is concerned ( it might be extracted from seawater in future [ 20 ] , albeit at higher cost ) .
Second , other metal minerals have no acceptable substitutes for their major applications , which is of special interest for those metals which will run out relatively fast at the present course , manganese being an important example .
Third , even metals with a high ratio of reserves to primary annual production combined with large absolute amounts of reserves and associated extraction rates , can be susceptible to future supply constraints because they are located in just a few geographic locations .
An example is chromium which is mainly located in Kazakhstan and southern Africa .
Without timely implementation of mitigation strategies , the world will soon run out of all kinds of affordable mass products and services .
A few examples are given here .
First , a striking example are cheap mass - produced consumer electronics like mobile phones , flat screen TVs and personal computers for lack of various scarce metals ( amongst others indium and tantalum ) .
Also , large - scale conversion towards more sustainable forms of energy production , energy conversion and energy storage would be slowed down by a lack of sufficient platinum - group metals , rare - earth metals and scarce metals like gallium .
This includes large - scale application of high - efficiency solar cells and fuel cells and large - scale electrification of land - based transport .
Further , a host of mass - produced products will suffer from much lower production speeds ( or much increased tooling wear ) during manufacturing owing to a lack of the desired metal elements ( a.o. tungsten and molybdenum ) for tool steels or ceramics ( tungsten carbide ) .
Among the affected mass - produced machined products are various household appliances and all types of motorized transport ( cars , trains , ships and aero structures ) .
The lack of various metal elements ( a.o. nickel , cobalt , copper ) for high - performance steels and electromagnetic applications will affect all sectors which apply high - performance rotating equipment .
Besides transportation this includes essential sectors like electric energy generation ( coal / oil / gas - based and nuclear power plants , hydropower , wind power ) .
Also the vast areas of construction work in general ( housing , infrastructure ) and chemical process industries will be affected .
The most striking ( and perhaps ironic ) consequence of a shortage of metal elements is its disastrous effect on global mining and primary production of fossil fuels and minerals : these activities require huge amounts of main and ancillary equipment and consumables ( e.g. barium for barite based drilling mud ) .
These threats to the global economy require political , behavioural and governmental activities as well as technological breakthroughs .
Of the breakthroughs , intensified recycling offers the opportunity to buy us time and innovative substitution may lead to sustainable options [ 18,19 ] .
Efficiency : Jevon ’s paradox
A potent partial solution for metal minerals scarcity would be a better extraction efficiency , if it was n’t for Jevon ’s paradox .
Jevon ’s paradox is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used , tends to increase ( rather than decrease ) the rate of consumption of that resource .
So , technological progress on its own ( without ‘ control ’ ) will only accelerate the depletion of reserves .
Recycling : delaying of effects
Recycling the current and constantly growing inventory of metal elements in use in various compounds and products is the obvious choice in order to buy time and avoid or diminish short - to medium - term supply gaps .
Although recycling is nothing new , generally the intensity could be further enhanced .
We should keep in mind though that recycling has inherent limits , because even 100 % recycling ( which is virtually impossible ) does not account for annual demand growth .
At the present course we need to continue to expand the amount of metal elements in use in order to satisfy demand from developing countries like China and India whose vast populations wish to acquire a material wealth comparable with the standard of living of the industrialized western world .
Furthermore , recycling also costs lots of energy ( progressively more with more intense recycling ) and many compounds and products inherently dilute significant parts of their metal constituents back into the environment owing to their nature and use .
So even with intense recycling , we will need a continued massive primary production to continue our present collective course .
Substitution : the elements of hope
It is self - evident that - at our current level of technology - substitution of scarce metals by less scarce metals for major applications will lead to less effective processes and products , lower product performance , a loss in product characteristics , or lead to less environmentally friendly or even toxic compounds .
An important and very challenging task is therefore to realise the desired functionalities of such products with less scarce elements and to develop processes for production of these products at an economic scale .
The best candidates for this sustainable substitution are a group of abundantly available elements , that we have baptised ‘ elements of hope ’ ( see figure 10 ) .
These are the most abundant elements available to mankind and can be extracted from the earth ’s crust , from the oceans and from the atmosphere .
They constitute both metal and non-metal elements .
Hydrocarbons for production of materials ( including plastics ) could be extracted progressively more from biomass , albeit at a much lower extraction rate than from concentrated ( fossilized ) biomass ( oil , natural gas and coal ) .
Not coincidentally , all macronutrients of nature ( all flora and fauna including the human body ) are found among the elements of hope : nature either uses these elements ( metabolism , building blocks ) or has shown to be tolerant to these elements ( in their abundant natural forms ) .
Substitution based on the elements of hope therefore is potentially inherently environmentally friendly .
Figure 10 : The elements of hope ; the green elements are macronutrients , the elements
within the thickened section are metals ( Si being a metalloid )
Responsible application : frugal and critical elements
We can look at the remaining global reserves of metal minerals as a toolbox for future generations ( see figure 11 ) .
An important part of the toolbox is reserved for the elements of hope .
Another part of our toolbox is reserved for less abundant but still plentiful building blocks , the ‘ frugal elements ’ .
These elements should only be applied in mass for applications in which their unique properties are essential .
In this way their remaining reserves will last longer ( most notably copper and manganese ) .
For the sake of completeness , also the non-metals belonging to this category are included in figure 11 .
Finally a small corner of the toolbox is reserved for all other metal elements , the ‘ critical elements ’ , which should be saved for the most essential and critical applications .
Not described in figure 11 but also belonging to the critical elements are other non-metals and the metal trace elements with high atomic mass ( not previously mentioned in this paper by lack of data from [ 17 ] ) .
Figure 11 : The toolbox containing the elements of hope , the frugal elements and the critical elements ;
PGM = Platinum - Group Metals ;
REM = Rare - Earth Metals ;
the red elements are non-metals ;
B , Si , Ge , As , Sb , Te are metalloids ( for a better resolution version of fig .
11 , see this link )
Conclusion : a call for action , ingenuity and responsible behaviour
Because of the surging scarcity of energy , even large - scale substitution and recycling cannot circumvent supply gaps in metal minerals .
This is because production of metals consumes vast amounts of energy and so do substitution technologies and intensive recycling .
The introduction of managed austerity is required to convince us all to live using less .
With this paper we call for action .
We can increase the lifespan of the reserves of various materials by making a shift towards large - scale application of the elements of hope with a sensible use of the frugal and the critical elements .
In order to do this mankind will have to mobilize its collective creativity and ingenuity .
Technology alone is not enough to achieve this goal , nor can the challenge of metal minerals scarcity be treated as an isolated problem : it is part of a host of interrelated problems .
A solution calls for nothing less than a globally co-ordinated societal response .
The scarcity of energy , of food and water , of metal minerals and the effects of pollution and climate change all call for intervention by authorities to facilitate a transition towards collective responsible behaviour : managed austerity .
They call for a transition from growth in tangible possessions and instant , short - lived luxuries towards growth in consciousness , meaning and sense of purpose , connection with nature and reality and good stewardship for the sake of next generations .

Brooks torches Jindal : ' Stale ' and ' insane '
<
I 'd missed this last night , but David Brooks was almost unbelievably harsh in his reaction to Bobby Jindal 's response :
It was " stale " and " insane " and " a disaster for the Republican Party . "
His basic issue :
The GOP appears not to have a response to the economic crisis .
ALSO : Thrush catches a very odd reference in Jindal 's talk .
Che Guevara 's granddaughter poses semi-naked for animal rights ... with a string of carrots for ammo
Her grandfather fought for his idea of freedom , equality and a better world .
Lydia Guevara is simply fighting for attention .
The granddaughter of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara has posed semi-naked with bandoliers of baby carrots slung across her shoulders in an advertisement promoting vegetarianism .
Revolutionary : Lydia Guevara , on the set of the PETA photoshoot , wore a red beret and bandoliers of carrots
And she made sure to wear the iconic beret so associated with the famous grandfather she never knew .
Miss Guevara , 24 , has been recruited by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
' It 's a homage of sorts to her late grandfather , ' said a PETA spokesman .
' It very much evokes the tag line of the ad , which is " Join the vegetarian revolution " . '
Legend :
This photograph of Che Guevara was taken in 1960 and has become one of the most iconic images of all time
Since his death in 1967 , Che Guevara 's stylised image has become one of the world 's most recognised emblems .
His family has criticised the fact that his face has been used to sell everything from T - shirts to vodka .
PETA enlisted Miss Guevara , who lives in the U.S. , after finding out she was a vegetarian .
Che Guevara played a pivotal role in Fidel Castro 's rise to power in Cuba .
He was executed by the CIA in Bolivia in 1967 .
The ad is PETA 's first campaign promoting vegetarianism in South America .
' We say the best way to save animals is not to eat them , ' Mr McGraw said .
He said others who have promoted vegetarianism for PETA include Paul McCartney , Forest Whittaker and Alicia Silverstone .
It has also emerged that Natascha Kampusch , who was abducted and held in a cellar for eight years , wants to strip off for a PETA campaign .
I have received loads and loads of emails regarding all the issues people are facing when trying to unlock and jailbreak iPhone OS 3.0 .
I have tried my best to answer them by email , and to all the comments in my guides here and here .
Here is compilation of all the fixes for the issues that you may be getting when unlocking and jailbreaking iPhone OS 3.0 using redsn0w :
Fix for Problem 1 : If you are stuck at the “ Waiting for reboot ” screen .
Try the following solutions :
Solution A : ( Windows 7 & Windows Vista users ) : Right click on redsn0w.exe and then click on “ Properties ” .
Switch to “ Compatibility ” tab and make sure you check “ Run this program in compatibility mode for : Windows XP ( Service Pack 3 ) ” .
Now simply start the application by right clicking on the .exe file and then click on “ Run as administrator ” .
Solution B : If “ Solution A ” does n’t work for you then make sure that you downloaded the correct firmware version file for your device .
Firmware OS 3.0 ( iPhone1,2_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ) for iPhone 3G
Firmware OS 3.0 ( iPhone 1,1_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ) for iPhone 2G
Solution C : If “ Solution B ” does n’t work then try this when you are stuck on “ Waiting for reboot ” : Press and hold both the “ Power ” and “ Home ” buttons for about 10 seconds then release only the “ Power ” button only while continue to hold the “ Home ” button for another 10 seconds .
Your process should continue now .
Solution D : Make sure that you place all the required downloaded files in one single location ( i.e. in same folder ) as redsn0w :
redsn0w.exe
i Phone1,2_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ( iPhone 3G ) OR iPhone1,1_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ( iPhone 2G )
i Phone1,1_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ( iPhone 2G ) bl39.bin ( for iPhone 2G only )
bl46.bin ( for iPhone 2G only )
Make sure you have kept all these files in one location under same folder .
Fix for Problem 2 : If redsn0w.exe crashes during jailbreaking .
Try the following solutions :
Solution A : Make sure that you places all the required downloaded files in one single location ( i.e. in same folder ) as redsn0w :
redsn0w.exe
i Phone1,2_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ( iPhone 3G ) OR iPhone1,1_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ( iPhone 2G )
i Phone1,1_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw ( iPhone 2G ) bl39.bin ( for iPhone 2G only )
bl46.bin ( for iPhone 2G only )
Make sure you have kept all these files in one location under same folder .
Solution B : redsn0w may crash for some users running Windows Vista & Windows 7 .
To get around freezing and crashing of redsn0w , right click on redsn0w.exe and then click on “ Properties ” .
Switch to “ Compatibility ” tab and make sure you check “ Run this program in compatibility mode for : Windows XP ( Service Pack 3 ) ” .
Now simply start the application by right clicking on the .exe file and then click on “ Run as administrator ” .
This should solve your problem on Windows 7 .
Solution C : If both “ Solution A ” and “ Solution B ” didnt work for you then try this ( Thanks to joey ) :
Choose not to install “ Icy ” when redsn0w gives you an option to install it .
You can install “ Icy ” manually later when your are done with the jailbreak by following instruction under “ Fix for Problem 5 ” .
Fix for Problem 3 : If you are using a custom firmware 3.0 to update / restore using the guide here and getting 1604 error :
Solution A : You must make sure that you are updating from 2.2.1 in unlock and jailbroken condition .
Solution B : You must also make sure that you connect your iPhone directly to usb port on the backside of the computer .
Avoid using usb ports in front and usb hubs .
Fix for Problem 4 : You are stuck with firmware 3.0 and want to downgrade to 2.2.1 : ( Thanks to shoaib )
Most importantly you will have to set your iPhone into DFU mode NOT recovery mode , i tried recovery mode and got an error .
I ’m sure most of you out there are just hitting shift + restore in iTunes and hoping it will work .
But that method does n’t set the phone into DFU mode .
1. Connect your iPhone and Press the home button for 5 seconds .
2 . Press sleep / wake button for 10 seconds ( do not release home ) .
3 . Release sleep button but continue holding down the home button for an additional 30 seconds ( your computer will start reinstalling drivers DO NOT RELEASE HOME BUTTON UNTIL 30 SECONDS ARE OVER )
4. iTunes will detect your phone in recovery mode ( dont worry it will say “ recovery ” but is infact in DFU , you can make sure by checking the screen of your phone :
Recovery mode= logo of USB connecting to iTunes
DFU mode = Blank screen
5 . Press and hold left shift and click “ restore ”
6. Browse to folder containing the 2.2.1 firmware restore file .
it should look like this
i Phone1,1_2.2.1_5H11 _Restore
7. Double click it and iTunes will start restoring .
8 . Once that is done iTunes will say INVALID SIM ( if you are not using the legitimate SIM card ) .
9 . Now you have a choice , you can either set the phone back into DFU mode ( remember NOT recovery mode ) , or jailbreak using quickpwn 2.2.5 ( old version ) .
I decided to jailbreak so that the “ restore ” option appears like how it is normally suppose to when you connect your iPhone .
although setting the device back into DFU mode should also work .
10 .
Again press and hold shift and click on restore to browse to the custom “ cooked ” 3.0 firmware .
11 . Voila !
iTunes restores a fully functional 2G iPhone running on firmware 3.0
IMPORTANT REMINDER : Recovery mode can also be activated by holding the sleep and home button for 10 seconds , then releasing the sleep button while holding the home for additional 30 seconds …
THIS IS WHAT U *** MUST NOT *** DO !!!!
Remember that throughout the process we are using DFU mode ( I am emphasizing on this fact simply because recovery mode did not work for me ) .
PROBLEMS I ( shoaib ) FACED :
The shift + restore method was not functioning as it was suppose to .
So if you face the same problem , tell me .
i will show you how to bypass that .
Fix for Problem 5 : You have successfully jailbroken your device but you cant find “ Icy ” ( formerly Installer ) on your iPhone :
Those of you who have jailbreaked your iPhone using redsn0w method above may have noticed no Icy ( formerly Installer ) on your iPhone .
To install “ Icy ” , simply start “ Cydia ” on your jailbroken iPhone .
It will prompt you to install upgrades , choose “ Complete Upgrade ” and then confirm the installation .
Once this upgrade is done , restart “ Cydia ” and then follow the following steps :
1. Click on “ Manage ” and then click on " Sources ” .
2. Click on “ Edit ” and then click on “ Add ” .
3. Enter “ http://apt.ripdev.com” and then click on “ Add Sources ” .
It will upgrade some files .
4 . Now click on “ Done ” and then click on “ Search ” to search for “ Icy ” .
5. Find “ Icy ” ( Only the word “ Icy ” ) and install it .
6 . You should now have “ Icy ” installer on your iPhone home screen .
Fix for Problem 6 : You have successfully jailbroken your device but you are now unable to install jailbroken apps on iPhone OS 3.0 :
Those of you who have updated to iPhone OS 3.0 ( jailbroken ) might have noticed that your jailbroken apps ( Apps installed outside from App Store ) have stopped working .
Even if you have tried reinstalling them they wont work because these apps require a patched version of MobileInstallation file on your iPhone .
To get around this issue , follow the guide here to patch the MobileInstallation file on your iPhone to get all the jailbroken apps working on your iPhone with OS 3.0 .
Fix for Problem 7 : You seem to have downloaded the correct iPhone OS firmware 3.0 .ipsw file but your Windows identifies it as a “ . Zip ” folder for extraction :
Some people have encountered this problem when downloading .ipsw file from Apple only to find it as an extraction ( .zip ) folder with a bunch files .
To get around this issue :
1. Go to “ My Computer ” in Windows .
2. Press “ Alt ” button on the keyboard and then select “ Tools ” from the file menu and then click on “ Folder options … ” .
3 . In “ Folder Options ” , switch to “ View ” tab and uncheck “ Hide extensions for unknown file types ” and then click ok .
4 . Now simply go to the folder which contains that “ .ipsw ” file .
You will notice that the extension for that file will now be reading as “ .ipsw.zip ” .
Rename this file by removing the “ .zip ” extension from the end of the file so that the extension for the file becomes “ .ipsw ” only .
Example : iPhone1,2_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw
Windows should now be able to read the file as valid “ .ipsw ” file for iTunes .
UPDATE 1 : redsn0w 0.7.2 is now available for both Windows & Macs .
It adds support for PPC and comes with Icy ( formerly Installer ) as pre-installed .
Direct Download links can be found here .
Please share if you know solution to any problem that you may have encountered .
Also let me know if any of these solutions fixed your problem .
I ’m open to any questions .
Cheers !

INCOME TAX : WHY WE HAVE IT by Alan Stang
March 26 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
[ Announcement : Did you know Alan Stang has a new radio show ?
Click here for details . ]
Tote that barge , lift that bale , and make sure you pay on time .
April 15th approaches and my guess is that only a relative handful of Americans knows why we have the income tax .
With rare exceptions , they will exclaim that we must have the income tax to “ pay the expenses of the government . ”
Of course the truth is exactly the opposite .
The income tax has nothing to do with paying the expenses of the government .
First an obvious fact , something you already know .
When was the country created ?
Pick a date .
Many would pick July 4th , 1776 , when the Continental Congress adopted the nation ’s birth certificate , the Declaration of Independence .
Many others would pick the date of ratification of the Constitution .
Let ’s arbitrarily use 1776 .
Now , when did we get the income tax ?
Except for the temporary income tax during Lincoln ’s Communist War to Destroy the Union , there was no income tax in this country until 1913 , when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld its validity in Brushaber , 240 U.S. 1 .
Indeed , even then it did not affect more than a handful of our people .
As late as 1942 , only 3 % of our people paid income tax .
Until that date , most people probably had heard of it , but they did n’t pay it and had never seen the form .
It did n’t apply to them .
Indeed , if you check the records , you will see that in 1941 , when the reader may have already been alive , the federal government collected more in alcohol and tobacco taxes than it did in income tax .
Remember “ moonshine ” and the “ revenooers ? ”
The income tax finally did hit the people in a big way only in 1942 , and then only because we were of course in the middle of the war Franklin Roosevelt had finally succeeded in tricking us into by arranging Pearl Harbor .
Even so , the conspiratorial warmongers could put the tax over only by calling it the “ Victory ” tax , a “ temporary ” tax collected by withholding , which would be repealed as soon as we had won the war .
Question : Name for me a year , just one year , between 1776 and 1942 , when the nation could n’t function because we had no income tax .
Ca n’t find one ?
Okay name a month , just one month , when the nation collapsed , could n’t pay its bills , because we had no income tax .
How about a week ?
Indeed , remember that during all that time , we fought many wars .
We won them all .
Yes , we won World War II with the income tax because it was “ temporary , ” not yet a permanent part of our lives , but mainly because we fought that war on behalf of Stalin .
With the income tax we have not outright won a war since , from Korea to Iraq .
Remember , you knew all this .
I am simply reminding you of something you already knew .
So , if we did n’t have an income tax , yet never collapsed , where did the federal government get the funds to pay for itself ?
Again , they came from alcohol and tobacco taxes .
They also came from tariffs , which made foreigners pay for the privilege of selling products here .
And they came from other indirect taxes .
These were enough to pay for the few powers the Constitution grants to the federal government .
Did you know that one of the biggest problems in Congress before the turn of the Twentieth Century was what the newspapers called the “ tariff monster ? ”
So much tax money was pouring into the Treasury that Congress did n’t know what to do with it .
So , if we do n’t need an income tax to pay for the federal government , why do we have one ?
In August , 1942 , Meyer Jacobstein , of the Brookings Institution , testified to a Senate subcommittee that “ it is necessary to mop up the excess purchasing power of the community . . . because of its effect on the price situation . . . . ”
There are also a couple of Ohio University economists , Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway , whose study showed that for every dollar of increased taxes , Congress increased spending $ 1.58 .
In other words , taxes cause spending .
Now , another question you know the answer to .
When there was money ( gold and silver ) behind our currency , the government had to deposit in the treasury the appropriate amount of money , in grains or ounces , whenever it printed paper currency .
In the same way , you must deposit the appropriate sum in your checking account before you write a check against it .
Advertisement U.S. currency used to say it was “ redeemable ” downtown at the bank .
The bank would pay the amount of money printed on the face of the bill to the “ bearer on demand . ”
Even early Federal Reserve Notes said that .
The only difference between your personal check and government currency is that your check names the person to be paid and the government currency does not .
It paid the “ bearer , ” whoever had it in his hand when he walked into the bank .
Now here comes the question .
Since there no longer is any money behind our currency ; since the government no longer need find and deposit rare gold or silver into its account in order to write a check against it ; and since paper and ink are relatively limitless in supply – indeed , computer entries , today ’s “ money , ” are utterly limitless – why does the government bother to tax at all ?
Why the audits , the penalties , the raids and seizures , the divorces and suicides ?
Why does n’t the government just print what it needs ; bigger numbers on bigger pieces of paper ?
Even easier , why not just boot up and click on ever bigger computer entries ; then use those computer entries to pay the bills ?
This is what Meyer Jacobstein was talking about .
The answer is that doing so would constitute hyperinflation , which would send prices to Alpha Centauri and destroy the dollar here .
That is what happened in the Weimar Republic in post - World War I Germany , where the process took two years .
It is happening now in Zimbabwe .
The reason it has taken so long to happen here is that the financial geniuses who run the conspiracy for world government run the unbacked printings and now the computer entries through the non-Federal non-Reserve System , which is brilliantly designed to confuse and conceal what is happening .
Extra layers of obfuscation have since been added , including the CDO and other alphabetical horrors .
I have explained the process many times ; no need to do so again here .
But it is happening and when the train stops we shall be in Weimar .
The man with the answers is Beardsley Ruml .
Ruml was a lifelong Rockefeller factotum .
Rockefeller is the family David Rockefeller boasts in his Memoirs is part of a globalist conspiracy against the United States .
Ruml was chairman of the New York Fed .
It was he who devised World War II “ temporary ” withholding .
It was originally named for him : the “ Ruml pay - as - you - go plan . ”
In January , 1946 , American Affairs published a speech by Beardsley Ruml .
The title was , “ Taxes for Revenue Are Obsolete . ”
In it , Ruml speaks of two remarkable changes : “ the gaining of vast new experience in the management of central banks , ” and “ the elimination , for domestic purposes , of the convertibility of the currency into gold . ”
Under the heading , “ What Taxes Are Really For , ” Ruml listed three main purposes : “ as an instrument of fiscal policy to help stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar ” ; to express public policy in the distribution of wealth and of income , as in the case of the progressive income tax and estate taxes ” ; to express public policy in subsidizing or in penalizing various industries and economic groups . ”
Redistribution of the wealth by government is communism .
Subsidizing and penalizing various industries by government is fascism .
You are seeing such fascism right now in the government “ bailout ” of certain favored companies .
For instance , the government saved Goldman Sachs but flushed Lehman Brothers .
What about stabilizing the purchasing power of the dollar ?
Ruml says this by far is the most important reason for the income tax and other federal taxes , sometimes called “ the avoidance of inflation . ”
Ruml explains that “ federal taxation has much to do with inflation and deflation , with the prices which have to be paid for the things that are bought and sold .
. . . ”
If people have “ too much ” purchasing power , prices will rise . “. . .
This will mean that the dollar is worth less than it was before – that is inflation .
. . .
“ The dollars the government spends become purchasing power in the hands of the people who have received them .
The dollars the government takes by taxes cannot be spent by the people , and , therefore , these dollars can no longer be used to acquire the things that are available for sale .
. . . ”
So this is what Meyer Jacobstein meant by “ mopping up purchasing power . ”
The true purpose of the income tax , therefore , is to inhibit the inflationary effect of ravenous government spending .
The income tax allows our rulers to juggle their fiscal balls in the air a bit longer , by offering a safety valve through which the inflationary pressure generated by that spending can more safely be released .
The income tax does that by transferring purchasing power from the people to the government .
Again , it has nothing at all to do with paying the government ’s bills .
By the way , if you would like to read all this on paper , you will find most of it in my book , TaxScam : How IRS Swindles You and What You Can Do About It .
There you will see a picture of the “ tariff monster , ” from Puck , a magazine of the time .
Why I do n’t know , but they tell me it has become something of a “ minor classic , ” maybe merely because of its advanced age : twenty one .
It originally was $ 9.95 .
Despite its “ classic ” status , we ask only $ 5.95 ( plus shipping and handling ) because the covers are no longer perfect , in some cases no good .
But the pages are like new , and , of course , so is the information .

Alan Stang was one of Mike Wallaceï¿½s original writers at Channel 13 in New York , where he wrote some of the scripts that sent Mike to CBS .
Stang has been a radio talk show host himself .
In Los Angeles , he went head to head nightly with Larry King , and , according to Arbitron , had almost twice as many listeners .
He has been a foreign correspondent .
He has written hundreds of feature magazine articles in national magazines and some fifteen books , for which he has won many awards , including a citation from the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for journalistic excellence .
One of Stangï¿½s exposï¿½s stopped a criminal attempt to seize control of New Mexico , where a gang seized a court house , held a judge hostage and killed a deputy .
The scheme was close to success before Stang intervened .
Another Stang exposï¿½ inspired major reforms in federal labor legislation .
His first book , Itï¿½s Very Simple : The True Story of Civil Rights , was an instant best - seller .
His first novel , The Highest Virtue , set in the Russian Revolution , won smashing reviews and five stars , top rating , from the West Coast Review of Books , which gave five stars in only one per cent of its reviews .
Stang has lectured in every American state and around the world and has guested on many top shows , including CNN ï¿½s Cross Fire .
Because he and his wife had the most kids in Santo Domingo , the Dominican Republic , where they lived at the time , the entire family was chosen to be actors in ï¿ ½Havana , ï¿½ directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Robert Redford , the most expensive movie ever made ( at the time ) .

The income tax finally did hit the people in a big way only in 1942 , and then only because we were of course in the middle of the war Franklin Roosevelt had finally succeeded in tricking us into by arranging Pearl Harbor .

People do n't understand science .
And I do n't mean that your average person does n't understand how relativity works , or quantum mechanics , or biochemistry .
Like any advanced study , it 's hard to understand them , and it takes a lifetime of work to become familiar with them .
No , what I mean is that people do n't understand the process of science .
How a scientist goes from a list of observations and perhaps a handful of equations to understanding .
To knowing .
And that 's a shame , because it 's a beautiful thing .
It 's not mechanical , not wholly logical , and not plodding down a narrow path of rules and laws .
But it appears to me that this is how Douglas Todd , author of an article in the Vancouver Sun called ' Scientism ' infects Darwinian debates :
An unflinching belief that science can explain everything about evolution becomes its own ideology , thinks of science .
He likens it to religion , an unflinching belief that science can explain everything .
He calls this -- as many have before him -- scientism :
-- David Brin , Brightness Reef
Scientism is the belief that the sciences have no boundaries and will , in the end , be able to explain everything in the universe .
Scientism can , like religious literalism , become its own ideology . [...]
Those who unknowingly fall into the trap of scientism act as if hard science is the only way of knowing reality .
If something can't be " proved " through the scientific method , through observable and measurable evidence , they say it 's irrelevant .
Scientism is terribly limiting of human understanding .
It leaves little or no place for the insights of the arts , philosophy , psychology , literature , mythology , dreams , music , the emotions or spirituality .
Right from the gate he 's using a strawman argument .
There are many things science can't explain currently , and no real scientist brushes those fields off as " irrelevant " .
And he 's wrong in saying that science leaves no room for all those other studies ; it 's our study of human evolution that brings fantastic insight into why we have art , dreams , and mythology in the first place .
What a strange notion , that science plays no role in those fields or our understanding of them !
But it's in his understanding of science where Todd goes completely off course .
What he says about science is exactly backwards , and it seems to me that he does n't understand the process of science , of how it 's done by real scientists in real life .
First off , there is no such thing as scientism .
What he is describing is simply science , because science by its very nature is an attempt to explain all things using natural processes .
And he seems to think science has no imagination .
That 's insane .
Without imagination , all we can do is categorize the world .
Assigning names and numbers , statistics and categories .
And while that sort of thing is important in the scientific process , it 's not science itself .
Without imagination , science is a dictionary .
And in fact the opposite of what Todd is saying is true .
It takes no imagination at all to insert a supernatural explanation in some spot where you do n't understand the process .
It 's all too easy to say " the bacterium flagellum could not have evolved , " or " The Big Bang theory does n't explain why the Universe is homogeneous everywhere , " and therefore " God did it . "
But it takes imagination , soaring , incredible , wonderful imagination , to look beyond the limitations of what 's currently known , and see what could possibly be ... and even more imagination to make sure this venturing beyond current understanding still stays within the bound of reason and known rules of science .
You can always insert magic or belief or some supernatural power , but in the end that is a trap .
Because someone else who is more imaginative than you will see the actual steps , the process reality made , and then you are left with an ever - narrowing amount of supernatural room in which to wiggle .
And once that gap starts to narrow , the squeeze is inevitable .
Your explanation will be forced to fill zero volume , and you 're done .
Your explanation will be shown to be wrong for everyone to see , and your only recourse will be to abandon it , far too late to save your credibility .
Or to run for the Texas State Board of Education .
But that 's certainly not science .
It took a vast leap of imagination for Max Planck to think of gas molecules in the Sun behaving like little springs , oscillating away , able to eject only specific colors of light .
It took a leap of imagination for Alan Guth to think that the Big Bang theory was n't wrong , but incomplete , and to add inflation to explain why the Universe looks so smooth .
It took Darwin 's breadth of imagination to correlate the vast amount of data he collected , and see that it was the unthinking mind of nature that forced species to adapt or die .
It 's all too easy to poopoo science , and to say that scientists are black and white automatons who go through the motions of the scientific method , rejecting anything with sparkle or color or surprise .
But that conclusion itself lacks imagination .
Science is full of wonder , of surprise , of leaps of imagination .
If it were anything else , we would n't have probes orbiting other worlds , we would n't have vaccinations capable of wiping out scourges like smallpox , we would n't have digital cameras , the Internet , ever - faster computers , cars , planes , televisions .
We would n't be able to feed ourselves , support our population , or look ahead to see where our decisions are taking us ... and to see if these decisions are the right ones , and what to do to make them better .
Without imagination , even after all these centuries , we'd have learned nothing .
Science is imagination .
Tip o' the lab coat to Bill Rehm .
Venice was settled originally by refugees fleeing the barbarian hordes — who , apparently , did n’t like water .
But that was then .
This week , Swoon , a 31 - year - old Brooklyn artist whose name is Caledonia “ Callie ” Curry , is leading a waterborne invasion of the Venice Biennale ( she did n’t bother to try to get in officially ) with a crew of 30 artists , musicians , and miscreants in tow .
Though they have raised some $ 150,000 for this crash party , the money wo n’t show in the boats they ’ll travel in , because the boats are made of trash — a symbol of the freedom that comes with radical self - reliance , and one that is meant to effect change .
“ Throughout history , pranksters have been looking at fences and then pushing them aside , ” Swoon has said ( the name came to an ex-boyfriend in a dream , in which he imagined her future as a graffiti artist long before her career began ) .
“ Through action , you can move the perception .
It ’s almost like a magic trick . ”
Swoon and her group are emissaries from a specific underground culture : the bike - riding , Dumpster - diving , anarchist street - art movement that has flourished in Bushwick , Greenpoint , and areas near the Gowanus Canal over the past decade .
On this trip , she ’s joined by a few artists from the Black Label Bike Club , an anarchist bicycle - art group , including Greg Henderson and Ryan Doyle , a six - foot - six sculptor who builds machines that crush cars for rock festivals like Coachella and Amsterdam ’s Robodock gathering .
There are also some gearheads from San Francisco , including “ Chicken ” John Rinaldi , the original guitarist for GG Allin ’s band and , more recently , co-sponsor of a ( failed ) proposition to rename a Bay Area sewage - treatment plant after George W. Bush .
For them , scrounging is a kind of religion , and the boats are an embodiment of that aesthetic .
They ’re not interested in expensive green technologies or recycling programs — the point is reuse , to breathe new life into the city ’s detritus and build a new , separate world from those remains .
“ We ’re not perfect , ” Swoon says .
“ How much jet fuel was used to fly all of us here ?
But we ’re not going to let being imperfect stop us .
If you are too rigid in your ethics , you undo positive action . ”
So , about two months ago , they begin to gather on the coast of Slovenia , about 60 miles from Venice , preparing to unload their 40 - foot containers from New York — except that the containers , sent on a tax - free artist ’s visa , are being held at customs .
Slovenian officials are n’t sure that they ’re not just full of trash , rather than trash that is about to be turned into art .
Almost all of the stuff in there is New York junk : discarded olive barrels from a factory in Queens ; scraps from brownstone - renovation Dumpsters ; cast - off crates used to cover skyscrapers ’
HVAC units , found in a dump in Greenpoint ; materials salvaged by Build It Green ; and dozens of sheets of plywood from a new condo building under construction at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in Dumbo , fork - lifted by an accommodating foreman .
“ In most condos , construction workers lay a sheet of plywood down to form cement , but once it ’s set , they just throw it away , ” says Swoon , smiling .
“ I asked nicely . ”
When constructed , the boats will be about twenty feet high and just as wide , powered by Mercedes car motors that run on biofuel ; the trash materials for two of them are in the containers , but a third , named Old Hickory and inspired by Swoon ’s recent motorcycle trip through India , has to be built from “ found materials ” here in Slovenia , though they ’re finding that the country is oddly devoid of discarded plywood , and that ’s a problem .
New York , on the other hand , is a trash town :
We are weak , we are profligate , and this Brooklyn tribe has reaped our rewards .
“ New York ’s the top of the world , in trash , ” exclaims Swoon , taking a seat at the dinner table in the crew ’s rented house , where they sleep four or five to a room .
( Later , when they run out of money , they will move into their shipping containers . )
“ There ’s no trust - fund babies here , ” snorts one of the crew , who then covertly disses Dash Snow , the art world ’s enfant terrible of just a few years ago .
“ No grandmother on the Upper East Side . ”
“ Manhattan , ” says Iris Lasson , a sculptor .
“ The strange place across the water . ”
“ I do n’t like going there unless I have to pick up a check , ” says Doyle .
Arielle Bier stirs a pot of soup .
“ I go to Manhattan , and money falls out of my pockets , ” she says .
Playing nice has always been Swoon ’s secret :
She ’s like a sweetheart in a John Hughes movie , with a dimpled smile and a mess of curly red hair .
She punctuates most conversations with unexpected squeals and giggles .
The boat project first came to her in a dream :
She was jumping trains around the U.S. when , one night , she saw dogs pulling boats that looked like a crazy , indecipherable city .
“ I was like , What is that ? ” she says .
“ I thought to myself , God , I have to build that thing , so I can see it for myself . ”
The daughter of redneck hippies who gave her the middle name Dance , she moved to Borough Park at 19 , to attend Pratt .
In school , she studied Renaissance - style portraiture , among other forms , but found herself caught up in the late - nineties rush of post - aerosol street art : stickers , culture - jamming , covering ads with art , “ thinking about public space , how we can make our city our own while real - estate developers suck up the coasts , ” she explains .
She became quite rigid in her own ethics :
She joined groups like Grub , which provides free Dumpster - dived dinners in Brooklyn , and founded the Toyshop collective , known for instigating outrageous happenings like marching through the Lower East Side with 50 people playing instruments made out of junk .
In 2002 , she started making elegant life - size portraits in her apartment with wood - block prints , then wheat - pasted a series of them on corners throughout Dumbo and Bushwick .
What she was trying to achieve was “ the momentary intersection of the paste - up on the wall and the pedestrian whose eye it catches , ” she has said , “ a moment of recognition , a wink from another human presence which is there but not there , like a little reflection of self embedded in the wall . ”
Though she still works on the street , she ’s never been arrested .
“ I think because I do portraits , and because I ’m all about it , people realize that I ’m only trying to bring something beautiful to their neighborhood and leave me alone , ” she says , giggling .
“ Also , it helps to be a woman . ”
By 2005 , MoMA was collecting her work , and Jeffrey Deitch started representing her .
“ There are artists who are products of Yale , with nice studios , fancy materials , and assistants , and I respect that , but really , all you need is your determination and your spirit , ” says Deitch .
“ A lot of her friends are freegans !
I said , ‘ What ? ’
They live without money :
You can always get free secondhand clothes , hitchhike , find a place to crash . ”
In the art world , Swoon is considered a gifted technician but also a leader .
“ Callie is the Pied Piper , a folk hero , ” says Marsea Goldberg , owner of New Image Art , Swoon ’s West Coast gallery .
Says Jeff Stark , a collaborator on the vessels and editor of a Happenings newsletter , Nonsense NYC , of Swoon ’s rise to prominence : “ We told Callie that now we could get her cabinetmakers .
Now the boats can be perfect , the way she wants them to look , without any right angles , like they ’re held together by gossamer and unicorn snot .
And she said , ‘ No , I want them to look the way they ’ve always looked and make them with all of us . ’ ”
“ New York ’s the top of the world , in trash , ” says Swoon .
This crew is Swoon ’s big punk - rock family , and even though they ’ll likely be broke after this project , they ’ll take care of each other .
“ The culture of eating and building out of Dumpsters is not an endpoint , not what any of us wants to be doing , ” Swoon says .
“ It ’s about living off a bad culture that we wish did n’t exist and making the resources that contribute to that situation no longer available to you . ”
She curls a lock of hair around her finger .
“ You start to build something like these boats , and you ca n’t believe it yourself , but enthusiasm has a way of sparking other people , ” she says .
“ What this project has shown me is that there is no place for pessimistic disbelief in the world ; it ’s just not useful .
Once you ’ve decided to be on the side of audacious wonder , beauty , and joy , you ca n’t go back . ”
There are many unromantic aspects to planning a 30 - person boat trip for two weeks , which is about the time it will take them to sail to Venice from Slovenia , but Swoon lets her tireless project manager , Tianna Kennedy , worry about that .
The boats need to be registered and insured ; the people need to be fed ( onboard , there ’s a “ sack of potatoes ” rule , which means any stowaway who wants to jump on must bring that much sustenance ) .
There are bridges that may be too low for one of the boats to pass beneath , so the top is designed to flip down quickly .
There ’s a great deal of concern about Venice ’s giant rats .
Even in the anarchist world , there is a bit of a hierarchy to the crew , which is divided largely in two — the skilled and unskilled , much as life will be if , or when , the Earth is flooded and everyone must fend for themselves .
Most mornings , the lightly callused set off early in their hot - wired blue bus to scavenge for materials for Old Hickory , the third boat .
( Swoon is considering bringing this boat to a climate - change conference in Denmark this winter : “ We could pull it over the Alps , right , guys ? ” she says , giggling . )
Today , they circle a few piles of junk on street corners before driving to an abandoned warehouse in Koper , a border town with Italy .
They jump a broken window like professionals , in heavy gloves and work boots , one with a bolt - cutter and another with a hammer , an art handler from New York named Kera Blossom quickly tying a kerchief over her face .
Inside , graffiti like NO WORK , NO MONEY and LIVE FREE lines the walls , and the ceiling has collapsed onto the floor .
There are hundreds of floppy - disk boxes , reams of dot - matrix paper , crushed faxes , old telephones , and small plastic boxes ( “ We could sell weed in these , ” one guy jokes ) .
Some aerosol cans lie on the ground ; a few in the crew pierce them quickly , adding their tags to the walls .
A guy holds up a bunch of corks : “ I can use these to plug up my bike ends , ” he says , stuffing them into his pocket .
They pop a skylight out of its frame and take a knife to some herringbone flooring , then cut through a heavy wire fence to the street , so they can move out their winnings .
Just then , Blossom sets off an alarm — they ’ve been spotted by construction workers in the next building .
Within minutes , the cops are outside , but they slip out a side exit , blending back into the street .
It ’s a stroke of good luck , but they ca n’t go back to Swoon empty - handed .
They pull into an open field , with a ravine piled high with rusting cars ( “ Is that our car from the future ? ” Orien McNeill asks , pointing at a crushed blue van ) .
Then they spot them : two flawless four - by - eight planks , worth at least $ 200 in Slovenian Home Depot .
They tie them quickly to the top of the van , along with a rotting surfboard , and are about to rush off when a young Slovenian couple appears .
In broken English , the wife explains that this is the field they use for training dogs and that ’s their plywood .
Eventually , Swoon ’s crew undoes the twine from the top of the car .
“ Callie would n’t have wanted us to take it , ” McNeill says .
In the car , though , they growl about their bad fortune .
She was probably lying , and why did they have to give it back , anyway ?
Finders keepers , that ’s their motto .
It ’s not like Swoon is selling her boats :
This is just art they ’re using to float on the sea , and after Venice , it will be garbage , once again .

At Southwest , a company known for its offbeat sensibility , that story can be as personal as she wants .
That means tweeting about the sunburn she got on a photo shoot one recent afternoon .
Or responding “ yes ” to a man who once asked , “ Am I the only person who thinks Southwest is overrated ? ” Ms. Day added : “ I have a lot of people Twittering about the celebrities they see on flights .
I love celebrity gossip , so I get pretty excited . ” A case in point ?
“ Someone just saw Vanessa Hudgens , ” she said with a giggle .

Dear Abraham , >
Now comes the question of how to map a C++ class hierarchy > into haskell .
>
It seems natural to try to map C++ classes into haskell typeclasses ; > however , there are a few issues involved with that .
You will quickly run into problems when doing that .
The most important problem is that class instances are implicitly exported ( ie. have a global scope ) .
When different C++ classes implement the same methods , you will get unresolvable name clashes in Haskell .
Fortunately , there exists a simple solution to model * single * inheritance object models in Haskell .
It works with using phantom types where we encode the inheritance tree in the phantom type variable .
Here is a quick example .
Suppose we have the following classes : class Window { void Show ( ) ; } ; class Frame : public Window { void SetTitle ( const char* title ) ; } ; class Control : public Window { ... } ; class Button : publice Control { void SetLabel ( const char* label ) ; } ; Every object in Haskell will be represented by a simple " Ptr a " .
The phantom type " a " will encode the inheritance relation , that is , for each class we will create a new " phantom " data type that represents its class ( or its part of the virtual method table ) .
type Window a = Ptr ( CWindow a ) data CWindow a = CWindow Note that we will never use the " CWindow " constructor and that it therefore called a phantom data type .
The " CWindow " type represents the Window class by itself , the " a " type variable represents the classes that may extend it .
type Frame a = Window ( CFrame a ) data CFrame a = CFrame type Control a = Window ( CControl a ) data CControl a = CControl type Button a = Control ( CButton a ) data CButton a = CButton Ok , now that we have encoded the objects and inheritance relationships , we can give the signatures of all the methods : frameCreate :: IO ( Frame ( ) ) buttonCreate :: IO ( Button ( ) ) windowShow :: Window a -> IO ( ) frameSetTitle :: String -> Frame a -> IO ( ) buttonSetTitle :: String -> Button a -> IO ()
The creation function return objects where the type parameter is instantiated to unit ( ) -- indeed such function creates exactly a Frame or Button , but nothing more .
In contrast , a function like " windowShow " has its type parameter uninstantiated as it can receive any kind of window ( any object that derives from a window ) .
This corresponds to the contra-variance rule .
do b <- buttonCreate windowShow b
We can see that the above code does indeed work , the buttonCreate returns a " Button ( ) " that can be passed whenever a " Window a " is expected : Button ( ) == Control ( CButton ( ) ) == Window ( CControl ( CButton ( ) ) ) == Window a Pheew , quite a story .
I hope it helps .

( I think it is published in " the fun of programming " ? ) >
I 'd like to make a haskell binding for a C++ library .
Most I have done this for a upcoming wxHaskell library : a binding to the wxWindows GUI library .
Just as Alastair , I also think that it is better to create ( or generate ) a C interface to the C++ library first , ie .
extern " C " { void object_foo ( Object * self , int arg ) { self -> foo ( arg ) ; } } Furthermore , you probably need to generate dynamic link libraries ( or shared object files ) to link with GHC as the runtime systems of C ( =GHC ) and C++ are incompatible on many platforms .
>
First - it seems natural to use template haskell to do the code > generation .
That way , the library could either write the I would advise against this : it is quite experimental and you would lock yourself into a single implementation .
( I have made that mistake with haskellDB and TREX myself though :-) .
Since you will generate code anyway , you probably have no need for template stuff .
All the best , Daan . >

Despite pie - in - the - sky economic theory , competitively priced , quality products do not always trump those of lesser quality in the marketplace .
A variation of Sony ’s Beta format video was used for decades by professionals because of its superiority to the VHS format , but this did n’t stop VHS from becoming the dominant consumer format .
McDonald ’s does not make food that is cheaper , more nutritious , or even better tasting than a good sandwich from a local deli , but this has n’t stopped the burgermeister from selling untold billions of its artery - clogging offerings .
The US health care system gets arguably fewer positive results per dollar spent than any other health care system in the world , but there are US consumers who will defend it as being “ the best ” right up to their untimely deaths .
The truth is that marketing techniques often trump product value when determining marketplace winners and losers .
The growth of advertising in the late 19th century taught marketers that they could make profitable products that had no value whatsoever .
These included electrical trusses , waistbands , and other devices to improve health , universal medicines that were mostly alcohol mixed with God - knows - what , and “ arctic ” boots guaranteed to produce frostbitten toes for the clueless Yukon prospector .
Breakthroughs in psychology in the 20th century gave marketers powerful new tools for their arsenals .
For instance , they learned that products could be sold while ignoring their real attributes by attaching them to an image .
Cigarettes , a product that tastes pretty much like you would expect burning leaves to taste , could make you so sexy and alluring that people would ignore your tobacco reek .
Rocks could be packaged and sold as pets .
A coonskin cap could make you Davy Crockett , and becoming a fake blonde would make you irresistible to men , while having little or no effect on your intelligence ( or that ’s the claim , anyway ) .
In one sense , nothing has changed much .
A brightly colored , but underpowered , computer can be sold because it ’s been carefully linked to “ cool , ” or a lousy video game can fly off shelves because it ’s based on a popular movie .
There are signs , though , that the days of sizzle counting for more than steak are coming to an end , and the best current example of this may be the Panasonic Lumix DMC - LX3 camera , a product that most traditional marketing departments would consider very difficult to sell , but that is selling so well , in fact , that it is going for up to 50 % over suggested retail price at those few outlets that can manage to keep it in stock .
The reason the LX3 is selling so well is that it is a superior camera for its class .
The marketing issue is that it does not appear to be superior , and therein we have both the mystery and the hope for the quality of future products .
Most of us have walked through consumer electronics stores and seen the compact camera displays .
Generally , there is at least one long row of small cameras , each having a little card next to it with the brand name , model name and number , price , and a few sales points .
Most common among these sales points is the number of megapixels a camera ’s sensor possesses .
There was a time , indeed , when the number of megapixels on a sensor was a pretty fair indication of a camera ’s resolution , which is one of the key factors of image quality .
Early compact electronic cameras had barely enough resolution to make a decent 3× 5 print , so there was a race to pack ever more pixels onto small chips to improve images .
It was true then ( and now ) that a three megapixel camera will almost always outperform a one megapixel one , and a six megapixel camera will make a much sharper image than a camera with only three .
But once one gets above six megapixels , the issue becomes much more complex .
Understanding why is a bit technical , and it ’s the very complexity of the issue that has kept camera marketers trumpeting ever more megapixels — while tolerating ever - decreasing image quality at most settings — to sell their products .
Simply put , consumers have come to equate megapixels with higher image quality even though it is not true , so marketers have forced camera manufacturers into degrading image quality to sell to badly informed camera buyers .
Consumers also seem to like large range zooms of almost telescopic power , not realizing that these relatively slow lenses also work to degrade image quality .
The LX3 bucks this trend and , contrary to expectations , consumers have rewarded it for doing so .
Some Technical Notes
Note : I ’m going to go into a bit of a technical explanation here , and will try to make it as painless as possible .
Those who would prefer to skip the technical part are welcome to read down below this marked section for my conclusions .
The race for ever - more megapixels has an enormous quality drawback .
By their nature , electronic components produce fields that interfere with other electronic components .
Pack too many pixel - sized sensors on a tiny chip , and this interference manifests itself as noise in the final image .
The noise is caused when a number of pixels produce colors ( often white ) that are at odds with the colors they should produce .
The result is a sort of static that is roughly like the grain one can see on high - speed films .
At their lowest sensitivities , when there is the least current or “ gain ” in the electronic sensor , small chips with very high megapixel counts can perform quite well .
When the sensitivity is turned up to account for low light , however , or to allow greater depth of field by closing the aperture or faster shutter speeds to freeze motion or avoid camera shake , the noise increases .
Camera - makers have fought this problem with software that identifies the noisy pixels and guesses at the correct color replacement .
This software inevitably blurs the image until , in some cases , it appears to be almost a watercolor .
As a result , camera manufacturers have tried to set their software to allow some noise in order to maintain sharpness .
The end result is that small - sensor , compact cameras tend to produce poor image quality and / or unacceptable noise at anything above the film equivalent of ISO 400 .
For some cameras , even ISO 400 produces too much noise for acceptable images .
Compounding this problem is the race toward ever - more - powerful zoom lenses for these little cameras .
Zoom lenses tend to be long lenses , and long lenses are a bit like looking down a cardboard tube – they are “ slow ” because they simply admit less light than larger , less zoomy lenses .
So , a camera with a sensor and software that tend to produce poor images in low light is often equipped with a lens that lets in a half to a quarter of the light allowed by cameras with less - aggressive zooms , meaning that it will produce many , many more inferior , noisy images than the “ faster ” lens - equipped camera .
The obvious technical solution is to build compact cameras with larger sensors and / or fewer megapixels than is currently possible , and equip them with large , fast , wide - angle lenses of limited zoom range .
All other things being equal , cameras built this way would produce superior images in more lighting conditions than cameras equipped with small , megapixel - packed sensors and slow , long - zoom lenses .
They would also allow higher shutter speeds and greater control over depth of field in lower - light conditions , giving both more creative control and less possibility of hand - held camera shake .
The obvious marketing solution is to build cameras with ever more megapixels packed onto a small chip , more aggressive software to gloss over the noise , and longer and slower lenses to wow consumers with telescopic range most of them will seldom use , because these things are supposed to be what consumers want and will buy .
Can Internet Product Reviews Overcome Marketing Hype ?
The LX3 uses a larger - than - normal sensor for a compact camera , limiting it to only 10.1 megapixels .
It also uses a fast , 2.0 to 2.8 zoom with a rather limited 35 mm camera equivalent range of 24 mm to 60 mm .
It is also built around a high - quality , Leica lens with minimal barrel distortion for a lens this wide and this small .
It also has a retro , rangefinder look and a manually removed lens cap that is dictated by its fast lens and larger - than - average sensor .
None of these attributes is supposed to make buyers of the average consumer .
So , why is the LX3 flying off shelves for nearly $ 700 in some places , when its suggested retail price is around $ 500 ?
I wish I knew for sure , but I suspect , and hope , that we are witnessing the power of the Internet .
Key “ Panasonic LX3 review ” into google.com , and you ’ll get a list of glowing reviews .
Or just go here for a thorough review or here for an abbreviated review comparing the LX3 to its competition .
If one tracks the pricing history of the LX3 , it ’s clear that the initial pricing curve was what one would expect ; discounting to around 80 % ( $ 400 ) of its suggested retail price within a few weeks of its introduction .
Within a few months , however , large outlets such as Dell , B&H Camera , and other on - line camera stores were sold out , and prices soared .
When I phoned around my metropolitan area for a camera store with the LX3 in stock , I could n’t find a single one .
They all wished they had them because they could sell as many as they could stock , but they ’re sold out and had no idea when they ’ll receive a new shipment .
What could explain the LX3’s phenomenal sales performance other than the power of Internet reviews ?
Based on its design , it appears that they were trying to produce a camera compact enough and with a high - enough quality image to appeal to professionals and serious amateurs who do n’t want to haul around 30 pounds of camera equipment and a tripod everywhere they go .
In other words , the camera is meant to appeal to experts or semi-experrts – not the average consumer .
Panasonic must have expected the product to have limited appeal in a high - end compact market being threatened by a price drop in digital single - lens - reflex ( DSLR ) cameras .
Instead , they ca n’t make enough LX3s to meet the demand .
Have we entered the beginning of an age when information , in the form of product reviews , will be so available to the masses that consumers will start to make better quality buying decisions ?
Will this trend force manufacturers to actually make better products instead of gimmicky devices that sell by fooling consumers ?
Will the promotion - oriented marketers lose power and influence to product development departments ?
We can only hope .
Here are some images taken with the LX3 the day after delivery :
Editor ’s Note : Space limitations prevent us from displaying these images at full size and resolution .
Now , from the same guys that brought you the Katrina rescue effort ..... comes the 9/11 coloring book .
Joking ?
Sadly , no .
Ever get the feeling that that Ron Paul guy might 've been on to something ?
Paul , the libertarian - like congressman from Texas , is n't a big believer in government .
He thinks for the most part the government screws things up .
Just this week , he could point to the Air Force One photo op idea and now there 's this latest gem from FEMA .
Scary
A children 's coloring book called " A Scary Thing Happened " which shows a drawing of the Twin Towers ablaze with an airplane heading for them was removed from its website last week .
The idea behind the downloadable book was to help children cope with disasters , says the organization responsible for it .
So on page 12 , there are three images of the burning twin towers for children to color .
Heckuva
It 's not as though the new FEMA team came up with the idea just this year .
You might guess .
It was put up on the site under Mike Brown 's watch -- 2003 .
And the organization that developed it -- Minnesota 's Freeborn County Crisis Response Team -- still believes in it .
" I stand firm that it was a very well thought - out and useful resource for kids , " Olmsted told FOXNews.com .
" But it 's obviously being misinterpreted by a lot of people . "
Maybe that 's because coloring and 9/11 might not be a good mix for children .
Removed
" The coloring book , which was put online in 2003 , was removed last week and FEMA is currently reviewing all Web content designed and posted by the previous administration , " a FEMA spokesman said in a statement .
Makes no difference to Olmsted .
" I 'm gong to be putting together to FEMA a letter detailing the many ways that this book has been used , " Olmsted told the Minneapolis Star Tribune , adding that she 'll be including a letter she has on file from FEMA praising the book .
If that letter came from Brownie , she might just want to move on ...
Blogosphere
Not everyone agrees with the decision to pull it down .
The conservative PowerLine blog sees this as a troubling trend .
" It is n't hard to see where this is going .
It started with the television networks imposing de facto censorship on all footage of the September 11 attacks .
The pace of revisionism is accelerating as Obama 's executive branch reviews everything produced by " the previous administration . "
Eventually the only public legacy of the September 11 attacks will be photos of American soldiers brutalizing detainees . "
But a blogger on the conservative Lew Rockwell website says the government is too " obsessed " with 9/11 .
" Is it that they want to keep the " fear " factor ever - present in the sheeple 's minds ?
After people complained , FEMA removed the coloring book from its site .
Too bad we can't remove FEMA from our sight . "

In a speech yesterday at the Heartland Institute , Sen. James Inhofe ( R - OK ) laid out the GOP strategy for dealing with the potential EPA regulation of greenhouse gases .
Inhofe said that Republicans plan to stall until they get a new president , which means that Republicans might be willing to stall for the next seven and a half years .
Here is the video :
Inhofe said , “ Do n’t be distressed when you see the House passes some kind of cap - and - trade bill .
And you know it could be worse and she could still pass it , so it ’ll pass there .
The EPA has threatened to regulate this through the Clean Air Act .
That is n’t going to work in my opinion because we can stall that until we get a new president – that should n’t be a problem .
The House will pass the bill .
In the Senate they are not going to be able to pass it . ”
Advertisements
How can Inhofe be so sure that it wo n’t pass the Senate ?
He can be certain because centrist Democrats a.k.a.
Democrats in either Red or coal / auto producing states are already lining up in opposition to the bill .
Eight Senate Democrats , Robert Byrd , Blanche Lincoln , Mary Landrieu , Carl Levin , Evan Bayh , Ben Nelson , Bob Casey Jr. , and Mark Pryor , already opposed using reconciliation to pass cap and trade .
Even if Democrats get to 60 votes in the Senate , they still wo n’t have enough support to pass the current bill .
This is an issue that will likely be resolved with a compromise .
If the Republican strategy is to wait Obama out , they run the risk of Obama outlasting them .
The problem with the strategy of stalling Obama is that the GOP may continue to get crushed in elections while they wait .
The GOP ’s stall tactics are more evidence that this party is devoid of ideas , and hoping to win through obstruction .

Isabelle Dinoire , who underwent a face transplant three years ago , has said that it was not easy getting used to life after the operation
The Frenchwoman who underwent the world ’s first face transplant has said she is still struggling to come to terms with her looks .
( PICS )
Isabelle Dinoire admitted that three years on from the medical breakthrough , she remained uncertain as to whose face she looked at in the mirror every day .
Referring to the dead donor , Miss Dinoire , a 41 - year - old divorced mother of two from northern France , said : “ It ’s not hers , it ’s not mine , it ’s somebody else’s .
“ Before the operation , I expected my new face would look like me but it turned out after the operation that it was half me and half her . ”
She said she had not yet worked out her new identity , adding : “ It takes an awful lot of time to get used to someone else ’s face .
It ’s a peculiar type of transplant . ”
Such psychological difficulties will concern British medics from the Royal Free Hospital in London who have been given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out the world ’s first full face transplant .
Surgeons have been transplanting livers , kidneys and hearts for many years , but faces have always been different .
They are seen as a sacred , untouchable parts of a person ’s identity .
Unlike other organs , face transplants are not life - saving operations .
As a result , ethical committees frequently blocked them from going ahead .
But the face transplant surgeon , Jean - Michel Dubernard , said after carrying out the operation : “ Once I had seen Isabelle ’s disfigured face , no more needed to be said .
I was convinced something had to be done for this patient . ”
Miss Dinoire , from Valenciennes , northern France , was given a new nose , mouth and chin at the nearby Amiens Hospital in November 2005 .
She was rushed to hospital after her pet dog apparently ripped off the vital features .
Miss Dinoire herself had no memory of what happened .
After taking sleeping pills , all she could remember was waking up with blood on the ground .
When she tried to light up a cigarette , she realised her facial features were missing .
In spite of some early signs of immune rejection , Miss Dinoire soon regained sensation back in the transplanted face .
Rejection of the new tissue was brought under control by increasing the doses of immunosuppressant drugs , which Miss Dinoire is till taking .
Miss Dinoire made her latest comments in an exclusive interview with the journalist Vanessa Pontet on Reporters , a programme about face transplants broadcast on French channel NT1 .
Despite her worries about the identity of the new face , Miss Dinoire admitted that technically at least , “ it ’s mine ” .
She added : “ It ’s part of me .
I have the feeling of looking at something beautiful , I accept looking at myself now , but it was was n’t easy at the beginning . ”
She said she had lots of physio to reactivate the muscles and everything was back to normal as far as sensitivity was concerned .
Saying that face transplants should not be a taboo subject , Miss Dinoire said : “ It ’s important to get people to think about it because it completely changes your life . ”
“ There is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day , ” said Dr. Laurent Lantieri , one of the French doctors who operated on a man severely disfigured by a genetic disease .
In an issue of the British medical journal Lancet , Lantieri and colleagues reported on their patient ’s status one year after the transplant .
Chinese doctors also reported on their patient , two years after his surgery .
Last year , the French team operated on a 29 - year - old man with tumors that blurred his features in a face that looked almost monstrous .
They transplanted a new lower face from a donor , giving the patient new cheeks , a nose and mouth .
Six months later , he could smile and blink .
The Chinese patient had part of his face ripped off by a bear .
Surgeons in Xian gave him a new nose , upper lip and cheek from a donor .
After a few months , he could eat , drink and talk normally , and returned home to Yunnan province in southwest China .
The patients were not identified although photos were included in the reports .
As is the case with all transplants , doctors use immune - suppressing drugs to prevent the recipient ’s body from attacking the donated tissue .
In both face transplants , the patients started rejecting the transplanted tissue more than once .
Their doctors solved the problem by juggling their medications .
The French patient now takes three pills a day to prevent rejection .
“ That ’s less than most people with diabetes , ” said Lantieri , a plastic surgeon at the Henri Mondor - Albert Chenevier Hospital in suburban Paris .
Other doctors were reassured by the results .
“ To be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly , that is encouraging , ” said Dr. Bohdan Pomahac , a plastic surgeon at the Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston .
Pomahac has permission to do a face transplant in the U.S. , as do doctors at the Cleveland Clinic .
Experts have worried that if patients take lifelong anti-rejection drugs after a transplant , their cancer risk will jump .
Some also predicted that rejection would destroy the face within a few years .
Those fears seem to have been allayed , Pomahac said .
With three successful partial face transplants so far – including the world ’s first on a woman whose face was bitten off by a dog in France – doctors say that some of the surgery ’s initial uncertainties , like how functional the new face would be , are being answered .
For example , Lantieri ’s patient ’s face was paralyzed by tumors for more than a decade .
The French team was n’t sure if nerves could grow after the transplant .
But they discovered later their patient could blink , proving the brain was able to restore long - forgotten facial nerve connections .
Not everyone is convinced that face transplants are so revolutionary .
Dr. Patrick Warnke , a plastic surgeon at the University of Kiel in Germany , calls them a “ dead - end road , ” because he does n’t think the rejection problem can be solved .
Instead , he hopes to re-grow tissue from patients ’ own stem cells .
Still , the biggest obstacle to more face transplants may not be scientific , but social .
“ When kidney transplants first began , people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural , social and religious issues , ” Pomahac said .
“ This is exactly the same scenario now . ”
Doctors plan to do more face transplants , but are having a hard time finding donors .
“ Everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured , ” Lantieri said .
“ The real question is , would you be a donor , or would you allow your family member to donate their face ?
That is the answer we need to change . ”

The fate of Iran rested last night in a grubby north Tehran highway interchange called Vanak Square where – after days of violence – supporters of the official President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at last confronted the screaming , angry Iranians who have decided that Mirhossein Mousavi should be the president of their country .
Unbelievably – and I am a witness because I stood beside them – just 400 Iranian special forces police were keeping these two armies apart .
There were stones and tear gas but for the first time in this epic crisis the cops promised to protect both sides .
" Please , please , keep the Basiji from us , " one middle - aged lady pleaded with a special forces officer in flak jacket and helmet as the Islamic Republic 's thug - like militia appeared in their camouflage trousers and purity - white shirts only a few metres away .
The cop smiled at her .
" With God 's help , " he said .
Two other policemen were lifted shoulder - high .
" Tashakor , tashakor , " – " thank you , thank you " – the crowd roared at them .
This was phenomenal .
The armed special forces of the Islamic Republic , hitherto always allies of the Basiji , were prepared for once , it seemed , to protect all Iranians , not just Ahmadinejad 's henchmen .
The precedent for this sudden neutrality is known to everyone – it was when the Shah 's army refused to fire on the millions of demonstrators demanding his overthrow in 1979 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet this is not a revolution to overthrow the Islamic Republic .
Both sets of demonstrators were shouting " Allahu Akbar " – " God is Great " – at Vanak Square last night .
But if the Iranian security forces are now taking the middle ground , then Ahmadinejad is truly in trouble .
As the fume - filled dusk fell over the north Tehran streets , the crowds grew wilder .
I listened to a heavily bearded Basiji officer exorting his men to assault the 10,000 Mousavi men and women on the other side of the police line .
" We must defend our country now , just as we did in the Iran - Iraq war , " he shouted above the uproar .
But the Ahmadinejad man trying to calm him down , shouted back : " We are all fellow citizens !
Let 's not have a tragedy .
We must have unity . "
Clearly the decision of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to instruct the Council of Guardians to recount Friday 's election vote had done nothing to dispel the suspicion and anger of the reformist opposition in Iran .
First it appeared that the council would examine every election result .
Then only a few .
Then Iranians were told that it might take 10 days to learn their decision .
It was as well , perhaps , that Ahmadinejad had flown to Yekaterinburg for the Shanghai summit to bore conference delegates with his speeches instead of the Iranian people whom he believes he represents .
But on Vanak Square last night , all this meant nothing .
Plain - clothes cops – perhaps at last realising the gravity of a situation which their own obedience to Ahmadinejad 's men had brought about – persuaded middle - aged men from both sides to meet in the centre of the road in the middle of Vanak Square 's narrow no - man 's - land .
The Mousavi man , in a brown shirt , placed his hands around the arms of the bearded Iranian official from the Ahmadinejad side .
" We can not allow this to happen , " he told him .
And he tried , as any Muslim does when he wants to show his desire for trust and peace , to kiss the side of his opponent 's face .
The bearded man physically shook him off , screaming abuse at him .
The two rows of police were now standing shoulder to shoulder , their linked arms holding both mobs back , as they stared at their own comrades opposite with ever increasing concern .
An American - Iranian a few metres away , shouted at me in English that " we 've got to prove they can't do this anymore .
They can't rule us .
We need a new president .
Either they get their way or we get ours " .
It was frightening , the absolute conviction of these men , the total refusal to accept any compromise , one side demanding obedience to the words of Ayatollah Khomeini and loyalty to the ghosts of the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war , the other – emboldened by their million - strong march on Monday – demanding freedoms , albeit within an Islamic Republic , which they had never had before .
Maybe they now have the police on their side ; if last night 's example was anything to go by , either some senior officer – or perhaps the cops themselves , appalled at their behaviour over the past four days – decided that the special forces would no longer be patsies to the frightening power of Ahmadinejad 's ever - loyal bullies .
Only hours earlier , seven men killed by the Basiji at the end of Monday 's march , were secretly buried by police in Cemetery 257 , a large graveyard close to the Khomeini shrine , where the founder of the Islamic Revolution lies beneath a mosque of golden cupolas and blue - tiled walls .
No such honours for the seven victims of the Basiji .
They lay beneath a covering of earth , no markers on their graves , no word sent to their families of their fate .
But the pro-government newspapers in Tehran did report their deaths and one even gave its front page to the outraged condemnation of Tehran University 's Chancellor at the Basiji intrusion onto the campus on Sunday night , when the security forces killed seven young men , wounded several others and smashed and looted the university dormitories .
Farhad Rabar said he would pursue the killers through the courts , adding that " the invasion of the University of Tehran , which is the symbol of higher education ... has caused a wave of sorrow and anger in me " .
Is it too late to end this fratricidal violence now ?
For each side , the integrity of their cause is fast becoming more powerful than rational dialogue .
The freedom which Mousavi 's supporters have tasted – to ignore and disregard and despise the clerical autocracy which has so humiliated them – is now so intoxicating that they are confronting their political enemies in the street with a strange , unnerving , but genuine humour .
At one point last night , men and women wearing the green ribbons of Mousavi 's election stood on the pavement beside that chilling 100 metres of no -man 's - land next to chadored ladies clutching the Iranian flag – Ahmadinejad 's patriotic symbol .
They even chatted about the outcome of this fearful confrontation between their two sides .
It was a different narrative three hours earlier when Ahmadinejad 's men and women held their own demonstration in Val -y - Asr Square .
No word was said of Monday 's opposition mass rally , nor of the street demonstrations in the cities of Shiraz , Mashad , Babol and Tabriz .
Indeed , most Iranians have no knowledge of these events ; Ahmadinejad 's censors have seen to that .
The banners were predictable .
" Death to the Traitor " – Mousavi , of course , was the " betrayer " of the Republic .
" Death to anyone who is against the Supreme Leader " – which was a bit odd because neither Mousavi nor his millions of supporters are against Ayatollah Khamenei ( albeit that the two men dislike each other ) ; it is Ahmadinejad for whom they have a visceral hatred and whom they are trying to depose .
The former parliamentary speaker , Gholamali Haddadadel , spotted Mousavi 's weakest argument when he addressed a crowd that could not have been more than 5,000 strong .
" Does Mousavi know how many people voted for Ahmadinejad in the rural areas and in the villages ? " he asked .
" Iran is not just Tehran .
We know that Mr Mousavi got 13 million votes , but Mr Ahmadinejad got 24 million . "
But of course , those are the very statistics which Mousavi and his allies dispute .
Preachers and Sayads lectured the little multitude , their bodyguards – even paramedics – keeping careful watch over them .
There was a famous Iranian religious singer to preach to this banner - shrouded audience .
It was on my way out of Val -y - Asr that I noticed a truckload of men , all dressed in camouflage trousers and white shirts , many carrying police clubs , setting off to north Tehran .
They were followed by the newly energised Islamist demonstrators , off on the four - mile trek up to Vanak .
Two conscript soldiers were standing amid the Mousavi supporters there when an old man asked their advice .
Should he stay if the Basijis break through the cordon ?
" The Basijis beat people hard – very hard , " one of the soldiers said .
And he patted the old man on the shoulder and shook his head .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The combination of cancer drugs Tarceva and Avastin delayed the worsening of advanced lung cancer following chemotherapy longer than Avastin alone , according to results from a clinical trial .
The study was designed to test Tarceva as a so - called maintenance therapy to help delay progression of the disease following successful chemotherapy treatments .
Tarceva , which is co-marketed by U.S. biotech company OSI Pharmaceuticals Incand Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG , is currently approved to treat advanced lung cancer after at least one prior therapy has failed .
“ It ’s fairly unequivocal in my mind that the Avastin / Tarceva combination is superior to either agent alone , ” Dr. Vincent Miller of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center and one of the study ’s lead investigators said in an interview .
In the 768 - patient Atlas study , there was a 29 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression for those patients treated with the Tarceva / Avastin combination compared to those who received Avastin plus a placebo , according to data presented Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) meeting in Orlando , Florida .
The median progression - free survival -- the time it took for the cancer to get worse in half the patients -- was 4.8 months for the combination therapy versus 3.7 months for the placebo group , researchers said .
The study was halted early because the improvement in efficacy found in the Tarceva group was deemed to be statistically significant .
It remains to be seen how investors will view the results given the modest 1.1 - month difference in progression - free survival seen with the expensive combination therapy .
“ Anything more than a month warrants attention and will lead people to consider this strategy in treating their patients , ” Miller said .
OSI Chief Executive Colin Goddard recently said approval as a maintenance therapy could add $ 500 million to annual U.S. Tarceva revenue , more than doubling sales of the oral biotech medicine .
Tarceva , known chemically as erlotinib is expected to compete with Eli Lilly and Co ’s Alimta as a maintenance therapy following successful chemotherapy .
The Tarceva results will likely be compared to maintenance data presented on the Lilly drug at the ASCO meeting .
A different Tarceva maintenance trial being presented at the ASCO meeting showed a 41 percent advantage over placebo in the time patients live without their disease worsening .
But that study showed only a 1.1 - week difference in progression - free survival , which may have been a statistical anomaly , according to OSI .
Tarceva could be approved for maintenance use in the United States by mid-January of 2010 , OSI said .
No unexpected safety issues arose in the Atlas trial beyond expected levels of toxicity , researchers said .
“ The combination has been extensively studied before , ” Miller said .
“ It ’s well established that this is a pretty safe , well tolerated combination . ”
The next step , Miller said , will be biomarker research to determine just which patients are likely to benefit most from the Tarceva / Avastin therapy .
Avastin , a multibillion - dollar cancer drug known chemically as bevacizumab , was developed by Genentech , which is now fully owned by Roche .

You may already have seen an ominous looking radar and camera perched atop a traffic light in your neighborhood .
And almost all drivers have seen a patrol car cruising a freeway looking for speeders , or a law - enforcement officer standing at the side of a road wielding a radar gun .
But most have yet to see a freeway speed camera , which are common in Europe but currently are operated in just two U.S. states .
Opponents and backers of speed cameras both suggest that eventually speed cameras will become the norm on U.S. freeways .
But just how likely is a nationwide roll - out ?
And what factors stand in the way ?
We take a look .
Sponsoring legislation in Maryland
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law on May 19 Senate Bill 277 , allowing the use of speed cameras in highway work zones and within a half - mile radius of schools , which means that they can be placed on freeways under these conditions .
Maryland is only the second state behind Arizona to codify the use of freeway speed cameras into law .
Hawaii piloted a program but dropped it , and similar programs near San Jose , California , and in southern Florida were dismantled after they were found to be operating outside of state law .
Maryland 's law takes effect on October 1 .
" Maryland is in a unique position , " said Sean Adamec , the governor 's spokesman said .
" A pilot program in Montgomery shows it worked ; it lowered incidences of fatalities , crashing and speeding and made neighborhoods safer .
It 's safer for kids , road workers and it's been shown to work based on evidence .
The point of them is n't to raise money but to catch speeders and that in turn makes neighborhoods safer .

" We would n't propose any tax on motorists traveling at safe speeds .
If it was revenue rising we would 've done it years ago , [ but cameras ] slow people down so they do n't need to levy so many fines .
Of course there is a financial impact to make roads safer with less fatalities , but in the end you can't put a price on the life of a child , " said Adamec .
Fighting legislation in Arizona
Sam Crump , an Arizona assemblyman who is opposed to the speed cameras and has backed legislation to have them removed from the state 's freeways in 2010 , says the main backing for speed cameras within Arizona has come from " senior citizens groups , " but there has been a surprising agreement between his core conservative followers and college students over privacy concerns .
" It 's been the subject of some debate since we introduced it and some legislators have been surprised by the controversy , " Crump said .
" We expect it to come up for a vote in the next couple weeks .
If it fails , we 'll say more power to the people .
But every time [ a freeway speed - camera initiative ] has been up for a vote in any place it has failed . "
Arizona 's former governor , Janet Napolitano , predicted Arizona 's freeway camera system would generate $ 90 million in profit for the state in 2009 , and $ 34 million for the private company that runs it .
Crump , however says the system 's total profit has been in the range of " $ 20 to $ 25 million a year , " which leads him to suggest that speed camera detractors who say it 's only a device to make money could be wrong .
" I caution people that it really is technology in the hands of Big Brother , " Crump said .
" We 've got 70 or so [ freeway speed cameras ] right now , and they 're looking at [ a total of ] 200 . "
Safety at issue
Russ Rader , at the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety , says that , outside of freeways , speed cameras are used in 48 communities nationwide , including in Arizona , Colorado , Illinois , Iowa , Louisiana , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Mexico , Ohio , Oregon , Tennessee , Washington , and Washington DC .
The group 's research shows that photo enforcement " works to slow drivers down .
Cameras do what police officers can't -- enforce speed limit laws 24 / 7 .
Speeding is a major safety problem on our roads .
It contributes to one - third of all crash deaths . "
AOL Autos : Caught at 100 mph : Now what ?
The IIHS found that speed cameras " can substantially reduce speeding on a wide range of roadway types .
Six months after implementation of speed cameras on residential streets and school zones in Montgomery County , Maryland , in 2007 , the proportion of drivers exceeding speed limits by more than 10 mph declined by about 70 percent .
Implementation of a 9 - month pilot program using fixed speed cameras on a busy urban freeway in Scottsdale , Arizona , in 2006 was associated with up to a 95 percent decrease in the odds that drivers would travel more than 10 mph above the posted 65 mph speed limit . "
" The main argument opponents use against camera enforcement is that it can be a cash cow for local governments , " Rader said .
" If you do n't like the idea of sending revenue to your local government , do n't break the law .
It 's hardly unreasonable to expect drivers to stay within 10 mph of the speed limit .
I have an elementary school in my neighborhood , which is bisected by a major commuter road where drivers regularly speed like banshees .
I want those drivers ticketed .
Period .
There are n't enough police officers to do that everywhere . "
Nationwide rollout ?
Newspaper.com 's Richard Diamond , an opponent of speed cameras , says it 's hard at times to weigh which " side " -- opponents of the cameras , or their detractors -- is " winning . "
" There are places where cameras are advancing , and places where they 're retreating , " said Diamond .
" For politicians , the desire is on increase , but whether they can get away with it , that level has gone down . "
He says lawmakers in Wisconsin , Ohio , Montana and Mississippi failed to get a freeway speed camera measure onto a ballot , but points to Maryland as an example of lawmakers ' success .
He says 13 states have specific laws banning freeway cameras , but he sees a natural progression from states using red - light cameras to using freeway speed cameras .
" The biggest issue opponents have is it creates a legal system where you 're presumed guilty without a trial , " Diamond said .
" If a database says you 're a criminal , you are .
Once you let in the cameras it opens the door that this is OK . "
He says protesting freeway speed cameras can be an arduous task .
" Somebody willing to go to the effort for 30 days and grab 20,000 signatures takes dedication . "
Grassroots activism
Todd Kandaris , at Camerafraud.com says his Arizona - based group 's campaign against freeway cameras started late in 2008 and his group 's member numbers have swelled from 100 to about 1500 .
He says the group works to bring attention to the issue through protests and publicity stunts .
" Early on we concentrated on raising awareness and getting attention , [ with ] groups of people getting out there and protesting , " said Kandaris .
" We find that highway overpasses work well .
Thousands [ of motorists ] go by in a given hour , and [ it gets ] lots of media attention .
We demo'd in front of the manufacturer 's headquarters .
Earlier this year we introduced a citizen 's initiative with the secretary of state , attempting to put the issue on the ballot , to let citizens vote on it in 2010 . "
He says the group must collect more than 150,000 signatures by July 2010 to place the issue on the statewide ballot , and is working with groups in Virginia , Louisiana , D.C. , Texas and Ohio .
" Cameras have never withstood a vote of the public , which tells you this is a device used by politicians and corporations to make money .
It 's not like we 're a bunch of evil speeding people , we want traffic control as much as everyone else .
We just think this is just a device to bilk money out of the public . "
Legal standpoint
Sherman Ellison , a California lawyer who fights regular speeding and traffic tickets , says that a key legal issue is the data - gathering system by which driver information is collected by companies and then distributed to law - enforcement agencies , who then issue the citation to the car 's driver , or owner ( which varies by state ) .
AOL Autos : Learn what cops are thinking when they pull you over
" If you were driving down the street and ran a red light and an officer pulled you over he'd write a ticket for failing to stop , " Ellison said .
" He would have visually observed [ the offense ] and you 'd either plead or go to trial , where you 'd be able to ask him for proof of that .
In the photo context there is no officer , it 's just a camera connected to a laptop , and that system sends that information to a company , whether that 's Redflex or another , that sends data digitally to the contractor .
AOL Autos :
What to do when you get pulled over
" The difficulty in this process is they will crop or enhance these photos or whatever they feel they have to do , for the determination of whether they broke the law .
I demand that they prove this is a true and correct photograph and rarely they 'll go through that process . "
Redflex responds
Cristine Weeks , a spokeswoman for Redflex , an Australian company headquartered near Phoenix that works in tandem with seven other vendors enforcing speed limits nationwide and operates Arizona 's freeway speed - camera system , says several studies -- including those of the IIHS , Arizona State University and the Arizona Department of Transportation -- have demonstrated camera " efficacy and accident reductions . "
She says the Redflex infrastructure was set up without any additional taxpayer funds and that the company contracts with various state and city departments in the same way as a waste - management company would .
The company reported $ 88.2 million in revenue for its global operations in 2008 -- and an annual increase of 43 percent in U.S. traffic revenues from $ 44.3 million to $ 63.3 million -- and an operating profit of $ 10.6 million .
She says the company 's data - gathering process involves analyzing digital still images as well as streaming video , and that the company performs a quality check of any images before sending them to law - enforcement officers , who review all of the evidence before authorizing any citation .
" Nothing is changed on the image .
They are not ' Photoshopped , ' " Weeks said .
" It is impossible to ' shop in a light system .
In the early days it was a question many wanted to know .
[ But ] the agencies are walked through to see how the process works , and a violator can view their own video . "
She says radars similar to mobile - police devices measure a motorist 's time over distance and any breach of the speed limit results in a camera image of the front of the car -- including the driver , and the car 's rear license plate .
She says although Arizona freeway drivers are not levied points on their license for any breach of the law , that as drivers are forced to pay more fines , they become " more aware " of their driving patterns , and modify their driving accordingly .

When asked if she thinks a nationwide system of freeway speed cameras is likely , Weeks offers a cryptic response : " I think , you know , take a look at western Europe , which is 10 to 15 years ahead of U.S. applications . "

About $ 155 billion was invested in 2008 in clean energy companies and projects worldwide , according to a new report out today .
That 's four times a much as the 2004 investment .
Renewable energy , including solar , wind , biofuels and more , accounts for more than 40 percent of power generation capacity added during the year .
The report , Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2009 , was prepared for the United Nations Environment Programme 's ( UNEP ) Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative by global information provider New Energy Finance .
The growth trend has reversed in recent months , however .
Investment in the second half of 2008 was down 17 percent on the first half , and down 23 percent on the final six months of 2007 , a trend that has continued into 2009 , the report states .
The report concludes that governments play a significant role in promoting private investment in renewable energy technology .
" This report highlights the continuing importance of government leadership to ensure that renewable energies , including solar , achieve their potential in weaning us off fossil fuels and addressing climate change , " said Michael Ahearn , President of US - based First Solar .

}}
Where the money went
Of the $ 155 billion , $ 105 billion was spent directly developing 40 gigawatts of power generating capacity from wind , solar , small - hydro , biomass and geothermal sources .
A further $ 35 billion was spent on developing 25 gigawatts of large hydropower , according to the report .
This $ 140 billion investment in 65 gigawatts of low carbon electricity generation compares with the estimated $ 250 billion spent globally in 2008 constructing 157GW of new power generating capacity from all sources .
Despite the global economic slump , investment in clean energy during 2008 topped 2007 's record investments by 5 percent , in large part as a result of China , Brazil and other emerging economies , the report concludes .
" Without doubt the economic crisis has taken its toll on investments in clean energy when set against the record - breaking growth of recent years , " said Achim Steiner , UN Under - Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director .
" Investment in the United States fell by 2 percent and in Europe growth was very much muted .
However , there were also some bright points in 2008 especially in developing economies —
China became the world 's second largest wind market in terms of new capacity and the world 's biggest photovoltaic manufacturer and a rise in geothermal energy may be getting underway in countries from Australia to Japan and Kenya . "
Steiner continued : " Meanwhile other developing economies such as Brazil , Chile , Peru and the Philippines have brought in , or are poised to introduce policies and laws fostering clean energy as part of a Green Economy .
Mexico for example , the Global host of World Environment Day on 5 June , is expected to double its target for energy from renewables to 16 percent as part of a new national energy policy . "

Other highlights
Wind attracted the highest new investment ( $ 51.8 billion , 1 percent growth on 2007 ) , although solar made the largest gains ( $ 33.5 billion , 49 percent growth ) while biofuels dropped somewhat ( $ 16.9 billion , 9 percent decrease ) .
One response to the global economic crisis has been announcements of stimulus packages with specific , multi-billion dollar provisions for energy efficiency up to boosts to renewable energies .
" These ' green new deals ' lined up by some economies , including China , Japan , the Republic of Korea , European countries and the United States contain some serious clean energy provisions .
These will help support the market , " Steiner said .
" However , the biggest renewables stimulus package of them all can come at the UN climate convention meeting in Copenhagen in just over 180 days time , " he said .
" This is where governments need to seal the deal on a new climate agreement - one that can bring certainty to the carbon markets , one that can unleash transformative investments in lean and clean green tech . "
Green Energy Costs Coming Down : Solar Costs Set to Fall 43 percent
The investment surge of recent years and softened commodity markets have started to ease supply chain bottlenecks , especially in the wind and solar sectors , which will cause prices to fall towards marginal costs and several players to consolidate .
The price of solar PV modules , for example , is predicted to fall by over 43 percent in 2009 .
Carbon Markets Continue Upward
Despite the turmoil in the world 's financial markets , transaction value in the global carbon market grew 87 percent during 2008 , reaching a total of $ 120 billion .
Following the lead of the EU and Kyoto compliance markets , several countries are now putting in place a system of interlinked carbon markets and working towards a global scheme under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .
Growth Shifts to the Developing World
On a regional basis , investment in Europe in 2008 was $ 49.7 billion , a rise of 2 percent , and in North America was $ 30.1 billion , a fall of 8 percent .
These regions experienced a slow - down in the financing of new renewable energy projects due to the lack of project finance and the fact that tax credit - driven markets are mostly ineffective in a downturn .
With developed country market growth stalled ( down 1.7 percent ) , developing countries surged forward 27 percent over 2007 to $ 36.6 billion , accounting for nearly one third of global investments .
China led new investment in Asia , with an 18 percent increase over 2007 to $ 15.6 billion , mostly in new wind projects , and some biomass plants .
Investment in India grew 12 percent to $ 4.1 billion in 2008 .
Brazil accounted for almost all renewable energy investment in Latin America in 2008 , with ethanol receiving $ 10.8 billion , up 76 percent from 2007 .
Africa achieved a modest increase by comparison , with investments up 10 percent to approximately $ 1.1 billion .
The Greening of Economic Stimulus Packages
Not surprisingly given market conditions , private sector investment was stalling in late 2008 but government investment looks ready to take up some of the slack in 2009 .
Sustainable energy investments are a core part of key government fiscal stimulus packages announced in recent months , accounting for an estimated $ 183 billion of commitments to date .
Countries vary significantly in terms of investment and the clarity of their measures .
The US and China remain the leaders , each devoting roughly $ 67 billion , but South Korea 's package is the " greenest " with 20 percent devoted to clean energy .
This green stimuli illustrates the political will of an increasing number of governments for securing future growth through greener economic development .
According to Michael Liebreich , Chairman & CEO of New Energy Finance , " There is a strong case for further measures , such as requiring state - supported banks to raise lending to the sector , providing capital gains tax exemptions on investments in clean technology , creating a framework for Green Bonds and so on , all targeted at getting investment flowing " .
" What 's most important is that stimulus funds start flowing immediately , not in a year or so .
Many of the policies to achieve growth over the medium term are already in place , including feed - in tariff regimes , mandatory renewable energy targets and tax incentives .
There is too much emphasis amongst some policy - makers on support mechanisms , and not enough on the urgent needs of investors right now . "
Between 2009 and 2011 UNEP estimates that a minimum of $ 750 billion - or 37 percent of current economic stimulus packages and 1 percent of global GDP - is needed to finance a sustainable economic recovery by investing in the greening of five key sectors of the global economy : buildings , energy , transport , agriculture and water .
2009 and beyond : Climate change , energy security and green jobs
New investments in the first quarter of 2009 fell by 53 percent to $ 13.3 billion compared to the same period in 2008 , reflecting the depth of the global financial crisis , according to the report , which notes " ' green - shoots ' of recovery during the second quarter of 2009 , but the sector has a long way to go this year to reach the investment levels of late 2007 and early 2008 . "
Climate change , economic recovery and energy security will spur far greater investments in coming years , the report concludes .
In particular , the growing understanding that global carbon emissions ( CO2 ) must peak around 2015 to avoid dangerous climate change ( based on the 4th assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- UNEP / World Meteorological Organization ) will make clean energy investments national priorities .
Annual investments in renewable energy , energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage need to reach half a trillion dollars by 2020 , representing an average investment of 0.44 percent of GDP .
These levels of investment are not impossible to achieve , especially in view of the recent four year growth from $ 35 billion to $ 155 billion .
However , reaching them will require a further scale - up of societal commitments to a more sustainable , low - carbon energy paradigm .
With the current stimulus packages now in play and a hoped - for Copenhagen climate deal in December , the opportunity to meet this challenge is greater than ever , even seen from the depths of an economic downturn .
Additional highlights by industry
WIND
Wind attracted the highest new investment ( $ 51.8 billion , 1 percent growth on 2007 ) , confirming its status as the most mature and best - established sustainable generation technology .
Wind 's leading position continues to be driven by asset finance , as new generation capacity is added worldwide , particularly in China and the US .
SOLAR
Solar continues to be the fastest - growing sector for new investment ( $ 33.5 billion , 49 percent growth on 2007 ) , with compound annual growth of 70 percent between 2006 and 2008 .
Solar 's growth reflects the easing of the silicon bottleneck and falling costs , which are expected to decline 43 percent in 2009 .
Solar project financing underwent the most dramatic growth in 2008 , rising 71 percent to $ 22.1 billion .
BIOFUELS
Investment in biofuels fell 9 percent in 2008 down to $ 16.9 billion .
Although the technology is well established , particularly in Brazil , it has suffered for the past two years from over - investment in early 2007 , followed by a fall from grace caused by a combination of high wheat prices , lower oil prices and an increasingly heated food - versus - fuel controversy .
Biofuels technology investment is now focused on finding second - generation / non-food biofuels ( such as algae , crop technologies and jatropha ) : the second half of 2008 saw next - generation technology investment exceed first - generation for the first time .
GEOTHERMAL
Geothermal was the highest growth sector for investment in 2008 , with investment up 149 percent and 1.3 GW of new capacity installed .
The competitive cost of electricity from geothermal sources and long output lifetimes have made this an attractive investment despite the high initial capital cost .
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
New private investment in energy efficiency was $ 1.8 billion - a fall of 33 percent on 2007 - although this figure does n't capture the investments made by corporations , governments and public financing institutions .
The energy efficiency sector recorded the second highest levels of venture capital and private equity investment ( after solar ) , which will help companies develop the next generation of sustainable energy technologies for areas such as the smart grid .
Energy efficiency also attracted more than 33 percent of the estimated $ 180 billion in green stimulus measures .
Regional highlights
EUROPE
Europe continues to dominate sustainable energy new investment with $ 49.7 billion in 2008 , an increase of 2 percent on 2007 ( 37 percent CAGR from 2006 - 2008 ) .
This investment is underpinned by government policies supporting new sustainable energy projects , particularly in countries such as Spain , which saw $ 17.4 billion of asset finance investment in 2008 .
NORTH AMERICA
New investment in sustainable energy in North America was $ 30.1 billion in 2008 , a fall of 8 percent compared to 2007 ( 15 percent CAGR from 2006 - 2008 ) .
The US saw a slow - down in asset financing following the glut of investment in corn based ethanol in 2007 .
Also , the number of tax equity providers fell for wind and solar projects due to the financial crisis .
AFRICA
South Africa -- Feed - in Tariffs Kick Start Green Investment
On 31 March 2009 , South Africa announced ' feed - in ' tariffs that guarantee a stable rate - of - return for renewable energy projects .
South Africa is hoping to spur the sort of investment spurred in Germany and Denmark through feed - in tariff schemes .
Sub -Saharan Africa -- Geothermal Kenya & Sweet Sorghum Ethanol
Elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa , lack of finance is the principal barrier to sustainable energy roll - out .
However , some notable progress was made in 2008 .
In Kenya , a number of investments are underway ; including the continents first privately financed geothermal plant and a 300MW wind farm planned for construction near Lake Turkana .
In Ethiopia , French wind turbine manufacturer Vergnet signed a EUR 210 million supply contract in October 2008 with the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation for the supply and installation of 120 one MW turbines .
In Angola , Brazilian industrial conglomerate Odebrecht set up an Angolan sugar cane processing plant and plans to steer its production from ethanol to sugar when it comes online late next year .
UK - based Cams Group announced plans for a 240 million liter per year sweet sorghum ethanol facility in Tanzania .
North Africa -- Sun and Wind
Renewable energy in North Africa remains focused on Morroco , Tunisia and Egypt , particularly in solar and wind .
Egypt recently announced its expectation that wind farms in the Saidi area will produce 20 percent of the country 's energy needs by 2020 .
Morocco 's government has also outlined plans to meet 10 percent of its power needs with renewable energy sources .
ASIA
China - Asia 's Green Energy Giant
By 2008 , China was the world 's second largest wind market by newly installed capacity and the fourth largest by overall installed capacity .
Between 5GW and 6.5GW of new capacity was installed and commissioned in 2008 , bringing total capacity to 11 GW to 12.5GW .
China became the world 's largest PV manufacturer in 2008 , with 95 percent of its production for the export market .
Some 800MW of biomass power was added in 2008 , bringing the total installed capacity for agriculture waste - fired power plants up to 2.88 GW .
Development of biofuels has all but ground to a halt , mostly due to high feedstock costs .
India - Pressing Need for Grid Improvements and Clean Power Generation
In 2008 the largest portion of new investment in India went to the wind sector , growing 17 percent -- from $ 2.2 billion to $ 2.6 .
Thanks to a supportive policy environment , solar investment grew from $ 18 million in 2007 to $ 347 million in 2008 , most of which went to setting up module and cell manufacturing facilities .
Small hydro investment in India grew nearly fourfold to $ 543 million in 2008 , while biofuels investment stalled and fell from $ 251 million in 2007 to only $ 49 million in 2008 .
Japan - A New Push for Sustainable Energy
In December 2008 , Japan unveiled a new $ 9 billion subsidy package for solar roofs , granting JPY 70,000 ( $ 785 ) / kW for rooftop PV installation .
For the first time in three years , domestic shipments of solar cells rose between April to September ( up 6 percent ) , indicating a fundamental change in domestic solar demand .
Geothermal also seems to be reawakening in Japan , after a twenty - year lull .
In January 2009 , plans for a 60 MW geothermal plant were announced .
Australia - Geothermal and Wind Gaining Support
The Australian government has set up a A$ 500 m ( $ 436 million ) Renewable Energy Fund to accelerate the roll - out of sustainable energy in the country .
A$ 50 million has already been committed to helping geothermal developers meet the high up - front costs of exploration and drilling .
Geothermal is expected to provide about 7 percent of the country 's baseload power by 2030 .
Wind will also benefit from Australia 's new push for sustainable energy , and is expected to provide most of the 20 percent renewable energy by 2020 target .
Other Asian Countries -- Philippines , Thailand , Malaysia
In late 2008 , the Philippine government signed a new Renewable Energy Law , offering specific incentives ( mainly tax breaks ) for renewable generation -- a first for Southeast Asia and perhaps a model for other countries .
Thailand and Malaysia have been talking about introducing renewable energy legislation for some time ; and other countries are planning biofuel blending mandates , similar to those introduced by the Philippines in 2007 and subsequently by Thailand .
LATIN AMERICA
Brazil - World 's Largest Renewable Energy Market
About 46 percent of Brazil 's energy comes from renewable sources , and 85 percent of its power generation capacity thanks to its enormous hydropower resources and long - established bioethanol industry .
Some 90 percent of Brazil 's new cars run on both ethanol and petrol ( all of which is blended with around 25 percent ethanol ) .
By the end of 2008 , ethanol accounted for more than 52 percent of fuel consumption by light vehicles .
Brazil is now moving into wind .
The government has announced a wind - specific auction to take place in mid-2009 , for the sale of approximately 1GW of wind energy per year .
Brazil also has a global leader in renewable energy financing .
In 2008 the Brazilian Development Bank ( BNDES ) was the largest provider globally of project finance to renewable energy projects .
Chile , Peru , Mexico and the rest of Latin America
Brazil accounted for more than 90 percent of new investment in Latin American , but several other countries are looking to implement regulatory frameworks supportive of renewable energy .
Chile 's recently approved Renewable Energy Legislation is responsible for regulating the country 's renewable energy sector , where small hydro , wind and geothermal projects have become increasingly attractive for investors .
It requires electricity generators of more than 200MW to source 10 percent of their energy mix from renewables .
In 2008 Peru introduced legislation that requires 5 percent of electricity produced in the country to be derived from renewable sources over the next five years , including financial incentives such as preferential feed - in - tariffs and 20 - year PPAs for project developers .
Mexico has a non-mandatory target to source 8 percent of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2012 .
However a new national energy plan expected at the end of June 2009 is expected to double that target .
WHISTLER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - Canadian municipal leaders threatened to retaliate against the “ Buy America ” movement in the United States on Saturday , warning trade restrictions will hurt both countries ’ economies .
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities endorsed a controversial proposal to support communities that refuse to buy products from countries that put trade restrictions on products and services from Canada .
The measure is a response to a provision in the U.S. economic stimulus package passed by Congress in February that says public works projects should use iron , steel and other goods made in the United States .
The United States is Canada ’s largest trading partner , and Canadians have complained the restrictions will bar their companies from billions of dollars in business that they have previously had access to .
“ This U.S. protectionist policy is hurting Canadian firms , costing Canadian jobs and damaging Canadian efforts to grow our economy in the midst of a worldwide recession , ” said Sherbrooke , Quebec , Mayor Jean Perrault , also president of the federation that represents cities and towns across Canada .
The municipal officials meeting at the federation ’s convention in Whistler , British Columbia , endorsed the measure despite complaints by Canadian trade officials .
Trade Minister Stockwell
Day told the group on Friday that Ottawa was actively negotiating with Washington to get the “ Buy American ” restrictions removed .
The measure ’s supporters agreed to modify it slightly by suspending implementation for 120 days , in order to give Canadian trade officials and U.S. critics of the “ Buy America ” rules more time to work on the issue .
‘ UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ’
The only Canadian community to enact an anti-“ Buy American ” purchasing rule so far is Halton Hills , Ontario , where a major employer , Hayward Gordon , is worried about losing its access to the United States .
The company ’s water treatment equipment includes parts that are produced in the United States , and critics of the “ Buy American ” rule say that is an example of how the restriction could end up costing U.S. jobs .
“ Leaders in the United States have to understand this could have unintended consequences , ” said Clark Somerville , acting mayor of Halton Hills , which sponsored the measure approved by the federation delegates .
Some Canadian communities complained any retaliation effort could have unintended consequences of its own , including driving up the cost of infrastructure projects being considered to help stimulate Canada ’s economy .
“ We as local officials have a responsibility to get the best possible deal we can for taxpayers , ” said Jim Stevenson , a city alderman in Calgary , Alberta .
Halton Hills councilor Jane Fogal acknowledged the views of Canada municipal officials will likely carry little weight with the American public , but she hoped it would at least make them take notice of the issue .
“ We want Americans talking to Americans , ” she said .
Facebook , fundraising , social networks
Facebook Causes is one of those conundrums in the nonprofit world – it seems like a perfectly wonderful tool for gaining attention for a cause , but there are significant barriers to adopting Causes as an online giving mechanism .
It may appear to be a good solution for the nonprofit seeking new revenue streams : Give !
Where you already spend time online !
Easily !
It ’s viral !
– but very few organizations have figured out how to translate this idea into any type of reliable or significant source of revenues .
I attended two workshops at NTEN ’s annual Nonprofit Technology Conference that addressed Facebook Causes and offered statistics , best practices and guidance .
( I ’ll save summaries from those sessions for another blog post . )
However , what arose out of those sessions was this concept :
Facebook users are not used to giving money on - site ; in fact , it ’s not how they use the site .
Yet .
Facebook users are going to a party , not a fundraisng house party .
Think about it : when you are visiting Facebook online , do you also think , “ I ’m on Facebook and I ’m ready to also give some money while I ’m here … socializing ? ”
Not really .
That ’s what you do at a fundrasing house party , and not at a social event .
Here is how most people use social networks :
I do n’t see “ giving money ” on the list .
However , “ organize with others for an event , issue or cause ” is listed .
Facebook seems ideal for communicating ideas .
Maybe donating money within a social network is closer in nature to clicking on an ad ?
The habits of social network users are one obstacle .
According to emarketer , “ In 2008 , IDC found that 43 % of social network users never clicked on ads , a dramatic difference from the 80 % of other Internet users who did so at least once a year .
Further , 23 % of nonusers who clicked on an ad then made a purchase ; only 11 % of social network users who clicked on ads did the same . ”
When people click on ads , they are interested in making a purchase , or thinking about making a purchase .
When people on social networks click on a Facebook Cause , they may be interested in supporting the cause ( possibly the 43 % cited in the Pew Internet study ) , but not making a donation ( purchase ) to the cause .
According to the session that I attended at NTEN , “ Valuing Online Fundraising , ” only two nonprofits have raised more than $ 100,000 through Causes .
Fewer than 50 nonprofits have raisde more than $ 10,000 .
However , from 2007 to 2008 , the average average amount donated per cause has increased from $ 31.25 to $ 41 .
According to the Causes developer ’s page , the average donation is now $ 45.52 , and there are 155,000 Causes listed ( for 32,000 unique non-profits ) .
According to this article by Allison Fine , only about 8,000 of those Causes have also created a Network for Good fundraising dashboard to raises money for the Cause .
If you take that into account , then the average donation per organization with a Network for Good dashboard is closer to $ 930 .
That shows some signs of improvement .
Which organizations have raised the most ?
Both the Nature Conservancy and Students for a Free Tibet have raised over $ 100,000 , and Save Darfur has raised about $ 80,000 .
I do n’t think any organization should give up on Causes , nor any other social network - based fundraising efforts .
It ’s just that people are socializing on social networks .
They are meeting up with friends and chatting at virtual events or parties online .
They are even making people aware of causes by organizing for a cause ( see chart above ) .
They are n’t , in large part , raising funds on social networks .
Raising funds through social networking is the future – but the Causes application is in no way the “ fundraising house party ” widget that it needs be to raise awareness and funds .
And maybe that is the issue .
Perhaps Causes should to divide itself into an awareness application and a fundraising application .
The expectations are just too high on the part of the nonprofits – that awareness passed along easily through social networks will translate into donations .
This is the same translation challenge on every medium - from email fundraising to offline event organizing .
The difference is that when a nonprofit supporter receives an email from a nonprofit , that person is now acculturated to expecting a donation request .
According to Facebook Causes , “ a cause is an online campaign for collective action that can be started by any Facebook user .
The creator of a cause can champion any issue … like ‘ Support the Berkeley Y.M.C.A. ’
The cause creator conveys the primary goal of the cause in the title they choose and the various fields they can fill out to describe the cause . ”
The offline equivalent would be asking people to take action , such as signing a petition or making a phone call .
It ’s different than asking people directly to give money .
I know the argument : engagement leads to donations .
That is a true fact .
What I ’m arguing is : the expectation is that if one joins a Facebook Cause , the money will follow .
This has more to do with how people want to use social networks than whether or not Causes can raise money .
Engage with your supports on social networks – it will lead to donations .
But right now , those donations are happening where donors are used to donating : from their checkbook , or when led to donate on a website .
adoption barriers , people have to first change their patterns of online behavior .
If your organization is n’t currently trying to raise money through Causes or any other social network fundraising application , it is missing an opportunity .
Two years from now , I predict that online behavior will again have shifted and that social network users will become accustomed to donating through social networks .
Early adopters will be at an advantage in two years ’ time .
They will be the ones that understand best how to utilize Causes to create large fan bases and raise funds …by the time their fans are ready to give regularly online .
It ’s just a waiting game now .
Small Movement in Congress Eyes Campaign Finance Reform
Created : June 04 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen. Richard Durbin ( D - Ill . ) ( WDCpix )
The stories emerge periodically to spark mild scandal : A powerful congressman funnels tens of millions of dollars to his largest campaign contributors .
A White House cabinet nominee steps down over an investigation into his campaign finances .
A seven - term senator is indicted for hiding expensive gifts provided by an oil contractor .
A prominent lobbyist goes to prison for bribing public officials .
In their wake , these episodes are often treated as isolated events — the misguided acts of a few bad apples who overstepped bounds and betrayed public trust .
Yet in the eyes of many lawmakers and campaign finance reformers , they ’re symptoms of a much larger problem : namely , a system of money - in - politics that lends special interests greater sway than individual voters , forces politicians to be fundraisers before legislators , and practically invites occasion for impropriety — or at least the perception of it .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
The result , critics argue , is a symbiosis in which lawmakers grow dependent on the same deep - pocketed special interests they ’re expected to regulate — a technically legal arrangement that nonetheless lends lobbyists disproportionate access and influence , and corrodes public trust in lawmakers ’ motives .
The money - in - politics issue was propelled into the national spotlight during last year ’s general elections , when Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate to refuse taxpayer money since the public financing system was put in place 32 years earlier — a decision that allowed him to raise nearly $ 750 million during the campaign , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Obama at the time said the system was outdated , and he vowed to overhaul it as president .
Requests to the White House for comment on Obama ’s intentions were not returned .
Yet despite a popular sense that money plays too great a role in the process — and despite a recent push from seasoned campaign finance reformers newly energized by the change in administrations — there appears to be little appetite in Washington this year to change how candidates are elected .
Not that some are n’t trying .
In March , a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed legislation to overhaul the way congressional campaigns are financed .
The measure — sponsored by Sens. Richard Durbin ( D - Ill . ) and Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) in the upper chamber , and Reps. John Larson ( D - Ct. ) and Walter Jones ( R - N.C. ) in the House — would allow congressional candidates to access public funds in exchange for disavowing large contributions from individuals , and all contributions from lobbyists .
By providing public funds , the theory goes , the bill would attract candidates who otherwise might not have the resources to run for public office .
By limiting contributions to small sums from individuals , it would prevent candidates from relying too heavily on any one donor or interest group .
Popular candidates would still raise more money than others , — the goal is not to give everyone equal funding , just the opportunity for equal funding .
The real aim , supporters say , is to prevent a minority of wealthy donors from holding excessive sway , perhaps at the expense of everyone else .
“ You can never prevent all money from entering politics , and that ’s not the goal , ” said Josh Zaharoff , deputy director for programs at Common Cause , a campaign finance reform group .
“ The goal is to separate that link between lawmakers and their largest contributors . ”
Yet critics of publicly funded elections maintain that political donations are just another form of speech .
By capping contributions , they say , Durbin et al are stealing First Amendment rights .
In March , the day Durbin introduced the bill , the Center for Competitive Politics , a group formed to fight campaign finance regulation , issued a statement arguing that “ special interests ” and “ public interests ” are one and the same .
“ Our public policies , however foolish or wise they may appear , ” said CCP President Sean Parnell , “ are the natural result of the many often - conflicting interests , perspectives , and priorities of the American public being enacted by elected officials , not some mythical ‘ corruption ’ caused by citizen contributions to candidates that share their values . ”
Yet that argument does n’t fly among campaign finance reformers , who do n’t consider money from corporate - hired lobbyists to fit the “ citizen contributions ” category .
Speaking at a campaign finance forum in Washington last month , Trevor Potter , founding president of the Campaign Legal Center , wondered why , if corporations can’t vote , they should be allowed to give cash to candidates .
“ Who ’s democracy is this anyways ? ” Potter asked .
Highlighting current trends , Common Cause released a report last week revealing that the 18 members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense were responsible last year for directing more than $ 355 million in earmarks to various defense contractors — companies that donated a total of $ 1.3 million to the sponsoring individuals .
Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , who heads the subpanel , alone accounted for $ 166.5 million worth of those earmarks — $ 73.5 million of which went to 13 companies that gave him between $ 58,550 and $ 11,500 each in the last election cycle , Common Cause found .
Earlier in the year , Murtha made headlines when CQ reported that the PMA Group , a defense lobbying firm with close ties to the Pennsylvania Democrat , had secured nearly $ 300 million in 2008 earmarks for its clients — funding requested by no fewer than 104 House members .
Those lawmakers , CQ found , have taken in more than $ 1.8 million in contributions from PMA since 2001 .
The charge from campaign finance reformers is not that the trend constitutes bribery ( which is illegal ) , or even that there ’s a direct cause - and - effect relationship between the contributions and the earmarks ( certainly not one that can be proven ) .
But , they argue , the relationship is still egregious , sending the unsubtle message to voters that money buys influence over even the best - intentioned lawmakers , and those without need not come knockin’ — something Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig calls “ good soul corruption . ”
There are other trends to indicate that the power of money in Washington is only growing stronger .
Since the end of President Clinton ’s term in 2001 , according to Lessig , both the number of lobbyists in Washington and the dollars per hour demanded by those lobbyists have doubled .
The combination , Lessig argues , is good evidence that those dollars are paying dividends .
“ If the price is going up and the supply is going up , then the production must be going up , ” he said at the campaign finance forum , sponsored by the New York University School of Law ’s Brennan Center for Justice .
Researchers at the University of Kansas recently bolstered Lessig ’s theory , finding that multinational firms lobbying for a recently changed tax benefit reaped , on average , a 22,000 percent return on their lobbying investment .
But tales like that one , many experts argue , are just the symptom of a more deeply rooted problem .
“ Lobbyists are not the problem , ” Lessig said .
“ It ’s how campaigns are funded that ’s the problem … We ca n’t afford to ignore this dependency any longer . ”
Under the Durbin - Larson bill , candidates wishing to tap public funds would first have to prove viability by raising a minimum amount of cash from in - state donors , who could give no more than $ 100 each .
Candidates meeting that state - specific threshold would then receive a lump sum for the primary election , and could raise addition funds from individual donors , again not to exceed $ 100 .
For every $ 1 raised in - state , the government would chip in $ 4 .
Primary victors would receive another grant for the general election , again with the stipulation that additional donations could n’t top $ 100 , and again with the enticement of a four - to - one federal match for in - state contributions .
The matching funds would stop flowing at a certain point , but candidates could continue to raise unlimited small donations from individuals .
The bill would also prohibit participating candidates from accepting any donations from political action committees , the groups organized by businesses and ideological groups to influence elections .
Aside from the benefit of lending citizen - voters greater voice in elections , supporters say the reforms would save lawmakers the many hours they spend raising reelection funds .
“ Americans would be shocked if they knew how much time members of Congress and candidates seeking office must spend dialing for dollars and attending fundraisers , ” Durbin said in a statement announcing the proposal .
Some advocates for campaign finance reform argue that the Durbin - Larson proposal would be a step in the right direction , but would n’t fix the problem of special - interest influence altogether .
Bruce Ackerman , professor of law and political science at Yale Law School , is pushing a form of blind trust , in which candidates could accept contributions from anyone , but the donors ’ identities would n’t be known .
The result , Ackerman says , would be that those who donate simply to gain influence would stop doing so , because lawmakers would n’t know who to reward .
“ The only people giving to the candidate [ would be ] those who believe in his principles , ” he said .
With this year ’s congressional calendar filling quickly with controversial proposals like health care reform , a Supreme Court nomination and , perhaps , climate change legislation , even supporters of the campaign finance proposal concede the odds of the bill moving this year are slim .
Also , many lawmakers are reluctant to toy with a system that ’s already treated them well .
“ It ’s always hard to convince Congress members to change the way they got into office , ” said Zaharoff , of Common Cause .
Still , following a historic election year in which more Americans voted than ever before , advocates for campaign finance reform appear as energized as ever to see to it that the voices behind those votes are heard in Washington .
At stake , they say , is nothing less than the legitimacy of the nation ’s claim to representative democracy .
“ What does it matter if millions vote , ” asked Lennox Yearwood Jr. , president of the Hip Hop Caucus , a community outreach group , “ but the election is not fair to begin with ? ”

Imagine that we could make cars , aircraft and submarines as small as bacteria or molecules .
Microscopic robotic surgeons , injected in the body , could locate and neutralize the causes of disease — for example , the plaque inside arteries or the protein deposits that may cause Alzheimer ’s disease .
And nanomachines — robots having features and components at the nanometer scale — could penetrate the steel beams of bridges or the wings of airplanes , fixing invisible cracks before they propagate and cause catastrophic failures .
Iraq and the Gulf on the rocks
While it has n’t received much attention , Iraq ’s relations with two key Arab Gulf states have jumped the tracks over the last week .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has publicly declared that he has given up on trying to reconcile with the Saudis .
Meanwhile , Iraq and the Kuwaitis are in an increasingly nasty spat over the question of compensation claims dating back to the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait .
It ’s gotten to the point that a majority of the members of the Iraqi Parliament are demanding that Kuwait pay compensation to Iraq for allowing U.S. troops to invade Iraq in 1991 !
This is a time for American diplomacy to kick into high gear and try to prevent this from getting out of hand , since U.S. plans to withdraw from Iraq depend at least in part on establishing a sustainable regional security architecture .
First , the Saudis .
Tension between the Saudis and the Iraqi government is nothing new , of course .
The Saudis view the Iraqi government as Shia , sectarian , Iranian pawns ( Maliki , the line goes , is guilty of " driving while Shia " ) , and few of their promises to improve relations — opening an Embassy , forgiving debt , establishing cordial diplomatic ties — have been fulfilled .
At the ill - fated Doha Summit , King Abdullah reportedly refused to even greet Maliki .
Many Iraqis , meanwhile , view the Saudis as " Wahhabis " , supportive of the insurgency and fundamentally hostile to the new Iraq .
Late last week , Maliki publicly declared that " there will be no other initiatives on our part as long as there is no sign from Saudi Arabia that it wants to have good ties . "
The Saudi media has had some angry responses , but not much has happened beyond public recriminations .
Second , the Kuwaitis .
The Iraqi government declared last week that it wanted to close the books on Saddam - era issues with Kuwait .
This came as Kuwait has strongly resisted Iraqi efforts to be released from its Chapter Seven status with the United Nations , which imposes financial compensation and reparations for Saddam ’s invasion .
That opposition , combined with Kuwait ’s continuing — and frankly absurd — refusal to forgive Saddam - era debt , has driven relations to the boiling point .
Iraqis are actually demanding that Kuwait pay compensation for facilitating the 1991 U.S. " invasion " of Iraq ( one can only imagine where that precedent might lead when they start thinking about 2003 ) .
And members of the Kuwaiti Parliament are demanding that their ambassador be withdrawn from Baghdad .
The U.S. really needs to step in and try to dampen down these Iraqi - Gulf Arab pyrotechnics before they get out of hand .
Integrating Iraq into the Arab neighborhood is an important strategic objective , and these public recriminations could set back efforts there by years .
Two leading Saudi journalists — the editor of al - Sharq al - Awsat and the director of al - Arabiya TV — both wrote nearly identical articles today asking what the Arabs were ready to do to help the Obama administration of which they were asking so much .
While they focus more on the Palestinian question ( and they should help on that too ) I ’d say that shifting their approach to Iraq — Kuwait forgiving debt and getting out of the way on the Chapter Seven status , Saudi Arabia establishing normal diplomatic relations — would be a great place to start .
Greyhound is no longer the “ ugly stepchild of intercity transportation , ” said Anne Marie Chaker in The Wall Street Journal .
“ Recession - battered travelers ” are choosing the bus over Amtrak and airplanes to save a few bucks , and the bus lines are upgrading to keep them from defecting come better economic times .
These days , everyone from Greyhound to Peter Pan to upstarts Megabus and BoltBus are offering leather seats , Wi-Fi , and , yes , “ cleanliness . ”
Newbie Amtrak refugees would be wrong to think “ one cheapo coach is the same as the next , ” said Noreen Malone in Slate .
So , here ’s a “ snob ’s guide to bus travel ” — take original “ Chinatown bus ” Fung Wah for value and efficiency , if you can stomach its “ spotty safety record ” ; Greyhound is much nicer than you remember ; and “ my top choice , ” Greyhound ’s BoltBus , is “ the Google to Megabus ’ AOL , ” offering tech “ connectedness ” to young professionals .
Whichever bus you take will have the advantages of flexible schedules , better prices , and no airport security , said Jamie Rhein in the travel site Gadling .
But you have to pack differently .
Bring a neck pillow , socks , water , music , fresh fruit and other snacks , and a light blanket .
Other tips : sometimes getting bumped to an overflow bus is a good thing , and " best of all , enjoy the scenery as you roll by . ”

CNN NEWSROOM
Security Guard Shot at Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C. ; Obama Schedules Town Hall Meeting in Wisconsin
Aired June 10 , 2009 - 14:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
KYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : All right .
Apologize for that .
That 's obviously not Maria .
But Ed Henry , I know you were able to -- you saw her again and were able to bring her in for a live shot .
Maybe she can give that account now on camera about what she saw .
HENRY : She can .
That 's right .
I have Maria here .
She lives here in the United States .
Some of her relatives are here visiting from Puerto Rico .
So they were going to the museum .
Describe what you saw , Maria .
MARIA : Well , we were in the " Remember the Children " exhibit .
We were just exiting and we heard shooting .
I ran towards the glass doors to see what was going on .
I thought it was a joke or something .
And there I could see a security man pull out his gun and shoot towards the shooter .
I also saw another security man on his belly .
There was blood everywhere .
So I did n't actually see him get shot , but I saw that he was badly hurt and he did get shot .
HENRY : And then you saw some of the return fire from the security personnel ?
MARIA : Yes , it hit the security man .
I am not sure where , but he was flat on his back .
HENRY : Do you remember what floor -- is that the second floor ?
MARIA : We were on the second floor , right where " Remember the Children " was .
I could see a few other security people there .
HENRY : And describe the scene .
How many people were around the security personnel ?
Were there people near where the gun shots were being fired ?
MARIA : No , people ran as far away as possible .
They were running towards me , towards the " Remember the Children " exhibit .
People were on the floor .
No one was standing up .
No one dared move .
We were all very scared .
Finally , I ran back towards where my grandparents were to see if they were OK .
And there we stayed until further instructions on how to go from the building , just exit the building safely .
HENRY : And so were you able to ascertain -- you said that it appeared that the one security guard who had been shot described -- it sounded like it was a bad scene .
MARIA : It was , just terrible .
I looked back , and what I saw from , there was already a lot of blood on the floor .
It was just heartbreaking , because I spoke to a security guard earlier who was very friendly .
And it just hurts to see him just fall , yes .
HENRY : And so was this near where some of the metal detectors were and entry point to the museum ?
MARIA : I was n't close enough to see , but they were shooting towards the entrance of the museum .
So I am assuming that they were .
They were heading towards there .
All the security guards were running towards the entrance of the museum .
HENRY : And so this children 's exhibit you were talking about where you were is close to that , and so that is close to the front of the museum that 's on the 14th Street side ?
MARIA : Yes .
You go up the stairs and there it is .
It 's outside of the actual museum .
You do n't go inside .
You wait outside in the lobby to wait for you to enter the museum , the actual Holocaust Museum .
HENRY : And did you see the original shooter ?
You said that there were shots fired by the security personnel , return fire .
Did you see him get hit ?
MARIA : No , I did n't actually see him get hit .
I already ran to the back .
I did n't want to be near the entrance anymore .
HENRY : And when we say " him , " did you get an idea of what he looked like , how old he was ?
MARIA : No , not at all .
I just ran from the building as fast as I could .
I did n't want to stay to look .
I really did n't .
HENRY : OK .
And did you get any sense of what weapon the original shooter had ?
There were some reports of a shotgun or something like that .
Were you able to ascertain that ?
MARIA : From what I heard , it did not seem -- it sounded like a handgun , like the ones that the security guards had .
It was n't very loud .
I thought that the security guards were just shooting , but then I know that they were shooting at someone .
So it sounded like a small gun .
It did not sound very loud .
It sounded like the ones that the security guards -- almost the same as the ones the security guards were shooting .
HENRY : OK , so a very dramatic scene you 're talking about that played out .
Describe what other people -- you seem to have stayed pretty calm through all this .
I have heard other eyewitnesses say there were some screaming , there was some -- describe the scene .
MARIA : Oh yes .
There was chaos everywhere .
People were running towards me trying to get into the " Remember the Children " exhibit , because that 's the place that people were on the floor .
Everyone was trying to just stay calm and exit the building .
I actually was too busy to see where my grandparents were to really care what was going on .
HENRY : And your grandparents are sitting right near us and they are well .
MARIA : Yes , they are well , thank God .
I was just trying to see where they were and make sure they were OK .
HENRY : OK .
And then describe -- some eyewitnesses say that then the security personnel , once they accounted for people in the building , told some people to start running , clear the scene .
Describe that .
MARIA : Yes .
They were like " Run. Run . "
As soon as they knew there was a clear way for us to go , " Run and do not stop .
Do not look back . "
I tried to go back for my grandparents .
They were like , " Just go .
Just go .
We 'll take care of it .
Just go .
Get out of here . "
So , yes -- so ...
HENRY : OK .
And then what happened once you got outside the building ?
Because when we got there , we have now been pushed a full block away towards the Washington Monument .
Describe the scene out on 14th Street once you cleared the building .
MARIA : All the people that worked in the museum were like , " Get away from the museum as much as possible .
Get on the lawn . "
They were pushing people to get on the lawn .
From the lawn , they told us to even go further from there .
They just -- and they actually told us to turn our backs towards the museum at one point .
If you are going to stay there , turn your backs off the museum .
It was just , " Get out , get away , get away . "
That 's the main goal .
HENRY : Do you live here in Washington ?
Have you been to the museum before ?
MARIA : Yes , I have been to the museum , actually .
And I just took my grandparents there for the first time .
So , yes .
HENRY : Yes , obviously a very harrowing scene .
You seem to have stayed very calmly .
Appreciate you spending so much time with us explaining what you saw .
MARIA : No problem .
No problem .
HENRY : So you heard it right from Maria .
She was there on the scene .
Obviously , it sounds like a very tragic scene in terms of the security officer -- we do n't have a name yet -- who was down , as Maria describes it , face down , bleeding profusely amid the back - and - forth gunfire in trying to stop this shooter .
A very chaotic scene in there -- Kyra .
PHILLIPS : All right .
Ed Henry there in front of the Holocaust Museum for us .
Ed , you had actually a chance not to talk to Maria , who had some pretty incredible testimony there , but you talked to other eyewitnesses , and they were able to confirm they heard five shots .
We have now been able to confirm one security guard shot , transported to the hospital .
The alleged gunman shot , transported to the hospital .
Have you learned anything else about the confrontation between the gunman and security , if the gunman said anything or was there any type of demands made , or anything when he entered that museum ?
Does Maria by chance know if the gunman said anything ?
HENRY : That 's a really good question .
If I could ask you one more question , Maria -- I have not in my reporting been able to determine whether or not the shooter said anything as he entered the building .
Did you hear -- what was going on ?
Was the shooter saying anything while they were shooting at him ?
MARIA : All I heard was , like , a very angry yell .
I 'm not sure if it was from the shooter .
There was just a very angry yell coming out from the entrance .
That could have been the shooter , but I did n't see him , so I 'm not sure if it was him .
But it was just angry .
HENRY : He was n't airing any grievances or anything that you could hear ?
MARIA : No , not at all .
HENRY : And what were the security personnel -- were they saying , " Drop the weapon , " things like that ?
MARIA : Yes , they were like , " Get on the floor !
Drop the weapon !
Drop the weapon ! "
Once he did n't respond , they started shooting .
HENRY : OK .
MARIA : Yes .
HENRY : Thank you again , Maria .
So you hear -- that 's the best we can determine right now , are from the eyewitnesses .
We 're still trying to get more information from law enforcement on the scene .
As you know in Washington , there are many layers of law enforcement from the Metropolitan Police Department , Secret Service police , Park Police , because this is a U.S. Park Police area here , right around the Washington Monument .
You can still hear the siren around me of various law enforcement personnel overlapping authorities , responding to this scene , trying to blanket the scene .
You can still hear this park police helicopter flying over me as well .
That has been on the scene throughout .
In addition to , of course , all the media descending upon the scene , a lot of tourists who saw something , heard something .
We 're talking to them and a lot of other people who were nearby and are just trying to figure out exactly what happened .
So , we 're trying to get more information from law enforcement .
We are expecting more press conferences and updates , so that 's what we 'll work on next -- Kyra .
PHILLIPS : Got it .
Keep working your sources for us , Ed. I 'll kind of recap for our viewers .
Let me know as soon as you have something .
I am also being told the police chief there on the scene now .
Here 's some pictures coming to us , live pictures , actually , from our affiliate WJLA there in Washington , D.C .
The mayor on the scene .
The police chief on the scene .
You can see Mayor Fenty right there with his hand on his chin , obviously talking with law enforcement , and also it looks like some reporters there trying to get word with him as well .
We are following these live pictures .
Let me bring you up to date until we hear from the mayor , from the police chief , from anybody else there at the scene .
This has been going on for a little more than an hour right now .
We got word that there was possibly a shooting at the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C.
We have now been able to confirm that .
A shooting did , indeed , take place .
We were able to hear from Sergeant David Schlosser .
He 's with the U.S. Park Police .
He gave a news conference just a few minutes .
Here is what happened .
A man entered the museum either with a rifle or a shotgun .
At this point , police say it was just described as a long gun .
He entered into the museum .
They 're not sure if he went through the metal detectors or not .
And immediately , gunfire erupted .
According to police , the gunman opened fire on one of the armed security guards there at the museum .
You heard from 19 - year - old Maria .
She was a witness there inside the museum .
She said she heard the security guards demand that that gunman put his gun down .
When he did n't do that , they opened fire .
Then , once that exchange happened , one or more additional security guards returned fire on the gunman that opened fire on the one security guard that was shot and dropped to the floor .
Someone that -- one of the eyewitnesses
Ed talked to actually saw on the floor bleeding profusely .
And we were able to confirm that that security guard , in addition to the gunman , were transported to George Washington University Hospital .
Do not know the condition of those two at this time .
Another man was injured , possibly by some glass that was shattered when that shooting happened .
There was reports possibly of a suspicious package somewhere as well .
That has not been confirmed .
But Sergeant Schlosser said that they are looking into that information .
Live pictures now from our affiliate WJLA , one of our other affiliates there in D.C.
You can see all the response -- the ambulances , the police cars .
The fire department also there on the scene .
The museum is closed .
It has been secured .
It has been evacuated .
And now , as you can see , all leading members of law enforcement , including the police chief , the D.C. police chief , and also the mayor of D.C. , there on the scene , more than likely to hold a news conference any minute now .
And we will take that live .
Our Ed Henry is on the scene .
He is talking to eyewitnesses .
He is gathering information for us as well .
But we can tell you two individuals have been shot , a security guard and the alleged gunman .
Both taken to George Washington University Hospital .
Let 's go ahead and listen to another eyewitness that we were able to get an interview with thanks to our affiliate WJLA .
Let 's take a listen .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
We were in the " Daniel 's Story " section on the main floor and we heard what sounded like four loud pops .
And I thought somebody had just dropped something on the floor .
And my fiancee said to me , " That sounded like gunshots . "
All of the sudden , three kids ran into the area where we were and they had looks on their faces like I have never seen before .
And it was just a horrified , scared look .
I knew something was absolutely wrong .
We were all in that little small enclosed area .
Nobody really knew what to do .
You could feel the panic starting to rise up .
And I thought the only thing we can do is try and find a door out .
I did n't know if we needed to find a door out .
I did n't really know if something was absolutely really wrong .
But we were able to find an emergency door out , and I had to hold the door button for 15 seconds before that door would open .
It was like the longest 15 seconds of my life because I did n't know what was going on down at the other end .
But it finally did open and we got out the door , and everybody started filing out behind us .
And when I turned around and watched people coming out of the door , that 's when I knew something really had happened wrong because they were crying and scared .
You could just see it in their faces .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
PHILLIPS : All right .
And as I was telling you just a few minutes ago -- as we look at live pictures here from our affiliate WJLA , you can see actually members of the S.W.A.T. team , members of the various police forces there on the scene out in front of the National Holocaust Museum -- United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , rather , in Washington , D.C. , just about two blocks from the Washington Monument , directly across from the United States Department of Agriculture .
Just real quickly , a security guard and a gunman both shot , both taken to G. W. University Hospital .
Trying to confirm their conditions .
The museum has been closed , secured , evacuated .
Here is how it all went down , according to Sergeant David Schlosser with the U.S. Park Police .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
QUESTION : Is he in the hospital ?
Is that true ?
Do you know if he 's critical ?
SGT .
DAVID SCHLOSSER , U.S. PARK POLICE : I do n't know , but I 'll try to find that out for you .
QUESTION : Can you tell us what he was dressed like ?
SCHLOSSER : I do n't know .
QUESTION : Are you looking for anyone else .
QUESTION : There 's two people shot , that 's it ?
SCHLOSSER : My understanding is that it 's going to be a total of two victims , one being the security guard and one being the gentleman -- and one being the person that had initially gone into the museum .
QUESTION :
The reason for shutting everything down is because you still have a response team doing a secondary search ?
SCHLOSSER : Absolutely .
We want to make absolutely certain that the scene is completely secure .
QUESTION : Are there people hiding in there ?
SCHLOSSER : Let 's wait one second .
QUESTION : All three ( OFF - MIKE ) .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Let 's wait for that helicopter to clear .
SCHLOSSER : OK .
All right .
Going back to the number of shooters involved , I do know that obviously we had the gunman that walked in there and that one or more security officers returned fire .
The number , I do n't know yet .
I 'm going to try and get that .
So it could be one or more .
QUESTION : Sergeant , are there people hiding ?
SCHLOSSER : There were two that I heard returned fire , but I want to confirm that .
QUESTION : Are there people hiding inside the building right now ?
SCHLOSSER : Not to my knowledge .
No , I believe the museum has been completely secured and evaluated .
QUESTION : Do you have a rough age on this guy ?
SCHLOSSER : No , I have no age on him .
QUESTION : His condition , sir ?
SCHLOSSER : I do n't know .
Apparently pretty serious , but that 's all I know .
And I 'll try to get that .
QUESTION : And the guard 's condition ?
SCHLOSSER : I think the same for that .
QUESTION : Thank you , sir .
QUESTION : Is it safe to say that one of the most secure of the institutions in Washington ?
SCHLOSSER : All the institutions in Washington do threat analysis of their particular facilities , and I think the majority of the public gathering areas have done a good job as far as putting metal detectors and any other detection equipment necessary that 's appropriate for the type of facility they have .
QUESTION : Your name , sir ?
SCHLOSSER : OK .
A matter of housekeeping , my name is David Schlosser .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
PHILLIPS : All right .
Once again , you were listening to Sergeant David Schlosser of the U.S. Park Police .
That was a news conference that he held about 25 minutes ago .
Live pictures now from our affiliate WUSA , there in Washington , D.C .
If you just listened to his news conference -- OK .
I 'm being told now that Robert Gibbs addressing this at the White House press briefing .
Let 's go ahead and listen in .
ROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY : Again , in my endeavoring pursuit to bring you special guests , today , obviously , we have the secretary of commerce , Gary Locke , who is going to talk to you guys ...
PHILLIPS : Apologize for that .
We are going to monitor the White House press briefing and see if indeed he mentions the shooting at the museum here .
Meanwhile , we are going to stay on this breaking news coverage .
This is a live picture coming to us from WUSA .
The shooting has taken place inside the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum .
I can tell you there are two men that have been shot , a security guard and the alleged gunman .
They both are at the G. W. University Hospital right now .
The motive , still not sure .
We are trying to confirm that at this time .
We do know that tonight was the debut of the play " Anne and Emmett " by Janet Langhart Cohen at the U.S. Holocaust Museum , and that was bringing some heavy hitters to the museum tonight .
Apparently , Attorney General Eric Holder and members of Congress were supposed to be there at the museum tonight , but we have made no link between that , nor the president 's recent visit to Buchenwald concentration camp .
As you know , he was there remembering the Holocaust and also the 65th anniversary of D - Day .
And so with keeping that all in context , that is what is happening at the museum tonight .
The president 's trip just a few days ago , and now you have got this shooting here at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C .
Just to tell you a little more about the Holocaust Memorial Museum , it 's considered a living memorial .
We were rolling some video a little bit ago , some file video that we have inside the museum .
So if that comes up again , that is not of the crime scene that has taken plays inside the museum , it 's file video that we have had as we monitor a number of live pictures as well from our affiliates .
There it is right there .
This is the stock video that we have had inside that museum .
We covered its opening , its dedication back in 1993 , but it 's considered a living memorial , like I told you , exhibits and programs that teach millions of visitors each year about the dangers of unchecked hatred , anti-Semitism , the need to prevent genocide .
It 's got permanent exhibits that span actually three floors of the building , more than 900 artifacts , 70 video monitors , as you 're seeing here , a number of pictures of those that survived the Holocaust .
There 's actually four theaters that show historic film footage and eyewitness testimonies .
The exhibitions actually show pictures of Nazi propaganda , also the Nuremberg trials , the entire history of the Holocaust .
Pretty haunting images of death and destruction , and even these original uniforms that the Jews were forced to wear when they were held in those concentration camps that were finally liberated in 1945 .
Now back to our live pictures .
WUSA , our affiliate there in Washington , D.C. , helping us bring live coverage of this event .
Our Ed Henry was able to get to the scene .
He talked to a number of eyewitnesses there shortly after it happened .
Ed , have you been able to talk to anybody else to get any more information about the motive behind this shooting ?
HENRY : We have not been able to get to the motive .
I just spoke to two officials from the Holocaust Museum who were getting eyewitness reports from some of their employees , really repeating what we have been hearing about perhaps five gunshots , at least a security officer at the museum being shot and being hit pretty badly , as we heard from that eyewitness , Maria , 19 years old , who was saying that the security officer was bleeding profusely , was face down on the ground , was bleeding from the back , she believed , and that there was return fire from other security personnel on the original shooter .
And others -- other officials have said that the shooter was hit as well , that there were two people shot .
I just spoke to some museum officials who may be coming back in a moment to do a live interview who were saying they were getting similar reports from their employees .
We 're standing here now a little bit closer than we were before to the Holocaust Museum .
Jocco Riggs ( ph ) is with me , our photojournalist .
You can see where that American flag is waving just beyond the construction .
That is where the Holocaust Memorial Museum is .
That 's where the shooting took place .
Now , from eyewitnesses , we have gathered that the shooting took place inside the museum .
When I first arrived on the scene , it was pretty chaotic on the street , and there was so much security personnel and police personnel on the street , that it originally appeared that perhaps the shooting had taken place outside .
But instead , from various eyewitnesses , we 've gathered that the shooting took place inside , we believe , on the second floor of that museum , perhaps somewhere close to where the magnetometers , where the machines are where you get screened -- the security screening machines are , the metal detectors .
It happened near there , and that there may have been some sort of confrontation with the shooter and that security officer who was hit .
Again , he was down .
We are told face down on the ground after he was shot , Kyra .
We are now standing here because , here in the middle of the street , we are expecting perhaps the Park Police -- and you can see , some Park Police behind me -- are going to be having a news conference , we believe , in the next few moments to give us an update on exactly what happened and perhaps any sort of motive -- Kyra .
PHILLIPS : All right .
And as we wait for that , Ed , if you do n't mind , just kind of give our viewers a description of where exactly the museum is .
It 's about two blocks from the Washington Monument ; right ?
How close is it to the White House ?
I know it 's across the street from the Department of Agriculture .
HENRY : Well , if Jocco ( ph ) follows me one more time , you can see the Holocaust Museum over my left shoulder here .
See the construction , some of the greenery and the trees .
And I do n't know if he can do a complete circle because there is a lot of other media here who are getting ready to the news conference .
But a little bit to Jocco's ( ph ) right , he 's going to turn around .
Watch yourself here .
And you can see the Washington Monument .
If you can get on the monument there , Jocco ( ph ) .
And so the monument is very close to the Holocaust Museum , maybe a block or two .
Then if you go beyond the monument , of course , just another block or so is the White House .
And obviously that 's where Jocco ( ph ) and I were working when we got the initial readout from Vito Maggiolo ( ph ) on our desk saying that there was some sort of a shooting here at the Holocaust Museum .
And since we were only a couple blocks away , we decided to gather and start racing over here .
We jumped in a taxi , and from the White House , maybe four blocks away , you could hear sirens coming from every direction at that point .
This is maybe an hour or so ago , right after the shooting .
We saw , as we got into the cab , ambulances passing us .
Again , police personnel from the U.S. Park Police , the Washington , D.C. , Metropolitan Police , the Secret Service police , you name it , all the various overlapping law enforcement agencies here in Washington were here descending upon the scene .
That 's when we started -- we got here , we got pretty close to the museum , maybe just a couple hundred feet outside the museum before police started moving us back here , say , a block , block and a half away from the crime scene .
There have been helicopters hovering over throughout our reporting from the Park Police , perhaps to make sure the scene is secure now , obviously .
They want to make sure -- again , this is just maybe four or five blocks from the White House .
So they want to make sure the scene is safe and secure .
There 's also hundreds , thousands of tourists just in this area right around us who have gathered upon the scene .
Some are eyewitnesses .
Others just happen to be here and have heard , obviously , the commotion , seen the scene , and have wanted to figure out exactly what 's going on .
I saw one gentlemen who had a family member or a friend who was inside the museum during the shooting .
He has not been able to find that person , was asking us for our help .
So , you get the idea that that kind of a chaotic scene where the eyewitnesses are pretty shaken by what they saw , the folks who are not eyewitnesses are wondering what happened .
And then there are others looking for family members or friends who were in there and obviously hoping that they are OK .
We have only heard about two people who were shot , so we should pass that along to try to assuage any concerns anyone has about other people being potentially hurt .
But certainly there are a lot of people concerned about this entire scene and exactly how it unfolded -- Kyra .
PHILLIPS : And Ed , stay with me .
Just getting a statement here from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum .
This statement is coming from its director of media relations .
It says , " A shooting incident occurred at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 's 14th Street entrance .
An assailant shot a museum security officer . "
" Two museum security officers returned fire , hitting the assailant .
The museum officer and the suspect have been transported to a local hospital .
The museum is closed for the remainder of the day and expects to be open tomorrow . "
" We 'll release more information as it becomes available .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the officer and his family . "
Ed , this is the first we are hearing directly from the media relations department there at the Holocaust Memorial Museum .
HENRY : Yes .
And I spoke to two officials from the museum who were -- just in the last few moments who were returning to the scene .
They had been away when the shooting took place .
I believe , actually -- let me correct that .
One person , one of the officials I spoke to , was here .
The other one was not here .
And they were meeting here at the scene to try to trade information , swap information about exactly how it unfolded .
I was trying to get them over to our camera .
And they may come in a moment .
But then they were pulled over and they were talking to law enforcement and other people behind me .
So , obviously , the museum officials have been drawn into this unfortunately , obviously , because there is now a crime scene right at their museum .
And they are trying to figure out how it unfolded .
And they obviously -- one of the security personnel was hit .
PHILLIPS : Well , Ed , and as you are talking about it , we are just getting video in from our affiliate , WJLA , of the two ambulances .
And we are getting our first pieces of video here of the alleged gunman and also the security guard that was shot .
This is a photographer from one of our affiliates , WJLA , in Washington , D.C. Two ambulances arriving at G. W. University Hospital .
One ambulance carrying that alleged shooter , we believe .
The other ambulance carrying that of the security guard .
We are just going to kind of hold on this video to see exactly what D.C. Fire -- and we apologize for how this could be a little uncomfortable to see .
OK .
There is -- this individual is in green pants , looks like a white male in green pants on oxygen .
The paramedics there are talking to this individual lying on his side .
And then the video just cut away .
I do n't know if we are going to be able to come back to that or not , if we are going to be able to see the other individual that was in the other ambulance there .
We are actually working that videotape .
We 'll let you know if we do have video of the other ambulance and who , indeed , was taken out of that other ambulance .
Ed , are you with me still by chance as we are watching this ?
HENRY : Yes .
Yes .
PHILLIPS : Is there any way you can find out from somebody what type of uniform -- maybe you know -- these security guards wear inside the museum ?
This guy had green pants on , this one victim that was being brought in .
HENRY : OK .
PHILLIPS : OK .
( CROSSTALK )
PHILLIPS : Go ahead , Ed . Go ahead and ask .
Our affiliate -- yes , go ahead , Ed .
HENRY : No , go ahead with your information and then I 'll tell you .
PHILLIPS : All right .
WJLA , the affiliate , is reporting that the video we are looking at right now of this man being taken out of the ambulance is the alleged shooter .
HENRY : OK .
PHILLIPS : OK .
That is what we are getting from the affiliate .
That is what they are reporting .
They are reporting it 's the alleged shooter .
But I can tell you -- and I 'm going to look at video again , Ed -- it looks like he has got khaki green -- like Army green .
He 's got Army green pants on .
It looks like a white male , and he is up on his side .
So if there is any way we can confirm what the security guard 's uniform looks like , the guys that takes care of those inside the museum , we might be able to confirm that -- go ahead .
HENRY : Well , I have a still photo .
And I am going to e-mail this to you in a moment , but I do n't know if you can actually see it .
I 'm going to put it in for Jocco ( ph ) .
And these were some of the security personnel that I saw outside the Holocaust Museum .
And they were wearing white shirts and they look like dark pants .
I do n't know if you can make out this shot .
And I will e-mail it to you -- I 'll e-mail it in a moment .
Can you see that ?
PHILLIPS : OK .
Yes , go ahead and e-mail it to me .
Yes .
It 's hard to make out , Ed .
It 's too much of a glare .
HENRY : Yes .
PHILLIPS : Yes .
HENRY : It 's too much of a glare .
OK .
I 'm going to e-mail it to you , and then maybe from there in Atlanta , you can get it made into ...
( CROSSTALK )
PHILLIPS : And stay with me , Ed. Robert Gibbs is saying something now at the White House briefing .
Let 's listen in , Ed .
GIBBS : Earlier today , the president called President Sulayman to congratulate him on Lebanon 's successful parliamentary elections , commended Lebanon 's Interior Ministry and security services for their hard work .
President Obama reiterated his strong commitment to Lebanon 's sovereignty and independence and indicated that he looked forward to working with the president to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Lebanon .
Finally , President Obama noted that special envoy -- his special envoy for Middle East peace , George Mitchell , would be in Lebanon on Friday and looked forward to ...
PHILLIPS : OK .
Ed , you know how Robert Gibbs usually comes out , says a couple of things , and then reporters ask their questions .
So we 'll take the Q&A .
I 'm sure a reporter will ask about that shooting .
We 'll go back to that in a minute .
But meanwhile , you know , we do n't want to leave these pictures and the fact that we actually have video possibly of that alleged gunman .
I will wait for your e-mail to see the picture of exactly what those security guards wear .
And I will try and see if there looks like a correlation between the uniform and what that man was wearing that was coming out of the ambulance into the hospital .
HENRY : And obviously , there could be more than one uniform in different areas of the building .
These were folks who were outside securing the Holocaust Museum when I first arrived on the scene about an hour or so ago .
I just sent that to you .
And , you know , so , we 'll try to figure that out .
And we 're trying to figure out whether this press conference --
PHILLIPS : You were able to confirm through the eyewitness , or at least the eyewitness said that the gunman was shot in the back .
Is that correct , or was it the security guard ?
HENRY : That the security guard , we believe , was shot in the back , because Maria , the 19 - year - old eyewitness that we interviewed a few moments ago , she was saying that she saw a security guard on the ground face down ...
PHILLIPS : OK .
HENRY : ... and that it appeared he was bleeding from the back .
But obviously , it was a chaotic scene , and it 's unclear , unfortunately .
If blood was coming out quickly , it 's unclear exactly where it was coming from .
But she thought that he was shot in the back and that the security guard had blood coming out of his back and he was face down on the ground .
PHILLIPS : All right , and I 'm getting a wire coming across from NBC News and news services , updated about four minutes ago .
It 's reporting that law enforcement officials are identifying the suspect .
Do we want to go with this name ?
All right , we 're going to go to Bob -- Robert Gibbs at the White House .
He 's talking about the shooting now .
We will get back to the suspect 's possible name .
( JOINED IN PROGRESS )
ROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRTARY : ... the security guard that appears to have been hurt .
I gave him mostly a factual briefing of the facts as we knew it or knew them at that point .
And that 's about it .
Obviously , saddened by what has happened .
QUESTION : And in terms of -- can you just give us a little bit more detail about the White House involvement in a tragedy like this ?
How does coordination work through the Homeland Security ( INAUDIBLE ) ?
GIBBS : Well , you know , we get regular updates through the Situation Room .
We 're in contact with and we get updates from Homeland Security Council and other agencies like the FBI .
So , I assume throughout the day , we 'll continue to get information about facts and what 's happened ( INAUDIBLE ) .
QUESTION : I also want to ask you a couple quick things on health care .
Can you give us a progress report on the president 's meeting today with the key senators , just to start ?
How does the White House think it went ?
Was anything accomplished today ?
GIBBS : Well , I think the president continued to discuss with important and leading members of Congress on health care reform the challenges that we have before us .
Obviously , he 'll travel tomorrow to Green Bay and have a town hall meeting on this .
We just announced , obviously , the speech in Chicago on Monday .
The president is pleased that what appears to be happening is making progress .
I think you 'll hear him both tomorrow and Monday , as I said , lay out the strong case for health care reform to bring about some relief for families and small business from the costs that they 're seeing rise each and every year .
PHILLIPS : All right , we 'll continue to monitor the White House briefing there .
We did hear just a few comments from Robert Gibbs when asked about that shooting .
Meanwhile , we 're going to continue to monitor that as well as bring you information as quickly as we can surrounding this shooting that has taken place at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington , D.C.
We 're getting in new video now from our affiliates in addition to our shooter , Jocko Riggs ( ph ) , who 's there on the scene bringing us video of what it looks like right now .
Let me try and bring you up to date .
This is what we know so far , that about an hour and a half , an hour 35 minutes ago , a man entered the inside of this museum .
And as soon as he came inside the entryway , we are told that he opened fire on a security guard , an armed security guard right there inside the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C .
At that time , one or more other security guards , but according to a statement now from the museum , it was two security guards that opened fire on that gunman .
Two men were rushed to the hospital .
GW University hospital .
And this is the video we 're getting in from our affiliate , WJLA .
And they 're reporting that this is the alleged gunman , that this man right here that we 're seeing brought in , bleeding , it looks like from the front and the back , on his side is the alleged gunman that opened fire , possibly taking the life of that security guard that has been shot .
Still cannot confirm , cannot confirm the condition of those two men , the alleged gunman that apparently we just saw video of and the security guard that was shot .
Our Ed Henry is on the scene , has been monitoring this for us .
Have you been able to get any more information ?
HENRY : No .
I mean , to be honest with you , we are still trying to gather more about the motive , about exactly how it played out .
And we are expecting a press conference to start at some time soon , right here behind me .
That 's why we 're gathered here .
We are right now standing in the middle of 14th Street .
That 's where this has been set up because several blocks have been actually shut down on the National Mall as you can imagine .
Just behind my left shoulder here , you can see here out there the Holocaust Museum where the American flag is .
That 's where the museum is .
It 's been cordoned off now for well over an hour , hour and a half .
There 's now even another fire and EMS unit , appears to be an ambulance coming to the scene .
Obviously , it 's not rushing to the scene .
But you can see that that has been happening over the last hour and a half or so throughout .
PHILLIPS : And Ed ?
HENRY : Yes .
PHILLIPS : Apparently , and this is -- we 're going to hang this on NBC News right now .
But apparently , law enforcement officials have identified the suspect as James Wenneker von Brunn , 88 years old , from the Eastern Shore of Maryland .
Apparently , NBC reporting he may have had connection to hate groups or anti-government groups .
This is the information that we 're getting right now .
Stay with me because Mike Brooks , who used to work in law enforcement there in Washington , D.C. -- he was on the SWAT team -- he was talking to us by phone .
He 's here on set with me now .
You know , Mike , you 've got obviously a number of sources there within the police department .
Do you know anything about what is being reported now on NBC about this possible suspect , James Wenneker von Brunn , from Eastern Shore of Maryland , possibly connections to hate groups or anti-government groups ?
MIKE BROOKS , CNN SECURITY ANALYST :
We 're looking into that right now .
We do have that name .
That 's not the first time we 've heard -- that I 've heard that name myself .
PHILLIPS : You know that name ?
BROOKS : I 've heard that name because , if you recall , I was on the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force .
And we used to investigate domestic hate groups .
So , and I can tell you right now that the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force , the Washington field office , is there on the scene .
You also have the FBI SWAT team assisting U.S. Park Police and D.C. Police there on the scene .
Now , the Holocaust , you know , dedicated in the early '90s .
I was part of the actual ...
PHILLIPS : This museum , the memorial museum .
BROOKS : The museum was dedicated in the early '90s .
And when it was dedicated , you had revisionists who believed , you know , who say the Holocaust never happened .
You had different hate groups , skinhead groups , Aryan nations , all there protesting the opening of this .
Now , you know , is this guy part of an organized group ?
That remains to be seen .
But one of the things that law enforcement , and former law enforcement myself , Kyra , are always concerned about are these lone wolves .
These people who have this ideology in their head and , you know , as I call them , some of the true believers that will go out and carry out acts like this .
But we will find out more about this guy .
You know , there are a number of different hate groups around the Eastern Shore of Maryland , Virginia , northern Virginia , southwestern Virginia .
I know that for sure .
Does he have any affiliation with any of these groups ?
It 's not known at this time .
PHILLIPS : All right , and I 'm right now -- bear with me because I 'm getting some information from our investigative correspondent , Drew Griffin .
We have now confirmed this name as well , this suspect , James Wenneker von Brunn , 88 years old , from the Eastern Shore of Maryland .
Possibly connections to some hate groups , anti-government groups .
You say the name rings a bell , as in , you think you remember him as being tied to one of these groups , Mike ?
BROOKS : I know he has -- I do n't know if he 's tied specifically to a group , but I do know he has a Web site , and ...
PHILLIPS : Is this the HolyWesternEmpire.org ?
BROOKS : I believe that is it , yes .
PHILLIPS : I 'm trying to bring it up right now .
Looks like it 's getting a lot of hits right now .
I 'm having a hard time bringing that up .
Maybe we can bring that up in the -- here we go .
This is actually his bio .
James Von Brunn holds a bachelor of science Journalism degree from Midwestern University where he was president of SAE , a fraternity , played varsity football .
It says here , during World War II , he served as a P.T. boat captain , lieutenant .
Receiving commendation and four battle stars for 20 years .
He was an advertising executive , a film producer in New York City , a member of Mensa .
I 'm trying to work my way down .
Here we go .
Here 's the -- in 1981 , apparently he attempted to place the Federal Reserve Board of Governors under legal nonviolent citizens arrest .
He was tried in a D.C. court , convicted .
Oh , I see .
This is his Web site .
So , in his words , he 's talking about and he uses derogatory terms for African - Americans .
He talks about being convicted by a Negro jury , Jew / Negro attorneys .
It 's quite a racist Web site here .
And I 'm just going to seek guidance on if I should continue to even give this Website any more attention .
Boy , it sure lays out some pretty crude statements about his past and how he views blacks and Jews .
I can tell you right now that in the initial investigation like this , they will send a lead down to the Baltimore office of the FBI in Salisbury , Maryland and in Annapolis , they have RAs .
I guarantee you they are working with local law enforcement in getting together a search warrant for this guy 's house to see whether or not there is anything dangerous at his house .
Many times , you see people carry out incidents like this , and many times they do n't expect to come back from an incident like this , Kyra .
PHILLIPS : Right .
They will sometimes set something for police .
Again , that 's just something that we have seen in the past .
As I said , though , I 'm sure the FBI joint terrorism task force out of the Baltimore office is also involved in this , along with the domestic joint terrorism task force , the group that I used to be with there at the Washington field office .
PHILLIPS : We are working more information obviously on him and his ties to anti-Semitism , to racial groups , to hate groups , to antigovernment groups .
The name we are hearing now is James W. Van Brunn .
James Wenneker von Brunn .
We are actually looking at his Web site , trying to confirm more information about this possible shooter here outside the museum .
Let me update you .
If you are just tuning in , we are following breaking news right now .
A shooting that has taken place inside the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C.
If you are not familiar with the location , it 's just about two blocks from the Washington Monument , directly across in the United States Department of Agriculture , not far from the White House , which is why our Ed Henry was able to get so there quickly by a cab and cover this for us .
Mike Brooks , who used to work in law enforcement , even the anti- terrorism group out of D.C. , he is working his sources .
He is with me here on the set .
Here is what happened .
A man that we now believe to be identified as James Wenneker von Brunn , 88 years old , connections to hate groups , antigovernment groups , possibly even serving in World War II in the United States military .
Having connections to hate groups now , possibly police looking at him now as the gunman that opened fire on an armed security guard inside the Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C .
Ed Henry was able to get an incredible testimony with an eyewitness , a 19 - year - old girl by the name of Maria .
I am told Ed is ready now , too .
Ed is up live with us in front of the museum .
I was just talking about the fact that she saw this security guard that was shot .
A lot of developments now .
We still can't confirm , Ed , if the gunman is still alive and if the security guard is still alive .
We were able to see some video of the alleged gunman , James Wenneker Von Brunn being brought into the George Washington University Hospital .
This video captured by one of the photographers at WJLA .
They have been extremely aggressive on this story .
We appreciate them getting this video to us .
This came in to us just about 15 minutes ago .
In just a second , you will see video of the alleged gunman that authorities are saying could be James Wenneker Von Brunn , a man known to be tied to hate groups , anti-government groups .
Eighty - eight years old if he is , indeed , confirmed to be the shooter right now .
Police believing that is indeed him .
Now , the security guard .
How is the security guard ?
We still can not get a status on him at this point .
We do know he was shot .
One of the eyewitnesses saw him facedown in a pool of blood inside that museum .
He was rushed to the hospital as well .
We did get a statement from the museum .
The head of media relations saying their thoughts and prayers go out to the officer and his family right now .
They did confirm that that shooting incident occurred at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum right there at the 14th Street entrance .
That 's what you are looking at right now .
This alleged gunman , James Wenneker Von Brunn entered into the front of that museum .
Still not sure what he said , if there was any kind of verbal confrontation .
Witnesses said they just heard the police officer say , " Put your gun down , put your gun down , " and he did not .
That 's when gunshots were heard .
Witnesses hearing five gun shots .
We can confirm the security guard indeed was shot , and two additional security guards inside that museum shot the alleged gunman who is now at the G.W. University Hospital .
You saw a video of him moments ago .
We have been able to identify him .
According to law enforcement officials , they believe it is James Wenneker Von Brunn , a man known to be tied to hate groups and anti-government groups , possibly a man who served in the U.S. military during World War II .
We are working to confirm that .
Now , the statement -- you can see the mayor right here possibly getting ready to step up to the mike out here in front of -- you see the police chief , too .
You can see the head of the police force there in Washington , D.C. Right behind -- there she is .
It looks like she might be coming up possibly to the mikes to give a news conference .
We will see .
We are monitoring these live pictures hoping they will step up to the mike to say a statement .
We will take that live as soon as it happens .
It looks like the mayor is getting out some notes here and will be approaching the mike .
Let 's go ahead and take a listen .
Are we set up for this , guys , audio wise ?
Great .
As soon as the mayor steps up to the mike , we will take this live .
We want to thank our affiliate WJLA .
Let 's take it live .
ADRIAN FENTY , MAYOR , WASHINGTON D.C. : I would like to start off by saying we are going to give some statements and we would be glad to answer as many questions as possible .
What we have tried to do is arrange everybody who has a role in the investigation of what happened earlier this afternoon so that you can get one message , and then we would be able to have one single stream of communication .
We expect to do the same thing again early tomorrow morning after our law enforcement officials have had the night to do their investigation .
First of all , my name is Adrian Fenty , mayor of Washington , D.C.
At approximately 1:00 this afternoon , there was a shooting in the entranceway of the Holocaust Museum .
The Holocaust Memorial Museum is an agent of the federal government .
It comes under the Department of the Interior .
We are joined by William Parsons , the chief of staff of the museum who will answer questions about all museum affairs .
Again , this was earlier in the afternoon , just before :00 , an armed gunman came into the entrance and immediately opened fire , striking one security guard .
There was fire -- gunfire returned .
The gunman was hit .
As of right now , the armed gunman is in the hospital in critical condition .
There is also a security guard who was hit who is in grave condition .
Our hearts and thoughts go out to the security guard and his family .
No name will be released as of right now , and we will bring more information to you as more information comes to us .
The other thing that we want to talk about is that we have a partnership with the FBI .
Joe Persichini will speak from the FBI about their investigation .
Our chief of police , Cathy Lanier , will give the specifics of the incident .
We want to thank the United States Park Police for their work so far .
We know there will be questions about everything from what is going on in the museum , the museum 's hours , to traffic around the incident right now .
We will do our best to answer those questions in turn .
The next person who will speak is the chief of police for the District of Columbia , Cathy Lanier .
As the mayor said , it is still very early on in this investigation .
We will give you all the information we can give you at this point .
Please recognize that all this information right now is still determined to be preliminary .
We will give you the best information that we have , knowing that some information will develop as time goes on and some may change .
CATHY LANIER , CHIEF OF POLICE , WASHINGTON D.C. : About ten minutes to 1:00 this afternoon , there was what appeared to be a lone gunman who approached and entered the main entrance of the Holocaust Museum .
Immediately upon entering the museum , he was engaged by security guards , and there was an exchange of gunfire .
As he mayor said , we have one security guard who has been struck that is at an area hospital getting treatment .
We also have a gunman who was struck obviously from the return fire from security .
Off - duty police officer from the Metropolitan Police Department was in the block just as the shooting was being dispatched .
The officer immediately entered the museum , was supported by United States Park Police , and security from the museum and rendered aid immediately to the victims until they were transported by the D.C. Fire Department and EMS .
At this point , this appears to be a lone gunman .
He appears to be acting alone .
We do have information that we are following up on to try and confirm identities , which we do not have confirmed at this point , and this area -- immediate area around the museum will remain closed for probably an extended period of time .
However , we are going to open traffic around the area .
And we 'll get that update from DDOT Director here on what areas will be open for rush - hour traffic .
So , at this point , we had no prior information .
There was no prior threats of this nature about this incident .
So , it appears to be a lone gunman who entered into the museum and opened fire with what appears to be a rifle at this point .
QUESTION : Can you confirm that the gunman is 89 - year - old James Von Brunn ?
LANIER : We have no confirmation on any identity at this point .
So , we can't confirm identity .
That 's going to take a little bit of time .
FENTY : That 's all the questions until we introduce the last few speakers .
Joe Persichini , from the FBI .
JOE PERSICHINI , FBI : I think that as Chief Lanier said that we have a lot of work to do right now .
And I want to reiterate again that we had no prior knowledge of any act that was going to take plays at Holocaust .
We have an outstanding relationship , both the Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI with Holocaust .
We 'll be working through the night to develop the facts .
And as the mayor and the chief said , we 'll have a press conference tomorrow morning and hopefully provide you some of the facts of the investigation .
It is a joint investigation .
Again , we 're working through the night to develop all the facts that we possibly can .
Thanks .
FENTY : Last speaker , Bill Parsons , Chief of Staff for the Holocaust Memorial Museum .
WILLIAM PARSONS , CHIEF OF STAFF , U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM :
On behalf of everybody at the museum , we just want to say that , never take your guard force or your security people for granted .
These folks are trained .
They train all the time .
They did exactly what they were supposed to do to protect people at the museum .
Our hearts really go out to the family right now and to the guard who was shot .
And we appreciate all the support we 're getting .
The museum will be -- is closed today .
It will be open tomorrow for business as usual .
So , thank you .
QUESTION : Do you have any information that the museum was targeted because it's the Holocaust museum ?
Is there any information suggesting that it was targeted ?
PARSONS : We do n't have any of that , no .
QUESTION : ( INAUDIBLE ) .
PARSONS : It 's a security force at the museum .
QUESTION : How many people was inside the museum when it happened ?
PARSONS : It was a full museum , a couple thousand .
QUESTION : Did he go through the metal detectors to get in ?
Do you know if there was ( INAUDIBLE ) ?
PARSONS : I 'll defer that to the law enforcement .
QUESTION : Chief , can you tell us if you 've located the shooter 's car ?
LANIER : I 'm not going to comment on evidence .
We are working on a lot of evidence at this point .
From right now , what it appears is that the gunman did enter alone , was engaged by at least two of the security guards immediately upon entering the door .
So , the security forces as was commented on , did exactly what they are here to do and our hearts certainly go out to them .
QUESTION : Chief , did the bomb - sniffing dogs make a hit on his car though ?
Are you X - raying that car to make sure --
LANIER : As a precaution on every scene that we go to involving incidents and particularities around the area , we sweep the area with bomb dogs .
We have swept all the areas around the museum as a matter of routine .
QUESTION : ( INAUDIBLE ) .
LANIER : My understanding that the gunman entered with a long rifle -- that was visible when he entered the museum .
QUESTION : Did he saying anything , Chief ?
LANIER : We have no information on that .
( CROSSTALK )
LANIER : We have nothing -- no confirmation on identity at this point .
So , we 're not going to speculate until we confirm identity .
QUESTION : Can you tell us anything about him ?
His age , his gender ?
LANIER : We have n't confirmed ID .
QUESTION : How many shots ( INAUDIBLE ) getting fired ?
LANIER : It 's too early for us to say .
QUESTION : ( INAUDIBLE ) immediately engaged .
Does that mean they saw the rifle ?
Otherwise , why would you immediately engage somebody ?
LANIER : Well , from the information that we have at this point , it appears that immediately as he entered the front doors of the museum , he raised the rifle and started shooting .
QUESTION : It was a rifle , not a shotgun ?
LANIER : It is a rifle .
QUESTION : What was the approximate age ?
LANIER : Can't give you that at this point .
QUESTION : What about the guard ?
LANIER : Can't give you anything on the guard at this point .
( CROSSTALK )
LANIER : Actually , the second he was stepped into the building , he began firing .
QUESTION : ( INAUDIBLE )
QUESTION : Conscious or unconscious ?
LANIER : Both the guard and the suspect are at area hospitals being treated .
I can't comment any further on their condition because we just do n't know yet .
( CROSSTALK )
FENTY : We 'll take one more question for the FBI and then we 'll see you all in the morning .
QUESTION : What is the FBI 's role here ?
PERSICHINI : As a joint member of the JTTF , we 're always looking at any possible connection for domestic terrorism .
This is a collaborative effort and representatives from the Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI are assisting with this case .
QUESTION : Mayor , Mayor , Mayor .
PERSICHINI :
We have not received any other information about any other site in the city .
And I think that 's all .
QUESTION : Mayor , Mayor , Mayor , Mayor --
FENTY : We 're going to do a local traffic briefing for the local folks who will have to get the routes .
QUESTION : Mayor , I talked to several sources their first time in the city today .
What do you have to say to them about safety in D.C. ?
FENTY : Again , I think this is an extremely isolated incident .
Not only that , as Mr. Parsons said , this was something that happened where the security guards performed exceptionally well and exactly as they were supposed to .
In these days and times , you never know when someone is going to grab a gun and use it in an inappropriate way as was done today .
But we want to thank the heroism of the security guards and the Metropolitan Police Department for being on hand very early for making the arrest .
We believe we have someone who was a lone gunman .
But , we 're going to spend the night investigating any and all other leads .
What we'd like to do now is have our Department of Transportation director come forward and just give the local press a briefing on where we stand with traffic .
QUESTION : Who was the third person that was injured ?
We understood there was another person .
Hello , everybody .
My name is Gabe Klein .
I 'm the director of the D.C. Department of Transportation .
We initially had a closure on the 14th Street bridge northbound .
The 14th Street bridge is now open in both directions , excuse me .
And I 'm happy to announce that all the major arterials are open except for this area on 14th Street , from Constitution to D .
So , we have switched timing now to rush - hour timing as we have seen a surge on all the major arterials heading out of D.C .
( END OF COVERAGE )
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : OK , guys , I do n't hear it .
Guys ?
PHILLIPS : All right .
We 're trying to get our audio looped in there .
You were just listening to a live news conference with the chief of police and the mayor there in D.C.
Really , we have been giving you more information actually than they were able to give .
So I 'm just going to get right down to it .
Right now , law enforcement officials looking at white supremacist James Wenneker von Brunn , born 1920's , believed to be 88 or 89 ; known for a history of being involved with hate groups , anti-government groups .
On the phone with us right now from the Southern Poverty Law Center , Heidi Beirich .
Heidi ,
As we are learning more information about this shooting at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in D.C. , we now have the name of the suspect .
We 've seen video of him being brought into the George Washington University medical center .
We 're told he is in critical condition .
You have actually been investigating -- your organization , has been investigating James Wenneker von Brunn for a number of years , right ?
VOICE OF HEIDI BEIRICH , SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER : Yes .
He is in our files going way back to the 1980's .
He has extremely long history with Neo - Nazis and white supremacist .
He 's written extremely incendiary publications raging about Jews and Blacks and the like .
He 's been employed in a Holocaust denial bookstore .
So , this guy is a hard core Neo - Nazi .
PHILLIPS : And I 'm looking at his web site .
And you know , he 's referring to the 1983 case where he was found guilty in this incident with the Feds , calling the jury a Negro jury and that the attorneys were Negro and Jews .
I mean , it 's a very nasty discriminatory description of his lawsuit and how he feels about Blacks and Jews .
Did you start looking into him after this case with the District of Columbia 's Superior Court , when he was convicted in New Hampshire of attempting to kidnap members of the Federal Reserve board because of his anti-government feelings ?
BEIRICH :
Well actually , we have materials on von Brunn going into the late ' 70s when he was working with probably one of the prominent Neo - Nazis , American Neo -Nazis of the modern era , a guy named William Pierce , who actually wrote the book " The Turner Diaries " that inspired Timothy McVeigh 's Oklahoma City bombing .
Von Brunn was a close associate of William Pierce at something called the National Youth Alliance .
So , it was before that time .
But you 're right .
That incident is really scary .
If you read von Brunn 's web site talking about it , he talks about how he wants to bind the Fed members hands , make them go on television .
He was -- had a bunch of concealed weapons in a London Fog raincoat .
So , this guy 's really scary .
PHILLIPS : And he says that he was in the Military -- the United States Military during World War II .
Is that true , do you know ?
BEIRICH : I 'm not sure if it 's true .
It 's possibly true in the sense that he was very close allies with a guy named Rear Admiral John Cromolyn ( ph ) , who was an Alabamian , who came back from the war pretty well - decorated hero .
But he was raging anti-semi .
He was also associated with these same kinds of crazies .
So , it 's possible .
PHILLIPS : Well , it 's heart - wrenching and it's disgusting when you just read the background .
Heidi Beirich with the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Please stay with us .
Our ongoing coverage here of the breaking news story .
A security guard shot .
An alleged gunman shot .
That alleged gunman believed to be white Supremacist James Wenneker von Brunn .
It all happened at the Holocaust museum -- Memorial Museum , there in Washington , D.C .
We 've been following this for two hours .
We 've got much more ahead with Rick Sanchez .
He takes it from here .
I think we find one clue to why he rigged the vote count so crudely .
His argument that a majority of eleven million was too big to allow for any irregularities suggests he believed that a big lie was the only one that would work .
But if you utter a big lie , you had better hope it could persuade some .
It appears to have persuaded no one but a few fools at the Washington Post and the executive editor of the New York Times .
And the endless attempt to blame all this on Britain and the US and the " Zionists . "
This is a regime that is so hermetically sealed , so rigid in its dogma , so brutal in its ideology it probably believes its own lies .
It is , as David Brooks notes today , very , very fragile .
When every piece of data requires a reassertion of doctrine in order to banish reality from people 's minds , government becomes impossible .
All that is possible is brute force and terror .
I fear deeply what is about to happen .
But I also sense that the Gandhi - strategy of the majority is a winning one .
If they can sustain their numbers and withstand the nightly raids , and if they can overwhelm the capital tomorrow in another peaceful show of strength , then they can win .
And the world will change .
This is their struggle now , requiring the kind of courage that only God can provide .
Their God , my God , the God of the Torah and the Koran and the Gospels .
Something is happening in Iran .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

So much for that supposed " apology " .
Gingrich is back with more back peddling and more fear mongering over the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor .
CBS
News reported the interview this way .
Gingrich Opts To " Reframe " Racist Tweet :
Later in the program , Gingrich said he wished to " reframe " his initial comment calling Sotomayor a racist , when really he does not know the nominee and meant that her words were racist .
" One of the challenges for the administration is having first chided me for language , then having said she did n't mean it , and then having said she ought to restate it .
Now they face the fact that she has said this , written about it four or five time , " he argued .
" If you say people of this ethnic background are superior to people of this ethnic background , take out her language and put in the word ' white , ' put in ' white male ' where she had ' Latina , ' that person would be disqualified from the court .
Also would be disqualified as a juror . "
Gingrich admitted that it is " very doubtful " that her comments would disqualify her as a high court pick .
" I think she was a good prosecutor .
I think she was an acceptable district court judge , " he said .
But , Gingrich added , lower level judges " are n't in a position to live out whatever their prejudices are because they 're bound by the Supreme Court , " arguing that a lifetime appointment would put her in a position to radicalize the Court .
Gingrich 's actual words :
When I did a Twitter about her , having read what she said , I said that was racist — but I applied it to her as a person .
And the truth is I do n’t know her as a person .
It ’s clear that what she said was racist , and it ’s clear — or as somebody wrote recently , “ racialist ” if you prefer .
This " reframing " just looks another excuse to fling some more mud at her .
I wonder if Newt has looked at what racialism actually means either .
From Wikipedia :
Racialism is sometimes used as a synonym of racism .
or Racialism entails a belief in the existence and significance of racial categories , but not necessarily in a hierarchy between the races , or in any political or ideological position of racial supremacy .
So which one is it you 're smearing her with today , Newt ?
Synonym , or the latter ?
Newt 's double talk makes my head hurt .
Between Gingrich and Liz Cheney , I can't decide which one I 'm more sick of seeing on the television .
Antagonyms
Page revised on January 1 , 1999
This is a word I made up to describe a single word that has meanings that contradict each other .
My derivation of the word antagonyms is described below .
Example of an Antagonym :
A current example would be " BAD " .
There is the normal meaning and the slang meaning of " good " ( sometimes pronounced baad for emphasis ) .
Although I prefer words in which the antithetical definitions are listed in common dictionaries , I will accept well - known slang examples .
As pointed out by Rex Stocklin ( in list of acknowledgments below , see { T} ) , a number of antagonyms result from use of the prefix " re- " .
The meaning " again " may conflict with other meanings .
We will continue to add these words to the list as we receive them .

Was it an oversight ?
No , we never knew that antagonyms have previously been called " contronyms " until Mark Israel emailed us .
Apparently the term " contronyms " was coined by Richard Lederer in Crazy English ( Pocket Books , 1989 , ISBN 0-671-68907-X ) .
Mark has listed several dozen contronyms in the alt.usage .

We 're proud to say we have some he did n't have !

June 29 , 2009
Eva Golinger is a Venezuelan - American attorney and writer , and author of The Chávez Code : Cracking U.S. Intervention in Venezuela .
She lives in Caracas and issued regular reports on developments in Honduras at her Postcards from the Revolution Web site .
Here , we reprint her initial report from late yesterday morning , followed by excerpted updates from throughout the day .
Whether the coup in Honduras will succeed remains in doubt .
International condemnation has been strong .
The U.S. government at first appeared ready to acknowledge the coup - makers as a " force for democracy . "
But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later condemned the coup and called for respect for " constitutional order . "
The events in Honduras were similar to a coup attempt against left - wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in 2002 .
But that U.S. - backed effort failed when masses of poor Venezuelans mobilized to demand Chávez 's return .
Early in the morning , Zelaya was captured , beaten and forced onto a plane that took him to Costa Rica .
Other members of his government were also detained -- the whereabouts of several were unknown late Sunday night .
Honduras ' elected president , Manuel Zelaya , was taken prisoner by soldiers and forced out of the country on the day Hondurans were supposed to vote in a nonbinding referendum on changing the country 's constitution .
THE TEXT message that beeped on my cell phone this morning read " Alert , Zelaya has been kidnapped , coup d'etat underway in Honduras , spread the word . "
It 's a rude awakening for a Sunday morning , especially for the millions of Hondurans who were preparing to exercise their sacred right to vote today for the first time on a consultative referendum concerning the future convening of a constitutional assembly to reform the constitution .
Supposedly at the center of the controversy is today 's scheduled referendum , which is not a binding vote , but merely an opinion poll to determine whether or not a majority of Hondurans desire to eventually enter into a process to modify their constitution .
Such an initiative has never taken place in the Central American nation , which has a very limited constitution that allows minimal participation by the people of Honduras in their political processes .
The current constitution , written in 1982 during the height of the Reagan administration 's dirty war in Central America , was designed to ensure those in power , both economic and political , would retain it with little interference from the people .
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya
Zelaya , elected in November 2005 on the platform of Honduras ' Liberal Party , had proposed the opinion poll be conducted to determine if a majority of citizens agreed that constitutional reform was necessary .
He was backed by a majority of labor unions and social movements in the country .
If the poll had occurred , depending on the results , a referendum would have been conducted during the upcoming elections in November to vote on convening a constitutional assembly .
Nevertheless , today 's scheduled poll was not binding by law .
In fact , several days before the poll was to occur , Honduras ' Supreme Court ruled it illegal , upon request by the Congress , both of which are led by anti-Zelaya majorities and members of the ultra - conservative National Party of Honduras ( PNH ) .
This move led to massive protests in the streets in favor of Zelaya .
On June 24 , the president fired the head of the high military command , Gen. Romeo Vásquez , after he refused to allow the military to distribute electoral material for Sunday 's elections .
Vásquez held the material under tight military control , refusing to release it even to the president 's followers , stating that the scheduled referendum had been determined illegal by the Supreme Court , and therefore he could not comply with the president 's order .
As in the United States , the president of Honduras is commander - in - chief and has the final say on the military 's actions , and so he ordered the general 's removal .
The Minister of Defense , Angel Edmundo Orellana , also resigned in response to this increasingly tense situation .
What you can do Activist organizations are calling on supporters of democracy to call the State Department and White House and demand : a cut - off of all military aid to Honduras until President Zelaya and Foreign Minister Rodas are safely returned to office ; support for international movements to bring the coup plotters to justice ; and replace the U.S. ambassador to Honduras .
Call the State Department at 800-877-8339 and the White House at 202-456-1414 .
But the following day , Honduras ' Supreme Court reinstated Vásquez to the high military command , ruling that his firing was " unconstitutional . "
Thousands again poured into the streets of Honduras ' capital of Tegucigalpa to show support for Zelaya and their determination to ensure that Sunday 's non-binding referendum would take place .
On Friday , the president and a group of hundreds of supporters marched to the nearby air base to collect the electoral material that had been previously held by the military .
That evening , Zelaya gave a national press conference along with a group of politicians from different political parties and social movements , calling for unity and peace in the country .
AS OF Saturday , the situation in Honduras was reported as calm .
But early Sunday morning , a group of approximately 60 armed soldiers entered the presidential residence and took Zelaya hostage .
After several hours of confusion , reports surfaced claiming the president had been taken to a nearby air force base and flown to neighboring Costa Rica .
No images have been seen of the president so far , and it is unknown whether or not his life is still endangered .
President Zelaya 's wife , Xiomara Castro de Zelaya , speaking live on Telesur at approximately 10 am Caracas time , said that in early hours of Sunday morning , soldiers stormed their residence , firing shots throughout the house , beating and then taking the president .
" It was an act of cowardness , " said the first lady , referring to the illegal kidnapping occurring during a time when no one would know or react until it was all over .
Casto de Zelaya also called for the " preservation " of her husband 's life , indicating that she herself is unaware of his whereabouts .
She claimed their lives are all still in " serious danger " and made a call for the international community to denounce this illegal coup d'etat and to act rapidly to reinstate constitutional order in the country , which includes the rescue and return of the democratically elected Zelaya .
Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela have both made public statements on Sunday morning condemning the coup d'etat in Honduras and calling on the international community to react to ensure democracy is restored and the constitutional president is reinstated .
Last Wednesday , June 24 , an extraordinary meeting of the member nations of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) , of which Honduras is a member , was convened in Venezuela to welcome Ecuador , Antigua & Barbados and St. Vincent to its ranks .
During the meeting , which was attended by Honduras ' foreign minister , Patricia Rodas , a statement was read supporting President Zelaya and condemning any attempts to undermine his mandate and Honduras ' democratic processes .
Reports coming out of Honduras indicate that the public television channel , Canal 8 , has been shut down by the coup forces .
Just minutes ago , Telesur announced that the military in Honduras was shutting down all electricity throughout the country .
Those television and radio stations still transmitting are not reporting the coup d'etat or the kidnapping of President Zelaya , according to Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas .
" Telephones and electricity are being cut off , " confirmed Rodas just minutes ago via Telesur .
" The media are showing cartoons and soap operas , and are not informing the people of Honduras about what is happening . "
The situation is eerily reminiscent of the April 2002 coup d'etat against President Chávez in Venezuela , when the media played a key role by first manipulating information to support the coup , and then later blacking out all information when the people began protesting , and eventually overcame and defeated the coup forces , rescuing Chávez ( who had also been kidnapped by the military ) and restoring constitutional order .
HONDURAS IS a nation that has been the victim of dictatorships and massive U.S. intervention during the past century , including several military invasions .
The last major U.S. government intervention in Honduras occurred during the 1980s , when the Reagan administration funded death squads and paramilitaries to eliminate any potential " communist threats " in Central America .
At the time , John Negroponte was the U.S. ambassador in Honduras and was responsible for directly funding and training Honduran death squads that were responsible for thousands of disappeared and assassinated throughout the region .
On Friday , the Organization of American States ( OAS ) convened a special meeting to discuss the crisis in Honduras , later issuing a statement condemning the threats to democracy and authorizing a convoy of representatives to travel to Honduras to investigate further .
Nevertheless , on Friday , the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Phillip J. Crowley refused to clarify the U.S. government 's position in reference to the potential coup against President Zelaya , and instead issued a more ambiguous statement that implied Washington 's support for the opposition to the Honduran president .
While most other Latin American governments had clearly indicated their adamant condemnation of the coup plans underway in Honduras and their solid support for Honduras ' constitutionally elected president , Manual Zelaya , the U.S. spokesman stated the following , " We are concerned about the breakdown in the political dialogue among Honduran politicians over the proposed June 28 poll on constitutional reform .
We urge all sides to seek a consensual democratic resolution in the current political impasse that adheres to the Honduran constitution and to Honduran laws consistent with the principles of the Inter - American Democratic Charter . "
As of 10:30 a.m. , Sunday morning , no further statements had been issued by the Washington concerning the military coup in Honduras .
The Central American nation is highly dependent on the U.S. economy , which ensures one of its top sources of income -- monies sent from Hondurans working in the U.S. under the " temporary protected status " program that was implemented during Washington 's dirty war in the 1980s as a result of massive immigration to U.S. territory to escape the war zone .
Another major source of funding in Honduras is the U.S. Agency for International Development , which provides over $ 50 million annually for " democracy promotion " programs that generally support NGOs and political parties favorable to U.S. interests , as has been the case in Venezuela , Bolivia and other nations in the region .
The Pentagon also maintains a military base in Honduras in Soto Cano , equipped with approximately 500 troops and numerous combat planes and helicopters .
Foreign Minister Rodas has stated that she has repeatedly tried to make contact with the U.S. ambassador in Honduras , Hugo Llorens , who has not responded to any of her calls thus far .
The modus operandi of the coup makes it clear that Washington is involved .
Neither the Honduran military , which is majority trained by U.S. forces , nor the political and economic elite , would act to oust a democratically elected president without the backing and support of the U.S. government .
President Zelaya has increasingly come under attack by conservative forces in Honduras for his growing relationship with the ALBA countries , and particularly Venezuela and President Chávez .
Many believe the coup has been carried out as a method of ensuring Honduras does not continue to unify with the more leftist and socialist countries in Latin America .
Update at 11:15 a.m. ( Caracas time ) : President Zelaya is speaking live on Telesur from San Jose , Costa Rica .
He has verified that soldiers entered his residence in the early morning hours , firing guns and threatening to kill him and his family if he resisted the coup .
He was forced to go with the soldiers who took him to the air base and flew him to Costa Rica .
He has requested that the U.S. government make a public statement condemning the coup -- otherwise , it will indicate their compliance .
Update at 12 Noon : The Organization of American States is meeting in an emergency session in Washington concerning the situation in Honduras and the kidnapping of Honduras ' president .
Venezuelan Ambassador to the OAS Roy Chaderton just announced that the ambassadors of Venezuela , Bolivia and Nicaragua in Honduras have been kidnapped along with Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas , and are being beaten by Honduran military forces .
President Obama has made a statement regarding his " concern " for the situation in Honduras and a call to all political leaders and parties to " respect democratic norms . "
However , this statement is NOT a clear condemnation of the coup d'etat that has taken place during the early morning hours on Sunday .
Nor did Obama indicate , as other countries have done , that Washington would not recognize any other government in Honduras other than the elected government of Manual Zelaya .
Opposition forces in Honduras , led by a U.S. - funded NGO Grupo Paz y Democracia , have stated via CNN that a coup has not occurred , but rather a " transition " to democracy .
Martha Diaz , the coordinator of the NGO , which receives USAID funding , has just declared minutes ago on CNN that " civil society " does not support President Zelaya nor his " illegal quest " to hold a nonbinding referendum on a potential future constitutional reform .
She justified his kidnapping , beating and removal from power as a " democratic transition . "
Again , this is eerily reminiscent of the coup d'etat in Venezuela in April 2002 , when so - called " civil society , " along with dissident military forces , kidnapped President Chávez and installed a " transition government . "
The groups involved also received funding from the U.S. government , primarily via the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) and later from USAID as well .
CNN en Español , Telesur and other international television stations reporting on the situation in Honduras have been removed from the airways in the Central American nation .
The whereabouts of the Foreign Minister and the ambassadors of Venezuela , Bolivia and Nicaragua are still unknown .
OAS General Secretary Jose Miguel Insulze has announced he will travel immediately to Honduras to investigate the situation .
President Chávez of Venezuela has also announced an emergency meeting of ALBA nations in Managua , Nicaragua , as soon as this evening .
Updated at 12:18 p.m. : Dan Restrepo , presidential adviser to President Obama for Latin American Affairs , is currently on CNN en Español .
He has just stated that Obama 's government is communicating with the coup forces in Honduras , trying to " feel out " the situation .
He also responded to the reporter 's question regarding whether Washington would recognize a government in Honduras other than President Zelaya 's elected government by saying that the Obama administration " is waiting to see how things play out " and so long as democratic norms are respected , will work with all sectors .
This is a practical confirmation of support for the coup leaders .
Restrepo also inferred that other countries are interfering in Honduras ' international affairs , obviously referring to Venezuela and other ALBA nations , who have condemned the coup with firm statements earlier this morning .
Updated at 12:30 p.m. : Foreign Minister of Honduras Patricia Rodas has been taken from her home by soldiers , beaten and imprisoned .
Serious human rights violations are occurring in Honduras , and President Obama has so far only said he is " concerned . "
Another showing of a U.S. double standard ?
Since Zelaya is a " leftist " president , will the Obama administration refuse to condemn the coup against him ?
Updated at 1 p.m. : President Zelaya is speaking right now live from San Jose , Costa Rica , alongside the right - wing president of Costa Rica , Oscar Arias , who traditionally has been a staunch ally of Washington .
Arias has just adamantly condemned the coup against Zelaya and called for the whole hemisphere to follow suit .
Updated at 2:10 p.m. : Incredible !
Just like Venezuela in April 2002 .
CNN has just issued a report saying that the Honduran Congress has just read President Zelaya 's resignation from the presidency and the head of Congress will be the new president of Honduras .
However , just under one hour ago , President Zelaya spoke live from Costa Rica and did not give ANY indication whatsoever that he was going to resign .
Zelaya , moreover , reiterated that he remains the elected president of Honduras until 2010 and was hoping to return to his country as soon as possible .
Updated at 2:20 p.m. : President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras was just live on CNN en Español , confirming that he never signed nor authorized his resignation from the presidency .
This is a coup d'etat taking place , he said .
The Honduran Congress has forged a resignation letter illegally removing the president from power .
Updated at 3 p.m. : Minister of the Presidency in Honduras , Enrique FLores Lanza , is live on " Once Noticias " Channel 11 news in Honduras affirming that hundreds of thousands of Hondurans are taking to the streets to demand the return of President Zelaya .
He has confirmed that President Zelaya has not resigned , and the letter presented by the Congress is a fake .
The Obama administration has not yet called for the unequivocal reinstatement of Zelaya to the presidency of Honduras .
Updated at 3:30 p.m. : A member of Honduras ' Congress has just admitted that in discussions with the U.S. ambassador in Honduras , the U.S. Ambassador suggested they let the poll take place today , and then vote against the Constitutional Assembly in November .
But , said the member of Congress , " We ca n't just allow ' these people ' to do this with the help of Venezuela and Cuba . "
Updated at 3:44 p.m. :
The alleged resignation letter with the forged signature from President Zelaya is dated June 25 , 2009 .
This is completely ridiculous considering that up until he was violently kidnapped this morning , Zelaya gave no indication whatsoever that he was planning to resign .
Today , in forced exile from Costa Rica , he has reaffirmed his role as constitutional president of Honduras and denied any resignation via letter or any other means .
The Honduran Congress has violated the human rights of its citizens and has brutally repressed members of Zelaya 's administration .
Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas , who was beaten and taken from her home a few hours ago , has still not resurfaced .
Updated at 4:32 p.m. : The Honduran president , Manuel Zelaya , elected in November 2005 , has been kidnapped , beaten and forced into exile in Costa Rica .
A fake letter of resignation , with his forged signature , was used by Honduras ' opposition majority Congress to justify the president 's ouster .
Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas was brutally beaten and kidnapped by military forces in her residence just before noon and taken into custody .
She has not been seen since .
In complete violation of diplomatic law , the ambassadors of Venezuela and Cuba were both beaten and kidnapped for a short period by Honduran soldiers , under orders of the coup leaders .
They have both been released and have taken refuge again in their respective embassies .
A nonbinding vote , scheduled for today , on a possible future constitutional assembly , was impeded by the coup leaders , violating the Honduran people 's right to vote and participate in their political processes .
Nations around the world , including the United Nations , Organization of American States , Latin American countries and even the United States , have condemned the events in Honduras .
Only the Obama administration has yet to clarify whether it will recognize the illegal coup government led by the president of Honduras ' Congress Micheletti .
Updated at 5:37 p.m. :
It 's official .
Illegal , but official .
Roberto Micheletti , up until now the head of Congress , has just been sworn in as de facto president after violently ousting President Zelaya from power , kidnapping him and forcing him into exile in Costa Rica .
Micheletti just gave a speech before Congress , broadcast live via CNN en Español and Telesur , along with Honduran stations , in which he declared his " utmost respect for democracy and the constitution . " (?!)
He also discussed how his " cabinet , " which he is about to announce , will " restore democracy " and " respect for the constitution . "
He repeated over and over again that what took place was not a military - civil coup , but rather a " civil society " action to " ensure democracy . "
Still no word about kidnapped and beaten Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas ' whereabouts .
The Congress also did not explain President Zelaya 's beating and kidnapping and forced exile or the forged resignation letter , which they now obviously are no longer using as a legitimate " justification " for the coup .
It 's just too bogus .
BTW , the U.S. Military Group in Honduras trains around 300 Honduran soldiers every year , provides more than $ 500,000 annually to the Honduran Armed Forces and additionally provides $ 1.4 million for a military education and exchange program for around 300 more Honduran soldiers every year .
The United States maintains a military base in Soto Cano , Honduras , that houses approximately 500 soldiers and Special Forces .
The leaders of the coup today are graduates of the U.S. School of the Americas , a training camp for dictators and repressive forces in Latin America .
Updated at 6:54 p.m. :
In a major blow to the coup leaders in Honduras who illegally installed themselves in power , the Organization of American States ( OAS ) has just issued a resolution condemning the coup against President Zelaya , demanding the return of Zelaya to power immediately and clarifying that the OAS will not recognize any other government other than Zelaya 's in Honduras .
Whew !
For a minute there , I thought this was going to turn out like Haiti in 2004 , when coup forces kidnapped President Aristide and forced him into exile and , while the OAS " condemned " the constitutional rupture , they never called for Aristide 's reinstatement , and since the U.S. backed the coup , an illegal transitional government was installed , and nothing more came of it from the international community .
This time , things seem different .
Still waiting on the U.S. government 's official position .
If they say they will not recognize the coup government , then we have to see how things will play out in Honduras .
Updated at 7:40 p.m. : Since the Obama administration has stated the coup situation in Honduras should be resolved via the OAS , and the OAS has just condemned the coup and called for the unconditional restoration of President Zelaya to power , that should also imply that the U.S. government shares the same position .
Some rumors are flying around that two U.S. government reps have made statements to the effect of Obama not recognizing the coup government in Honduras , but not wanting to " get involved " and " wait " for the coup government to decide it is illegitimate by analyzing the OAS decision .
I think a clear coup d'etat against a democratic government that also happens to be dependent on U.S. economic and political aid should require a more firm and concise statement by the U.S. government .
Tomorrow , the State Department will have to respond to questions about the coup .
Another literate Haskell post :
I 've tried a few times to read various documents on the web about
Monad Transformers in Haskell .
I think that in almost every case the
authors are trying to show how clever they are rather than explaining
their use .
If I had just seen the simplest possible examples of Monad
Transformers at work I would have been able to figure out what was going
on and that would have given me enough information to bootstrap myself
into Monad Transforming enlightenment .
So to save other people the trouble I went through I 'm providing you
with examples of Monad Transformers at work .
I 'm not even going to
explain in detail how they work , they 're close to self - evident once the
main features are pointed out .
> import Control .
Monad .
State
> import Control .
Monad .
Identity
Firstly here are two examples of the use of the State Monad .
This
code is n't intended as a tutorial on the State Monad so I won't
explain how they work .
> test1 = do
> a > modify ( +1 )
> b > return ( a , b )
> test2 = do
> a > modify ( ++ " 1 " )
> b > return ( a , b )
> go1 = evalState test1 0
> go2 = evalState test2 " 0 "
Note how evalState ' unwraps ' the State Monad and gives you back the
answer at the end .
So the question is : how do I combine both of these states into one
so that I can update or read either the integer or the string state
at will ?
I could cheat and make a new state of type ( Int , String )
but that is n't a general solution .
The idea is that you use a Monad Transformer .
A Monad Transformer
if like a layer of onion peel .
You start with the Identity monad
and then use Monad Transformers to add layers of functionality .
So to get a two - state monad you take the Identity and add two
layers of stateness to it .
To get the answer at the end you need
to unwrap the State layers and then unwrap the Identity layer too .
When you 're inside your ' do ' expression you need a way to choose
which Monad you 're talking to .
Ordinary Monad commands will
talk to the outermost layer and you can use ' lift ' to send your
commands inwards by one layer .
The following should now be self - evident :
> test3 = do
> modify (+ 1 )
> lift $ modify (++ " 1 " )
> a > b > return ( a , b )
> go3 = runIdentity $ evalStateT ( evalStateT test3 0 ) " 0 "
Note that we use evalStateT to unwrap the State layer instead
of evalState .
evalStateT is what you use to unwrap one layer
of the Monad .
evalState is what you use when your entire Monad
is just the State monad .
When State is a layer , rather than
the whole thing , it 's called StateT .
( Try : type go3 in ghci . )
What if you want to combine IO and State ?
For various reasons
the IO monad must form the innermost core of your onion so
there 's no need to wrap an IO layer around the Identity ,
you can just start with IO .
And when you unwrap you do n't
need to unwrap the IO layer because the Haskell compiler does
that for you .
( Now you can see why you can't layer IO , you 're
not supposed to unwrap IO as it's the job of the code that
calls main at the top level to do that . )
So here we go :
> test5 = do
> modify (+ 1 )
> a > lift ( print a )
> modify (+ 1 )
> b > lift ( print b )
> go5 = evalStateT test5 0
At this point you might be suspicious that IO is being handled
slightly differently from State .
So here 's a StateT layer
wrapped around State :
> test7 = do
> modify (+ 1 )
> lift $ modify (++ " 1 " )
> a > b > return ( a , b )
> go7 = evalState ( evalStateT test7 0 ) " 0 "
You can probably safely ignore my comments and crib the code above
directly for your own use .
And credit where credit 's due : I found the following link to be
more helpful than any other in trying to figure this stuff out
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/MGS2006/LectureNotes/lecture03-9up.pdf
( But I still felt that this link was obfuscating . )
You may now be wondering where test4 and test6 are .
So am I .
Update : I just figured out that you do n't always need to use the
' lift ' operation .
Some of the Monad Transformers have been defined
so that the commands will automatically be passed into the inner
Monad ( and further ) if needed .
I think it 's slightly confusing to
write code this way , however .
