The King of Prussia mall management was excited to meet with me first thing Monday morning to show me a few available store fronts for the opening of Feminique Boutique II .
I do n’t blame their enthusiasm and ass - kissiness .
In this economy , it must be tough to find a retailer that can handle rent that starts at nearly $ 5000 a month , and at first they were eager to have me sign on the dotted line .
That is until the word “ vibrator ” was uttered and the leasing manager literally covered her ears and closed her eyes like a child that just heard a bad word .
Apparently in her enthusiasm , she failed to read my business description or website before our meeting .
Her :
Oh no you ca n’t sell that .
This is an upscale , family mall .
Me : Well you have a Spencer ’s .
They sell vibrators .
Again with the cringing and ear covering at the “ v ” word .
Her : Yes , and we in the mall management business do n’t like them either but they have millions of dollars .
Me : Meaning they have the resources to sue you for discrimination and I do n’t ?
Her :
This is not a democracy .
This is private property and we can rent to whoever we want .
But we are a high - end shopping destination .
We have a Neiman Marcus .
We have a reputation to uphold .
What exactly is this reputation that needs upholding ?
For one , it has nothing to do with sex toys and “ family friendliness ” of the mall because if it did , they would uniformly forbid the sale , not just by Feminique Boutique but by all retailers , including Spencer’s .
And it ’s not just about the “ millions of dollars ” .
While Spencer ’s is a successful corporation , and the King of Prussia Mall does get 8 % of their lessee ’s monthly sales , would that be enough to have them risk their reputation ?
Obviously it is , since they allow Spencer ’s to sell vibrators .
So why ca n’t I ?
What is the refusal to rent me a space really about ?
Let ’s review :
Spencer ’s is owned by man .
Feminique Boutique is owned by a woman .
Spencer ’s sells t- shirts that degrade women , such as one that depicts a woman on all fours wearing a leash around her neck that says , “ How to Train your Bitch ” .
Feminique Boutique sells t- shirts that empower women , such as one that says “ Love your Body : Start a Revolution ” .
Spencer ’s sells vibrators in the view of minors that contain phthalates , a chemical known to be harmful to the female reproductive system .
Feminique Boutique sells vibrators in an 18 + backroom that are phthalate - free .
Spencer ’s has an expressed business mission of humor and gag gift giving .
Feminique Boutique has a business mission of advocating that “ women are sexual subjects , not objects ” .
To me , it ’s about the mainstreaming of sex-negativity .
Sex toys can be sold as long as they are “ novelties ” with the purpose of embarrassing someone who opens it at their 40th birthday party .
But when women buy one to actually be used and enjoyed , as they would from Feminique Boutique , it makes people uncomfortable .
Sex can be talked about , as long as it ’s a joke or putting someone down , which is why “ training your bitch ” t- shirts and penis shaped pasta is acceptable at the mall for the entertainment of 12 year olds , but a woman who loves her body and proudly wears the Feminique Boutique shirt that declares that , well , that ’s obscene .
If people were really offended by sex toys , they would protest outside of Spencer ’s .
If the King of Prussia Mall really cared about their reputation as an “ upscale family friendly shopping destination ” they would not allow Spencer ’s to open .
If people really feared for the children , they would be outraged at the toddler t- shirt Spencer ’s sells on the “ baby ” section of their website which says “ the boy ” with an arrow pointing to the face , and “ the legend ” with an arrow pointing to the genitalia , the indoctrination starting at 2 years old that the mighty phallus is the cornerstone of our sexual culture .
But no one is upset about this .
What have we learned ?
Promoting the dignity of sexuality : Bad .
Using sexuality as a punch line on a tacky keychain : Good .
My indignation is not at Spencer ’s .
It ’s a free country and I support their right to run their business as they see fit .
But for the King of Prussia Mall to allow the sale of vibrators and other sex related products in a way that exacerbates social norms of female subservience while denying the opportunity for a competing business that sells similar products in a pro-female environment is discriminatory , sexist , and illegal .
Such double standards frustrate me but they do not surprise me , because women in control of their sexuality threaten the very structure and basis of our entire society .
And nobody is comfortable with that .

Iran is now a ' nuclear state ' says Ahmadinejad as thousands take to the streets
Gordon Brown :
The world 's patience is wearing thin
Security forces fire tear gas and paint balls on opposition protesters
Internet connections attacked in Tehran as regime tries to foil opposition
Opposition leader attacked
Iran is now a ' nuclear state ' , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced this morning .
As Gordon Brown warned that the world 's patience is wearing thin , Ahmadinejad told scores of cheering Iranians that the Islamic Republic is capable of producing weapons - grade uranium .
He spoke as tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Tehran to mark the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution .
Despite fears of violence , opposition supporters found themselves largely overwhelmed by the clerical regime and pro-government demonstrators .
The massive security clampdown appeared to succeed in preventing protesters from converging into a cohesive demonstrations .
Large numbers of riot police , members of the Revolutionary Guard and Basij militiamen , some on motorcycles , deployed in back streets near key squares and major avenues in the capital to move against protesters .

He said it had produced its first batch of 20 per cent enriched uranium - and had the capability to enrich to far higher levels at its Natanz plant .
Enriching uranium produces fuel for a nuclear power plants but can also be used to create material for atomic weapons .
The international community has warned Iran against further enrichment activities , threatening new UN sanctions .
Today Gordon Brown again reiterated the threat of sanctions .
' I believe the mood around the world is now increasingly one where , patience not being inexhaustible , people are turning to look at the specific sanctions we can plan on Iran , ' Mr Brown said .
' This is a critical time for Iran 's relationship with the rest of the world . '
MrBrown said the international community did not want to impose sanctions but would do so if Iran did not cooperate more fully over its nuclear plans
The Iranian leader insisted the material was not intended to produce an atomic bomb , however .
' We have the capability to enrich uranium more than 20 percent or 80 percent ( the level needed to create an atomic bomb ) , ' he said in a speech broadcast live on state television .
' But we do n't enrich ( to this level ) because we do n't need it ...
Supporters wave flags and placards as they gather in Tehran 's central square

' When we say we do not manufacture the bomb , we mean it , and we do not believe in manufacturing a bomb , ' he told the crowd .
' If we wanted to manufacture a bomb we would announce it . '
Thousands of supporters had been brought in on buses to hear Ahmadinejad speak as security forces threatened to crush any opposition protests .
Witnesses say security forces fired paint balls to disperse anti-government protesters in one of the first clashes of the day 's ceremonies .
The unrest began after protesters began to chant opposition slogans in Sadeqieh Square , which is about a half - mile ( one kilometer ) from a huge pro-government gathering where President Ahmadinejad delivered his speech .
Witnesses say there were no apparent injuries among the several hundred protesters .
Security forces stand guard as crowds of Iranians gather to listen to President Ahmadinejad 's address

Internet speeds around the capital dropped dramatically this morning as the government tried to foil demonstrations against the regime .
State television showed live footage of crowds carrying Iranian flags and pictures of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei making their way to Azadi ( freedom ) Square in central Tehran , where the main gathering is being held .
Opposition members went on rooftops late Wednesday and shouted Allah - u - Akbar ( ' God is greatest ' ) in protest - echoing similar cries after the disputed June election as well as anti-shah protests more than three decades ago .
' There is a heavy presence of security forces everywhere .
Police trucks are at every major intersection , ' said a witness in central Tehran .
Police helicopters were flying over the city .
An opposition website , Iran Green Voice , reported large numbers of opposition supporters gathering in several cities , including Tehran and the northern city of Tabriz .
' In some parts of Tehran , opposition supporters are chanting ' Death to the Dictator ' ' the website said .
Security forces are equipped with water cannon to disperse opposition protests , the opposition website Jaras reported .

Other opposition websites spoke of groups of protesters in the hundreds , compared to much larger crowds in past demonstrations
One protester told The Associated Press she had tried to join the demonstrations but soon left in disappointment .
' There were 300 of us , maximum 500 .
Against 10,000 people , ' she told an AP reporter outside Iran .
She said there were few clashes .
' It means they won and we lost .
They defeated us .
They were able to gather so many people , ' she said .
' But this does n't mean we have been defeated for good .
It 's a defeat for now , today .
We need time to regroup . '
Another protester insisted the opposition had come out in significant numbers , but ' the problem was that we were not able to gather in one place because they ( security forces ) were very violent . '
[ caption ]
' Maybe people got scared , ' he said .
' The idea was n't to lose or win today ...
But what is certain , today was not a good day . '
The opposition leaders have promised to join street rallies , including the Green movement founder and former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Police chief Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam said on Wednesday the Revolutionary Guards and Basij Islamic militia were ready for any incident .
' In case of any riots , public disturbance and disorder ... police will detain and keep rioters in prison until April 9 , ' an unnamed official told the semi-official Fars news agency on Thursday .
The Islamic state is facing its worst domestic crisis in three decades as opposition supporters have rallied round reformists who lost to Ahmadinejad in the election .
Today President Ahmadinejad announced that the Islamic Republic had produced its first batch of 20 per cent enriched uranium .
He is pictured here at the Natanz nuclear plant
In recent months , the opposition has built its street protest strategy around days of important political or religious significance in attempts to embarrass authorities .
The tone of the rallies , however , has shifted from outrage over alleged fraud in President Ahmadinejad 's re-election to wider calls against the entire Islamic system , including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Neither side has shown much appetite for compromise in the eight months since the disputed June presidential vote , which the opposition says was rigged to secure Ahmadinejad 's re-election .
Iran faces growing Western calls for targeted sanctions against it after Ahmadinejad ordered production of higher - grade uranium , stirring fears that Tehran aims to make nuclear bombs , not just fuel for civilian use as it says is the case .
The authorities , who say the poll was fair , have struggled to suppress the protests , and opened trials in recent weeks of people charged in connection with bloody riots on December 27 .
Opposition leaders have said the trials were an attempt to deter people from taking part in protests today .

Iranian authorities again tried to squeeze off text messaging and Web links in attempts to cripple protest organisers .
The opposition has used internet and text messaging as its main communication channels .
Internet service was sharply slowed , mobile phone service widely cut and there were repeated disruptions in popular instant messaging services such as Google chat .
But several Iranians reached by The Associated Press said some messenger services , including Yahoo ! , and mobile phone texting were still sporadically accessible .
Many Internet users said they could not log into their Gmail account , Google 's e-mail service , since last week .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei yesterday promised Iran will deliver a ‘ punch ’ that will stun the West to mark today 's celebrations
' We have heard from users in Iran that they are having trouble accessing Gmail , ' said Google in a statement .
' We can confirm a sharp drop in traffic and we have looked at our own networks and found that they are working properly . '
An Iranian opposition website claimed today that security forces attacked opposition leader Mehdi Karoubi when he attended a rally .
' Karoubi was attacked by security forces in central Tehran ... they shattered his car 's windows ... Karoubi was not seriously injured , ' Jaras website reported .
The same website said security forces also attacked former president Mohammad Khatami .
The Islamic Republic has survived many challenges , not least a 1980 - 88 war started by Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , whose forces were propped up by Gulf Arab oil money and Western weaponry .
But the national unity forged in that trauma has long given way to rifts within clerical and political elites that widened after the June election .
Street protests have flared periodically ever since , sometimes around official rallies .
Attending February 11 events is a tradition for many in the country of 70 million , over half of whom have only ever known the Islamic Republic established by the revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
' If we all stay at home , our youngsters will be left alone on Bahman 22 ( February 11 ) .
We should support them , ' said Laleh , a 67 - year - old housewife .
' I have nothing to lose . '
Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi said on Wednesday her country faced a catastrophe that would wreck peace in the whole Middle East if what she called government repression of the people were not halted .
Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Karoubi say the reform movement is alive despite pressure from the hardline rulers to disband .
Karoubi predicted last month that Ahmadinejad would not be able to complete his four - year term .
' Even if he stays in power until the end of his term , he will be the weakest president since the revolution , ' an Iranian analyst who did not want to be named said this week .

( Mental Floss ) --
If you 've ever collected baseball cards , comic books , stamps , or maybe those limited edition commemorative plates , you understand the concept of the " Holy Grail " item .
It 's that last , hard - to - find , incredibly rare , usually expensive piece that you have to have before you can officially say your collection is complete .
If you 're a collector of vintage home video game cartridges ( or " carts " ) , sometimes that can mean paying a pretty penny for the pièce de résistance .
1. Stadium Events ( Nintendo Entertainment System )
Price Range : $ 13,000 -- $ 41,300 ; $ 10,000 for the box alone
Why So Expensive ? : Stadium Events was released by Bandai in 1987 as one of the few games available in America that was made for the company 's Family Fun Fitness mat , a soft , plastic controller you walked , ran , and jumped on to make the characters move .
Nintendo bought the rights to the game and the Fitness mat in 1988 and re-released them as World Class Track Meet and the Power Pad controller .
To avoid consumer confusion , Nintendo pulled all copies of Stadium Events from shelves and had them destroyed , but not before approximately 200 carts had already been sold .
Of those 200 , collectors believe that only 10 to 20 complete copies of the game exist today , making them a real rarity .
Stadium Events recently made headlines with two high - profile eBay sales .
A North Carolina woman was cleaning out her garage and found an old Nintendo and a handful of games , including Stadium Events .
She put them up on eBay without high expectations and was amazed to see the bids steadily climb up to $ 13,105 .
While the game itself is valuable , the winning bidder was most interested in the cardboard box it came in .
Since most kids threw the box away after tearing open a new game , intact boxes for any game are really hard to come by , but especially so for Stadium Events .
Empty Stadium
Event boxes have been known to sell for $ 10,000 alone .
After hearing of the success of this eBay seller , a man in Kansas dug up a factory - sealed copy of the game that he thought was worthless .
However , his game became only the second known sealed copy in existence .
He 'd purchased the game in 1987 , but could never find the Fitness mat to go with it .
It was still sealed because he'd meant to return it .
When his eBay auction ended on February 26 , 2010 , the game sold for an amazing $ 41,300 .
The same game repackaged by Nintendo , World Class Track Meet , generally sells for less than $ 3 on eBay .

2. 1990 Nintendo World Championships ( NES )
Price Range : Gray : $ 4,000 -- $ 6,100 ; Gold : $ 15,000 -- $ 21,000
Why So Expensive ? :
In 1990 , Nintendo held a 30 - city gaming tournament to find the best player in the world .
Players had to get the best score in demo versions of three games -- Super Mario Bros. , Rad Racer , and Tetris -- all within a six - minute time limit .
At the end of each city 's tournament , the winners of each of three age groups were given special gray Championship cartridges exactly like those used in the competition , which means only 90 of these cartridges were distributed .
The gold version was sent out to those who won a promotional contest in the pages of Nintendo Power magazine .
Only 26 gold games were produced , so they 're especially hard to find and command a higher price today .
3. Nintendo Campus Challenge ( NES )
Price Range : $ 14,000 -- $ 20,100
Why So Expensive ? :
In the early 1990s , Nintendo held competitions on college campuses and at popular Spring Break destinations .
Like the World Championships , players had six minutes to play for high scores on demo versions of Super Mario Bros.
3 , PinBot , and Dr. Mario .
Most copies of the game were destroyed after the competition ended , but one Nintendo employee kept his cart and sold it to Rob Walters at a garage sale in 2006 .
This garage sale is legendary among retrogamers , as Rob bought all kinds of NES Holy Grails for only $ 1,000 .
By the time he re-sold everything , he 'd made 50 times that .
Part of that $ 50,000 was the Campus Challenge cartridge , which went for $ 14,000 .
Shortly after , the buyer of the cart turned around and sold it on eBay for $ 20,100 .
As far as anyone knows , it 's the only copy of the game in the world .
4. Atlantis II ( Atari 2600 )
Price Range : $ 5,000 -- $ 6,000
Why So Expensive ? :
It 's never mentioned in the same breath as Pac - Man or Donkey Kong , but Atlantis was a pretty popular game in 1982 .
The gameplay was similar to Missile Command , with players defending their base from overhead attack by enemy ships .
The developer held a tournament called Destination Atlantis , where players were invited to send in photos of their TV screens displaying their high scores .
The best players were then sent Atlantis II , a special edition of the game that featured faster enemy ships worth fewer points , making it harder to get a high score , but easier to determine the true champions .
Because this version was not mass produced , its pretty rare today .
But if you find a copy of the original Atlantis at a garage sale , it might be a good idea to pick it up anyway .
The competition cart had the exact same colorful label of the regular Atlantis , but had a small , white sticker slapped on the front that read " Atlantis II . "
The label was easily peeled off , so a quick Google search will show you how to determine if you bought a $ 3 Atari game or a $ 6,000 one .

5. Air Raid ( Atari 2600 )
Price Range : $ 1,000 -- $ 3,000
Why So Expensive ? : Air Raid is a bit of an enigma for Atari fans .
Some say it was the one and only game produced by a company called " Menavision " ( or perhaps " Menovision " ) .
The game is so shrouded in mystery , it can't even be verified that " Air Raid " is its official title -- there 's no name on the label .
The name was based on the gameplay , which is similar to Atlantis and Missile Command , and by the picture on the label of a city being attacked by flying saucers , jets , and helicopters .
This strange cartridge appeared around 1984 in a bright blue " T - handle " casing that is very different from the standard , square , black Atari carts sold in North America , but is similar in style to those sold in Brazil .
Furthermore , while a few second - hand copies have been sold , no one can ever say they were the original owner .
The mystery , as well as the fact there are only 12 known copies , make it a must - have for serious Atari collectors .
6. Star Wars Ewok Adventure ( Atari 2600 )
Price : $ 1,680
Why So Expensive ? : Advertised in Parker Brothers ' 1983 retail catalog as Revenge of the Jedi : Game I but affectionately known as Ewok Adventure , the cart became legendary for never being sold .
In the game , players took control of an Ewok and flew a hang glider over the forest moon of Endor in an attempt to blow up an Imperial base .
You could avoid or kill enemy Stormtroopers , Speeder Bikes , or Imperial AT - ST Walkers , or you could instead commandeer these vehicles to take out the base .
The game was shot down by Parker Brothers ' marketing department , which felt the controls were too hard to master , so it was never produced .
The game 's designer , Larry Gelberg , gave the one and only known prototype copy to a friend 's son , who later sold it for $ 1680 .

7. Kizuna Encounter ( Neo Geo )
Price Range : $ 12,000 -- $ 13,500
Why So Expensive ? :
One of the main games that all Neo Geo fanatics are looking for is a particular version of Kizuna Encounter , a 1996 fighting game similar to Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter .
The game itself has received solid reviews , but is n't groundbreaking by any means .
However , it was produced in such small quantities for the European market that collectors speculate fewer than 15 copies were made .
The Japanese version , which is exactly the same except for different packaging , is fairly common and sells for about $ 50 .
8. Ultimate 11 ( Neo Geo )
Price Range : $ 8,000 -- $ 10,000
Why So Expensive ? : Ultimate 11 was the final game in the Super Sidekicks series , a popular franchise of soccer games that sold very well .
For some reason , though , Ultimate 11 was not produced in large quantities , and there are now fewer than 10 known copies in existence .
That kind of rarity makes it a must - have for collectors .
In late 2009 , a private sale was reportedly made between two members of the collectors ' forums at neo - geo.com .
The buyer paid an astonishing $ 55,000 to acquire both Kizuna Encounter and Ultimate 11 .
The original owner purchased the games around 10 years ago , when Kizuna was selling for $ 500 and Ultimate for $ 400 .
The new owner has said he will not sell them , even if he were offered $ 100,000 .

Recently , I wrote about public education in crisis .
But two other vital public services are also being hit hard by budget cuts : mental health care and assistance to the homeless .
Education is at least partly buttressed by the fact that almost everybody supports the idea of public schools .
Cuts generally provoke an outcry , and politicians often pledge to do their best to restore funding as soon as the economy improves .
Mental health and homelessness services , by contrast , are in some ways more vulnerable over the long - run : the constituencies they serve tend to be perceived by much of the public as nuisances at best , as societal menaces at worst ; services to these groups tend to be costly ; and the success rates ( illnesses controlled , homeless folks moved into permanent housing ) are , while a whole lot better than nothing , sometimes mediocre .
And so , as local and state government budget crunches worsen , it 's no surprise many of these services are on the chopping block .
The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) reports that Connecticut 's governor has proposed suspending all state - funded homeless services for the rest of the fiscal year ; California has eliminated funding for domestic violence shelters ; Massachusetts has reduced spending on geriatric mental health services ;
Ohio has , according to the CBPP report " eliminated virtually all state funding for mental health treatment for individuals who are not eligible for the state 's Medicaid programme " ; while Virginia has reduced the amount it pays hospitals to treat people with mental health or substance abuse issues and slashed its grants to local mental health service providers .
In fact , search online for mental health cuts by state , and it rapidly becomes clear that across America the already - fragile community mental health service infrastructure is being battered .
The impacts are by no means abstract .
Community mental health clinics provide not just medicines and counselling services , but an array of other support : they help the mentally ill find housing and jobs ; and they work with them to navigate complex government bureaucracies and access benefits .
They provide friendship to people who are frequently lonely , depressed and marginalised from the broader community .
Cuts to the mental health infrastructure in Kansas have resulted in a documented increase in calls to suicide hotlines and rising numbers of people being admitted to psychiatric hospitals in a psychotic state .
Communities like Santa Barbara , California , have seen homelessness spike at least in part because broke local mental health services are having to turn sick men and women away .
And , once homeless , the mentally ill – as well as the non-mentally ill homeless – face a similar scramble for scarce resources .
Tens of millions of dollars have been removed from city shelters in Washington DC , the nation 's capital .
As winter set in last November in Minnesota , one of the coldest states in America , thousands of low - income families lost emergency financial assistance to help pay rent to avoid being evicted .
The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates more than 700 homeless Americans die of hypothermia each year – and with homeless services being slashed , that number will likely increase in the years to come .
Meanwhile , New York City is considering closing the largest homeless drop - in centre in Manhattan .
Activists worry that homeless residents with drug addictions , HIV , tuberculosis , or mental illnesses will find it harder to access treatment if they are n't in stable housing situations .
And that , ultimately , could trigger a broader public health problem .
In cities , counties , and states across America , homeless and mental health services are being eviscerated .
As a result , programmes that have been carefully built up over decades are going to close .
With them will go the expertise of trained staff ; the accumulated experience of caseworkers who have gotten to know the needs and behaviours of individual clients , and who might have spent years getting those individuals to trust them enough to let them provide help ; and the fragile bonds , the sense of belonging , that in some instances are the only things keeping a person on the edge from spiralling into more serious illness and more intractable long - term homelessness .
There are no easy answers here : too many branches of government have simply run out of cash and of quick - fix solutions .
Without more support for these programmes from the federal government , or local ballot measures that earmark funds for particular social services , it 's inevitable that many of them will be cut in the next few years .
But , at the very least , this merits a frank conversation , an acknowledgment that the risks associated with dismantling this infrastructure are huge : tear down services to these groups during the down times and there is just no guarantee that a political consensus will emerge at the back end of the fiscal crisis to restore such services .
After all , homeless people or the seriously mentally ill do n't tend to have much of a political voice .
Their needs are , too often , seen as irrelevant .
The undermining of these vital social services will have an impact that long outlives the current economic crisis .
Nothing would more forcefully illustrate the phrase " private affluence and public squalor " , coined by progressive economist John Kenneth Galbraith , than a booming America , its landscape littered by ever more homeless encampments , ever greater numbers of untreated mentally ill people and , in consequence , a growing sense that , for the affluent majority , public spaces are unsafe and unseemly .
That happened in Victorian England ; it occurred again in both America and the UK in the 1980s .
It would be a great tragedy to let the 2010s and 2020s witness a repeat performance .
The world 's largest alarm clock is actually the sun , but I 'll look past that for the sake of this scary bitch , who 's convinced he 's made the largest .
Now I do n't want to ruin the video for you , but there is absolutely no way he originally designed that as an alarm .

New research has shown a dramatic increase in the number of long - term cannabis users being admitted to hospital .
The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre has found the number of Australians seeking treatment with cannabis - related problems has jumped 30 per cent since 2002 , with the incease in the rate of harmful use mostly among those aged over 30 .
Overall , the rate of cannabis use has been dropping .
Around 9 per cent of Australians have smoked the drug in the past year , down from 11 per cent in 2004 .
But researchers at the University of New South Wales found that people using the drug are using more , and more often .
The study has been published online in the health journal Addiction .
Amanda Roxburgh , senior researcher at the university 's National Drug and Alcohol Centre , says the rate of harmful use has dramatically increased particularly among 30 to 49 - year - olds .
" We 're seeing an increase in cannabis - related harms , particularly hospital admissions , for things like cannabis dependence in particular , " she said .
" And we 're seeing particularly in 30 to 39 - year - olds , the admissions have increased quite a bit , as have the 40 to 49 - year - old age group .
" What we think that reflects is a longer - term use over a long period of time . "
Ms Roxburgh says hospital admissions are usually for treatment for cannabis dependence , but a small number are for cannabis intoxication or cannabis - induced psychosis .
She says older users are twice as likely to report daily use compared to the 14 to 19 - year - old age group .
She says the rate of harmful use among younger people is also worrying .
" When you look at that frequency of use for that group , they 're actually much more likely to report the really , really heavy periods of use , " she said .
" So they might be smoking 10 or more joints or cones per day and they 're doing that more than the older users .
" Potentially , we might see in five or 10 years - that might be borne out in them presenting to hospital . "
David Templeman , the chief executive of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia , says the study suggests older users of cannabis are still failing to understand the consequences of long - term use .
" We 've got to really do some more work in terms of getting people to understand the impact of cannabis on people , particularly people who might have a predilection to mental health illness and the like , " he said .
" We now know so much in relation to it .
It 's the secondmost drug of concern now , behind alcohol .
" We 've got older population groups who 've grown up - if I can use that word - using cannabis , and [ if we could ] get the message to them to understand what sort of concerns they could be inflicting on themselves , we 'd probably see some significant improvement . "

North Korea 's worst concentration camp is a reeducation center where women who escaped to China are subjected to the most brutal treatment , NGO Good Friends said Monday .
The Jeungsan Reeducation Center in South Pyongan Province has a reputation for cruelty and the saying goes that even healthy people leave as cripples .
The facility was turned into a reeducation center after the regime revised the criminal law in 2004 .
Before the law was revised , North Korea had four kinds of detention centers -- reeducation , education , confinement and labor training camps in descending order of severity .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - il himself is said to have turned the center into a kind of " Papillon " prison island , giving instructions that every prisoner 's year there should feel like 10 .
The camp has since 1999 been used to detain female defectors .
The North tightened controls for fear of regime collapse amid the famine of the 1990s , which sent many fleeing hunger and starvation .
China regularly cooperated in the atrocity by sending refugees back to the North .
Short of space at political camps , the regime started to put women in the Jeungsan camp .
Hundreds of female inmates reportedly suffer malnutrition there , and two or three die every day .
Their bodies are wrapped in plastic and buried in mass graves .
One former inmate who was detained there in 2004 said that other inmates who saw mass graves with piles of human bones and bodies came away with permanent psychological scars .
A former official of the Ministry of Public Security who defected said , " The Jeungsan Reeducation Center is notorious because many more inmates die there than at any other concentration camp due to the unbearably hard labor and malnutrition . "
Jeungsan consists of 10 divisions , each of which is made up of seven to 10 groups .
Each group normally has 40 to 50 inmates .
A relatively healthy inmate is chosen as a capo who controls other inmates under the supervision of security guards .
Those caught attempting to escape or committing infractions there are not publicly executed as at other political prison camps but are tortured or killed out of sight .
continuing now with ' Britain Key To World History ' By Comyns Beaumont .
.... Although Ab 'Ram prepared strong defences at Hebron in the event of enemies approaching from the north or east , the Book of Genesis evinces his early and strong interest in the land of Havilah , which , according to it , was situated in the Garden of Eden .
In this same region , among others , was the famous city of Ai , also called Hai , or Aiath , or Ajalon .
In close proximity to Ai was Bethel , the place of the Stone of Jacob , while nearby was Beersheba , and not far distant was the Philistine city of Gath , its stronghold and capital .
In addition to these there flourished not far distant another city of great fame , providing a link with the Atlantis of Plato , namely Gades , the city of Gad , known also as Tartessus or as Tarshish .
Its earliest Bible name was Sodom , destroyed by the hand of God by means of fire from heaven .
The name Sodom signifies the city of the south .
It is this region I propose to examine for further clues to the pre-history of Britain , as culled from Biblical , Greek , and native sources .
When Ab'Ram and Lot parted company the latter patriarch moved to the plain of Jordan and termed it " The Garden of the Lord , " pitching his tent towards Sodom , whose descendants , according to the same Book of Genesis , became the Ammonites and Moabites .
Of the important ( Page 52 ) tribe of Gad , whose totem was the Old Lion , and who were Cushites ( or Chaldeans ) , we are told that its later borders reached to Jazer ( or Gaza ) , all Gilead and half the land to Aroer before ( or opposite ) Rabbah .

I recently received an email from my company ’s 401 k plan manager asking me the question : “ have you got enough cushion ? ”
In other words , they were asking , based on the amount of money I ’m contributing to retirement today , if it will be enough ?
Further into the note , their suggestion was to save as much as I can now in order to have padding to pursue my future goals .
So , what is the best way to determine how much you ’re going to need to save for retirement ?
Let me start by saying I ’m not a financial professional , or a retirement planner .
I do n’t claim to know all the aspects of retirement planning , but I think this post will give you some important points to consider for your situation .
With retirement savings not being my primary goal right now , I did a little bit of research to find out what types of resources are available to tell me how much I need to save when the time is right .
Almost instantly , I found an interesting post from J.D. Roth at Get Rich Slowly exploring this topic further .
J.D. identifies a common dilemma in retirement planning .
The problem is that nobody seems to agree on what assumptions to make when planning for retirement .
How much should you assume for inflation ?
For investment returns ?
For rising health - care costs ?
How long should you expect to live ?
Is there really not a good way to determine how much you need to save for retirement and are we better off just maxing out savings as much as we can today ?
Perhaps focusing on the amount to contribute is the wrong approach .
Focus On How Much You ’re Going To Spend
Rather than focus on how much to save , J.D. leans towards finding out how much you ’re going to spend and says :
If you can live a lifestyle that is comfortable but not extravagant , you will effectively decrease the amount you need to save for retirement .
This approach makes a lot of sense to me .
It seems a logical approach to planning for the retirement years is to do the following :
Consider what you ’ll be doing and the associated lifestyle .
Adjust your lifestyle as much as possible today to align or to eventually transition into your lifestyle at retirement Build your savings goals , investment strategy based on that chosen lifestyle .
Of course , there is still the dilemma of estimating all of those other items such as inflation , returns , etc. , but I suppose that ’s probably best to leave that up to investment calculators and financial advisors of your choice .
So , if my focus is on what I ’ll be doing and how I ’ll be spending ( and not blindly saving hoping for the best lifestyle possible ) , I think I can make some fairly accurate assumptions .
Retirement – A New Idea ?
According to an MSN article retirement is a fairly new idea :
The whole concept of retirement is fairly recent , an experiment that began with the creation of Social Security in 1935 , observes Ken Dychtwald , a gerontologist and authority on aging in the U.S .
Scripture does n’t mention such a thing either .
Larry Burkett references Numbers 8:24 - 26 .
He tells us the following :
As long as one is physically and mentally capable there is no scriptural basis for a person to retire and become unproductive .
Personally , I do n’t consider my future retirement years as workless .
What about you ?
Rather , I hope to position myself to achieve true financial freedom .
To me , this means I ’ll be able to give more of my time and resources to help others .
And you probably would guess that ’s helping people in the area of personal finance .
My friend John Gay , who is a financial planner and advisor , wrote an article at One Money Design during last year ’s retirement week .
His advice :
If retirement is like landing a plane , what is the best retirement plan ?
Do n’t land the plane ( just let it run out of gas ) .
How Much Do I Need To Save ?
Considering my plane is n’t going to land ( I know what I want to do in retirement ) and I can probably do some estimating around this lifestyle , I can then get back to the original question of how much I need to save .
So , how should you go about answering that question and identifying the savings amount ?
1. Regardless of where you are with emergency savings and debt reduction you should save up to the minimum amount required to receive a company match on 401k contributions .
2 . Next , there are a number of retirement calculators on the internet provided by trusted websites .
I think this is a good place to start .
I think this one from MSN Money is a pretty good retirement calculator .
2a . Visit with a financial advisor to discuss your lifestyle at retirement and seek some planning advice .
3 . And finally , when it ’s the right point on my financial journey ( debt paid off and emergency savings funded ) ; I ’ll increase my contributions as much as possible to provide for my future lifestyle .
Final Thoughts
In closing , I ’ve decided not to join the panic about retirement savings .
While I think everyone should save and invest for the future , I do n’t think it should replace important goals such as getting out of debt and building emergency savings .
The only time there is an exception to this rule is when a company provides a match to your contributions .
Invest to get the match if you can still make forward progress on debt or emergency savings goals .
When I reach the point of extending my contributions , I ’ll consider my lifestyle and save accordingly .
But beyond all of the calculating and planning , I ’ll trust God to provide for my needs and put me where he wants to me to serve Him .
What ’s your take ?
How do you plan to make sure you ’re saving enough for retirement ?
Mike Arrington brings us news that Facebook is working on a full - fledged email product , with the aim of eventually killing Gmail , Yahoo Mail , AOL Mail and other web - based email systems .
This is brilliant .
Why ?
Because Facebook is ideally positioned to build a gigantic web - based mail and messaging system .
It is much better positioned , in fact , than Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , and any other competitor .
Facebook has become the center of the online world for hundreds of millions of people for a simple reason :
It 's a great way to communicate .
Facebook users already keep in touch with friends via Facebook .
They connect with friends via Facebook .
They share via Facebook .
If Facebook users can now use Facebook as their primary address book , email , chat , and VOIP platform , they will build even more of their lives around it .
Contrast Facebook 's positioning with the core reasons people visit Yahoo , Google , and Microsoft , none of which have anything to do with communications .
Yahoo is about aggregated content .
Google is about search .
Microsoft is about ... well , we 're not sure what Microsoft is about , but it 's not focused on communications .
Those who do n't use Facebook to communicate , moreover , do n't use it because Facebook 's current communication system can be really annoying .
For example , it forces you to visit Facebook anytime you want to respond to anyone who has communicated with you ( fine for core users , annoying for the rest of us ) .
Building a full - fledged communications platform could bring a much wider group of Facebook users into the fold .
Will it be challenging for Facebook to succeed with an email product ?
Absolutely .
If Facebook produces a crappy email system , no one will use it .
If Facebook produces an excellent email system , however , it has a huge opportunity here .
Google has already demonstrated that it 's possible to come from behind in web mail .
Google 's insistence on doing email differently , meanwhile , has left a gaping hole for a company to do it the way users actually want it .
Yahoo Mail , meanwhile , has been deteriorating for years , and the company just does n't seem eager to fix it .
And Microsoft is still mostly concerned with protecting the paid Outlook monopoly .
So email is a great opportunity for Facebook — and a smart way for the company to spend its money .

Openbench Logic Sniffer is an open source logic analyzer .
It ’s designed to support the SUMP logic analyzer software at the lowest possible cost .
Download the source and design files from the Gadget Factory project page .
This project started in the comments on a post .
Initial circuit design , PCB layout , development , and testing continued in the forum under the code name Project SUMP PUMP .
Many , many people contributed ideas and advice , the Gadget Factory and Dangerous Prototypes coordinated circuit development and routed the PCB .
We borrowed heavily from the Gadget Factory ’s Butterfly Platform .
The Open Logic Sniffer is a purpose - built logic analyzer board designed to be low cost but high speed .
It sacrifices a lot of the features you ’d look for in a full - scale development board to achieve our primary goals :
70MHz + sample speeds
32 channels
16 buffered , 5 volt tolerant channels
USB interface , USB powered
USB upgradable everything
Make it as DIY as possible
Make it as open source as possible
$ 30 - $ 40 price range
We did n’t quite hit our initial price range , but we got really close .
You can get your own assembled Open Logic Sniffer at Seeed Studio for $ 45 , including worldwide shipping .
Continue reading about the design and collaboration below .
Concept Overview
SUMP
SUMP is an open source Java logic analyzer client by Michael Poppitz .
It consists of two parts , a VHDL logic capture engine for FPGAs , and a Java logic analyzer client .
The latest development version of the SUMP client is available from SourceForge.net .
SUMP is a sampling logic analyzer .
It reads the state of the input pins and stores the samples in internal ram .
It then dumps the samples back to the computer client for analysis .
The number of samples possible is limited by the RAM in the FPGA .
We like SUMP because it ’s the best developed open source logic analyzer toolchain currently available .
It has lots of professional features like multi-stage triggers , configurable pre-roll , external trigger and clock sync , and a few protocol analyzers ( I2C , UART ) .
It ’s open source , so the potential to add cool new features is limited only by your imagination and coding skills .
SUMP is typically ported to a general - purpose FPGA development board .
We took a different approach and designed hardware specifically for SUMP , while constraining costs wherever possible .
Other logic analyzers
Professional logic analyzers have tons of channels and super high speeds .
We ’re not trying to make a low cost DIY version of these tools , the OLS is n’t an alternative to these types of tools if you need to sniff 100M Hz + signals and have huge sample sizes .
Being an engineer ’s tool , there are plenty of DIY logic analyzer designs .
Parallel port based logic analyzers used to be all the rage , but with parallel ports and direct interrupt access disappearing from systems , these are just historical curiosities .
Another type of DIY logic analyzer is a microcontroller - based device .
There are several with custom interfaces like the PIC Logix , Scanalogic , and AVR Logic Analyzer .
The Bus Pirate works with SUMP .
Microcontroller analyzers all have one thing in common : they ’re really slow , usually sub-megahertz .
USB IO chip - based hobby logic analyzers are currently popular .
We ’ve always been fans of the Saleae Logic , the USBee is similar .
These devices are just a USB IO chip like a CY7C68013A - 56PVXC , with all trigger and processing logic done in software on a computer .
The hardware part is just a datalogger .
The top sampling speed is usually around 24 Msps ( 24MHz ) , if the conditions on your USB bus are just right .
They can take ‘ unlimited ’ samples because everything is stored on the computer .
Current models tend to be 8 channels , more channels would reduce the maximum speed proportionately .
These are commercial products with highly polished user interfaces , we do n’t know of any that are open source .
The Open Logic Sniffer sits somewhere between hobby analyzers and professional analyzers .
The OLS samples up to 200 Msps , regardless of the USB bus traffic , and has true hardware triggers .
The OLS has twice as many buffered channels as most hobby USB analyzers , and four times more channels overall .
The major difference is that the OLS has a limited number of samples , while the hobby USB analyzers can theoretically take infinite samples .
Most of our debugging is done with the first few hundred samples , so this feature is n’t usually important to our work , your situation may be different .
Future versions of the OLS will definitely have more sample storage , and we can work an infinite sampling mode into a future firmware update too .
Our Design
Click for a full size circuit diagram [ PNG ] .
This circuit diagram , maintained by Uwe Bannow , shows the basic elements of the Open Logic Sniffer hardware .
The FPGA captures logic samples from 32 input pins into internal RAM .
The samples are dumped out a serial port for analysis on a computer .
The open source SUMP logic analyzer client is used to capture and visualize the samples .
The FPGA only communicates over a serial port , so we used a USB microcontroller to convert the serial IO to a USB virtual serial port .
The entire chain is upgradable through the USB connection .
The microcontroller can program updated logic analyzer designs into the SPI flash data chip , and the microcontroller can also be updated from its USB bootloader .
We chose a USB microcontroller over a dedicated USB interface chip .
A low pincount PIC was cheaper than most other USB bridge options .
It ’s USB 2.0 compliant , and can transfer data at up to 12 M bps .
We ’re using it with the completely open virtual serial port CDC interface , so it will work on almost any platform without proprietary drivers .
The PIC can also implement other USB transfer protocols with a firmware update , faster connection methods can be supported when someone adds support for them to the SUMP client software .
Currently the SUMP FPGA design only transfers data over a 115200 bps serial UART , the speed between the USB PIC and the computer is n’t a bottleneck .
We routed several extra connections between the PIC and FPGA to implement a high - speed SPI interface in the future .
The speed increase of an SPI interface can be supported in the SUMP client just by adding higher serial port speed settings .
An FTDI2232 chip was strongly considered as an alternative to the PIC .
Here ’s how we looked at it :
Benefits of the FTDI2232 with MSSP :
JTAG interface to debug the FPGA
SPI interface to program the ROM
SPI and UART interface to the FPGA
Cons :
Difficult to route
Expensive to place
Huge software development burden
Needs special drivers
USB interface not already supported by SUMP
With so much to accomplish already , major modifications to the client to work with untested hardware and custom drivers did n’t seem appealing .
Not if the project were ever going to get finished .
The PIC seemed like the best route for the first version .
Hardware
Click for a large image of the schematic [ PNG ] .
The schematic is divided into a microcontroller part [ PNG ] and a FPGA part [ PNG ] .
These sections are where Ian and Jack initially split the design work .
We used the freeware version of Cadsoft Eagle to make the circuit and PCB .

FPGA
A Xilinx Spartan 3E field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) is the central component of the logic analyzer .
The FPGA samples data from 16 buffered and 16 unbuffered IO pins , and stores the samples in internal RAM .
The samples are later dumped out a serial UART to the PIC , and from the PIC to a computer via USB .
The basic FPGA schematic and PCB layout is taken directly from the Gadget Factory ’s Butterfly Platform main board .
The OLS shows how versatile the Butterfly Platform is as a development tool .
The initial designs where first tested on the Butterfly Platform , and then we used the base design to create a unique , purpose - build hardware based on the prototype .
You can get a Butterfly platform to build your own prototypes at the Gadget Factory for $ 99 .
The FPGA ( IC3 ) requires three different power supplies .
The core requires 1.2volts and 2.5volts , and the IO pins run at 3.3 volts .
Each supply pin gets a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C11 - 26 ) .
We brought the JTAG programming and debugging connection to a header in the interior of the PCB .
The JTAG header provides 2.5V to external JTAG programmers to satisfy the Spartan 3E ’s requirements for 2.5V on the dedicated JTAG pins .
Several control and indication signals require special attention .
INIT_B enables the FPGA when high , it ’s held to 3.3volts with a 4.7 K pull - up resistor ( R6 ) .
The DONE signal goes high to indicate that the FPGA is configured and ready to use after a reset .
It ’s held to 2.5 volts by a 300 ohm resistor ( R1 ) .
PROG_B , held at 2.5 volts by a 4.7 K pull - up resistor ( R5 ) , can be pulled low to put the FPGA in programming mode .
The HSWAP pin ( not shown ) determines if all pins have pull - up resistors in programming mode .
We grounded HSWAP so that all pins have weak pull - ups when PROG_B is low .
FPGAs are volatile programmable chips , they lose their configuration without power .
The FPGA configuration , called a bitstream , has to be loaded into the chip each time it starts .
We configured the FPGA to automatically load a bitstream from an SPI ROM chip by wiring the mode select pins as follows : M0 ( 3.3volts ) , M1( 0volts ) , M2( 3.3volts ) .
The FPGA runs from a 50 Mhz oscillator ( Q2 ) .
This is a complete clock generation module , no external capacitors are required .
The 50 Mhz clock is doubled to 100 Mhz by an internal Digital Clock Manager ( DCM ) to provide the 100 Mhz clock required by the VHDL core .
Two LEDs indicate the FPGA status .
The ARM LED indicates when a trigger is set and the device is actively waiting for the trigger .
The TRIG LED indicates when a trigger has been activated .
We used 390R current limiting resistors ( R8 , R9 ) on the prototype , but the assembled board should ship with 1K1 resistors to make the LEDs dimmer .
Buffered inputs
The FPGA IO pins are powered by 3.3volts , and can tolerate no more than a 3.3 volt signal .
The M74LCX16245DTR2G buffer ( IC4 ) allows 16 buffered pins to sniff 5 volt logic and can tolerate voltages from - 0.5 to +7 V .
This chip is also powered by the 3.3 volt supply , and it gets a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C9 ) on the supply pin .
Clock / trigger headers
The logic analyzer can sync with other test equipment and should allow OLS ’s to be daisy chained together for more channels .
It can be driven by an external clock and trigger , and it also outputs its internal clock and trigger .
You can tap these signals from the some - what awkwardly placed pin block in the middle of the PCB .
The external clock input had to be on an FPGA global clock pin , this was the best possible location to access it because no sensitive high - speed signals were routed across other traces .
Wing header
A wing is an accessory for the Gadget Factory Butterfly Platform development board .
It uses a standardized header and pinout .
The header has 16bits of 3.3 volt IO , and 2.5 , 3.3 , and 5 volt power supplies .
We added a wing header to the OLS so it can use accessories developed on the Butterfly Platform , like a digital sampling oscilloscope .
This has the added benefit of making the OLS compatible with a bunch of existing Butterfly Platform accessories .
ROM
The FPGA programs itself with a bitstream stored in a 4 M bit AT45DB041D SPI flash storage chip ( IC2 ) , we refer to it as a ROM .
We previously demonstrated this chip with the Bus Pirate .
It ’s powered by the 3.3 volt supply , and requires a 0.1 uF capacitor ( C10 ) on the supply pin .
The XC3S250E bitstream will fit into a 2 M bit flash chip , but only 4 M bit chips were available when we sourced parts .
The ROM chip has an SPI interface that connects to the FPGA , the PIC microcontroller , and an external programming header .
The FPGA mode select pin configuration causes the FPGA to load a bitstream from the ROM chip .
When the bitstream is finished loading , the DONE signal goes high , and the FPGA is programmed and active .
The PIC can ( re ) program the ROM with updated bitstreams .
The PIC holds the FPGA PROG_B line low in this mode so the FPGA releases control of the ROM chip .
The external header can be used to program the ROM from a programmer .
Place a jumper between the PGM and EN pins to manually place the FPGA in programming mode .
Microcontroller
A PIC 18F24J50 microcontroller ( IC1 ) is the interface glue .
It has these functions :
Provides a USB -> serial connection from the SUMP Java client to the SUMP hardware in the FPGA Puts the FPGA in programming mode and updates the ROM with a new bitstream A USB bootloader can be used to update the PIC firmware
The 18xxJxx chips are really interesting , and seem like a hybrid of the 24 F and 18 F families .
This PIC has the instruction set and 8 bit core of the 18 F family , but many enhanced features of the 16bit PICs .
Half of the UARTs and SPI modules are assigned with peripheral pin select , it has flash configuration words , and it runs on 3.3volts , like a 16 bit PIC .
The PPS features are really handy and make the clean layout of the PCB possible .
The ROM SPI connection and FPGA UART connection are both assigned to custom pins with PPS .
PPS can be used to implement a high - speed ( 10 Mbit + ) SPI connection between the PIC and FPGA in a future firmware upgrade .
The PIC is powered by 3.3volts , the supply pin gets a 0.1 uF capacitor ( C7 ) .
The USB peripheral has a separate 3.3 volt supply pin that also needs a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C8 ) .
A 10uF capacitor ( C4 ) is required for the internal 2.5 volt core supply regulator .
An external oscillator provides an accurate USB clock , we used a 20MHz crystal ( Q1 ) and two 27 pF capacitors ( C5 , C6 ) .
A 10 K resistor ( R3 ) holds the PIC reset pin high for normal operation , the RESET button ( S1 ) grounds it to cause a hard reset .
A second button ( S2 , R4 ) is available for simple user input .
The LED ACT is a general purpose indicator LED controlled by the PIC through current limiting resistor R7 .
The PWR ( power ) LED is connected to the USB supply though current limiting resistor R2 , it illuminates whenever the board is powered .
We also brought the one of the hardware UARTs to a header .
The pins are 5 volt tolerant , and can be interfaced at up to 5volts without damaging the PIC .
This header can be used for a ‘ classic ’ serial port connection .
The board can also be powered through the UART header supply pins .
Power supply
The board is intended to be powered by the 5volt supply from a USB port .
Three regulators provide the three supply rails required by the circuit .
All the chips require a 3.3 volt supply ( VR1 ) , the FPGA also requires a 1.2volt ( VR3 ) and 2.5 volt ( VR2 ) supply .
As recommended by the datasheet , there ’s a 10uF capacitor ( C27 ) on the supply line , and each regulator has a 1.0 uF capacitor ( C1 - 3 ) on the output pin .
Numbering
The OLS has two different numbering schemes , one on the inside of the board and one on the outside of the board .
The inside numbering scheme starts with zero on the buffered header .
The outside numbering scheme starts with zero on the Wing header .
Currently the numbering scheme can be selected by loading a bitstream that implements either numbering scheme .
Future updates will support selecting the numbering scheme through the Java Logic Analyzer client .
PCB
We used the freeware version of Cadsoft Eagle to make the schematic and PCB .
Download the latest files at the Gadget Factory project page .
The PCB is nearly the maximum allowable size in Eagle .
All the components are surface mount , but we stuck with traditional through - hole headers .
It took us an hour or two to solder each prototype board by hand .
We had boards made with the $ 50 Seeed Studio Fusion board service .
This design probably would have been ready a bit sooner , but the PCBs were delayed about a month by the major Hong Kong Post Christmas mail rush .

OLS Design Changes
The OLS uses the open source ( GPL ) SUMP logic analyzer VHDL design .
It ’s synthesized with the free Xilinx ISE Web Pack tool suite .
Our design is based on Jonas Diemer ’s Spartan 3E SUMP port [ ZIP ] .
The following modifications were made for the OLS hardware :
A new ucf ( User Constraint File ) was generated to map the pins of the FPGA to the layout of the OLS board and to support multiple numbering schemes .
Support for outputting the sample clock to an external pin was added .
Support for adding an external pin as a trigger was added .
Added support for Trigger and ARM LED’s .
Files for multiple BRAM memory configurations were added .
The files were generated with the Xilinx Core generator and are Xilinx specific .
Memory
The OLS utilizes BRAM ( Block Ram ) that is embedded inside the Spartan 3E FPGA , the included XC3S250E chip has 216K of BRAM available .
There are six bitstreams that allocate the available memory into different combinations of memory depth and sampling channels .
Currently the following memory / channel configurations are available :
32 channels with 4 k sample depth .
16 channels with 8 k sample depth .
8 channels with 16 k sample depth .
You may have noticed that the above numbers do n’t add up to the 216 K of BRAM that is available .
With 8 channels we should be able to get 216k / 8 = 27 k samples .
The first issue is that the published size of 216 K of BRAM includes parity bits , without parity bits we actually have 192K of BRAM available .
The second issue is that the Sump design is setup to require a power of 8 for its sample depth , so until the Sump design can be modified we are stuck with the above power of 8 sample depths .
Once these two issues are resolved the possible memory / channel configurations will be :
32 channels with 6 k sample depth .
16 channels with 13 k sample depth .
8 channels with 27 k sample depth .
Our future design plans do include working on adding 32 - 64 Mb of SDRAM memory .
Bitstreams
The output of the Xilinx Webpack synthesis tools is a bitstream file that is used to configure the FPGA .
We convert the bitstream ( *.bit ) file to an Intel Hex format ( *.mcs ) using the Xilinx Impact application .
The bitstream is then loaded , by the PIC , into the Atmel SPI Flash chip .
When power is applied to the OLS the FPGA configures itself by loading the bitstream from the SPI Flash chip .
There are currently six different bitstreams that provide for 3 different memory configurations and 2 different numbering schemes .
Currently , the bitstreams have to be loaded with the pump - loader executable .
Future revisions will load the desired bitstream from the Java Logic Analyzer client .
The current bitstream options are :
32 channels with 4 k sample depth , inside numbering scheme .
16 channels with 8 k sample depth , inside numbering scheme .
8 channels with 16 k sample depth , inside numbering scheme .
32 channels with 4 k sample depth , outside numbering scheme .
16 channels with 8 k sample depth , outside numbering scheme .
8 channels with 16 k sample depth , outside numbering scheme .
RLE
Run Length Encoding ( RLE ) helps make the most efficient use of available memory .
With RLE enabled memory is only filled when there is activity .
If there is a period of inactivity it is represented in memory with a value instead of a large block of empty space .
A practical example would be with capturing UART data .
In many cases there is a burst of continuous activity while an 8 bit character is sent across the channel , but then there will be a very long period of inactivity before the next character is sent across the channel .
Without RLE the available memory would quickly be filled up with empty space and you would only be able to capture one or two characters .
With RLE only the activity is captured and the long pauses in between characters is represented with a value that indicates how long the pause is instead .
This allows many more characters to be captured .
RLE was added to the SUMP VHDL design by Jonas Diemer when he released a BRAM based design .
RLE has worked very well with simple waveforms but needs further testing with more complex signals like the UART example outlined above .
Sampling
OLS supports sampling rates from 10 Hz ( 10sps ) to 200 Mhz ( 200 Msps ) and has been able to capture perfect , generated waveforms up to 100 Mhz .
As a general rule of thumb you need at least twice the sampling rate of the waveform you are capturing .
If you are trying to capture a 100 Mhz waveform then you need a 200 Mhz sampling rate , if you are trying to capture a 50 Mhz waveform then you need a 100 Mhz sampling rate .
In practice this rule of thumb does not always hold up , some sources advise having at least 5 times the sampling rate of a captured waveform .
In our tests with repeating , simple , perfect waveforms we have been able to use the twice the sampling rate rule of thumb .
We have seen that the results with the unbuffered 3.3V pins are better at higher speeds than the 5V buffered pins .
Triggering
The Sump VHDL core supports simple and complex triggering on all available channels .
Complex triggering supports 4 stages of parallel or serial triggering .
Triggers can be configured with how much of the waveform is captured before and after the trigger .
A trigger ratio of 50/50 puts the trigger in the center of the captured waveform .
Simple triggering supports a Mask to indicate which channels to trigger on and a Value to indicate whether to trigger on a ‘ 1 ’ or ‘ 0 ’ .
Click on the image above to see how a trigger can be configured to trigger on a value of ‘ 1 ’ on channel 0 .
For a deeper explanation about triggers take a look at the excellent Oak Micros Logic Analyzer Guide .
Clocks
The Sump VHDL core is driven by the external 50 Mhz oscillator or an external clock connected to the CKI pin , the desired clock can be selected in the Java client .
The default is to use the 50 Mhz clock which is doubled internally to 100 Mhz by one of four Digital Clock Managers ( DCM ) .
This 100 Mhz clock is labeled as Internal in the Sump client options dialog .
The external clock is connected without modification to the sampling section and the Sampling Rate option will be disabled .
When the Internal clock is used the sampling rate can be set from 10 Hz up to 200 Mhz .
When 200 Mhz is selected a Double Data Rate technique is used and the signal is sampled on both the rising and falling edge of the 100 Mhz clock .
In this mode the amount of available channels is cut in half to free up memory for the additional samples .
For example , if the bitstream is configured to support 32 channels with 4 k samples of memory then there is a 4 k block of memory that is 32 bits wide allocated within the FPGA .
Each channel corresponds to one of the 32 memory bits and is 4 k deep .
When 200 Mhz is selected twice the amount of memory is required to store the samples , so in order to keep the 4 k deep sampling space the available channels would be reduced to 16 .
The bottom 16 bits of memory store the samples at the rising edge and the top 16 bits of memory store the samples at the falling edge .
Proposed Changes
Changing the design to support all available BRAM memory .
There is a SRAM and a BRAM memory interface available , integrating a SDRAM controller is desirable since SRAM is much more expensive than SDRAM .
Replace the UART controller with a SPI controller to enable USB speeds up to 12 Mb/s .
Add a register to indicate the memory depth , amount of supported channels , and numbering scheme of a bitstream .
The Java client could then query the register and give a visual indication of what numbering scheme , how many channels , and amount of memory that the bitstream currently running on the FPGA supports .
PIC Firmware
The latest PIC firmware and source is available from the Gadget Factory project page .
The code is written in C , and is compiled with the Microchip C18 demonstration compiler .
The bootloader is written in ASM and compiled with the PIC 18 assembler .
We used Microchip ’s free , but non-distributable , USB stack source code to provide USB support in this project .
To compile the firmware you need to download the USB stack source directly from Microchip , then follow the directions at the top of main.c in the OLS source code .
A major goal of this project is to create an open source virtual serial port code base to replace the non-distributable Microchip USB stack .
The PIC is the interface glue for the circuit .
It has three operating modes :
Normal – a serial port to USB bridge for the SUMP logic analyzer ROM Updater – upload a new FPGA bitstream to the ROM chip Bootloader – update the main firmware in the PIC
Normal mode
The PIC usually operates in a transparent USB -> serial bridge that connects the SUMP build in the FPGA with the SUMP client on a computer .
This is the default startup mode after a reset or power - up .
Press the reset button to enter normal operating mode from any other mode .
After a reset , the ACT LED will blink while the FPGA loads the bitstream contained in the ROM chip .
If the FPGA does n’t load after a few seconds , because of an error or blank ROM chip , the PIC will automatically enter ROM update mode and the ACT LED will illuminate ( see ROM updater below ) .
The ACT LED will turn off when the FPGA is configured and ready .
The OLS then enumerates as a USB virtual serial port device .
The first time you plug it in , you may need to feed Windows the .inf file in the project archive to assign driver to the device .
Once enumerated , the ACT LED blinks to indicate any USB activity .
ROM Updater
ROM updater mode is used to program a new FPGA bitstream into the flash storage chip .
This feature lets us release FPGA design updates that can be loaded over the USB interface .
To enter ROM update mode , press the reset button while holding the update button .
The PIC will also automatically enter ROM update mode if the FPGA does n’t load correctly because of an error or blank ROM chip .
The ACT LED will light in this mode .
The OLS enumerates as a USB virtual serial port in ROM update mode , this is the same connection type as the normal operating mode .
The first time you plug it in , give Windows the .inf file from the project folder to assign the correct drivers to the device .
Use the pump - loader console utility for Windows , Linux , or Mac to load the updated FPGA bitstream .
There ’s also a pump - loader .
pl
Perl utility that we used during initial development .
ROM update procedure
Press the reset button while holding the update button .
The ACT LED will light and the OLS will enumerate as a USB virtual serial port .
C:\pump> pump - loader -p:COM5 - status PUMP loader Opening serial port ' COM5 ' @ 921600 ... OK Found PUMP HW : 1 , FW : 0.1 , Boot : 1 Found flash : ATMEL AT45DB041D no input file specified !

Use pump - loader to write a SUMP FPGA bitstream to the ROM chip .
If you use the - run flag it will exit to normal operating mode when the upload is complete .

Special thanks to Michal Demin , Piotr Pawluczuk , and Uwe Bannow for working on the pump - loader utility .
Michal won our developer ’s challenge with his lightning - quick coding skills .
Bootloader
We used the Diolan open source ( GPL ) USB bootloader in this project .
The bootloader appears as a USB HID device , and a small utility uploads a new firmware to the PIC .
We started with the bootloader source from the Dangerous Prototypes ’ USB Infrared Toy and ported it to the 18F24J50 .
The Diolan bootloader is intended for the PIC18F2550 family of USB PICs .
We had to make several modifications to get it working on the 18F24J50 :
Changed the configuration fuses
Added clock switching and PLL startup delay
Added register bank switches , where required .
Changed sleep mode to idle for 18fx4J50 PLL system
Changed page write ( 64bytes ) to word write ( 2bytes )
One of the big issues we encountered with the port was a difference in flash page write size between the regular and ‘ j’ PICs .
The Diolan bootloader supports PICs that write flash memory in 32 byte chunks ( pages ) .
The ‘ j ’ chip writes flash in 2 byte or 64 byte chunks .
The bootloader is designed to send an entire page worth of data in a single USB HID packet .
HID packets are 64 bytes long , once you include a few bytes of header there ’s not enough room in a single HID packet to transfer 64 bytes of data to write to the flash memory .
Our quick solution was to take advantage of the 2 byte word write mode and make a custom compile of the Diolan utility that sends only 2 bytes in each HID packet .
This slows down the update because most of the USB HID packet is wasted .
It would be far faster to use the 64 byte write mode and send 64 bytes of data over two HID packets with a flush flag in the second .
We hope to improve this with a new upgrade utility , the functionality is already supported in the bootloader firmware .
If you ’re working with a fresh chip , program the bootloader into the PIC using the 5 pin ICSP header .
You ’ll need a PICKIT or ICD programmer to load the bootloader the first time .
Enter bootloader mode by placing a jumper between PGC and PGD pins and press the reset button , or run the pump - loader utility with the - b flag .
The ACT LED will light when the bootloader is active .
Use the fw_update . exe utility to load new PIC firmware with the bootloader .
Firmware update procedure
Place a jumper between the PGC and PGD pins of the ICSP header .
Plug in USB .
ACT LED lights .
Bootloader enumerates as an HID device .
Remove the jumper .
If you remove it now the bootloader will reset into user mode automatically , if not it will just return to the bootloader .
C:\firmware > fw_update -e -w -vid 0x04D8 - pid 0xFC90 - ix v1-pumpfirmware -v0a.hex U2IO flash erasing : DONE .
U2IO flash programming : DONE .
RESET Device Operation successfully completed .
C:\firmware > pause Press any key to continue . . .
Run the firmware loader , or just use pump - program .bat .
The chip is erased and then ( slowly ) programmed .
Slowly is 30 seconds -ish .
If we fix the app it will program in 1 - 2 seconds .
Remove the jumper ( if you did n’t earlier ) .
Look for more detailed upgrade guides in the Open Logic Sniffer links page .
Special thanks to Piotr Pawluczuk for getting the firmware update utility to compile for us .
Using it
Install Java , the rxtx serial port library , and the SUMP client .
The Gadget Factory has a version compiled from the latest source code .
There is also a Windows compile of SUMP that does n’t require you to install Java .
We ’ll give you a brief overview of the SUMP client below , but be sure to download Oak Micros ’ detailed SUMP manual .
Open SUMP .
Press the rocket button .
Configure SUMP as shown here .
Change the serial port to match the OLS serial port on your system .
Select channel groups to sample .
Group 0 and 1 represent the 16 buffered channels .
Group 2 and 3 are the 16 unbuffered channels on the wing header .
The OLS can capture 16 k samples with 8 channels , 8 k samples with 16 channels , and 4 k samples on 32 channels .
All speed settings are valid .
Click capture to start .
Sampling can also be triggered by a change on one or more pins .
Enable the trigger by checking the enable box .
Check the mask bits to set the state of the input pins that will trigger sampling .
Optionally configure multiple trigger stages .
Configure the number of samples to capture before and after the trigger event .
Click capture .
The ARM LED lights to indicate that the analyzer is active .
A match to the selected pins triggers sampling .
Taking it further
The OLS has been a collaborative community effort .
We designed the entire toolchain to be as flexible and upgradable as possible .
Here ’s some of the ideas we have for upgrades and improvements :
Implement a high speed SPI connection between the PIC and FPGA to improve sample download speeds .
SUMP client will need a minor modification to include higher serial port baud rates , up to 12MBPS .
Add more protocol analyzers to the SUMP Java logic analyzer client .
The PIC can be configured for other USB protocols for clients that support them .
Add bulk transfers for a continuous sampling mode .
We ’re already working on an open source digital sampling oscilloscope wing .
Improve the bootloader update speed .
Cleanup the firmware update code .
Create an open source compatible USB virtual serial port firmware .
A future hardware revision may include SRAM or a bigger FPGA chip to store more samples .

The Lancet today finally retracted the paper that sparked a crisis in MMR vaccination across the UK , following the General Medical Council 's decision that its lead author , Andrew Wakefield , had been dishonest .
The medical journal 's editor , Richard Horton , told the Guardian today that he realised as soon as he read the GMC findings that the paper , published in February 1998 , had to be retracted .
" It was utterly clear , without any ambiguity at all , that the statements in the paper were utterly false , " he said .
" I feel I was deceived . "
Many in the scientific and medical community have been pressing for the paper , linking the MMR ( measles , mumps and rubella ) jab to bowel disease and autism , to be quashed .
But Horton said he did not have the evidence to do so before the end of the GMC investigation last Thursday .
In 2004 , when concerns were first raised about the conduct of the study , the Lancet asked the Royal Free hospital , where Wakefield and his fellow authors worked , to investigate .
But Professor Humphrey Hodgson , then vice - dean of the Royal Free and University College school of medicine , wrote to the journal to say it had found no problems .
" We are entirely satisfied that the investigations performed on children reported in the Lancet paper had been subjected to appropriate and rigorous ethical scrutiny , " he said at that time .
The GMC last week disagreed .
Children had been subjected to invasive procedures that were not warranted , a disciplinary panel ruled .
They had undergone lumbar punctures and other tests solely for research purposes and without valid ethical approval .
Wakefield " was dishonest " , said Horton .
" He deceived the journal . "
The Lancet had done what it could to establish that the research was valid , by having it peer - reviewed .
But there is a limit , he said , to what peer - review can ascertain .
" Peer review is the best system we have got for checking accuracy and acceptability of work , but unless we went into the lab or examined every case record , we can't ever finally rule out some element of misconduct .
The entire system depends upon trust .
Most of the time we think it works well , but there will be a few instances – and when they happen they are huge instances – where the whole thing falls apart . "
When journals have suspicions of fraud or misconduct , they have to refer them to the institution employing the scientists .
" We rely on the processes within institutions to investigate allegations of fraud , and if they are found to be wanting , that is extremely disappointing , " he said .
Dr Michael Fitzpatrick , author of books on the MMR scare , said the retraction was " good news – only 10 years too late " .
The FCC has been asking plenty of " innocent questions " lately about the mobile space .
It does n't threaten any direct action against companies like AT&T and Apple , it just wants " a more complete understanding " of some situations .
But those questions usually get results .
The latest target ( PDF ) of FCC questions - by - letter is Verizon Wireless , which recently doubled some of its early termination fees ( ETFs ) .
An ETF is paid by a subscriber who cancels service before a contract expires , and it's used to ensure that you can't just buy a subsidized smartphone for $ 200 and cancel service a month later , leaving Verizon Wireless to cover several hundred dollars of the device 's actual price .
But is it about more than recouping this amount ?
The FCC is n't sure , but it has some questions about the newly doubled ETFs for " advanced devices " ( smartphones ) .
Question 6 , for example , notes that " if a customer cancels a two - year contract after 23 months , the customer would still owe an ETF of $ 120 .
Is this correct ?
If the ETF is meant to recoup the wholesale cost of the phone over the life of the contract , why does a $ 120 ETF apply ? "
There 's much more along these lines .
The FCC also wants a detailed accounting of the " the cost differentials that Verizon pays for advanced devices over what it charges its customers . "
It wants to know how consumers would find out about the ETF " other than by calling up the formal Customer Agreement accessible in small type at the bottom of the web page . "
And it 's curious about how customers might learn " the formula for prorating the ETF other than in the formal Customer Agreement . "
The FCC letter , sent today , requests a response by December 17 as part of two FCC investigations — one into the entire field of ETFs and the other into how wireless companies disclose useful information on such topics to consumers .
In the meantime , a just - introduced piece of legislation intends to reign in early termination fees , although similar bills have failed to make it out of committee in the past .
Netanyahu says ' no concession ' on Jewish settlements
Mr Ban said Israel 's blockade of Gaza was counter - productive Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any concession on the building of settlements in occupied East Jerusalem , despite international pressure .
Mr Netanyahu said he had written to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to remove any doubt about the issue .
He made the remarks hours before he left for Washington to address the influential pro-Israeli group , Aipac .
He has been invited to meet President Barack Obama on Tuesday , indicating a possible thaw in relations .
Tensions between the two allies has been running high over Israel 's announcement to build 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem , occupied by Israel since 1967 , despite US efforts to re-launch stalled peace talks .
The invitation to the White House was delivered by President Obama 's special Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , who met Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday .
On a day of intense diplomatic activity in the region , Mr Netanyahu also met UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , who is on a rare two - day visit to the region .
Netanyahu defiant " As far as we are concerned , building in Jerusalem is like building in Tel Aviv , " Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But he said Israel was willing to widen the scope of planned indirect talks with the Palestinians that Mr Mitchell is to mediate .
The diplomatic package Mr Netanyahu is offering has not been made public , but officials say one element is agreement to discuss all the outstanding issues , including the future of Jerusalem , as well as borders , Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees .
Mr Netanyahu comments on settlements were quickly denounced by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as unhelpful to attempts to restart peace talks , the AFP news agency reported .
Mr Abbas also condemned the recent killing of four Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli forces .
Speaking in Gaza on Sunday , Mr Ban called on Israel to end its blockade on Gaza , saying it causes " unacceptable suffering " and " undercuts moderates and encourages extremists " .
Israel imposed the blockade in 2006 and tightened it when the militant movement Hamas overran the territory the following year .
Egypt , which borders Gaza to the south , also helps maintain the blockade .
Mr Ban said families in Gaza were living under " unacceptable , unsustainable conditions " and that it was " distressing " to see damage to housing caused by Israel 's offensive 14 months ago , with no reconstruction possible under the blockade .
Also on Sunday , the Israel army said soldiers shot dead two Palestinians who tried to stab a soldier at a checkpoint in the West Bank .
On Saturday , a Palestinian teenager was shot dead during clashes near Nablus .
A second person shot on Saturday died of his injuries on Sunday , West Bank medical officials said .

Gravediggers employed by one of the country ’s largest cemetery and funeral home corporations , StoneMor , are battling for their first union contract — amid a COVID - related increase in burials .
Hang Nguyen at the O.C. Register has an interesting post from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2010 consumer conference :
Pat Connolly , executive vice president [ Williams - Sonoma Inc. , which also owns Pottery Barn ] :
" We are committed to restoring our retail channel profitability to historical levels ...
We are working diligently to restructure our portfolio of stores and optimize our sales and costs per square foot .
This will be accomplished by selective store closings and lease negotiations ...
Over the next three fiscal years , 25 percent of our store leases will reach maturity ...
E- commerce is 30 percent of our corporate revenue and it ’s very profitable ... even in this environment .
The Internet and e-commerce have become the focus on our capital investment . "
Sharon McCollam , chief operating officer and chief financial officer : " Every quarter last year , we increased the number of stores that we plan to close ...
If we could get the deals ( with landlords ) done , we would not necessarily want to close stores if you could get to the profitability levels you were historically .
...
However , we do n’t believe that that is a strategy that can be executed .
So there will be additional store closings ...
" Our outlook for retail properties as a whole is bleak ... we do not foresee a recovery in the retail sector until late 2012 at the earliest . "
As the leases expire , Williams - Sonoma will be looking to cut the lease rates substantially , or close the stores .
This is especially true in multi-store markets .
Other retailers probably have similar plans , and that means that malls will be facing rising vacancies and lower rents for some time .
For Q4 2009 , real estate research firm Reis reported that the mall ( and strip mall ) vacancy rates were the highest since Reis began tracking the data .
At the time , Reis economist Ryan Severino said : The comments from Williams - Sonoma executives fit with Severino 's forecast .
Note :
The Q1 mall vacancy rate be released in early April , and I expect more records .

Abel prize awarded to number theorist John Tate .
John Tate .
C. Fondville / The Abel Prize / The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters
The Abel prize — considered the ' Nobel ' prize of mathematics — has been awarded to John Tate , recently retired from the University of Texas at Austin , for his work on algebraic number theory , the mathematical discipline that deals with connections between whole numbers and lies at the heart of Internet security .
Established in 2002 , the Abel Prize is presented annually by the King of Norway and carries a cash award of US $ 1 million .
" Number theory knits together the subtle and strange properties of whole numbers in a beautiful way , " says mathematician Ian Stewart at the University of Warwick in Coventry , UK .
" Tate has really made himself the master of number theory . "
Tate 's work in number theory helped to crack one of the most famous challenges in mathematics : proving Fermat 's Last Theorem .
The theorem states that you cannot find three positive integers a , b and c that satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than two .
The theorem was solved in 1995 by Andrew Wiles of Princeton University in New Jersey , thanks in part to Tate 's research into the rules obeyed by ' elliptic curves ' — curves generated by a particular family of equations in number theory .
" Fermat 's Last Theorem is simple to state , but took 350 years to prove , using the machinery of number theory developed by Tate , " says Stewart .
Long thought to be one of the purest forms of pure mathematics — as it had little real - world relevance — number theory has now become vitally important for securely encoding data to be transmitted across the Internet .
" If you go back to the 1950s , most mathematicians would have agreed that number theory was n't particularly useful — some thought that a vice and some a virtue — but then along came the computer , " says Stewart .
King of the code
One important method for ensuring secure transmission across the Internet uses encryption keys based on 200 - digit numbers that are the multiple of two prime numbers .
Thanks to Tate 's developments in number theory , algorithms can easily generate such numbers for encoding purposes , says Stewart .
However , there are no algorithms to perform the reverse operation — working out the constituent primes of the 200 - digit number — making it impossible to for hackers to crack the codes .
" Try to find the prime factors of a 200 - digit number with pencil and paper — or even with a computer program — and it would take longer than the age of the Universe , " says Stewart .
ADVERTISEMENT
Tate 's work is also at the heart of error - correcting codes that allow corrupted digital information to be reconstructed .
" When you 're driving along , listening to music and hit a bump , the reason your CD does n't skip is thanks to these error - correcting codes , " says Stewart .
" It 's also the reason that the messages that you send on your mobile phones are n't garbled by all the other radio signals flying through the air . "
Tate is a popular choice for the Abel award , says mathematician Helge Holden at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim .
" Tate 's achievements in number theory go right back to his doctoral thesis , which became famous , and span more than 60 years during which his name has been given to many different theorems in the field , " Holden says .
" This is a well - deserved award for lifetime achievement . "

I have just bought two Seagate 7200.12 1TB ( ST31000528AS ) after using 4 x 7200.8 drives for 4 years 24/7 in RAID 5 with absolutely no problems .
I have read about the 7200.11 firmware issues , but I found out that everything was solved by the 12 series .
But it was not .
One of the drives I bought has firmware CC34 , the other has CC44 .
As it turns out , the CC44 drive has a seek time of 20 ms !
And it is so much more quiet during seeks .
The CC34 is really loud during seeks but has a seek time of 14 ms !
Yes , that 's 42 % difference between the same models from the same manufacturer !
Acoustically they are even more different , but I do not have any equipment to measure it .
AAM is set to 0 on CC34 , where it is set to 208 on CC44 .
There seems no way to change it .
I tried everything , but the drive resets itself to its default values .
I tried different DOS utils and with one , I could finally disable it on CC44 , but as it turned out , it came out not as disabled , but only set to max performance .
Since it happened I can not set it to anything else , and it really did n't change anything .
Neither acoustics nor performance changed a bit .
I think it 's best if I just show you the measurements :
WASHINGTON 
It was a telling glimpse into the state of mind of rattled Senate Democrats .
Worried that they were going to be skewered for pushing a jobs bill that was stuffed with business tax breaks and pork , Senator Harry Reid , the majority leader , pulled the plug Thursday on a rare bipartisan proposal , gambling both with the party ’s best chance of posting a needed legislative win as well as with President Obama ’s new push for cross-party cooperation .
The surprise move by Mr. Reid , partly in response to fears from lawmakers that they were going to take a pummeling on cable news , has put the future of the jobs legislation in question and showed how the criticism heaped on their health care plan and the loss of the Massachusetts Senate seat have put Democrats in a protective crouch .
At the same time , Mr. Reid ’s gambit puts pressure on Republicans to back elements they had already endorsed as part of the broader package , rolled out by top Democrats and Republicans on the Finance Committee , a note the White House sounded Friday .
“ I think the legislation that Senator Reid will move when the Senate comes back into town will garner bipartisan support , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman .
Reality shows routinely tail US police officers , filming them tangling with miscreants .
Cops regularly film themselves from cameras mounted on cruiser dashboards – and now special hats .
But if the state uses cameras for its own purposes and defense , why are so many citizens getting in trouble for pointing their cameras at the police ?
The rise of security and red - light cameras coincides with ubiquitous photography , when nearly every American with a cellphone holds a reality - recording device in his or her pocket .
That democratization of photography is ratcheting up tensions between police , who sometimes feel beleaguered by citizen gotcha artists , and amateur photogs who claim a First Amendment right to record what ’s happening in the public square .
“ You can buy a digital camera the size of a stick of gum for 20 bucks , ” says Radley Balko , a senior editor at Reason magazine and frequent critic of police power in the US .
“ As a result , we ’re seeing all these videos popping up that show not only misconduct , but contradict what shows up in police reports after the fact . ”
A growing list of police seizures cameras and destroyed pictures is testing the Constitution ’s First Amendment protections .
In a New Orleans case this week , two “ copwatch ” activists failed to win a civil conviction against New Orleans police officers who three years ago confiscated their cameras , erased footage , and arrested them for “ crossing a police cordon ” during the Bacchus Krewe Mardi Gras parade .
There ’s more :
A famous YouTube clip shows a citizen videographer running away from a police officer trying to grab his camera after another officer allegedly shot a handcuffed man , Oscar Grant , in the back at a crowded public transit station in Oakland , Calif . , on New Year ’s Day 2009 .
( The officer claimed he thought his gun was a Taser , but citizen video evidence was used to bring murder charges . )
After a three - year legal battle over Miami photographer Carlos Miller ’s arrest on a public street for refusing to stop taking pictures of several police officers , Mr. Miller saw all the charges dropped this week .
( His compendium of such incidents can be seen here : carlosmiller.com )
The Boston Globe recently wrote a series about Massaschusetts police using an obscure wiretap law to confiscate crime - scene video recordings collected by passers - by .
Moreover , police often have the upper hand in court .
The New Orleans jury , for example , found that the photographers brought their troubles on themselves .
Police have a legitimate right to object to filming that interferes with their duties .
And “ there 's another reason cops are skittish , ” explains one police officer commenting on a 2008 Popular Mechanics story titled Watching the Watchers .
“ As anyone who has ever seen a Michael Moore movie knows , creative editing and partial context can let you make film say whatever you want . ”
Still , experts say it ’s relatively easy for police officers to interpret obstruction laws too broadly .
“ Photography can be a double - edged sword , depending on your perspective , ” says Portland , Ore. - based attorney Bert Krages , author of “ The Legal Handbook for Photographers . ”
“ One of the problems photographers do face is the vulnerability to being charged with things that they did n’t do , and where , absent images or independent witnesses , it then comes down to a citizen ’s word against a police officer ’s word . ”
For many civil libertarians , police overreach is incontrovertible in almost all camera seizure and photographer arrest cases .
“ We have this thing called the Constitution , and the idea that you ca n’t film something that you can see is ludicrous , ” says Marjorie Esman , executive director of the Louisiana ACLU .
“ The sad thing about these cases is it suggests that police do n’t want people to know what they ’re doing , which then implies that they ’re doing something that they do n’t want people to know that they ’re doing . ”
At least one state , Mississippi , is looking at whether First Amendment protections are strong enough to protect photographers in the video age .
That debate needs to happen nationally , too , some law experts argue .
“ Abuse of photographers is common , and difficult to remedy under current law , ” writes University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds in an e-mail .
“ I believe that public officials performing their duties – including , but not limited to , law enforcement – should be subject to photography by citizens , and I would favor a federal civil rights law to that effect . ”
More pragmatically , citizens do have recourse beyond the courts if they believe their First Amendment right to capture reality in the public sphere has been violated by an officer of the state .
“ Complaining to a department ’s internal affairs unit is a pretty effective tool in [ educating ] police departments better with respect to the rights of the public to take photographs , ” says Mr. Krages .
“ And citizens can also get in touch with local or regional media .
Newspapers have a deep interest in being able to photograph in public . ”
While I may have mixed emotions toward LINQ to SQL , we 've had great success with it on Stack Overflow .
That 's why I was surprised to read the following :
If you are building an ASP.
NET web application that 's going to get thousands of hits per hour , the execution overhead of Linq queries is going to consume too much CPU and make your site slow .
Thereâ€™s a runtime cost associated with each and every Linq Query you write .
The queries are parsed and converted to a nice SQL Statement on every hit .
Itâ€™s not done at compile time because thereâ€™s no way to figure out what you might be sending as the parameters in the queries during runtime .
So , if you have common Linq to Sql statements like the following one .. var query = from widget in dc .
Widgets where widget .
ID == id && widget .
PageID == page
Id select widget ; var widget = query .
SingleOrDefault ( ) ; .. throughout your growing web application , you are soon going to have scalability nightmares .
J.D. Conley goes further :
So I dug into the call graph a bit and found out the code causing by far the most damage was the creation of the LINQ query object for every call !
The actual round trip to the database paled in comparison .
I must admit , these results seem ... unbelievable .
Querying the database is so slow ( relative to typical code execution ) that if you have to ask how long it will take , you can't afford it .
I have a very hard time accepting the idea that dynamically parsing a Linq query would take longer than round - tripping to the database .
Pretend I 'm from Missouri : show me .
Because I am unconvinced .
All of this is very curious , because Stack Overflow uses naive , uncompiled Linq queries on every page , and we are a top 1,000 website on the public internet by most accounts these days .
We get a considerable amount of traffic ; the last time I checked it was about 1.5 million pageviews per day .
We go to great pains to make sure everything is as fast as we can .
We 're not as fast as we'd like to be yet , but I think we 're doing a reasonable job so far .
The journey is still very much underway -- we realize that overnight success takes years .
Anyway , Stack Overflow has dozens to hundreds of plain vanilla uncompiled Linq to SQL queries on every page .
What we do n't have is " scalability nightmares " .
CPU usage has been one of our least relevant constraints over the last two years as the site has grown .
We 've also heard from other development teams , multiple times , that Linq to SQL is " slow " .
But we 've never been able to reproduce this even when armed with a profiler .
Quite the mystery .
Now , it 's absolutely true that Linq to SQL has the performance peculiarity both posters are describing .
We know that 's true because Rico tells us so , and Rico ... well , Rico 's the man .
In short the problem is that the basic Linq construction ( we donâ€™t really have to reach for a complex query to illustrate ) results in repeated evaluations of the query if you ran the query more than once .
Each execution builds the expression tree , and then builds the required SQL .
In many cases all that will be different from one invocation to another is a single integer filtering parameter .
Furthermore , any databinding code that we must emit via lightweight reflection will have to be jitted each time the query runs .
Implicit caching of these objects seems problematic because we could never know what good policy is for such a cache -- only the user has the necessary knowledge .
It 's fascinating stuff ; you should read the whole series .
What 's unfortunate about Linq in this scenario is that you 're intentionally sacrificing something that any old and busted SQL database gives you for free .
When you send a garden variety parameterized SQL query through to a traditional SQL database , it 's hashed , then matched against existing cached query plans .
The computational cost of pre-processing a given query is only paid the first time the database sees the new query .
All subsequent runs of that same query use the cached query plan and skip the query evaluation .
Not so in Linq to SQL .
As Rico said , every single run of the Linq query is fully parsed every time it happens .
Now , there is a way to compile your Linq queries , but I personally find the syntax kind of ... ugly and contorted .
You tell me :
Func< Northwinds , IQueryable < Orders > , int > q = CompiledQuery.Compile < Northwinds , int , IQueryable < Orders >>
( ( Northwinds nw , int orderid ) => from o in nw .
Orders where o.
OrderId == orderid select o ) ; Northwinds nw = new Northwinds ( conn ) ; foreach ( Orders o in q( nw , orderid ) ) { }
Anyway , that 's neither here nor there ; we can confirm the performance penalty of failing to compile our queries ourselves .
We recently wrote a one time conversion job against a simple 3 column table containing about 500,000 records .
The meat of it looked like this :
db. PostTags .
Where (t => t. Post Id == this .
Id ) .
ToList ( ) ;
Then we compared it with the SQL variant ; note that this is also being auto - cast down to the handy PostTag object as well , so the only difference is whether or not the query itself is SQL .
db. ExecuteQuery ( " select * from PostTags where PostId={0} " , this .
Id ) .
ToList ( ) ;
On an Intel Core 2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz , the former took 422 seconds while the latter took 275 seconds .
The penalty for failing to compile this query , across 500k iterations , was 147 seconds .
Wow !
That 's 1.5 times slower !
Man , only a BASIC programmer would be dumb enough to skip compiling all their Linq queries .
But wait a second , no , wait 147 seconds .
Let 's do the math , even though I suck at it .
Each uncompiled run of the query took less than one third of a millisecond longer .
At first I was worried that every Stack Overflow page was 1.5 times slower than it should be .
But then I realized it 's probably more realistic to make sure that any page we generate is n't doing 500 freakin ' thousand queries !
Have we found ourselves in the sad tragedy of micro-optimization theater ... again ?
I think we might have .
Now I 'm just depressed .
While it 's arguably correct to say that every compiled Linq query ( or for that matter , any compiled anything ) will be faster , your decisions should be a bit more nuanced than compiled or bust .
How much benefit you get out of compilation depends how many times you 're doing it .
Rico would be the first to point this out , and in fact he already has :
Testing 1 batches of 5000 selects uncompiled 543.48 selects / sec compiled 925.75 selects / sec Testing 5000 batches of 1 selects uncompiled 546.03 selects / sec compiled 461.89 selects /
sec
Have I mentioned that Rico is the man ?
Do you see the inversion here ?
Either you 're doing 1 batch of 5000 queries , or 5000 batches of 1 query .
One is dramatically faster when compiled ; the other is actually a big honking net negative if you consider the developer time spent converting all those beautifully , wonderfully simple Linq queries to the contorted syntax necessary for compilation .
Not to mention the implied code maintenance .
I 'm a big fan of compiled languages .
Even Facebook will tell you that PHP is about as half as fast as it should be on a good day with a tailwind .
But compilation alone is not the entire performance story .
Not even close .
If you 're compiling something -- whether it 's PHP , a regular expression , or a Linq query , do n't expect a silver bullet , or you may end up disappointed .
SEOUL , South Korea — Lee Kun -hee , the former chairman of Samsung who was convicted of corruption last August but pardoned by President Lee Myung - bak four months later to help a campaign for the 2018 Winter Olympics , returned to the helm of Samsung Electronics on Wednesday .
He was the latest and most prominent ex-convict who has retained top management of major conglomerates here .
In announcing Mr. Lee ’s surprise comeback , the Samsung Group said the chairman would bring to its electronics subsidiary , and to the conglomerate as a whole , badly needed leadership at a time when global businesses like Toyota were tottering .
The manner of Mr. Lee ’s return — as disclosed by a senior vice president and top Samsung spokesman , Rhee In - yong — spoke volumes not only about the power of the taciturn chairman at Samsung but also about that of other “ owner chairmen ” like him at their own family - controlled conglomerates , known as chaebol .
“ This only proves how unreasonable Samsung can be , ” said Kim Sang - jo , an economist at Hansung University and executive director of Solidarity for Economic Reform , a civic group .
“ His return only makes Samsung more vulnerable to the kind of risk Toyota faces .
It shows how distorted and how closed its decision - making is .
It shows Samsung ’s lack of a mechanism to deal with errors . ”
It 's always a good surprise when you go at google .com search for something and you get to see another great Google custom logo .
This past year was a true treasure chest , full of great designs , and I bet this year will also be a great year for these custom logos .
The guys behind these are making their best to keep thinking outside the box ...
... Very different from the first 5 or 6 years of Google .
Back them , it was mostly some little changes and additions .
But now we get to see full customized logos for holidays all over the globe , what is fantastic .
Anyways , this is my selection ...
I think these are the best Google custom logos to this date .
You may go to their Logo gallery and check them out , all of them .
You might find some others you like .
Anyways , I hope you enjoy these !
Cheers . ;)

OpenLayers Tutorial - Part 3 : Controls
Controls allow interaction with OpenLayer maps .
Panning , zooming , switching layers , etc , are all handled via controls .
Some controls , such as dragging the map around to pan it , while others , like the overview map , do have a visual appearance .
There are cases where you might not want any controls - these cases are actually fairly common ; for instance , if you wanted to show a small section of a map , mimic a static image , allow only logged in users to navigate around the map , etc . then you might want to have no controls on your map .
This tutorial is broken down and aims to teach you how to do the following :
1. Adding Controls
2. Customizing Controls - Passing properties and customizing control appearances
3. Adding Controls / Panels Outside of the Map >
Adding Controls
controls : [ OpenLayers .
Control , OpenLayers .
Control , etc ...]
Map Without Controls
var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , { controls : [ ] } ) ;
, { controls : [ ] }
Map With Controls
Method 1 - Passing in controls on map creation
var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , { controls : [ ] } ) ;
controls : [ ]
var my_controls = [ ] var map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , { controls : my_controls } ) ;
Example
map_controls = [ new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap( ) ] ; map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , { controls : map_controls} ) ;
map_controls = [ new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( ) , new OpenLayers.Control.LayerSwitcher( ) ] ; map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , { controls : map_controls} ) ;
map_controls = [ new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( ) , new OpenLayers.Control.LayerSwitcher ( ) , new OpenLayers.Control.PanZoomBar( ) , new OpenLayers.Control.MouseToolbar( ) , new OpenLayers.Control.KeyboardDefaults ( ) ] ; map = new OpenLayers .
Map ( ' map ' , { controls : map_controls} ) ;
Method 2 - Adding controls after map has been created
map = new OpenLayers .Map ( ' map ' ) ; map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( ) ) ;
map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( ) ) ;
If this does n't make too much sense , do n't worry much about it for now - this concept is called Object Orientented Programming , and it is outside the scope of this tutorial .
Without trying to further confuse things , think of a class as a blueprint for a house , and an object as a house created by the blueprint .
This idea applies here ; OpenLayers .
Control .
OverviewMap is a class , which is sort of like the blueprint for an overview map control .
We can't actually do anything with the blueprint though , to manipulate it we need to create an object by called new OpenLayers .
Control.OverviewMap ( ) , which basically takes the blueprint and generates an object from it - this object is what we pass into the map.addControl ( ) function call , as passing in just the blueprint wo n't do much good ( it 'd be similar to opening a door of a house - you can't open a door on the blueprint ( the class ) , but you can open a door on the house ( the object ) ) .
Recap
1. Passing in an array of controls creating the map
2. Calling the function addControl ( Control ) and passing in a single OpenLayer control object
Example
map = new OpenLayers .Map ( ' map ' , {controls : [ new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( ) ] } ) ;
map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( ) ) ;
Customizing Controls
1. Instantiation ( creation ) parameters - handles the actual control options
2. Style ( CSS ) customization - handles the look / feel / position / style of the control
1. Customization on Instantiation ( creation )
map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( {autoPan:true , layers : [ new OpenLayers .
Layer .WMS ( " OverviewMap " , " http://labs.metacarta.com/wms/vmap0 " , {layers : ' country_01'} ) ] } ) ) ;
{autoPan : true ,
layers : [ new OpenLayers .
Layer .WMS ( " OverviewMap " , " http://labs.metacarta.com/wms/vmap0 " , {layers : ' country_01'} ) ]
2.Customizing OpenLayers Controls with CSS
element { key : value ; }
Where element is an HTML element ( can be an element like div ( would apply to all div elements ) or an ID ( single element ) or class ( multiple elements ) ) , key is an attribute of the element ( such as width or height ) and value is , surprise , the value .
For things like width or height , the value is either a pixel value ( like 500 px ) or a percentage ( like 50 % ) .
I wo n't cover much CSS in this post , but CSS basically expects an element with property : value pairs , which can be views as key : value pairs , separated by a semi-colon ( ; ) .
Here 's the basic structure :
Where element is an HTML element ( can be an element like div ( would apply to all div elements ) or an ID ( single element ) or class ( multiple elements ) ) , key is an attribute of the element ( such as width or height ) and value is , surprise , the value .
For things like width or height , the value is either a pixel value ( like 500 px ) or a percentage ( like 50 % ) .
.olControlOverviewMap
< style > .olControlOverviewMap { background : # ff0000 ; width :200 px ; } .olControlOverviewMapElement { background : #00ff00 ! important ; } </style >
Adding Controls Outside of Map
1 . Place the control itself outside the map
2 . Place the control in a " panel " outside the map .
The panel contains a group of controls .
Placing a control outside the map
< div id =" external_control " ></div >
var external_control = new OpenLayers.Control.MousePosition ({ div : document.getElementById('external_control ' ) } ) ; map.addControl(external_control ) ;
Placing a control outside the map in a panel
< div id =" panel " ></div >
var external_panel = new OpenLayers .
Control .
Panel ( { div : document.getElementById(' panel ' ) } ) ; map.addControl(external_panel ) ;
Control Types
TYPE_BUTTON
TYPE_TOOL
TYPE_TOGGLE
Adding controls to panels
1. Create and add a panel
var external_panel = new OpenLayers .
Control .
Panel ( { div : document.getElementById(' panel ' ) } ) ; map.addControl(external_panel ) ;
2. Create and add a zoom in and a zoom out control to the map
var control_zoom_in = new OpenLayers.Control.ZoomIn ( ) ; var control_zoom_out = new OpenLayers.Control.ZoomOut ( ) ;
map.addControl(control_zoom_in ) ; map.addControl(control_zoom_out ) ;
3 . Add the zoom in and zoom out controls to the panel
external_panel.addControls([control_zoom_in , control_zoom_out ] ) ;
Adding style to controls in panels
.olControlZoomInItemInactive
.olControlZoomInItemInactive { background : url ( http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.8/img/zoom-plus-mini.png) no -repeat ; border : 2 px solid # 232323 ; float : left ; height : 18 px ; margin - right : 5 px ; width : 18 px ; } .olControlZoomOutItemInactive { background : url ( http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.8/img/zoom-minus-mini.png) no -repeat ; border : 2 px solid # 232323 ; float : left ; height : 18 px ; margin - right : 5 px ; width : 18 px ; }
Conclusion
We 'll show how to create a map without controls shortly , but what kind of stuff can we do with controls ?
There are many more examples on OpenLayer.org 's Examples page , simply search for " control " to get an idea of what various types of controls there are .
There are lots of simple ones , ranging from scale bars to full vector layer manipulations .
While there are too many controls to cover in depth here in this post , I 'll be focusing on a few different controls throughout this tutorial to exemplify how flexible OpenLayers is and give you an idea of what can be done .
Most controls that are ' visible ' ( e.g. the layer switcher control ) can be placed either inside or outside of the map .
The ' invisible ' controls , such the control that allows you to navigate the map when you drag the map with your mouse , are either there are they are n't - so we can't really ' place ' them outside the map .
Placing controls inside the map is the default behavior and is a bit simpler than placing it outside ( although both are easy once you know how ) , so we 'll cover that first .
Adding controls to a map can be done indifferent ways .
When the map is created , it can accept an array of OpenLayers .
Control objects to be passed in when creating the map object , and controls can be added to the map after it has been created .
If no array of control objects are passed in , ( like we 've been doing in prior tutorials ) OpenLayers creates the map with various default controls .
The basic format ( psuedo code follows ) is : After the map is created , you can add controls individually by calling map.addControl ( new OpenLayers .
Control ) .
Before we get into that though , let 's demonstrate how to add a map with no controls .
By default , OpenLayers adds a few controls to your map , such as mouse navigation and the pan / zoom bar , unless you tell it not to .
( The full list of default controls added are ArgParser Let 's first create a map with no controls to demonstrate .
The following code will create a map object with no controls .
The following line is the main relevant bit of code .
What we 're doing here is creating a new OpenLayers .
Map object and passing in the ID of the element ( typically a div element ) that we want the map to appear in .
The next bitis where we specify additional parameters to pass in to create the map .
Keep in mind these parameters are called in such a way of key : value , with multiple ' keys ' separated by commas .
The curly brackets denote that we 're passing in key : value pair (s ) ( in this case , just one key : value pair ) .
The key is controls , and the value is [ ] , which is an empty array element in Javascript .
We are passing in no OpenLayers .
Controls - basically , we 're telling OpenLayers that we want this map object we 're creating to have an empty array of controls ; i.e. this map will have no controls .
To add controls , we can either1 .
pass in an array of controls when we instantiate the map ( create the map object from the OpenLayers .
Map class , like we did above ) .
We do this by passing in the controls parameters such as { controls : [ control1 , control2 , etc .. ] } when creating our map , or2 .
add controls after the map has been created .
We do this by called map.addControl ( ) and inside the paranthesis we pass in an OpenLayers Control object - e.g. new OpenLayers.Control.LayerSwitcher ( )
The second method is what I typically do when creating my maps ; it comes in handy especially when you want to allow controls to be added or removed dynamically .
Let 's cover how to add a control to the map using both methods .
I 'll be using the OpenLayers Overview Map control ( yes , the overview map is considered a control ) to demonstrate .
There are really two ways to do this .
Because OpenLayers expects you to pass in an array , you can build the array before you actually pass it in , making the code a bit easier to read .
Trying to keep this as simple as possible to those not much experienced with Javascript , we 'll use the above example code to demonstrate .
So , let 's take a look :
The line here isAgain , we 're passing in an empty array for the controls , so no controls will show up .
We can subsitute a previously created list here instead though , as follows :
Here we set my_controls equal to an empty array , and pass in my_controls to controls .
Although we have an extra line , we 're doing exactly the same thing we did above , only this time we 're passing in a previously created array instead of creating it in the map object call .
It does n't make a lot of sense to do it this way in this example , but once you start adding more than one control to the map , you 'll find it makes it much easier to read your code .
Alright , let 's make an actual control now .
We 're going to add it to the map the way we just described , by creating a list of controls first .
This will make it easier demonstrate how we can add controls after the map has been created too .
Now , doing it this method we will only have the controls we add to the map , so panning / zooming will not be enabled by default as we are overriding the default controls passed in .
We 'll be using the Overview Map control here to demonstrate .
This is the relevant code .
Notice the only control is the Overview Map .
We can add more controls by simply seperating them commas .
Here we have both the overview map and layer switcher ; but nothing else .
Finally , before we move on , let 's add those two controls and some of the defaul controls OpenLayers add to have a more functional map .
Now that we know how this works though , let 's move on to something a bit more common .
We 're going to let OpenLayers add some of the basic controls for us .
You may not want to do this , depending on your own needs for the map - if you dont want to allow users to navigate around the map , for instance , then you should probably add controls manually like the method detailed above .
Let 's set up a map using the default OpenLayers controls and we 'll add the Overview and Layer Switcher control to it .
Since we did n't pass in controls to the map object , the default controls are added automatically .
The next line is where we actually add the control to the map.map is our map object we just created , and addControl is a function call we make that - takes in - an OpenLayers Control object and adds it to the map .
In this case , we are passing in new OpenLayers. Control.OverviewMap ( ) .
OverviewMap is the class , and we are creating an object from the class by typing new before it .
We can also make as many calls to addControl as we like , and we can use it in conjunction with any controls we pass in when we create the map ... OpenLayers is pretty flexible like that .
To recap , we can add controls by There are a plethora of controls we can add to the map , and I wo n't cover them all , but you can see a list of them at OpenLayer 's Doc Site So , adding controls is pretty easy , but often we want to customize them a bit .
This part can be a little tricky , as each control has its own set of configuration options - for instance , a permalink control and overview map control do not share the same configuration options .
Some controls can also be placed in an HTML element outside of the map , such as the layer switcher or vector editing toolbar .
We 'll first cover configuration basics , and then discuss how to add a control outside a map .
Let 's walk through how to customize an overview map control , and by doing so you 'll have the necessary knowledge to customize any other control ( hopefully ) .
I 'm going to break down control customization into two parts :
For this section , I 'll use the Overview Map control as an example .
The overview map control does not have the same properties of other controls , so be cognizant of this when adding your own controls .
The best place to find out what we can do when calling an OpenLayer control is at the OpenLayer documentation site , and for this we 'll be using OpenLayers Overview Map Control Doc
When we create a control , we define what options we want it to be created with .
We can , however , manipulate the control after it is created , but for now let 's just stick to defining everything when we create the control .
Here 's some code to create an overview map control with a couple properties defined :
This may look intimidating , but let 's break it down .
We already know map.addControl ( new OpenLayers.Control.OverviewMap ( this line .
map is our map object , and addControl is the same function we 've been using .
Notice that we are calling the function add just one control , so we only pass one control into the function .
We 're creating a new OverviewMap control object and passing it in - still , nothing new here .
The next line is new though .
Notice the curly brackets - this denotes that we 're going to start passing in key : value pairs , which are the options we want to set for this control .
autoPan is the key , and true is the value .
Notice the comma afterwards , which means we 're going to pass in another key : value pair next .
Before we go to the next line , let 's briefly discuss what aut oPan : true means .
I'm going to quote the OpenLayer Overview Control Documentation page directly so you get an idea how to use it.autoPan - " { Boolean} Always pan the overview map , so the extent marker remains in the center .
Default is false .
If true , when you drag the extent marker , the overview map will update itself so the marker returns to the center .
" What this means is that { Boolean} is the - type - of value that is expected in the key : value pair .
Thus , this means that autoPan expects to receive either true or false for its value .
If we do n't pass in aut oPan : true when we create our overview control , OpenLayers assumes autoPan is set as false .
We could also explicitly say autoPan : false but this is not necessary , as we know from looking at the docs that OpenLayers assumes the value is false unless otherwise specified .
Ok - so moving along .
The next line looks a bit hairy
But let 's take a look .
All that 's going on here is that layers is the key and an array containing a single layer object is the value .
From the OpenLayer docs , layers expects an What 's this mean ?
Well , the overview map expects an array of OpenLayers Layer objects to be passed in .
Layers are discussed in detail in the previous tutorial , part 2 - layers .
So without getting too detailed here , we 're basically passing in a single OpenLayers WMS Layer .
This layer is the only layer in our array , but if we wanted another we could just add a comma and specify as many more layers as we want .
We are also passing in parameters to this new OpenLayers Layer object so we get a different layer for the overview map .
By default , the overview map uses the maps ' base layer .
So , my lengthy explanations aside , we see that it is n't too tricky to pass in construction parameters .
We do it when we create our layers , so it 's not new - but there are quite a lot of options , and the official OpenLayers docs describe all the options .
All other controls are called and defined the way we just did above , so it 's only a matter of figuring out what control and what options you want to specify .
But after we do this , we might want to give it a custom style .
OpenLayers is generally pretty good with allowing customizable controls with CSS style sheets .
( CSS ) allow us to specify how HTML elements look and feel , their size , position , font size , etc. etc .
Anything related to the way the page looks can pretty much be handled via CSS ; CSS is a way to customize appearance .
OpenLayers allows us to style our controls with CSS , which makes creating a slick looking map much , much easier .
All OpenLayers controls have an associated CSS class where we can specify a style we want to apply to it .
To define a style for an OpenLayers element , we must access it by class name .
The class names are set up in form of .olControlControlName..olControl is always at the beginning of the classname , and the control name follows .
So , for our overview map , the classname we would need to override the default CSS style isNotice the period at the beginning , to those unfamiliar with CSS that denotes that what follows the period is a class name .
Now we can override the default styles and make it look like however we want .
Here 's an example CSS declaration you can add that will style the overview map on the page ; feel free to mess around with the declaration and style it however you would like .
Now , this is a good example although it is a little tricky , because styling the overview map is a little tricky .
You 'll notice we have the olControlOverviewMap element 's background set as red ( # ff0000 ) but the olControlOverviewMapElement element 's background as green ( #00ff00 ) and has ! important after it .
This is to ensure that the overview map element 's background is not overwritten - if we do n't include any background , it is blue by default .
This is because OpenLayer 's Overview Map control contains another CSS element , namely the OverviewMapElement , and we need to define it also .
Most controls are not set up this way , but the overview map is fairly common and does not exactly follow the same style guidelines as other controls .
The last topic we 'll cover is how to add a control outside the map .
With the previously discussed code , this should be quite an easy feat to accomplish .
There are many cases where you might want a control outside the map - a toolbar of buttons in a div that sits on top the map , for instance .
You can also create custom buttons , which will be discussed in depth in a future tutorial .
There are two main ways to place controls outside the mapTo place a control outside the map , we need an element to place it in ( we 'll use a div with an id of " external_control " ) and we specify a div parameter when calling the control .
To demonstrate : You can view the external control demo here
We 're basically creating a MousePosition control and setting the value of div to equal an HTML element with the element ID of ' external_control ' .
The mouse position control is outside the div , in it 's own div .
We could apply whatever style we want , either by styling the div itself ( without using OpenLayers style classes ) or style the control itself ( using the .olControlMousePosition class ) , or both .
Panels are basically a collection of controls which can be placed inside or outside of the map .
These are useful for grouping related buttons together , such as pan buttons , zoom buttons , etc .
To demonstrate , we 'll build a panel from scratch and add some controls as buttons to it .
We need an HTML element to hold our panel , so we 'll do what we did above , but we 'll get it an ID of ' panel ' Now we just need to create the Panel control itself
The demo code will come shortly .
Right now , this does nothing but create an empty Panel control attached to our ' panel ' div element .
We need to now add controls to it .
There are three ' types ' of controls OpenLayers provides for use in a panel .
1. TYPE_BUTTON2 .
TYPE_TOOL3 .
TYPE_TOGGLEThese controls call an event / trigger an action when clicked .
An example would be a zoom in / out button ; once clicked , an event is triggered to zoom the map in These controls ' turn on ' when clicked and ' turn off ' when clicked again .
An example would be the editing buttons on OpenLayer 's Editing Toolbar Example .
Once the control is activated ( e.g. the pan button - the button with the hand icon ) , it stays activated until it is either clicked off or another control is activaed .
These controls are similiar to the TYPE_TOOL , as they are activated and deactived on mouse click ; however , they do not affect the state of other controls - meaning , that if a TYPE_TOGGLE button is activated , it will not deactivate other controls .
Only one TYPE_TOOL button can be active at a type , but TYPE_TOGGLE buttons do not carry this restriction .
Alright , so let 's get to it .
We 're going to put together what we 've learned so far to add zoom in and out buttons to the panel outside the map and edit their class to make them look something like a button .
The first step , creating the panel , was done above .
The next step is to simply add two more controls now - one will be a zoom in control , the other a zoom out control .
By default , there is no style associated with these controls when we place them outside the map , as they are called normally by methods such as scrolling in or out .
Before we describe exactly what we need to do , let 's take a look at the docs for the zoom in and out controls - Zoom In control .
You 'll notice there 's not much there .
It does n't have any special properties , although it does inherit everything from the base OpenLayers .
Control class , so anything we can do to that class we can do to the Zoom In class .
The ZoomOut class is the same way .
So , we do n't need to worry about passing in anything extra really , we 'll just create the two controls without passing anything in ; here 's how we do it .
We 've done this above .
We need to create a div with an ID of " panel " and add the corresponding Javascript code .
All we have to do is create the controlsand then add them to the mapAlright , so we have those two controls added to the map ; we now need to add the controls to the panel .
You 'll notice we call the function addControls .
To add any controls to a panel , we must call this function and pass in an array of controls - even if we only want to add one control ( there is no " addControl " function , only addControls ) This is because by default , there is no style associated with the zoomin or zoomout controls .
Let 's finish up this demo though by adding some CSSThe naming convention is the same as we mentioned above for naming controls inside panels , however , as these are controls inside a panel , they have ' states ' attached attached to them .
ItemActive or ItemInactive is added to the end of the control 's class name .
For example , our zoom in button has the class nameBecause of the type of this control is a button , its only relevant class is olControlZoomInItemInactive .
When the button is clicked , it does not become active or inactive , but simply triggers the zoom In event .
So , let 's add some basic style to our controls to make them look a little bit like buttons .
Here 's the relevant CSS code I use in the demo below :
With this tutorial , hopefully you 've learned how to add controls to an openlayers map , customize them a bit , give them some style , and add controls and panels outside a map .
Although this tutorial was a bit lengthy , it really just scratches the surface of what is possible to do with OpenLayers controls .
The OpenLayers Event system can be used to create your own custom controls .

The Soviet - born mathematician once taught at colleges in the US Russian maths genius Grigory Perelman , who declined a prestigious international award four years ago , is under new pressure to accept a prize .
A US institute wants to give him $ 1 m ( £ 700,000 ) for solving one of the world 's most complex mathematical problems , the Poincare Conjecture .
But it is unclear whether Dr Perelman , a virtual recluse , will pick it up .
A children 's charity in St Petersburg , where he lives , has urged him to take the money and give it to charity .
Dr Perelman , 43 , has cut himself off from the outside world for the past four years , living with his elderly mother in a tiny flat said by neighbours to be infested with cockroaches .
In an open letter on its website , the Warm Home charity called on Dr Perelman to give the cash equivalent of the US Clay Mathematics Institute 's $ 1 m Millennium Prize to Russian charities .
It suggested that the mathematician had already made an ethical point by turning down the Fields Medal , the world 's highest prize in mathematics , in 2006 .
Appeal for privacy
The mathematician is reported to have said " I have all I want " when contacted by a reporter this week about the Clay Millennium Prize .
Grigory Perelman already won maths accolades as a teenager According to the UK's Daily Mail newspaper , he was speaking through the closed door of his flat .
Dr Perelman was the first person to turn down the Fields Medal , which would have been presented to him at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid .
" I 'm not interested in money or fame , " he is quoted to have said at the time .
" I do n't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo .
I 'm not a hero of mathematics .
I 'm not even that successful ; that is why I do n't want to have everybody looking at me . "
One of Russia 's most senior politicians , Federation Council Chairman Sergei Mironov , has appealed for Dr Perelman to be left in peace to make up his own mind .
He suggested that it was " not very decent to look into other people 's pockets and count other people 's money " , Russia 's Interfax news agency reports .

We 've been dying to know more about Microsoft 's Courier tablet / e-book device ever since we first caught wind of it last September , and while our entreaties to Mr. Ballmer went unanswered , we just learned some very interesting information from an extremely trusted source .
We 're told Courier will function as a " digital journal , " and it 's designed to be seriously portable : it 's under an inch thick , weighs a little over a pound , and is n't much bigger than a 5x7 photo when closed .
That 's a lot smaller than we expected -- this new picture really puts it into perspective -- and the internals apparently reflect that emphasis on mobility : rather than Windows 7 , we 're told the Courier is built on Tegra 2 and runs on the same OS as the Zune HD , Pink , and Windows Mobile 7 Series , which we 're taking to mean Windows CE 6 .
As we 've heard , the interface appears to be pen-based and centered around drawing and writing , with built - in handwriting recognition and a corresponding web site that allows access to everything entered into the device in a blog - like format complete with comments .
We 're also hearing that there will be a built - in camera , and there 's a headphone jack for media playback .
Most interestingly , it looks like the Courier will also serve as Microsoft 's e-book device , with a dedicated ecosystem centered around reading .
It all sounds spectacular , but all we have for a launch date is " Q3 / Q4 " , and we have no idea how much it 's going to cost , so we 're trying to maintain a healthy skepticism until any of this gets official -- call us any time , Microsoft .
One more pic showing the interface after the break .
We 've added a gallery of user interface shots -- some of which we 've seen and some of which are new .
We 've just gotten two full - length HD videos of the interface in action .
We 've seen parts of these before , but there 's some new stuff here that 's quite interesting .

The Tea Party Movement Has Deep American Roots
Louise W. Knight is the author of " Jane Addams , Citizen : Jane Addams and the Struggle for Democracy , " " Jane Addams : Spirit in Action , " and a writer for the History News Service .
Attribution to the History News Service and the author is required for reprinting and redistribution of this article .
This country began with a fierce debate , and it does not appear to be over .
The folks rallying to the Tea Party campaign espouse a program that goes right back to the Articles of Confederation .
Whatever we think of it , the movement is as American as apple pie .
And its followers think so too , calling themselves " patriots " rather than Republicans or Democrats .
Mark Skoda , the president of a Tea Party PAC , recently summed up what he calls their first principles : " less government , fiscal responsibility , lower taxes , states ' rights and national security . "
There 's an irony here , though .
The Tea Partiers lustily cheer at every mention of the United States Constitution , yet their principles were most fiercely embodied not in our current Constitution but in the Articles of Confederation .
Remember those ?
The same month that Congress was debating a declaration of independence , a committee was drafting the Articles .
Its purpose was to form a new government , which it called the United States of America .
The states completed ratification of the Articles in 1781 .
Eight years later , the Constitution supplanted the Articles and brought to an end the political institution that Tea Party members now seem intent on reviving .
The Articles allowed the new central government -- solely a legislative body -- to make war but not to tax or regulate interstate commerce .
States , nervous about losing their independence , had intentionally designed a weak government .
That was why it was called a confederacy .
The Southern states , equally determined to protect states ' rights , created another one eighty years later .
The first confederacy failed .
Unable to tax , it struggled to raise money from the states to finance the Continental Army ; after the war ended , it could not help states floundering with war debts .
By 1786 , it was clear to many that the confederation needed to be replaced by something stronger , a federation .
The second constitution , the one we live under now , became law in 1788 .
It gave the central government powers to tax and to regulate interstate commerce and created a national government that for the first time had executive and judicial branches .
Many Americans , known as the anti-Federalists , had their doubts about the new constitution .
Their spiritual descendants are the Tea Partiers .
Like the anti-Federalists , the Tea Party folks are fiercely distrustful of the national government , especially its power to tax , even though they completely trust its power to defend the nation .
They also dislike the two - party political system created in Washington 's first administration .
Sarah Palin recently declared her disapproval of both the Republican and Democratic parties in her speech to the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville and sparked an explosion of approval from her audience .
Today 's defenders of the Constitution are the progressives .
Led by President Obama , they believe that the national government should not only protect the nation from attack , promote interstate commerce and protect individual rights , but also solve national problems through federal legislation -- from building infrastructure to promote economic growth to making the schools better to protecting workers from unjust employment practices .
It is not surprising that the Tea Partiers hate Obama .
He embodies the anti-Federalists ' worst fears .
What is perhaps most interesting about the Tea Partiers is that they have no interest in the socially divisive cultural issues -- abortion , gay marriage , euthanasia -- that have so dominated our recent national political debate .
That , at least , is refreshing .
Instead , these Americans have returned to the oldest argument arising from this nation 's founding -- what should the role of the national government be ?
Should it help Americans who are struggling or should it not ?
Should we maintain ( and even strengthen , as through health reform ) the progressive apparatus of laws and programs that keep the unemployed , the poor and the elderly sick , and even all citizens , from suffering , and increase total federal tax revenues to pay for it , or should we deconstruct that apparatus and reduce those revenues ?
This is the debate we should be having .
May it recommence !

Is any criticism of the President 's ideas and programs inherently racist ?
Is merely using his name a racist statement ?
How should he be referred to , as BO ?
Well , since President Bush was called W , why not ?
Guy Bruce Courts - 3/20/2010 Mr. Jones ,
<< Most of those involved in the Tea Party movement do so because of their concerns over the nation 's economic health and future due do a government that is quickly bankrupting the country . >>
Where exactly were all of the fiscally reponsible tea partiers from 2001 - 2008 ?
As for race :
Mr. Green : << The Tea Party 's leaders tend to feel this way , and too many of the Tea Party 's members condone or accept the racism of others in their " movement . " >>
Tom Tancredo at the Tea Party Convention : << " People who could not spell the word vote or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House -- name is Barack Hussein Obama , " >>
No racism there .

Maarja Krusten - 3/18/2010
As someone whose primary historical interest is the presidency , I ’m glad you mentioned the Fox News Channel .
I considered myself a Republican starting in 1972 and self identified as a conservative during the Reagan years .
I became an Independent around 1989 , just as the Cold War , which I had followed closely as a voter since I cast my first vote for Richard Nixon in 1972 , was starting to wind down .
Fox is strongly associated with Roger Ailes .
Ailes served as a media consultant to Richard Nixon .
He dealt with technical issues , not policy matters .
( See
http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/donated/050470_ailes.pdf
for one of his memos to Nixon ’s chief of staff , H. R. Haldeman . )
Having once self identified as a conservative Republican in my younger days , I think Fox has served the Republican party very poorly .
So much so that I ’ve come to wonder how it might have done , if a communications expert more comfortable with history and critical thinking , and a better understanding of voters across a broad spectrum , such as David Gergen , had been the guiding force behind it .
The problem with Fox ’s business model lies in the contrast with how companies usually resolves issues , something which may be reflected in Ailes ’s reaction to a recent column by Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post .
Bruce Bartlett , economics expert and former Reagan advisor , pointed out last year that “ The Fox News channel is a pure conservative / Republican network that does not pretend to be anything else .
Personally , I have no problem with that .
. . .
The rise of talk radio was the foundation .
. .
As time has gone by , these guys have gone from just representing their own opinions to representing the conservative movement to representing the Republican Party to thinking they actually speak for the American people as a whole .
Power and vanity have led them to lose touch with reality .
The Internet completed the circle and provided for complete detachment of conservatives from the mainstream media .
They could now get 100 % of their news filtered through a conservative lens .
They no longer had to confront any facts they deemed inconvenient or without a ready - made response that either refuted them or interpreted them in a way conservatives could rationalize .
The result is that many conservatives live in a cocoon as well , completely insulated from any facts or opinions that are counter to their worldview . ”
Bartlett ’s view is his own , you can agree with it or not .
But his mention of a cocoon got me thinking about good business practices and how well performing corporations value 360 feedback .
After reports of dissension within
Fox surfaced this week , Ailes reportedly visited the Washington Bureau and told staff , " I was brought up to defend the family .
If I could n't defend the family I 'd leave .
I 'd go to another family . "
Yet management experts recommend that bosses reward rather than shoot the messenger .
While some things are appropriate to discuss internally rather than externally , the alternative never should be defend or leave .
There should be an option of avoiding comment outside but staying inside to take a hard look at perceptions and to stay on to fight to improve a business .
Such an approach requires self awareness and backbone on the part of the executive .
One of the best clips in Steve Pearlstein ’s series on leadership at WaPo last year was the one in which a successful director of an organization said , “ own your mistakes publicly . ”
He explained that it is n’t as if people do n’t see the mistakes so it ’s best to get out in front , own them , and move on to improve the company .
Better to look brave and honest , it does n’t weaken the executive , it strengthens him .
I used to watch Fox more than I do now , but started tuning out during 2003 .
Its presentations of current events during a time of Republican ascendancy seemed so filled with fear and anxiety rather than Reaganesque confidence and a sense that you ca n’t tell the emperor he ’s not wearing any clothes .
Could it have become a more robust messenger for conservatism and for the GOP has it been helmed by someone capable of merging Reagan ’s sense of confidence with a courageous executive ’s ability to look at the good , the bad , and the indifferent both in the political causes he supported and in management of a company ?
I do n’t know .
But it certainly seems to me that Fox could have avoided becoming the Jon Stewart bait it is now .
Stewart recently called Fox " the meanest sorority girl in the world . ”
But the real problem seems to be a fear of introspection and self analysis of the type all successful businesses must undergo , in order to improve their products and market share .
Ailes ’
Fox treats conservatism and the GOP as something incredibly fragile , requiring a defensive crouch and envelopment in a protective cocoon .
As someone who once identified as a conservative , I do n’t think that as an ideology , it is as weak and vulnerable as Fox would have one believe .
The history - reading Gergen could have signaled more confidence had he been in charge .
He could have woven together a strong fabric for the Fox News Network .
Given Ailes ' background as a technical expert and his apparent limitations in understanding how to attract moderates and centrists to a GOP leaning network or to reward rather than shoot the messenger internally , I doubt Ailes ever will be able to turn the network into something stronger .
Grant W Jones - 3/16/2010 People like Green are impervious to reason and facts .
Most of those involved in the Tea Party movement do so because of their concerns over the nation 's economic health and future due do a government that is quickly bankrupting the country .

That 's incredible , Mr Green , you seem to have a handle on the thoughts of the leaders of the Tea Party movement , or " movement , " as you put it .
Maybe they eat babies and hate puppies too ?
Peter Kovachev -
3/16/2010 " Insurgency , " " tea - baggers , " " black helicopters , " " right - wing paranoia " and " promotional sills of Fox news . " ???
Not a happy camper are you , Mr Isserman ?
In fact a tad bitter , yes ?
In watching the latest hilarities of your Fearless Leader and his Vice - Buffoon , I can't blame you much for your reactive snobbery and small - minded peevishness , though .
Left - wing fantasists poured all their hopes and dreams into a bungler whose incompetence appears to be bottomless .
Not your typical messiah , no .
And then there is the cringe - inducing series of tragi-comedic disasters and the humiliating spectacle ... at least for snobby establishment types ... of a bunch of " soccer- moms " and " plumbers " almost effortlessly dismantling the Great Thoughts and Heroic Plans of a bunch of the White House radicals in itchy new suits .
Such a shocking affront to the New Nobility !
Had you actually watched Fox , the only network that did n't swoon and have shivers going up their legs or whatnot , maybe you could have avoided getting suckered by the most PR - heavy , hollow , if not outright misleading campaign in US history .
R Jeffery Kiser - 3/16/2010
One can paint any group to be extreme .
Does that mean the democrats have their roots in the recent more violent Black Panther movement ?
Or perhaps the stronger socialist movements of fascism ?
Of course not , though it makes it nice to dehumanize a group in that way , it does not reflect the reality .
It only leads one to dismiss the accuser .
Michael Green - 3/14/2010
They also fit in well with the era with which the Articles were associated - - or not .
At that time , slavery existed in the U.S.
While it was not yet so widely defended as it would be in the South during the mid-19th century , it had defenders .
But most Americans at the time agreed that non-white people were inferior .
The Tea Party 's leaders tend to feel this way , and too many of the Tea Party 's members condone or accept the racism of others in their " movement . "
The teaching of evolution has been under attack for decades , but few are aware of the extent of the campaign .
Each year , at least a half - dozen states seem to introduce legislation intended to undermine science education standards by allowing or requiring nonscientific ideas to be taught alongside a standard biology curriculum .
In recent years , these have taken the form of the so - called " academic freedom " bills , which allow teachers to bring in outside materials that undercut standard science textbooks .
Many of these bills are now placing climate change beside evolution as a target for special criticism , and there are signs that climatology may become an independent target for state legislators .
We 're only partway through February , and the National Center for Science Education has already been tracking two bills related to education in the biological sciences .
The first , from Mississippi , would " require that the lesson have equal instruction from educational materials that present arguments from both protagonists and antagonists of the theory of evolution . "
It died in committee earlier this month .
But it was quickly joined by a bill in Kentucky that would allow teachers to bring in materials that were not approved by the state in order to critique the science that has previously been discussed ; in this sense , it 's structured much like the legislation that passed in Louisiana .
The law targets scientific theories " including but not limited to the study of evolution , the origins of life , global warming , and human cloning , " which is a direct copy of the Louisiana law .
There are two ways of interpreting this recent tendency to lump biology and geoscience education into a single piece of legislation .
The first is that hyperskepticism of evolution and climate change have generally been associated with the conservative end of the political spectrum in recent years , meaning that the people behind the bills object to both topics .
The alternative is that the people behind the bills know that there are many people who mistrust either one or the other , and the bill can attract wider support by including both .
But there are now signs that , at the state level , climate change may be ready to branch out on its own .
Last week , the Utah House approved legislation that urges the Environmental Protection Agency to put any plans for regulating carbon dioxide emissions on hold , " until climate data and global warming science are substantiated . "
Although the determination that the EPA would act on greenhouse gas emissions was based on scientific findings , the actual policy that results would be a political decision , and one that it 's perfectly reasonable for the Utah legislature to weigh in on .
Instead , the Utah legislation attacks the science , in inflammatory and confused terms .
The initial text of the legislation accused scientists of being on a " gravy train " of federal funding and engaging in a conspiracy to promote flawed findings .
Those statements have been toned down in the version that passed , but it still contains many misunderstandings and distortions , including a positively bizarre aside that appears to blame chlorofluorocarbons — like freon — for the recent trajectory of temperatures .
Bills such as these highlight what appears to be a disturbing trend , one that is also apparent in a Maine legislator 's recent attempts to place health warnings on cell phones .
The US public has had difficulty distinguishing between credible scientific information and the various forms of misinformation available on the Internet .
It 's no surprise that state lawmakers , drawn from and representing that same population , have similar difficulties .
Being elected should , however , place a larger burden of responsibility on legislators , one that would seem to require at least a minimal attempt to work with the best available information .
In fact , many scientific organizations , such as the National Academies of Science and the American Association for the Advancement of Science , have staff devoted to providing policymakers with answers to scientific questions .
There 's little excuse for legislators to be badly misinformed on these issues .
Unfortunately , it 's very unlikely that a public that 's equally confused on scientific matters will hold these elected officials responsible for not taking their job seriously .
Which means that various pieces of climate - focused legislation may be appearing with the same regularity that evolution - focused bills now do .
Not a heck of a lot to report on this one , but a picture is worth a thousand words , no ?

In a first - of - its kind controlled experiment , researchers from the Boston University School of Public Health ( BUSPH ) and Brown University have found that surprisingly , binge drinking the night before a test does not impact college students ' test performance -- although it can affect their moods , attention and reaction times .
The study , which appears in the April 2010 edition of the journal Addiction , was conducted by Jonathan Howland , professor of community health sciences at BUSPH , and Damaris Rohsenow , research professor at Brown 's Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies .
The study found that intoxication in the evening did not affect students ' next day scores on academic tests requiring long - term memory , or on tests of recently learned material .
Binge drinking did , however , slow participants ' attention / reaction times and worsen mood states -- impacts that could affect safety - related behaviors , such as driving .
Howland said the research team was surprised by the test - taking results because some prior studies have found that occupational performance was impaired the day after intoxication .
But , he explained , " We looked at one particular academic outcome .
Test - taking is only one measure of academic success . "
The researchers also noted that binge drinking could affect other types of academic performance , such as essay - writing and problem - solving requiring higher - order cognitive skills .
" We do not conclude … that excessive drinking is not a risk factor for academic problems , " the researchers wrote .
" It is possible that a higher alcohol dose would have affected next - day academic test scores .
Moreover , test - taking is only one factor in academic success .
Study habits , motivation and class attendance also contribute to academic performance ; each of these could be affected by intoxication . "
While some previous studies , using surveys , have found that students who drink heavily have more academic difficulties than their peers who drink more moderately , this is the first study to examine that association by enrolling students in a controlled experiment , Howland said .

He said the study raises interesting questions about the effects of alcohol on specific cognitive skills and reaction / attention behavior -- questions that warrant further investigation .
The team of researchers tested 193 university students , ages 21 to 24 , recruited from the Boston area .
Over the course of four days -- one evening and the next morning , and then a second evening and morning a week later -- volunteer participants received either beer or nonalcoholic beer .
They received the opposite drink the second time they were tested .
The morning after , participants were given the practice versions of the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ) , as well as a mock quiz on an academic lecture they received the previous afternoon .
Students were monitored overnight by an emergency medical technician .
The study found that participants scored no differently on the GREs , or on the quizzes , whether they had consumed alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer .
Howland noted that the scores on the GRE and quizzes were relatively high , showing that the students were taking the tests seriously .
The researchers used different versions of the GREs , and quizzes on different lectures , that were comparable in difficulty .
In addition to Howland and Rohsenow , the study was co-authored by Jacey Greece , Alissa Almeida , Caroline A Littlefield , Timothy Heeren , Michael Winter , Caleb A. Bliss , Sarah Hunt and John Hermos , all at the Youth Alcohol Prevention Center at BUSPH , where the study was conducted .
The research was funded by the Youth Alcohol Prevention Center at BUSPH , a research center of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism .

Dimensions : 5 x 2.75 inches ( 24 - pages ) .
Description : Two " someones " are watching you .
And one has it in for you .
Now , you have a decision to make .
Five members of the Supreme Court declared that a “ corporation ” is a person , not a “ regular person ” but one above all natural laws , subject to no God , no moral code but one with unlimited power over our lives , a power awarded by judges who seem themselves as grand inquisitors empowered meant to hunt down all heretics who fail to serve their god , the god of money .
Their ruling has made it legal for foreign - controlled corporations to flush unlimited money into our bloated political system to further corrupt something none of us the trust and most of us fear .
The “ corporation / person ” that the 5 judges , the “ neocon ” purists , have turned the United States over to is n’t even American .
Our corporations , especially since our economic meltdown are owned by China , Russia , and the oil sheiks along with a few foreign banks .
They do n’t vote , pay taxes , fight in wars , need dental care , breathe air , drive cars or send children to school .
Anyone who thinks these things are people is insane .
Anyone who would sell our government to them is a criminal and belongs in prison .
There is nothing in the Constitution that makes this “ gang of five ” bribe sucking clowns above the law .
There is nothing in the Constitution that even mentions corporations much less gives them status equal to or greater than the Executive , Legislative and Judicial branches of government .
The Supreme Court of the United States has no right to breathe human life into investment groups owned by terrorist sympathizers , foreign arms dealers or groups working for the downfall of the United States and everything we believe in , but 5 “ justices ” have done just that .
We now have a new government above our government , above our people , one above any law .
Five judges have created institutionalized gangsterism as the new form of government for the United States .
No American soldier can ever go to war fighting for a Chinese hedge fund , a German bank or a Saudi Arabian fertilizer company .
Will our new debates in Congress be between members representing the opium warlords against the Columbian cartels ?
Their cash , which long ago has infiltrated one major corporation or bank after another is now heading for your local representative .
How important do you think secure borders for America are for these new political “ influencers ? ”
For years we complained about AIPAC , the Sierra Club , the NRA , trial lawyers , trade unions , NAM ( National Association of Manufacturers ) and the churches that got involved in politics .
Behind all of these were people , American citizens , and , on some occasions , Americans who fought for their country , raised kids here and we ’re invested in the survival of America although they did n’t always act that way .
This was an American problem .
Now we are n’t even sure we have an America anymore .
Anyone who believes that a massive flood of corporate money into politics wo n’t throw control of both houses of Congress into the hands of the wealthy nations that are also our primary strategic enemies , you know the ones , the ones loaded with oil cash , the ones with 10 cent an hour labor and legal systems that shoot first and ask questions later .
They just were told they can buy the United States , not just our government , but our military , and the lives of our soldiers .
They can now make our laws , raise our taxes , decide on our civil rights , where we can live , if we can own guns , how late we stay up , where and what we drive and , eventually , how we think .
The Supreme Court has given foreign - owned corporations the eventual power to silence us all .
When a corporation commits a crime , nobody goes to jail .
When wars come , they do n’t fight , they simply rake in cash .
When children are poisoned or workers are killed , they seldom even pay a fine .
However , when they want something , billions in tax money for “ bailouts ” or fat contracts or special laws , they have always gotten it .
It has been a battle to control corporations for 140 years .
Sometimes the American people have lost , sometimes they have won .
Our greatest presidents are the ones who reined to incorporate power and kept the influence of money over humanity in check .
Think of Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman , Dwight Eisenhower , and John Kennedy .
Without them , we would be living in work camps , stuck at machines all day , our children at our sides .
We would be paid in beans and salt pork , dying at 40 in filth like people around the world who live in countries controlled by corporations .
Based on the justices that we want to be prosecuted being Reagan / Bush “ conservatives ” you would think this is a liberal / conservative issue .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Nothing less “ conservative ” has ever been done by a branch of our government .
There is nothing “ conservative ” about our Supreme Court going insane and abandoning our Constitution and making medical decisions , not to give life to a fetus , but to a bank account .
This is nothing but an extremely unAmerican and unpatriotic group of thieves believing that Americans had given up so many of their civil liberties in silence during the Global War on Terror scam that opening the “ Pandora ’s Box ” of class conflict could now be done with nobody saying a word .
Their “ corporate person ” is now a Baron or Duke , the great landlords of the medieval period .
Americans are now destined for serfdom .
Their political and economic theories , what are they ?
Is it conservatism or feudalism ?
We are already burdened with a representative government that has tied itself to the money spigot because of the incredible cost of media exposure in campaigns .
People running for office in ancient Rome would purchase thousands of animals for slaughter in the arena .
Mass executions were staged as media events for political campaigns .
In fact , the arenas in every Roman city were built for that purpose , today replaced by television and the internet .
We thought we had changed since that time .
We were wrong .
The framers of the Constitution created the Supreme Court , the Electoral College and originally had Senators appointed , not elected , to protect the wealthy from having their money and land seized by the masses who would otherwise have controlled the government .
This was the 1780s .
The only “ democracy ” we knew about was ancient Athens , where the majority of the people living there were slaves .
27 Amendments later , including the Bill of Rights , we have worked to define justice and decency .
Generations have fought and died to keep life in our imperfect system from 1780 .
Who would have thought that 5 people could destroy it all ?
Political debate in America is sometimes extreme , often bordering on violence .
Feelings are high .
How many times have you heard people threaten to leave the country because “ their America ” no longer exists ?
We know that few really mean it .
When faced with a real threat , no people on earth are to be feared like Americans .
When help is needed , no people on earth are to be trusted and relied on like Americans .
This is the pride we have in our country and ourselves .
We never agree on anything .
We are n’t supposed to , we are Americans .
Everything we built has been based on a balance , race , religion , ethnicity , social standing , political beliefs , regional interests , all striving and compromising to build something we are all secretly very proud of , something all of us are willing to fight for and many are .
Americans all agree on one thing , that our government in Washington is out of control and has been for some time .
We all have different ideas on this but agree on the fact itself .
We wonder where the politicians come from , men too often “ less great ” than those of the past , in fact , less great than average .
Decisions are continually made that most find puzzling and , in fact , are driven by a rotten underbelly of corruption and self - interest .
Now , 5 members of the Supreme Court , people none of us voted for , a group that is answerable to no authority and , seemingly , no law or moral code , a group famous for immoderation , poor judgment , and low personal integrity has , either through blindness , avarice or insanity clearly done something so malicious , so unjust and so utterly inconsistent with our Constitution that they , themselves , have become an “ enemy of the people . ”
What is their power ?
What they have done is not within the scope of the authority given through the Constitution .
Their acts are outside the law , their acts are those of a conspiracy , their acts are meant to diminish our freedoms , our sacred institutions and even endanger our lives .
Typically , such acts are called crimes and those who commit them are criminals .
What could drive judges , albeit judges appointed with little thought as part of a cheap political ploy , to abandon any American constituency ?
Corporations have no religion .
They care nothing for the unborn .
They have no allegiance to a flag , a family or any moral ethic .
They serve no person , owe no loyalty other than to stockholders , shadowy groups of Russian oligarchs , Chinese banks , corrupt dictators grown fat on the spoils of their people or the international consortium ’s of bond and currency speculators who have , for decades , abandoned any economic law to build the ethereal “ house of cards ” we call the “ world economy . ”
The control of the American electoral process has been given to them .
No serving politician can survive now standing against them .
Years ago “ they ” bought our newspapers and our television networks .
Facts and truth became whatever they wanted us to believe .
“ They ” gained control of what many thought and what almost all of us see and hear .
That was n’t enough .
They wanted it all .
As their control has grown , so has terrorism , continual war , economic poverty for millions of Americans and insensitivity to justice and humanity .
Who would expect anything else from a corporation with no blood , no heart , and no face ?
The Founding Fathers led America on the path to freedom and eventual democracy .
The Federalists limited the ability of an impetuous electorate to seize power and “ reform ” America into chaos and anarchy .
This system of government was predicated on the belief that love of country would always burn brightly in America and with progress , freedom , and bounty was the inevitable reward of our industry .
It is only now too obvious that so much has happened that was unforeseen .
It is not a denial of our traditions to correct wrongs when we find them .
This was how America was created .
We are drowning in wrongs , we all finally agree on this .
The time is now .
Party politics have failed .
Political theories are little more than empty rhetoric meant to mislead and misinform .
The state has become church and church has become a state .
The state is less just and church less godly .
All we have left is “ we , the People . ”
This is how we began and it is now all we have to move forward .
It is time for the states to call for a Constitutional Convention to establish , not just a Republic , but a Democracy , by and for the people , the American people , rich and poor , a nation loyal to itself , not tied to corporations , a vast military - industrial complex or endless foreign alliances .
If it is to be a genuinely conservative nation , one with individual freedoms , a small government , fewer taxes , and more opportunity , a nation as intended , then we will all have to live with it .
The bloated corpse we are creating in Washington is emitting a stench we can no longer abide .
We will be saying goodbye to our Supreme Court , our seniority system in Congress and our political machines pretending to be “ parties ” and hello to paper ballots , a free press , term limits and the ability to yank a scoundrel out of office when we catch one .

The film director Quentin Tarantino has won the Dilys Powell Award for Excellence in Cinema , the highest accolade awarded by the London Film Critics ' Circle .
His latest film has been nominated for Bafta and Oscar awards .
Reporter Nicola Stanbridge spoke to Mr Tarantino about his films ' success .
This is an extended version of the broadcast interview .
GM Jesse Kraai , Photo Elizabeth Vicary GM Jesse Kraai gives us a glimpse into life at the Grandmaster house in the Bay Area , where Kraai , GM Vinay Bhat , GM Josh Friedel and IM David Pruess studied together .
I 've played some bourgeois moves .
In chess , I 've been spiritually consoled by the prudent building move and its complacent satisfaction .
It does n't know what your next move is .
It does n't care .
It sees patterns it has already seen and finds warmth and comfort in that familiarity .
And in life I have often greedily fought for what others considered entitlements and allowed the inertia of those entitlements to move me .
But I did move to the GM house , a couple of Jews and a Brahman , all enjoying some stage of autism , assembled together in what used to be a crack home .
My sister said the position looked bad , and that we would need weekly house meetings , dramatic sit - downs in which we explored the tense psychological space surrounding who did the dishes last .
But my tribe does n't really care about the dishes .
And that 's why some people think that we are not bourgeois , that we are intellectuals .
We sometimes like to think of ourselves that way too .
But , generally , meditations upon self - identity are viewed with the same indifference as the dishes .
The real danger of the GM house was n't foreseeable .
It was n't a trap or a trick you miss a few moves out .
The danger was far more structural .
It was the opportunity to see more clearly what we wished to achieve and then the demonstration of our own personal inabilities to attain what was directly in front of us .
Consider the post - game babble you 've heard outside the tournament hall .
The losers seem to suggest that chess is a flat , rather dull game , perhaps even ruled by chance : ' I blundered ' , ' got in time trouble ' , ' was n't feeling too great ' .
Whereas a winner 's rich smile can raise cliche to something that feels like poetry : ' Dude ! , I went off the top rope ' , ' Elbow from the sky ! ' .
And you can spend your whole life bouncing between these two poles of self - delusion without coming to much of an understanding of what constitutes the art of the game .
And whilst that sounds depressing , it 's actually quite comforting - because you can allow yourself to believe that you know what is going on when chess is played .

Then try to hear the Panda 's sigh .
I began to notice it only after months of study .
It 's apparently an unconscious exhalation , somehow grafted onto his system , which escapes from a very deep place somewhere around the perineum , when a fatal attack is allowed in an analysis session .
At first you do n't hear the sigh .
You and the other people about the table , who have also not realized that someone is getting mated , have their minds too close to the variations - like eight year olds massed around a soccer ball , drifting about the field as if it were a ouija board .
It 's as if the Panda sees a bigger view of the situation , and just needs some time to demonstrate the attack - as if he were translating his game to ours .
The interesting structural danger in coming to the GM house was revealed in this communal study .
If I were just to play the Panda I have a good chance to hold , sometimes I might even win .
But then I would only be seeing the moves , and not what lies behind them .
By simply playing in tournaments I would have never had an insight into the many hidden talents that make up playing chess well .
And I would have never had a taste of abilities which feel out of reach .
For even though I have begun to hear a faint sigh within myself , it is an ability which continues to feel otherworldly .
This direct perception of limitation is magnified by an intuition of still greater ability when my friend , the Panda , apparently faced something else in his 2 - 0 loss to Wang Hao in the World Cup .
I do n't know what the something is .
But I now suspect , based on my study at the GM house , that it is a whole range of abilities which are as rare and unattainable as superpowers .
And Wang Hao does n't even seem to be World Champion material .
He is just another 2700 .
An awareness of skills which feel like they are spoken in another language may lead to self - doubt .
And doubt is not always a practical asset in chess .
The assimilation of new skills will also be painful .
You will not master the art of the sigh simply by recognizing its physiological provenence .
Your time at the GM house is not like a horde of pennies on which you are waiting to accrue interest .
It is not a bourgeois move .
Because your rating might never go up .
Two guys riding in my peloton , GM Vinay Bhat and IM David Pruess , struggled with the rating chart on the refrigerator .
When Vinay came to the house he talked of going from 2500 Fide to 2600 in a year .
And David thought he would be a GM in a matter of months .
But months will turn into years and our rating graph will often look like a flat line bobbing to a standard deviation .
David and Vinay do n't study with us anymore , and they are both in the process of leaving the competitive chess world .
To me they seem traumatized .
And I believe I have some insight into the pain they have suffered .
But I - and my expectations - are more grey : and at this stage of my life , a good flagellation is less likely to open a fresh wound than it is to revisit an old scar .
Most American chess players develop their skills in a lonesome closet - like space .
Without mentors , their thinking becomes very independent , as well as uncultured .
And the lack of a taught chess language inhibits the growth of chess wisdom .
This lack leads to a flat and colorblind view of the game which thinks of chess ability as ' raw talent ' .
But this one - dimensional characterization paves over the many pockets of artistry whose brilliance will only be revealed when you look under the surface of the played move .
This was a central lesson I learned at the GM house .
But more important was that to acknowledge what you do n't know and may never possess is a dangerous move .
Because you are not entitled .
And the patterns which guide you are not in fact leading you anywhere .
They are helping you play the same game again and again - in chess and in life .
The GM house has until May 15 , 2010 .
If it does not find new recruits it will perish .
And although this was perhaps not the most appealing of advertisements , it nevertheless is one .
has taken a darker tone this season , and " Chuck Versus the Tic Tac " was the best example yet , and it was n't even about Chuck .
Showcasing Casey 's enigmatic past and Sarah continuing disillusionment of who Chuck is , the episode took a terrific step towards the impending climax of the arc .
What makes the new developments so great is that the show still retains the humor and action we all love .
The show does n't lose much of what made the show good already , and the layers being added only makes it better .
Colonel Casey , formerly known as Alex Coburn , is up to something secretive and not on orders of the CIA .
It 's directly related to his past .
In 1989 , Coburn was stationed in Honduras which is probably where he got all those anti-leftist ideas .
Sadly , the actor playing Alex did n't really look or sound like Adam Baldwin , so it was kind of weird .
Colonel James Keller ( Robert Patrick ) recruits Coburn to join his black ops team .
Coburn agrees , leaving his old life behind and becoming John Casey .
In the present , Morgan spies on Keller meeting with Casey , and assumes it is typical CIA business .
Morgan , who already has spy equipment , records everything .
That comes in handy later on .
Chuck , Sarah , and Casey are sent on a routine Trace Cell mission where they will test the security system of the CIA lockup .
It 's supposedly the best security system in the world ... but it 's theuniverse .
Nothing is secure , no matter how prestigious , deadly , or paranoid the organization .
The team tears through 15 levels of security with ease .
In fact , the security is so bad we only get to see them pass the first level .
Chuck uses his Intersect 2.0 powers to flip to the other side , dodging numerous projectiles coming from the wall .
While Chuck completes the objective of retrieving a note from a lockbox , Casey takes a single pill from another box .
Casey takes his time taking the pill , so Chuck sees him doing this , but Casey pulls a gun on him and warns him not to talk .
Back at the Castle , Beckman has bad news for the team : someone got their already and stole the laudanol pill ( laudanum derivative ? ) .
The pill suppresses all emotional , notably fear .
Chuck immediately realizes that it would great benefit him in flashing .
Sarah gives him that wary look we know all too well .
At the suggestion that it could have been an inside job , Chuck has it all figured out in his mind .
It 's another test .
And considering the previous tests , it would n't be a stretch except it would be another stupid CIA idea ( though I suppose stupid CIA ideas are the norm ) .
He thinks he was supposed to see Casey taking something , but Beckman dismisses that and starts questioning Casey .
Having no answer , Casey is placed in the same holding facility he infiltrated the same day .
Chuck gets to the bottom of this , using Morgan 's video and flashes on Keller .
He 's really a Ring agent .
Obviously Casey is n't part of the Ring , so there 's something else at work .
Sarah and Chuck decide to break in and save Casey , but Keller arrives at the facility at the exact same time .
The CIA has made the necessary security fixes already .
It 's employees , however , are n't as keen .
Using the monikers of Charles Carmichael and Sarah Walker , Chuck and Sarah are able to make it to the 15th level just by talking to their fanboy .
Casey decides to go along with Keller , confusing Sarah and Chuck who get caught outside by the CIA .
Beckman has arrived in person to oversee her delinquent agents .
She has Sarah and Chuck find Casey and get to the bottom of everything .
Casey uses the excited Morgan to hide the pill for him , and Chuck picks up on that instantly .
He returns back to his apartment where Casey awaits .
Sarah comes in , and we get the revelation that explains everything .
Before he became John Casey , Coburn had a fiance , Kathleen McHugh .
If he does n't turn over the drug , Keller will kill her .
Team Bartowski is back together and ready to kick ass .
They decide to split up and tackle the problem at two fronts .
Casey and Sarah will take on Keller , and Chuck will get McHugh to protection .
The plan works without a hitch .
Casey and Sarah kill Keller and everyone else easily .
Chuck takes the pill and flashes , destroying the Ring in the best fight scene of the season .
When Sarah and Casey arrive , they find Chuck chocking an agent much like Casey did to Keller .
Sarah 's worst fears have come true , but the effects wear off , and Chuck stares at his hands , astounded at what he was about to do .
If that is n't dark enough , a young woman rushes into the house .
It 's Casey 's daughter , but he walks away , knowing he is no longer part of their lives .
McHugh does n't even recognize him anymore ( and not just because the actors are different ! ) .
Beckman discharges Colonel Casey , addressing him as Mr. Casey .
This man who has risked his life for his country and saved countless lives lost everything because he cared for someone .
At the end of the episode , Casey tells Chuck he has to choose .
He can't have it both ways .
We 'll see exactly how dark the show gets , but Chuck is a fun show .
My prediction is that he gets the girl and the job .
For now , the show is going down the path until it reaches the light at the end of the tunnel .
Sarah goes with Beckman to Washington D.C. , the city where Shaw is .
In a season of accelerated narrative , the choices are quick and the consequences immediate .
The pill was a superficial way for Sarah expresses her fear of what Chuck has become and worries he is n't that guy who she met three years ago .
They look deeply into each other 's eyes , and before Chuck can get the words out , Sarah moves on to the pressing matters .
I wish Chuck would show a dark side on his own accord and not because of some pill which is temporary .
Sarah may have legitimate concerns , but other than lying , Chuck really has n't done too much to incur her attention .
Morgan , Ellie , and Awesome provide the relief needed to keep the episode into descending into a depressing .
Ellie receives an invitation to for a neurology fellowship at USC .
Awesome continues to push for Doctors Without Borders , and do n't know what to do .
They turn to Morgan , who initially thinks Ellie should take the fellowship .
Morgan and Awesome talk privately , and they discover that the other knows Chuck 's big secret .
Awesome is able to convince Morgan that is is safer for them to be completely out of the picture rather than be protected by Chuck .
Somewhere in the back of my mind , I was wondering if Ellie and Awesome would depart us for a duration .
Ellie comes to terms with what Awesome wants , but Awesome , too , has made up his mind .
They 'll stay for Ellie 's fellowship .
Awesome made the choice Casey did n't .
He picks the girl over safety and peace of mind .
Surely there will be repercussions later on .
I do n't know if anyone watches the promos , but the next episode looks amazing .
I do n't want to spoil it for anyone , but the end of the initial 13 - episode order is nearing , and the stakes continue to be raised .
Other than the rehashed relationship drama , the season is top notch .
Score : 9.5/10 Passing
Thoughts : The Buy More and Shaw were missing in the episode .
The plot still moved quickly , so the lack of subplots were n't a big deal .
The writers can extend an episode easily since the plot does n't really have to make much sense .
Robert Patrick was way underused .
The 5 minutes of screen time could n't have done him justice .
Since
The Ring was trying to get the Laudanol , could we assume that there is another Intersect about there ?
The writers probably do n't think that far ahead about the mythology , but if the pill helped Chuck , it could help another Intersect .
Rock band Pink Floyd launched a High Court action against EMI today in a dispute over the calculation of online royalty payments and marketing of their music .
The band , whose ' Dark Side Of The Moon ' is one of the best - selling albums in music history , is seeking a ruling on two key issues .
Robert Howe QC , appearing for the group , said they wanted to “ know where they stand as a matter of contract ” .
The case concerns how online royalties are to be calculated .
Mr Howe said it also concerned EMI ’s “ entitlement to sell individual tracks , or indeed any tracks , otherwise than in the original configuration of the Pink Floyd albums ” .
He argued that a contractual clause “ expressly prohibited ” what was referred to as “ unbundling ” – the selling of tracks , either physically or online , “ other than in their original configuration ” .
Mr Howe said EMI was arguing that the prohibition “ applies only to the physical product and does n’t apply online ” .
But that “ makes no commercial sense ” and was contradicted by the conditions used in the agreement with EMI , argued Mr Howe .
Pink Floyd signed with EMI in 1967 and became one of its most lucrative signings , their back catalogue being outsold only by that of The Beatles .
Introduction
In this article I ’m going to demonstrate how to use the Twitter Streaming API to send a stream of status updates for real time display in a web browser using Web Sockets .
We ’ll implement a backend server module that streams the events over a web socket using the node .
websocket.js framework , which provides a simple realtime HTTP server that implements the web socket protocol .
Node.websocket.js is built on top of Node.js which provides an Asynchronous API using callbacks .
Node.js is a server side javascript library that enforces an event driven style of programming which allows you to develop non-blocking code easily .
This in turn allows you to write simple servers that are very CPU and Memory efficient because you do n’t have multiple threads taking up shared resources .
Node.js is implemented using Google ’s V8 javascript engine and also the CommonJS specification which is defining a standard library for server side javascript .
Getting Started
First things first , you need node.js , which you can get from github .
Install in the usual way
$ git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git $ cd node $ ./ configure $ make $ sudo make install
Then we ’ll need node.websocket.js which you can also get from github
$ git clone git://github.com/Guille/node.websocket.js.git
This is basically an experimental implementation of the web socket API .
You can create simple server side modules and then a client side implementation that opens up a web socket to the server in which you can then exchange data in both directions .
There are a few examples included that you can take a look at including a simple echo server and a chat server .
Just fire up the server like so
$ node runserver.js
and then open up one of the html files in the test / websocket / directory in your browser .
One catch though , you ’ll need a current browser such as Google Chrome .
I ’d recommend it anyway , as browsing the web with it does run a bit smoother .
You ’ll also need curl , which is pretty common on any linux box these days and can be installed through your package manager .
Setting Up the Server
The way we ’re going to implement the server is to use the curl command to pull from the twitter stream into a file .
Twitter gives you a bunch of JSON objects back which you can then parse and display .
We ’ll use this file in a moment to send the data over the web socket to the browser .
There is some documentation on what you can do with the API but we ’ll keep it simple and search for any tweets with ‘ nyc ’ in them
$ curl - dtrack = nyc http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json -uUSERNAME:PASSWORD > sample.json
Now its time to write some server side javascript .
In the node .
websocket.js checkout there is a modules / directory .
We ’ll create a new module called gardenhose.js .
So the full path is node.websocket.js/modules/gardenhose.js
In a nutshell this is waiting for the client to establish a connection , and then it creates a child process that tails our file from the curl command above .
Anytime the file is written to the “ output ” listener is invoked , which runs our callback to parse the JSON into objects that we can then use to send a string back to the client with some readable information from the stream .
Lets break it down just a bit more in case you are not familiar with Node .
First we are requiring the system and filesystem modules from Node .
Now , node.websocket.js basically just uses the node API to implement a server in the websocket .js file .
It looks at the request header to see which module to instantiate and then invokes your onData ( ) method when a client sends over data .
Therefore the onData method is the one we need to implement in our module above .
We ’ll use the process object in Node to create a child process that emits an event called “ output ” each time the child sends data to stdout .
So the addListener call sets up a callback that will be invoked when our file receives more data from the twitter stream .
That data comes in the form of JSON objects , one per line .
So we split on the lines to create an array of JSON objects , and loop through them .
Each time through the loop we ’re sending this data back to the client , which is the web browser .
Just make sure the file you pass in is the correct path to the file you are outputting to from the curl command in the monitor_file ( ) function .
Then to run the node .
websocket.js server you can just invoke it like so
$ node runserver.js
However if you are running the server from another host , you may want to listen on more than just the default of localhost
$ node runserver.js -- host = 0 .0.0.0
Setting Up the Client
The goal here is to get the realtime tweets pumping through our web browser so our client will just be a web page with a little bit of web socket javascript .
This is probably a bit more straightforward .
We ’re just implementing a few of the functions from the Websocket interface .
First we ’re instantiating the WebSocket class with the hostname and port that we ’re running the server on .
The gardenhose in the path is to tell our server that we want to run the gardenhose .js module that we wrote above .
The onopen ( ) function is invoked when the socket is opened , and we send over the word “ start ” which if you recall from above understands the client has connected and to start the child process that runs tail on our file .
The onmessage ( ) function is invoked anytime the server is sending data over the web socket , which is the information we want to show on the page , so we append it to the HTML of our hose div .
If the server closes the socket then onclose ( ) is invoked , and we display that on the page .
Conclusion
We ’ve written a server side module using Node.js and the node .
websocket.js framework that will send tweets over a web socket connection .
We have also looked at the WebSocket API and learned how to implement some of the functions defined by its interface .
Of course , you could use JQuery or your favorite javascript libraries to enhance how this looks to the user , but the basics are all here in how the communication of a real time display can work with web sockets .

A new study using motion sensitive video cameras has revealed how New Caledonian crows use tools in the wild .
Previous work has shown the sophisticated ways in which crows can use tools in the laboratory , but now a team of scientists from Oxford University and the University of Birmingham have investigated tool use in its full ecological context .
The researchers recorded almost 1,800 hours of video footage for the study and published their findings in Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
In the wild , New Caledonian crows use tools for many purposes , including ' fishing out ' large beetle larvae from holes in dead wood .
In the new study , the team was able to show for the first time that more larvae were extracted by crows using tools than with their beaks .
They also discovered that adult crows appeared to be much more skilled at obtaining larvae than juvenile crows , suggesting that considerable learning -- possibly from copying more experienced ' larvae fishers ' -- is required for crows to become competent at this task .
Aside from recording the video footage the team also collected a large sample of tools that crows had left inserted into larvae burrows .
By comparing the length of the tools to the burrows , they found that , on average , longer tools are found in deeper burrows -- suggesting that wild crows , like their cousins in the laboratory , are able to match the ' right ' tool to the task .
The collection also showed that wild crows do not select tools randomly , from debris on the forest floor , but are more likely to choose leaf - stems than twigs , and are more likely to use tools of a certain size range .
The research team included Dr Lucas Bluff , Dr Christian Rutz , Dr Alex Weir and Professor Alex Kacelnik from Oxford University 's Department of Zoology , and Jolyon Troscianko from the University of Birmingham .
The work was funded by the UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) .

What is Twitter ?
Twitter is an online information network that allows anyone with an account to post 140 character messages , called tweets .
It is free to sign up .
Users then follow other accounts which they are interested in , and view the tweets of everyone they follow in their " timeline . "
Most Twitter accounts are public , where one does not need to approve a request to follow , or need to follow back .
This makes Twitter a powerful " one to many " broadcast platform where individuals , companies or organizations can reach millions of followers with a single message .
Twitter is accessible from Twitter.com , our mobile website , SMS , our mobile apps for iPhone , Android , Blackberry , our iPad application , or 3rd party clients built by outside developers using our API .
Twitter accounts can also be private , where the owner must approve follower requests .
Where did the idea for Twitter come from ?
Twitter started as an internal project within the podcasting company Odeo .
Jack Dorsey , and engineer , had long been interested in status updates .
Jack developed the idea , along with Biz Stone , and the first prototype was built in two weeks in March 2006 and launched publicly in August of 2006 .
The service grew popular very quickly and it soon made sense for Twitter to move outside of Odea .
In May 2007 , Twitter Inc was founded .
How is Twitter built ?
Our engineering team works with a web application framework called Ruby on Rails .
We all work on Apple computers except for testing purposes .
We built Twitter using Ruby on Rails because it allows us to work quickly and easily -- our team likes to deploy features and changes multiple times per day .
Rails provides skeleton code frameworks so we do n't have to re-invent the wheel every time we want to add something simple like a sign in form or a picture upload feature .
How do you make money from Twitter ?
There are a few ways that Twitter makes money .
We have licensing deals in place with Google , Yahoo ! , and Microsoft 's Bing to give them access to the " firehose " - a stream of tweets so that they can more easily incorporate those tweets into their search results .
In Summer 2010 , we launched our Promoted Tweets product .
Promoted Tweets are a special kind of tweet which appear at the top of search results within Twitter.com , if a company has bid on that keyword .
Unlike search results in search engines , Promoted Tweets are normal tweets from a business , so they are as interactive as any other tweet - you can @reply , favorite or retweet a Promoted Tweet .
At the same time , we launched Promoted Trends , where companies can place a trend ( clearly marked Promoted ) within Twitter 's Trending Topics .
These are especially effective for upcoming launches , like a movie or album release .
Lastly , we started a Twitter account called @earlybird where we partner with other companies to provide users with a special , short - term deal .
For example , we partnered with Virgin America for a special day of fares on Virginamerica.com that were only accessible through the link in the @earlybird tweet .
What 's next for Twitter ?
We continue to focus on building a product that provides value for users .
We 're building Twitter , Inc into a successful , revenue - generating company that attracts world - class talent with an inspiring culture and attitude towards doing business .

Consider learning how to write a white paper if you ’re looking to improve your content marketing efforts .
White papers , like other long - form content marketing pieces such as case studies and e-books , have the potential to influence people not through flashy sales copy but through informative content .
Simply put , you open people up to your marketing message by first giving them content they actually want to read .
If you ’ve heard of white paper writing as a marketing tactic already , you probably already know white papers can be excellent tools to drive leads and sales .
But what are white papers and how do you write one ?
While white papers can seem complicated , they do n’t have to be .
This article will teach you the basics of how to write a white paper of your own .
Note :
There are some differences of opinion in the white paper writing community regarding things like abstracts , best lengths , and rates if you choose to outsource your writing .
My opinions are based on years of experience in writing marketing white papers for small businesses , so that is the perspective this article is coming from .
Please do n’t think that there ’s only one “ right ” way to format or write a white paper .
Let ’s get started :
What is a White Paper ?
In short , a white paper is a report .
That ’s it .
Nothing fancy there .
White papers are designed to do two primary things : educate and persuade .
Here ’s what I mean .
Let ’s say your company released a new software package , and you want to increase sales to corporate clients ( who will use the software company - wide ) .
You are n’t targeting end consumers .
You ’re targeting executive - level professionals who are authorized to make that kind of purchasing decision .
They ’re probably not going to buy your software on a large scale ( or switch away from another software package ) on a whim .
Why ?
Because there ’s a significant cost involved , both in purchasing the software and in training their employees to use it .
They want to be educated .
They want to know exactly why they need software like yours , and why yours is the right choice for them .
If you ca n’t make them better understand what you ’re selling , and if you ca n’t show them the benefits in choosing your solution to their problem , you wo n’t make many sales .
White papers help you to get around that because they can be longer and more detailed than other types of marketing copy ( like a brochure ) .
There are two basic types of white papers : technical white papers and marketing white papers .
In the end , they ’re designed to do the same thing — sell your product ( or service , or company ) .
Technical white papers have to persuade a more technical audience .
They ’ll be filled with things like specs , whereas marketing white papers can be used to promote just about anything .
For the scope of this article , let ’s stick to marketing white papers .
What ’s in a White Paper ?
So you know your white paper has to educate someone about your product or service , and it has to convince them to buy from you .
How does it do that ?
Let ’s oversimplify .
When you learn how to write a white paper , here ’s what it should say to the reader :
White Paper : “ You have a problem , whether you know it yet or not — a big problem for your business .
Here ’s what that problem is and proof that it affects businesses like yours . ”
Reader : “ Oh no .
You ’re right .
That is a problem . ”
White Paper : “ That problem might even be tied to other , smaller problems .
Uh oh , you ’d better find a solution , and fast . ”
Reader : “ Wow !
I did n’t realize all of that .
Okay .
Quick .
Give me a solution . ”
White Paper : “ You ’re in luck .
Here ’s an idea that could make all of your problems go away .
Let me describe the basic solution for you without shoving a marketing message down your throat yet to help you understand it better . ”
Reader : “ Great .
I think I understand , and I agree — that sounds like it might work and be really good for business .
Any specific recommendations on who to hire ? ” White Paper : “ Um , yeah .
Me !
Here ’s why my company or my product meets your needs . ”
Reader : “ Sign me up ! ”
Okay .
That ’s obviously not quite what ’s going through a reader ’s head , but it shows you the intended train of thought when moving from one section to the next of the following basic white paper outline :
The Problem ( or Opportunity ) Proof the Problem Exists Additional Problems The Basic Solution Your Solution ( the Marketing Message )
White papers can include more than those five elements , but they ’re the most important , and the ones that should be included in any white paper you write .
You might also choose to include a title page , abstract , illustrations ( like charts and graphs ) , sidebars , a separate benefits section ( instead of including benefits in your general solution ) , guidelines on how to choose a provider for the solution ( before pitching yourself ) , and more .
Since you ’re probably learning how to write a white paper for the first time though , let ’s focus on keeping it as simple as possible .
White Paper Sections and What to Include
Now let ’s look at what should be included in each of those sections when you write white papers .
The Problem —
This is the introduction to your white paper .
It will tell the reader what their primary problem or opportunity is ( something holding back their own business , or an opportunity to drastically increase sales or productivity for example ) .
Your introduction should n’t be more than a page long .
You want to get the problem across quickly in order to grab the reader ’s attention .
Proof the Problem Exists —
You say there ’s a problem for the reader .
So what ?
Why should they believe you ?
After exposing them to the primary problem , you need to back it up with market research .
This is where you ’ll include statistics that verify your claim .
Additional Problems —
Sometimes the initial problem is enough to get the reader ’s interest , but not enough by itself to make them feel that action is necessary now .
There are often additional problems that could be addressed by the same solution .
Include them here .
The Basic Solution —
Do n’t jump into talking about your own product yet .
This is still a part of the educational aspect of the white paper .
You should describe the basic solution that the reader should consider ( for example , if you were trying to sell software as mentioned earlier , here you ’d make a case for your type of software — not your company ) .
This section should also cover the benefits of the solution to the reader .
Remember , as in all forms of copywriting , focus on benefits rather than features .
Your Solution —
Here ’s where you get to toot your own horn .
You ’ve ( hopefully ) convinced the reader that they like your basic solution .
Now you get to tell them why they should buy from you specifically .
I like to keep this to a single page — I almost treat it as a flyer , showcasing intro copy to highlight specific benefits , any information that sets your product apart from the competition , and then a call to action .
You should always include a call to action ( send them to your website to order , have them call a rep to answer their questions , etc. ) .
Without a call to action , why did you just get them to read through the white paper ?
Formatting a White Paper
Now that you know the basics of how to write the white paper ’s content , how should it look ?
While I ’m not sure if you ’ll consider it fortunate or unfortunate , there ’s no right way to format a white paper !
Some white paper writers like to use a single format for all of their clients .
Others adapt from one to the next .
I often let the supplementary material decide .
For example if there will be a lot of charts and graphs I ’ll go with a full page format to allow more room for the graphics .
If it will have few graphics and I ’d rather use pull quotes for visual interest , I might go with a two - column format where quotes and small charts might go in a sidebar area , keeping the main body text free - flowing .
You also have to decide whether or not you want to include a title page and abstract ( a short summary of the white paper content ) .
Here ’s the rule I go by :
If I include a title page , I include an abstract .
If I go right into the content on the first page , then I leave the abstract out .
Why ?
Because if I ’m going to put an extra page between my reader and my main problem paragraph , then I want to give them the gist up front — a reason to open it .
Sometimes a title and sub - title will be enough , but not in every case .
A title page is n’t necessary , although many companies include them .
What I suggest is that you choose whichever format you ’re most comfortable with , but try to keep things consistent with white papers released through your company moving forward .
Just make sure that if you do n’t include a title page , your company name , logo , and contact information is clearly visible on the first page .
Speaking of titles , here ’s a rule I follow and suggest : forget about catchy and cutesy .
The white paper title not only has to get attention , but it should more importantly tell the reader what ’s coming .
Because of that , I believe it should always include a mention of the basic problem and the target market .
You need to scream “ Hey , this white paper is for you ! ”
Save the fluff for consumer marketing if you must ; not B to B .
How long should your white paper be ?
Again , there is no right answer .
It might be five pages .
It might be 50 pages .
I ’ve found that most of my clients prefer white papers in the 5 - 10 page range .
However , the more technical the material , the more information might have to be included .
So there ’s nothing wrong with a longer white paper .
Just keep your target market in mind .
Ask yourself , “ will they read this ? ”
If you ’re targeting busy executives , keep it short and get to the point .
If you ’re targeting technical professionals who want every little spec and detail , then give them what they want .
Hiring a White Paper Writer
If you ’re not comfortable with the idea of writing white papers yourself yet , you might opt to hire a business writer .
Some writers specialize in writing nothing but white papers .
Other business writers and copywriters write white papers in addition to other types of copy ( such as press releases , email marketing campaign copy , brochure copy , etc. ) .
If you already have a business writer working for you , I would suggest seeing if they ’re capable of writing a white paper first .
If they ’re already intimately familiar with your company , products , and target market , they ’ll be well - equipped to handle your project for you .
Just know that white paper writing wo n’t come cheap ( if the writer is well - qualified and experienced ) .
It ’s not uncommon to pay more than $ 1.00 per word for a white paper ( sometimes quite significantly more ) .
Expect at least a low to mid four - figure budget if you want to hire someone experienced .
As with all things white paper related , there ’s no “ right ” price to pay .
They ’ll vary significantly based on specialty , location , experience , and other credentials .
If you want to learn how to write a white paper of your own , it ’s a great idea to take some time to search the Web and read a few white papers .
Look at some in your niche , and look at some outside of it .
You ’ll find many different formats , lengths , and styles , and looking at samples will be one of the best ways for you to decide what you do and do n’t like when it comes to writing white papers .
Do you have some favorite white paper examples to share ?
Link to them in the comments and offer your own tips on how readers can learn how to write white papers for their businesses .

Movie budgets have gotten so large that it 's almost impossible to imagine just what it is they 're spending these hundreds of millions on .
Well , as with most Hollywood stories , the reality seems more unrealistic than even the worst special effect .

You can't really examine some of the more interesting expenditures in Hollywood history without bringing up Kevin Costner 's $ 175 million albatross .
Cracked 's covered some of the VFX work on this shitshow previously ( they CGI 'd his goddamn hairline ? ) but the tale of the single most expensive visual in the film is too full of schadenfreude to pass up :

Universal paid $ 22 million for a quarter - mile long set called " The Atoll , " representing the floating junkpile that our piss - drinking , gilled Costner - Mutant finds himself on .
Kevin convinced Universal that for the utmost verisimilitude , they had to film on the ocean .
But instead of then just filming on the ocean , they built a massive tank ... in the ocean , just off the coast of Hawaii .
And then they built a giant set that depleted all the available steel in Hawaii .
It weighed 1000 - tons , cost $ 22 million and contained approximately no bathrooms .
The crew did n't like the idea of swimming and filming in their own filth , so costs rose as crewmembers had to be ferried back and forth to the island just to use the collection of port - a- potties outside their living quarters , which were old , uninsulated condominiums .
By contrast , Costner slept in a villa , complete with a butler , a chef and private swimming pool while collecting a $ 14 million salary .
Diiiiiiick .

When it came time to shoot , they put the set they built in the tank they built .
One thing they did n't take into account : Floating cities with no means of propulsion are hard to move .
When a hurricane warning was issued in the middle of shooting , they had no choice but sit back while the fucking thing sank .
Costner 's career followed shortly .
I have n't been posting on this potentially game - changing story because the details are complex and the information overload enormous and I want to make sure I get every iota right .
Stay tuned for more in the coming days .
But Scott Horton 's latest piece zeroes in on a very specific detail : the weird autopsies .
Horton claimed that the families of the dead prisoners requested the missing necks and heart and kidneys of the deceased for a second autopsy .
Rowan Scarborough at Human Events , contacted the military to debunk the story .
He wrote :
I am told authoritatively that the families have not requested the neck organs .
Horton has the actual letter requesting the organs ( see after the jump ) .
So either it got lost in the mail or this is another demonstrable untruth from the government .
Now Horton has asked one of the most respected autopsy pathologists inn the country to review the procedures of the autopsies as performed at Gitmo .
Read the whole disturbing thing .
It seems extremely clear that they violated standards and procedures that are routine for both civilian and military autopsies .
For example , organs removed from bodies are always returned to the next of kin for secondary autopsies if requested .
That did n't happen .
From the pathologist , Dr Michael Baden :
It is not appropriate to be unresponsive to the pathologists conducting the second autopsy .
If the body parts that were removed have been properly preserved , they can still be examined years later to assist in independently establishing how the death occurred .
Then this jumped out at me when I first read it .
In the original autopsy , it was found that the hyoid bone of one of the deceased had been broken .
The military claims this occurred accidentally during the removal of the neck for examination .
It had nothing to do with what they claim were hangings .
Here 's what the pathologist said of that finding :
A fracture of the hyoid bone occurs more commonly in homicidal manual strangulation than in suicidal hanging .
A pathologist performing the second autopsy should be able to examine the hyoid bone and larynx to independently determine if the fracture happened while the decedent was alive or inadvertently after death during autopsy removal of the larynx .
My italics .
But the second autopsy was denied this option by the US military .
Then the weird detail that also struck me before : why on earth did the deceased stuff rags down their throats if they wanted to commit suicide by hanging ?
The military 's explanation was that a rag was placed over the mouth to muffle any sound or cry they might utter when hanging and that they were then " inhaled as a natural reaction to death by asphyxiation . ”
No , I 'm not making that up .
But I 'm not an expert so the pathologist 's analysis should be deferred to :
I am not aware of any other case in which suicide was accomplished in this way , at least not with a gag in his mouth covered by a surgical mask .
I have a feeling this story is not over .
The letter asking for the organs of the deceased is below :

Just a week ago , Sacha Baron Cohen — the alter ego of Borat and Brüno — was announced as an Oscar presenter by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences .
Now , suddenly , Baron Cohen has vanished from that list .
Why is he gone from the show ?
Because one of the broadcast ’s producers was scared he might offend gazillionaire Best Director nominee James Cameron .
An insider familiar with the Oscar telecast tells Vulture that an Avatar sketch planned by Baron Cohen and Ben Stiller was nixed yesterday by show producer Bill Mechanic , who worried that Cameron would be so offended by it that he might even walk out of the Oscar broadcast on live TV .
So what skit could possibly so incense the HMFIC ?
Our insider informs us that Baron Cohen planned to appear onstage as a blue - skinned , female Na’vi , with Stiller translating “ her ” interplanetary speech .
As the skit went on , though , it would become clear that Stiller was n’t translating properly , because Cohen would grow ever more upset .
At its climax , an infuriated Baron Cohen would pull open “ her ” evening gown to reveal that s/he was pregnant , knocked up with Cameron ’s love child , and would go on to confront her baby daddy as if s/he were on Jerry Springer .
Mechanic , now both a producer of motion pictures and of this year ’s Oscar telecast , was head of Twentieth Century Fox when Cameron ’s Titanic famously went massively over budget and over schedule , so he ’s well acquainted with Cameron ’s sense of humor — or lack of it .
“ Let ’s just say that Cameron is n’t known to be , shall we say , ‘ self - deprecating , ’ ” explained one insider familiar with the decision to cut the sketch .
Academy spokesperson Toni Thompson would only confirm that Baron Cohen was no longer presenting , but Baron Cohen ’s spokesman , Matt Labov , tells Vulture that “ I hate to use the term , because it ’s so ubiquitous , but there were ‘ creative differences . ’
Nothing acrimonious , but both sides felt that since they could n’t agree , [ Cohen ] might as well remain in London . ”
( Calls to Mechanic ’s office were not returned at deadline . )
So in case you ’re ranking celebrity senses of humor at home , you can now safely put Cameron below Eminem .

Call for testing : nouveau open - source nvidia driver
We 're aiming to ship Nouveau as the default driver for nVidia cards in Lucid as a better nv .
Towards this end there are now packages ready for wider testing in the xorg - edgers / nouveau PPA [ 1 ] .
To test the nouveau drivers you just need to add the PPA with “ add - apt - repository ppa:xorg - edgers / nouveau ” , update your package lists , upgrade your packages and then install the “ xserver - xorg - video - nouveau ” package from the PPA .
This should install the needed packages : linux - backport - modules - nouveau for the kernel module , nouveau - firmware , and xserver - xorg - video - nouveau for the X driver .
The upgraded xserver - xorg - core should automatically use the nouveau drivers without an xorg.conf , and the newer libdrm is also needed .
All Lucid users can help with testing - if you do n't have nvidia hardware please test that it does n't break your existing drivers .
Users with nvidia hardware should test that they get :
1 ) Kernel modesetting from early boot including a nice native - resolution console .
2 ) The nouveau driver is automatically loaded by X without needing an xorg.conf - this can be checked in / var / log/Xorg.0.log , as usual .
3 ) The nouveau driver generally works as well as nv - nouveau should pick the correct resolution , dual - head should work , video should play nicely , etc .
You should not expect to work : * The nvidia binary drivers .
The nouveau kernel module will bind to the hardware and there is no mechanism for handing off to nvidia kernel module .
* 3D acceleration .
Brave souls can build mesa from source ( and may well find that they can run compiz ) , but we will not be shipping the 3D component in Lucid .
For the moment problems can be reported as replies to this mail - I 'm particularly interested in any situation where this breaks non-nvidia hardware . [ 1 ] :

A cross-party group of MPs will call today for a review of the way arms sales are approved after the government admitted British equipment was " almost certainly " used in the assault on Gaza last year .
" It is regrettable that arms exports to Israel were almost certainly used in Operation Cast Lead [ the attack on Gaza ] , " the Commons committee on strategic export controls says in a report published .
" This is in direct contravention to the UK government 's policy that UK arms exports to Israel should not be used in the occupied territories . "
The MPs say they welcome the government 's subsequent decision to revoke five export licences for equipment destined for the Israeli navy but " broader lessons " must be learned from a review to ensure British arms exports to Israel are not used in the occupied territories in future .
After the attack on Gaza , David Miliband , the foreign secretary , told the Commons that all future applications for arms - related exports to Israel " will be assessed taking into account the recent conflict " .
He said Israeli equipment used in the attack on Gaza " almost certainly " contained British - supplied components included in cockpit displays in US F - 16 combat aircraft sold to Israel , and components for the fire control and radar systems , navigation equipment and engine assemblies for US Apache helicopters .
The equipment also included armoured personnel carriers adapted from Centurion tanks sold to Israel in the late 1950s and components for the guns and radar in Israeli Sa'ar - class corvettes which took part in the operation .
Miliband said the government was looking into all existing licences to see whether any of them needed to be reconsidered .
He added that he believed British export controls were amongst the strongest and most effective in the world .
Government - approved arms exports to Israel were worth more than £ 27.5 m in 2008 , according to the the report .
Government departments approved nearly £ 4 m worth of export licences for weapons and equipment with dual military and civil uses in the nine months after the Gaza attack , according to official statistics .
Though this suggests a significant drop , the figures show Britain was continuing to sell Israel a wide range of military equipment , including small - arms ammunition and parts for sniper rifles .
Most of the equipment was components for large items , including parts for ground - based radar , military aircraft engines , military aircraft navigation equipment , military communications and unmanned drones .
Among approved exports were remote ground - sensor systems , electronic warfare equipment " components for sniper rifles " , " small arms ammunition " and " test equipment for recognition / identification equipment " .
The report also reveals that the government decided to revoke a number of licences for arms sales to Sri Lanka .
It says it regrets British arms were sold to Sri Lanka during ceasefire periods in the conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels .
Amnesty International called on the government to act swiftly to close loopholes allowing " brass - plate " companies registered in the UK to trade arms to countries where human rights violations were committed .
It backed the committee 's call for a robust international arms trade treaty .
Amnesty International 's arms programme director , Oliver Sprague , said : " World leaders and campaigners have worked far too hard on the treaty for it to become a worthless piece of paper that will do little to protect people from armed violence . "
“ This was a collection of things that the bureau did n’t want to be part of the regular filing system because it was considered highly sensitive , ’’ John Fox , the FBI ’s official historian , said in an interview .
Indeed , in the opinion of FBI officials , the room was quickly abused .
“ Some of these files contain no indication as to why , when , or by whom they were placed in this restricted status , ’’ one memo , dated May 15 , 1952 , stated .
“ These 26 cabinets are presently in one room and because of this weight factor must be moved immediately , ’’ one Sept. 13 , 1961 , memo warned .
Several years later , another memo reveals , it grew to 79 file cabinets .
On several occasions , the room , which only designated officials could access , became so overcrowded that the contents had to be moved to a larger space out of fear that the Justice Department building where it was first housed could not withstand the weight .
Yet the internal memos discussing the file room and its contents provide a unique window into what the FBI considered some of the most serious domestic security threats , both real and imagined .
Many of the files that were kept there over the years , some designated with cryptic titles such as “ raindrop ’ ’ and “ snitch - jacketing , ’’ remain secret — if they have n’t been destroyed , as one former FBI official speculated .
The memos , spanning the 1950s to the 1980s , were approved for release under the Freedom of Information Act and provided exclusively to the Globe by a researcher outside the FBI who wished to remain anonymous .
But now , for the first time , the FBI has opened its doors — at least a crack — by releasing hundreds of pages of memos outlining why bureau officials have deemed certain information too hot to handle even for most top - level officials .
Established in 1948 under the reign of notoriously secretive FBI director J. Edgar Hoover , it remains in use today at FBI headquarters in Washington to safeguard what the bureau considers its most highly sensitive information .
It is the FBI ’s “ special file room , ’’ where for decades sensitive material has been stored separately from the bureau ’s central filing system to restrict access severely and , in more sinis ter instances , some experts assert , prevent the Congress and the public from getting their hands on it .
It is also where the bureau stowed documents considered more embarrassing than classified , including its history of illegal spying on domestic political organizations and surveillance of nascent gay rights groups .
WASHINGTON —
It is where the government has hidden the most secret information : plans to relocate Congress if Washington were attacked , dossiers on double agents , case files about high - profile mob figures and their politician friends , and a disturbing number of reports about the possible smuggling of atomic bombs into the United States .
Others who have studied the FBI say the special filing location , at times also referred to as the “ confidential file room , ’’ has also served as a way to protect information about bureau activities that may have been unlawful , such as spying on Americans without probable cause .
“ This was a system that allowed FBI officials to say we have searched our central records system and there is no record of illegal conduct ’’ by the bureau , said Athan G. Theoharis , a former professor at Marquette University and a specialist on the reign of Hoover , who served as the agency ’s first director , from 1924 to 1972 , and who is known to have maintained his own files that he ordered destroyed after his death .
“ It was a pretty efficient system Hoover devised , ’’ Theoharis said .
“ If you can minimize who knew what the bureau is doing , you can minimize any legal action ’’ against the bureau if it operated outside of the law .
A majority of the files appear to be related to highly classified activities .
Many are excluded from guidelines that require the government to declassify documents after a certain period of time .
Some subjects are considered so secret that even the bureaucratic machinations for putting them into the secret file room were blacked out — such as memos discussing the files about potential spies for China operating in the United States .
In the early years of the Cold War , the FBI began placing thousands of other documents relating to security matters into the special file room , according to Fox and other specialists .
Stashed away were plans to conceal US radars designed to spy on the Soviet military , details of American war plans , and evacuation plans should Washington be attacked .
There were several files on the possible threat of smuggled nuclear weapons , including one labeled “ Atomic Bomb in Unknown Consul . ’’
The room was filled with files on Americans believed to be spying for Russia , including Julius Rosenberg , who was executed for selling atomic bomb secrets , and Morton Sobell , an American engineer who spent nearly 18 years in prison for spying for the Soviet Union .
Some of the documents , meanwhile , indicate that the United States was spying on friends during the height of the Cold War .
A number of files contained the diplomatic codes of Greece , Panama , Guatemala , Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Sweden , and even neutral Switzerland , allowing the United States to read secret communications between their diplomats .
Others were more questionable in nature , such as numerous files from the 1950s and 1960s detailing the FBI ’s spying on early gay rights groups such as The Mattachine Society , which in one 1958 memo was categorized under “ internal security . ’’
Homosexuality , in fact , was for a lengthy period an obsession of the bureau and the focus of multiple domestic intelligence operations , the memos show .
Another file was spirited out of the regular bureau filing system because it involved “ allegations of homosexuality of some very prominent individuals . ’’
It added : “ In view of the obscene nature of the allegations and the prominence of some individuals mentioned , therein , it is felt that this file should be retained in the Special File Room . ’’
Other files on domestic spying that were routed to the special file room involved “ black nationalist extremists . ’’
There were also files about an “ extremely sensitive counterintelligence technique ’’ called snitch - jacketing , which apparently involved the FBI spreading false information that members of a targeted group were government informants in order to sow conflict within their membership .
“ Secrecy was the key , ’’ Theoharis said .
“ Knowledge is power . ’’
The special filing location was even used to protect information about politicians believed to be involved with criminals .
“ The information is of a very sensitive nature in that it contains frequent reference to highly placed persons in Chicago law enforcement as well as city , county , and state political figures and their relations with the hoodlum element , ’’ one 1960 memo stated , requesting a file be routed to the special room .
“ References are also made to prominent businessmen and occasionally newspaper reporters . ’’
Longtime observers of the FBI say the memos are not just historically valuable , but also provide a roadmap for researchers who can now request some of the files cited in them , at least those with titles or file numbers that appear in the newly released documents .
The memos will be posted at governmentattic.org , a website run by volunteers that publishes hundreds of government documents released under the Freedom of Information Act .
But according to Susan Rosenfeld , former FBI historian , many of them have been destroyed as part of regular housekeeping or are no longer stored at the FBI but at other government records centers .

Time Management
As most bloggers know , time is money .
For me , it ’s no different .
My work weeks are very busy .
It ’s almost a science for me to schedule real Life work for two part time jobs , Freelance work , meeting with clients , advertisement outside of the web , meeting with clients , blogging time , personal time with the wife , school , working out , and a social life .
After several months of struggling , for the New Year , I decided it was time to start over , get things sorted out , and be more productive .
Tip 1 :
Get a schedule !
I can not stress this enough .
If you do not have a schedule and stick to it , you will fail .
For over a year I have been working a part time job and doing freelance whenever I could the work .
At first this was easy , I only worked several times a week and could schedule around a set schedule .
But as time went on , things got a bit busier and I had a hard time remembering appointments ( mostly personal , never work related ) .
About two months ago I started using a day planner , pda , and outlook calendar to set my work schedule .
This seemed to work for me .
But I did not schedule time for school , personal , and social time .
I still had issues with finding enough waking hours to get my work completed .
I was averaging about three to four hours of sleep and it was tearing me up .
So last week I started to schedule in everything .
I schedule everything I do from the time I get up in the morning to the time go to bed .
I plan this out weekly .
Everything is open to adjustment , but if an adjustment has to be made I fix it as soon as I get home .
I am still adjusting this schedule , but so far , I seem to be getting more sleep and my productivity levels are rising .
The reason I use multiple ways to schedule my life is for several reasons .
The first reason is , the more I look at my schedule , the easier it is for me to understand and remember what I have to do on any given day of the week .
Second , I can not carry a day planner everywhere I go .
The planner mostly stays at home at my desk , so my wife can check my schedule or add things to it as needed .
I carry my pda almost everywhere I go .
Some will say , if you have smartphone or a Blackberry , I can have all my information in there and not carry a pda .
That works as well .
But I tend to loose my phones .
I do keep my life in my smartphone , but that is only a backup .
The reason I carry the pda is I almost never take it out unless I am updating , or turning off an alarm .
Once I am done with it , it goes back on the built clip or sits in the cradle on my desk .
Using this system , I almost never misplace my pda .
At the end of the day , I sync my devices , update my planner , and back up everything .
This works great for me , but for others , this may not work .
Tip 2 :
Stop playing those stupid Facebook App games .
One of the easiest ways to burn up a time is playing games on Facebook or other social media sites .
If you must play those games schedule accordingly and never spend more than 30 minutes a day on it .
If you need more time , try playing during your lunch time or your scheduled break time .
But NEVER sacrifice your work , social life or family life to play these stupid , useless waste of time games .
I use to play these games all the time .
I use to spend several hours a day playing .
I would spend about an hour in the morning and then several in the evening .
After a while , I slowed it down to about 30 minutes a day .
Now I almost never play .
I choose to spend my free time with my wife , real life friends , blogging , and playing video games .
As for video games , I rarely get to play these .
I love video games and miss them , but I simply do not have the time anymore .
If do get the time , I generally head over to a friends house play multiplayer games or check out what they purchased .
Tip 3 :
Get off the couch and turn off the television !
Another easy to waste time is getting to comfortable on a couch while the TV is on .
Sitting on the couch is not that big of deal , if the TV on , you can distracted , next thing you know , you burned up two hours of your work day .
So leave the TV off and get off the couch .
The couch should only be used if you are working late and you are spending time with the family after your normal work hours .
For me , the couch is to tempting .
Early in the morning , I sit on the couch only to check my email and work on non related work items .
If I stay on the couch to long I get tired quickly and I get tempted to take a nap that could lead to half the day wasted .
Tip 4 :
Do not do work in the bed .
Working in the bed or near bed might seem like a good idea , but its not .
If you spend time working in the bed during the work day , the brain associate ’s places by what it used to .
The brain thinks that when you are in bed , the body should be sleeping or preparing to sleep .
If you work from the bed , stop it .
This is can slow you productivity down , and even tire you out .
If you have an office that is also a guest bedroom , you should either move your office or move your bed to another room if it is possible .
Just having the bed in the room , can be distraction that can be costly .
Tip 5 :
Organize your workspace .
Studies have shown that people that have a cluttered work area is less productive than those that are neat and have a well organized work area .
I truly believe this theory ; I generally have a cluttered work area .
At first of the year , I organized my office to be more productive and get rid of useless junk .
In the few weeks that I have kept organized I have seen an increased level of productivity .
When the area gets cluttered , I get less productive .
When this happens , I noticed I spend more time looking for documents and other items when they are not put away in their proper spaces and less time when everything is put away and well organized .
Also noticed that I tend to get tired easier and annoyed a lot faster .
So I try and clean up my office at the end of each work day and at the end of the week I clean up and get rid of anything that I do not need .
What do you do for time management ?

Greetings .
Sometimes a seemingly small software update can usher in a whole new world .
When Microsoft shortly pushes out a Windows 7 update with the reportedly innocuous title " Update for Microsoft Windows ( KB971033 ) " -- it will be taking your Windows 7 system where it has never been before .
And it may not be a place where you want to go .
Imagine that you 're sitting quietly in your living - room at your PC , perhaps watching YouTube .
Suddenly , a pair of big , burly guys barge into your house and demand that you let them check your computer to make sure that it's " genuine " and not running pirated software .
You protest that you bought it fair and square , but they 're insistent -- so you give in and let them proceed .
Even though you insist that you bought your laptop from the retail computer store down the street many months ago , and did n't install any pirate software , the visitors declare that your computer " is n't genuine " according to their latest pirated systems lists , and they say that " while we 'll let you keep using it , we 're modified your system so that it will constantly nag in your face until you pay up for a legit system ! "
And they head out the door to drop in on the eBay - loving grandmother next door .
You then notice that the wallpaper on your PC has turned black , and these strange notifications keep popping up urging you to " come clean . "
Ridiculous ?
Well , uh , actually no .
Microsoft most definitely has a valid interest in fighting the piracy of their products .
It 's a serious problem , with negative ramifications for Microsoft and its users .
But in my opinion , Microsoft is about to embark on a dramatic escalation of anti-piracy efforts that many consumers are likely to consider to be a serious and unwanted intrusion at the very least .
It 's important for you to understand what Microsoft is going to do , what your options are , and why I am very concerned about their plans .
Back in June 2006 , in a series of postings , I revealed how Microsoft was performing unannounced " phone home " operations over the Internet as part of their Windows Genuine Advantage authentication system for Windows XP .
( The last in that series of postings describes Microsoft 's reaction to the resulting controversy . )
The surrounding circumstances even spawned a lawsuit against Microsoft , which coincidentally was recently dismissed by a judge .
But Microsoft has continued to push the anti-piracy envelope , now under the name Windows Activation Technologies ( WAT ) .
This time around , to the company 's credit ( and many thanks to them for this ! )
Microsoft reached out to me starting several months ago for briefings and discussion about their plans for a major new WAT thrust -- on the basis , to which I agreed , that I not discuss it publicly until now .
The release of Windows 7 " Update for Microsoft Windows ( KB971033 ) " will change the current activation and anti-piracy behavior of Windows 7 by triggering automatic " phone home " operations over the Internet to Microsoft servers , typically for now at intervals of around 90 days .
The purpose ?
To verify that you 're not running a pirated copy of Windows , and to take various actions changing the behavior of your PC if the WAT system believes that you are not now properly authenticated and " genuine " -- even if up to that point in time it had been declaring you to be A - OK .
Note that I 'm not talking about the one - time activation that you ( or your PC manufacturer ) performs on new Windows systems to authenticate them to Microsoft initially .
I 'm talking a procedure that would " check - in " your system with Microsoft at quarterly intervals , and that could take actions to significantly change your " user experience " whenever the authentication regime declares you to have fallen from grace .
These automatic queries will repeatedly -- apparently for as long as Windows is installed -- validate your Windows 7 system against Microsoft 's latest database of pirated system signatures ( currently including more than 70 activation exploits known to Microsoft ) .
If your system matches -- again even if up to that time ( which could be months or even years since you obtained the system ) it had been declared to be genuine -- then your system will be " downgraded " to " non-genuine " status until you take steps to obtain what Microsoft considers to be an authentic , validated , Windows 7 license .
In some cases you might be able to get this for free if you can convince Microsoft that you were the victim of a scam -- but you 'll have to show them proof .
Otherwise , you 'll need to pull out your wallet .
I 'm told that the KB971033 update is scheduled to deploy to the manual downloading " Genuine Microsoft Software " site on February 16 , and start pushing out automatically through the Windows Update environment on February 23 .
Blog Update 5:05 PM :
This blog entry originally listed the KB number without the leading 9 , since that was the way it was provided to me verbally and confirmed by Microsoft .
They have now notified me that Update for Microsoft Windows ( KB971033 ) is the actual designation , so I have made the appropriate change to the KB number throughout this posting .
The update will reportedly be tagged simply as an " Important " update .
This means that if you use the Windows Update system , the update will be installed to your Windows 7 PC based on whatever settings you currently have engaged for that level of update -- it will not otherwise ask for specific permission to proceed with installation .
If your Windows Update settings are such that you manually install updates , you can choose to decline this particular update and you can also uninstall it later after installation -- without any negative effects per se .
But do n't assume that this will always " turn back the clock " in terms of the update 's effects .
More on this below .
Also , reportedly if the 90 - day interval WAT piracy checking system " calls " are unable to connect to the Microsoft servers ( or even if they are manually blocked from connecting , e.g. by firewall policies ) there will reportedly be no ill effects .
However -- and this is very important -- if the update is installed and the authentication system then ( after connecting with the associated Microsoft authentication servers at any point ) decides that your system is not genuine , the " downgrading " that occurs will not be reversible by uninstalling the update afterward .
The WAT authentication system also includes various other features , such as the ability to automatically replace authentication / license related code on PCs if it decides that the official code has been tampered with ( Microsoft rather euphemistically calls this procedure " self heal " ) .
I 've mentioned that Windows 7 systems will be " downgraded " to " non-genuine " status if they 're flagged as suspected pirates .
What does this mean ?
Essentially , they 'll behave the same way they would if they had failed to be authenticated and activated initially within the grace period after purchase .
Downgraded systems will still function much as usual fundamentally , but there will be some very significant ( and very annoying ) changes if your system has been designated non-genuine .
The background wallpaper will change to black .
You can set it back to whatever you want , but once an hour or so it will reset again to black .
Various " nag " notifications will appear at intervals to " remind " you that your system has been tagged as a likely pirate and offering you the opportunity to " come clean " -- becoming authorized and legitimate by buying a new Windows 7 license .
Some of these nags will be windows that appear at boot or login time , others will appear frequently ( perhaps every 20 minutes or so ) as main screen windows and taskbar popup notices .
Systems that are considered to be non-genuine also have only limited access to other Microsoft updates of any kind ( e.g. , access to high priority security updates , but not anything else , may be permitted ) .
And of course , under the new WAT regime you run the risk of being downgraded into this position at any time during the life of your PC .
In response to my specific queries about how downgraded systems ( particularly unattended systems ) would behave vis-a - vis existing application environments , Microsoft has said that they have taken considerable effort to avoid having the downgrade " nag system " interfere with the actual running of other applications , including stealing of windows ' focus .
It remains to be seen how well this aspect turns out in practice .
All of this brings us to a very basic question .
Why would any PC owner -- honest or pirate -- voluntarily participate in such a continuing " phone home " authentication regime ?
Obviously , knowledgeable pirates will avoid the whole thing like the plague any way that they can .
Microsoft 's view , as explained to me and as primarily emphasized in their blog posting that will appear today announcing the WAT changes , is that honest Windows 7 users will want to know if their systems are running unauthentic copies of the operating system , since ( Microsoft asserts and indeed is the case ) those systems have a significant likelihood of also containing dangerous viruses or other potentially damaging illicit software that " ride " onto the PC along with the unauthentic copy of the OS .
But even if we assume that there 's a noteworthy risk of infections on systems running pirated copies of Windows 7 , the approach that Microsoft is now taking does n't seem to make sense even for honest consumers .
If Microsoft 's main concern were really just notifying users about " contaminated " systems , they could do so without triggering the non-genuine downgrading process and demands that the user purchase a new license ( demands that will be extremely confusing to many users ) .
As I originally discussed in How Innocents Can Be Penalized by Windows Genuine Advantage , it 's far more common than many people realize for completely innocent users to be running perfectly usable -- but not formally authenticated -- copies of Windows Operating Systems through no fault whatever of their own .
OK , let 's review where we stand .
The new Microsoft WAT regime relies upon a series of autonomous " cradle to grave " authentication verification connections to a central and ever - expanding Microsoft piracy signature database , even in the absence of major hardware changes or other significant configuration alterations that might otherwise cause the OS or local applications to query the user for explicit permission to reauthenticate .
Microsoft will trigger forced downgrading to non-genuine status if they believe a Windows 7 system is potentially pirated based on their " phone home " checks that will occur at ( for now ) 90 day intervals during the entire life of Windows 7 on a given PC , even months or years after purchase .
That Microsoft has serious piracy problems , and has " limited " the PC downgrading process to black wallpaper , repeating nagging at users , and extremely constrained update access is n't the key point .
Nor is the ostensibly " voluntary " nature of the update triggering these capabilities ( I say ostensibly since almost certainly most users will have the update installed automatically and wo n't even realize what it means at the time ) .
The new Microsoft WAT update and its associated actions represent unacceptable intrusions into the usability of consumer products potentially long after the products have been purchased and have been previously declared to be genuine .
Microsoft is not entirely alone in such moves .
For example , a major PC game manufacturer has apparently announced that their games will soon no longer run at all if you do n't have an Internet connection to allow them to authenticate at each run .
Still , games and other applications are one thing , operating systems are something else altogether .
And regardless of whether we 're talking about games or Windows 7 , it 's unacceptable for consumers to be permanently shackled to manufacturers via lifetime authentication regimes -- particularly ones that can easily impact innocent parties -- that can degrade their ability to use the products that they 've purchased in many cases months or even years earlier .
Fundamentally , for Microsoft to assert that they have the right to treat ordinary PC - using consumers in this manner -- declaring their systems to be non-genuine and downgrading them at any time -- is rather staggering .
Make no mistake about it , fighting software piracy is indeed important , but Microsoft seems to have lost touch with a vast swath of their loyal and honest users if the firm actually believes their new WAT anti-piracy monitoring system is an acceptable policy model .
My recommendations to persons who currently run or plan to run Windows 7 are simplicity themselves .
I recommend that you strongly consider rejecting the manual installation of the Windows Activation Technologies update KB971033 , and do not permit Windows Update to install it ( this will require that you not have your PC configured in update automatic installation mode , which has other ramifications -- so you may wish to consult a knowledgeable associate if you 're not familiar with Windows Update configuration issues ) .
And if at some point in the future you find that the update has been installed and your PC is still running normally , remove the update as soon as possible .
While I certainly appreciate Microsoft 's piracy problems , and the negative impact that these have both on the company and consumers , I believe that the approach represented by this kind of escalation on the part of Microsoft and others -- into what basically amounts to a perpetual anti-piracy surveillance regime embedded within already purchased consumer equipment -- is entirely unacceptable .

“ ‘ Where did this intel come from ?
Did we get it from the UN ? ’
‘ No , it ’s been vetted by the US Government . ’ ” Or words to that effect , I do n’t have a transcript for the movie The Green Zone .
I ’m just your humble ACW movie reviewer .
I ’m not sure what the connotation of that bit of dialog was supposed to be .
Was the Matt Damon character blaming the lack of good intelligence on the UN ?
Or was he wanting to know if it had a reasonable pedigree ?
I sort of suspect the former , since that was the feeling at the time , at least in the US Government .
After all , I remember leaving the UN Headquarters late at night after sitting all day on the meeting of the independent panel of international experts reviewing our conclusions about the Iraqi missile program when some lady standing outside the fence started yelling “ Boo UN ! Boo ! ”
Later in the movie , however , I could feel a bit of pride when the chubby guy from the CIA , referring to a Priority 1 site , said , “ There ’s nothing there , that place was hit by the UN two months ago . ”
This feeling of satisfaction was , unfortunately , soon followed by a sinking feeling when the person I watched the movie asked as we walked out , “ Is that how the real Al Rawi died ? ”
Movies have a license to simplify complex problems or make the audience feel a certain way all within 120 minutes .
In ‘ The Green Zone , ’ the writers simplified the bureaucratic dynamics of the Intelligence Community , the Secretary of Defense , and the White House by essentially blaming the war on one guy lying about Iraqi WMD when he had just been told differently by an Iraqi general .
It ’s possible to learn to hate a person in a short amount of time if he is a liar and tries to have Matt Damon killed .
It ’s very hard , however , to hate the interplay between high ranking policy makers who kept on sending intel analyses back because they just do n’t believe them .
The true point that the film makers were making — and it is in there — is that the Bush Administration wanted intelligence reports that said there was WMD in Iraq .
A Trip to Amman
In the movie , Poundstone falsifies a raw intel report about a meeting he had with him in Amman , Jordan .
The Poundstone character promises him , probably as an inducement to reveal the WMD locations , that he would play an important role in the “ new Iraq . ”
Instead , Al Rawi assures him that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Does Poundstone believe him ?
The movie is not clear on this since the meeting supposedly predates the time it covers .
It would , of course , have been very foolish to believe a single source about such an important issue .
While there are examples of single intel sources being used extensively in the lead up to the Iraq invasion — Curveball is a prime example — there were other sources to back them up .
Unfortunately , there were at least as many sources that refuted them .
That is both why it is necessary for an unbiased analysis and why it was possible for “ higher ups ” to insist the analysis be redone .
Their intuition told them to believe the WMD “ myth . ”
( Not that there was n’t WMD in Iraq after the First Gulf War and that the Iraqi Government lied about it .
They apparently used all the left over chemical weapons on the Shia and the Kurds to suppress the rebellion that the war ignited . )
General Al Rawi is an interesting ( fictional ) character .
Did he go to Amman to try to wave off the invasion ?
Or did he go there for personal gain , to secure a position in the new Iraqi Government ?
One could interpret the movie to say that he was a true Iraqi patriot and had gone to try to avert the coming war .
When that failed , the movie seems to say , he was willing to try to reduce the suffering of his country by using his influence over the Iraqi Army to bring about a new stability .
Since Al Rawi never existed , he is just a convenient technique to simply the problems of de-Ba’athification .
At that , I think he succeeds wonderfully .
Secret Initiatives
But what is most interesting about him is that there were secret Iraqi diplomatic missions sent out to try to avert the war .
I know from my personal experience at UNMOVIC that , by February 2003 , Iraq was desperate to forestall the invasion .
At the beginning of the final crisis , which I place at the time of Pres .
Bush ’s September 2002 speech to the UN General Assembly , Iraq was defiant and committed to stonewalling the international community ’s just demands that they either disarm or prove that they had already disarmed their WMD .
Iraq responded to that speech by supplying UNMOVIC with the backlog of their semiannual reports .
These reports were intended to keep the UN informed on the status of industrial sites that had WMD - potential .
They make pretty dry reading , consisting mostly of lists of chemicals or equipment located at each site .
Iraq had stopped supplying the United Nations with these reports when the UNSCOM inspectors left in 1998 .
We therefore got four years worth of reports on hundreds of potential WMD sites .
But there was a clear message if you read between the lines — and I mean that quite literally .
Iraq was once again poking a finger in the UN ’s eye .
For instance , where they were supposed to list newly purchased equipment ( equipment that we inspectors would certainly check up on once we got back into the country ) they said they were purchased “ on the local market . ”
That was , of course , impossible in the most literal sense of the phrase .
These pieces of equipment were manufactured in the West , most after the inspectors left in 1998 .
A more honest answer would have been “ they were smuggled in and we are not about to tell you about that ! ”
Oh , yes ; about my “ between the lines ” comment .

A Frenetic Last Month
By February of 2003 , a month or less before the war started , Iraq had undergone a dramatic transformation .
They were clearly desperate to cooperate with the UN and avert the war , something they obviously considered would be a tragedy for their country .
By mid-February , they were swamping us with new initiatives to try to resolve the remaining WMD questions .
Many of these were impractical or technically impossible but their shear number symbolized Iraq ’s mental state .
Of these dozens and dozens of new initiatives they sent us that month , there were two that stick in my memory .
Both proposed to use a sampling method to “ verify ” that the amount of VX , in one proposal , and anthrax , in the other , dumped in the desert accounted for all the poisonous material they had produced .
There were significant technical flaws with this proposal which even their own write - up showed .
For instance , it would be impossible to simply count the number of anthrax spores in a hundred or so core samples and infer the total amount of anthrax dumped at the site , which is a brief summary of one of their proposals .
Even if we were willing to count them , it would have been impossible to take that number and infer the total originally involved .
Spores die — even hardy anthrax spores — or migrate away as the wind or underground water moves them .
Iraq ’s own control region samples , outside the declared dump site , showed a significant amount of contamination .
Similar problems existed in the VX proposal .
( It turns out that , after the war , Iraqi bioweaponeers admitted dumping the rest of the anthrax at a different site , one too close to one of Saddam ’s palaces for them to admit . )
However , even admitting the flaws in the initiatives — flaws that might very well have been intentional — these initiatives showed a significant change in Iraq ’s desire to cooperate .
Unfortunately , as we believed at the time and have been confirmed since then , they also did show a willingness to reveal the truth about Iraq ’s WMD .
Dr. Hans Blix , as the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC , was brilliant at judging Iraq ’s level of cooperation in near real time .
This function , which he was mandated to perform by the UN Security Council ’s resolution creating UNMOVIC , was both vitally important and very difficult to assess .
It was important because it seems unlikely to me that the United Kingdom , for one , would have joined the coalition if Dr. Blix had been able to unambiguously state that Iraq was fully cooperating with the inspections .
Could the war have been averted if such a level of cooperation was present ?
I think it could have .
But we needed that full cooperation to finally resolve the remaining issues and it is clear that Iraq was holding out on giving that .
Now , let me return to General Al Rawi .
As I said , he — perhaps by accident — does represent a( nother ) real Iraqi initiative .
In that last month , the same thirty days during which we were being swamped by Iraqi disarmament initiatives , Iraqi diplomats were desperately reaching out to the Bush Administration to try to avert the war .
But instead of Amman , these meetings took place in London and instead of a “ Pentagon Special Intelligence ” officer ( Poundstone ) , the Iraqis were reaching out to Richard Perle .
And instead of an Iraqi general , the Iraqis were using a Lebanese - American businessman .
They are reported to have offered to let 2,000 FBI agents into Iraq to search for WMD .
( Here , too , I feel a certain amount of pride .
It ’s clear to me that the Iraqis realized that 2,000 FBI agents would be less effective than the 300 UN weapons inspectors .
One needs only consider the Anthrax terrorism investigation to see why . )
What would have happened if UNMOVIC had known about those secret diplomatic initiatives ?
I know I would have been convinced that Iraq had made a strategic decision to cooperate with the inspections .
It might still have been a hard slog to get the truth , but I am confident we could have verified the disarmament of Iraq by inspections alone .
By the way , I loved this movie !
It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time .
“ Battlestar Galactica ” is finding new life on the Web .
A year after the cult and critics ’ favorite science - fiction show left the air , a multi- player online game is being developed that further explores the “ Battlestar ” universe , which is also continuing in Syfy ’s “ Caprica ” television show .
The game , which will be introduced at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week , is set to be released worldwide in August or September .
Despite the crossover between the science - fiction and video game audiences , there has never been a major video game based on “ Battlestar Galactica . ”
In 2007 there was a poorly received downloadable starship fighting game with the name but little direct connection to the series .
“ We ’re picking a point in the chronology of the series that fans are very familiar with to tell new stories , ” explained Bill Kispert , vice president of digital platforms for the partnerships and licensing department of Universal Pictures , which owns the “ Battlestar Galactica ” rights and made the game deal .
“ There will be space combat as well as missions and exploration . ”
Unlike traditional online multi-player games such as World of Warcraft that ship on discs and cost $ 50 to buy plus $ 15 per month , Battlestar Galactica is part of a new wave of games playable entirely in a Web browser for free .
In such games , which are hugely popular in South Korea and China and growing fast in the West , players can choose to purchase additional items such as weapons , costumes and access to new levels .
The Battlestar Galactica game is being published by Bigpoint , in which Syfy parent company NBC Universal is co-owner of a majority stake .
“ With a browser game , you just get started when you launch , ” said Nils - Holger Henning , chief communications officer of Bigpoint .
“ We can constantly add features and content for people who are playing . ”

The bee protrudes the proboscis when the scent of a desirable food source is present .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
While bees are extremely important to our ecology , they are becoming important to our defense against biological and other weapons , as the bee ’s discreet sense of smell , equivalent to a dog ’s , is being exploited as a much cheaper way to detect various odors in the environment .
As far back as 1999 , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) Controlled Biological Systems Program funded a bee - training program to detect buried landmines , so that many thousands of acres of the world ’s land could be productively farmed without encountering landmines the ugly way .
A bee ’s natural instinct is to extend its proboscis when it encounters a desirable odor , anticipating the taste of a flower , let ’s say .
But the bees used in the 1999 DARPA experiment were trained , via classical Pavlovian conditioning , to respond to the odor of TNT instead .
Their reward when they responded with a Proboscis Extension Reflex ( PER ) , was a taste of sweet syrup .
Then , trainers attached small diodes onto the backs of TNT - trained bees and used handheld radar tracking devices to chart where the bees went .
In 2010 , bee training in the fields of defense and security , medicine , food , and building industries is big business .
Bee training is essentially the same as it was in 1999 , but the results are attained with more sophisticated and less expensive technology .
Inscentinal Ltd. has been working on developing very unique sensing instruments that couple the biological performance of honeybees with the technology to translate bee response into an electronic response .
Inscentanil ’s first proprietary design is a hand held device called the VASOR136 , a trace vapor detection unit that is very versatile .
The VASOR 136 holds 36 bees in cartridges .
They are all ready to detect the presence of something in the air .
The VASOR136 contains 36 cartridges each containing one bee .
Filtered in by a standard gas mask cartridge is a constant supply of clean air .
When an operator presses a button on the VASOR , an air sample is taken from the environment that exposes the bees to ambient , unfiltered air .
If the bees have been trained to respond to a vapor in that air , the bees will exhibit a PER response and the response will be translated by the VASOR into a simple result shown on the PDA screen display .
This BBC News video provides a glimpse at the VASOR136 .
The short video that is next on the BBC video page shows how bees were trained to detect TNT in Croatia in 2007 .
Very neat .
But the VASOR also allows for a modular approach insofar as each cartridge can contain a bee that ’s been trained to identify a different vapor , giving the VASOR the ability to trace up to 36 different vapors .
For security at airports the VASOR ’s cost efficiency could not possibly be matched by 36 trained dogs , and other security technologies do not currently have that range of potential threats covered .
Of course , there is also the ability of the VASOR to identify diseases and cancers in people and animals , to detect rapidly spreading bacteria in food , and to identify dry rot in buildings ....
The applications for the VASOR136 are just beginning to unfold .
As for the bees ... after a few hours of training and two or three days on the job , they can go back to working for the Queen .

I decided many years ago that it would be really fun to cook a healthy recipe from every country in the world , and I 've finally started doing it .
According to Wikipedia , Afghanistan is the first country in alphabetical order , and after doing a lot of research , I decided to try my hand at stuffed bell peppers - Afghani style .
I 'm generally not a fan of stuffed bell peppers , but this recipe is truly an exception .
The stuffing is very nicely spiced red lentils , and the peppers are baked just until they 're tender .
These peppers go well with any grain and / or a green salad .
Afghani Stuffed Bell Peppers
1 cup red lentils
2 - 3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
1 onion , diced
2 jalapenos , diced , seeds and stems included ( unless you 're a wimp ! )
1 inch ginger , chopped
2 cloves garlic , minced
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
Salt and pepper to taste
4 bell peppers ( any color )
Preheat the oven to 350F
Soak the red lentils for a half hour .
Drain and set aside .
Place the cumin , coriander seeds , and olive oil in a pan over medium - high heat .
Stir occasionally until the seeds start to pop .
Stir in the onion , jalapeno , garlic , and ginger .
Turn the heat down to medium - low and saute for a few minutes .
Add in the lentils and vegetable broth .
Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low .
Cover and cook for 12 - 15 minutes , until the liquid has mostly evaporated .
The lentils should be around the consistency of a thick stew .
Cut the tops off the bell peppers , and stuff them with the lentil mixture .
Put the tops on the peppers , and put them in a baking dish .
( I actually like to put them in muffin tins if they fit . )
Cook for 25 minutes at 350 F .
Serve immediately .
The SETI Institute uses a set of antennas called the Allen Telescope Array to listen for alien radio signals ( Image : SETI Institute )
You are officially invited to join the search for extraterrestrial life .
And no , that does n’t mean you should head to Kansas and lie in a cornfield awaiting the mothership to scoop you up .
All you have to do is log on to SETIQuest.org , which went live on Wednesday .
The site ’s launch was announced at the TED 2010 conference currently underway in Long Beach , California .
SETIQuest is the product of astronomer Jill Tarter ‘s TED Prize wish .
After being awarded the TED Prize last year , Tarter was given the opportunity to make a single wish before an auditorium full of the top names in technology and design .
Tarter wished that they would “ empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company ” .
With SETIQuest , Tarter and TED are making that happen .
The website will make vast amounts of SETI data available to the public for the first time .
It will also publish the SETI Institute ’s signal - detection algorithm as open source code , inviting brilliant coders and amateur techies to make it even better .

“ With available cloud storage and processing resources , we can provide digital signal processing experts and students with a lot of raw data … and invite them to develop new algorithms that can find other types of signals that we are now missing , ” the website explains .
Even if you ’re not a coder , you can still take the opportunity to search for ET using nothing more than the naked eye .
“ Citizen scientists ” can visually search the data for anything that looks suspiciously like something other than white noise .
Should you spot something anomalous , alert the global community .
If enough citizen scientists agree that something looks fishy , their collective concern will direct SETI ’s telescopes to zoom in on the questionable patch of sky .
Who knows – you just might play a part in a discovery that changes history .

You want change ?
Ubuntu 10.04 , the next long - term release of the free operating system , is full of change .
Window buttons are on the left , default apps are replaced , the theme is new , and many more upgrades are worth exploring .

Click any of the images in this post for a larger view .
One of the first things any user will notice in the pic above , whether new to Ubuntu or a veteran Linux user , is the button layout .
Ubuntu 10.04 , also known as " Lucid Lynx , " has opted for a left - side , Mac - style lineup of maximize / restore , minimize , and close buttons , but switched around the order , so that the close / kill button is the right - most button on a left - hand button panel .
That is certainly new , and will take some getting used to .
An alpha - testing friend of mine said it took " a few hours " over one or two days to start using the buttons without thinking too much about it , but he still occasionally catches himself mousing toward the wrong side of a window .
Time will tell whether this was a smart long - term move for Ubuntu .

There 's also a new purple / dark gray theme that 's seen the usual " It 's elegant " / " It 's awful " debate around the net .
I have n't used the beta enough to render a real verdict , but it was definitely time to try something new .

As predicted , Ubuntu 10.04 will have a built - in music store that ties together with the free 2 GB of Ubuntu One cloud storage given to each user .
Ubuntu
One 's music store is built into the Rhythmbox music player , and once you try to access it , Ubuntu will install the proper MP3 codecs so you can , you know , play MP3s .
Alas , I did n't get very far with my own installation , but it does look like a nice alternative to buying songs manually through Amazon and processing them through Rhythmbox .

I 've called Simple Scan a big step forward for Ubuntu , as it takes something that previously involved four windows and hundreds of micro-controls and pared it down to what most people need : a " Scan " button , a rotate - and - crop tool , and a choice of just a few DPI resolution levels .
Simple Scan is a default application in Ubuntu 10.04 , along with the PiTiVi video editor , which I have n't had a chance to try out in much depth ( I 've found Open Shot to be remarkably usable of late ) .

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS [ Ubuntu ]
I had just moved into a house in the northern suburbs of Colorado Springs , and was getting to know one of my new roommates , a very attractive female in her mid 20’s .
This was promising .
At some point though , the conversation turned to politics .
She asked me , “ You ’re not another one of those liberals are you ? ”
There she was , a thin 5 ’ 6 or so brunette in tight jeans and an expensive blouse : beautiful , well - spoken , well dressed , and educated .
And conservative as hell .
This kind of girl is ubiquitous in Colorado Springs .
Not exactly what you think of when you see the , without a better way to put it , interesting looking types who attend the Tea Party rallys .
In fact , my previous experiences were the exact opposite : the liberal girls more likely to be attractive , and the hardcore conservatives , um , not so much .
I quickly found out that my old way of thinking would not work here .
This evil flip of my traditional paradigm is God ’s way of fucking with me , telling my non-believing ass , “ You ’re in the wrong place , pal .
You do n’t belong here .
This is my country . ”
Every thing is different in the country ’s most ultra-conservative city .
Colorado Springs is a strange place .
It ’s got one of the country ’s most beautiful backdrops , with the fourteen - thousand - foot Pikes Peak and its surrounding mountains on the western border .
I do n’t know how many times I ’ve almost caused a 50 - car pileup driving down I - 25 because I was too busy gawking at those damned mountains .
And yet , Colorado Springs also feels like the epitome of the United States , and this is not a compliment .
Suburban sprawl stretches as far as you can see to the north and east .
I spent the first five months of my stay in the northern suburb of Briargate .
This was my first experience ever living in the ‘ burbs , and it was as bad as I ’d feared .
Endless fast food restaurants , for one thing .
( Eric Schlosser ’s great book , Fast Food Nation , focuses on Colorado Springs as a new model of the fast food industry .
When you are here , it quickly becomes apparent why ) .
Never -ending strip malls with parking lots full of Chevy Suburbans and all the other stereotypical shit .
The residents are friendly on the surface , but you know their tone would change if they found out you were a left - wing atheist or something worse …
You may read this and say , “ This is just another tired complaint about the suburbs , ” or “ There are places like this in every American city , what ’s the difference here ? ”
Let me tell you the difference .
This place is worse , and I can prove it .
For one thing , Colorado Springs is nicknamed “ The Evangelical Vatican ” and for good reason : it ’s the home base of James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family and numerous other raging evangelical organization .
Richard Dawkins would be lynched if he came anywhere near here .
New Life Church , which used to be Ted Haggard ’s ( of meth - snorting closet - case homophobe fame ) lair , can be found on the outer rim of town .
The National Journal recently named Colorado Springs Congressman Doug Lamborn the most conservative member of the U.S. House .
And just to make sure the Evangelicals are right in the thick of the Apocalypse and End of Days , Colorado Springs is home to the NORAD facility built into Cheyenne Mountain and to two major military bases , Fort Carson and Peterson Air Force Base .
The United States Air Force Academy ( which has a curious history of anti-Semitic incidents ) is also located here .
The armed forces are so prevalent here that my shaved head gets me mistaken for being military nearly everywhere I go .
This has never happened any where else .
I get treated with a level of respect I ’ve never experienced before .
I am offered military discounts ( If only I had some sort of military ID … ) .
My grumpy old , ex-military neighbor with his flawless military ‘ do and dress slacks hiked up to his belly , once asked me , “ How ’s that war going ? ” without specifying which one .
To him , it is all the same fight against those heathen Muslims .
“ It ’s going well , ” I played along , curious as to where this would go .
Not far .
“ Keep up the great work , ” he responded brusquely before returning to his quest to have the perfect yard when he dies .
Hmmm ….
I did n’t realize anything going on in “ that war ” could be considered great , but apparently I do n’t understand the eternal optimism of the war hawk .
Whenever we are failing to impose our dwindling will on some poor little Podunk country , everything is apparently swell .
The list of the city ’s right - wing credentials goes on and on .
Now you can add “ Obamaville ” to that venerable list .
This was the derisive name anonymously given to one of the city ’s many homeless tent camps , an obvious play on the Depression ’s “ Hooverville . ”
The giant poster bearing the name was put on a fence that borders the camp , visible from the interstate .
The camps began appearing at the end of April and early May of last year , peaking in tent - city numbers this January .
There are approximately 500 chronic homeless in Colorado Springs , with about 300 staying in the ten or so camps that currently exist .
On February 9 , the Colorado Springs City Council voted 8 - 1 to ban all “ camping ” on city public property–as if the homeless were just a bunch of spoiled free - loading hippies , rather than unfortunate victims and failures .
The single dissenting vote came from a City Council member who had once been homeless in Colorado Springs himself .
The ordinance was then approved by the city attorney and has since passed another City Council vote , 8 - 1 .
Any day now , the police will enter the camps giving notice and warning for the homeless to move out .
This is Christianity - in- action , according to the warped , mean version peddled by Dobson , Haggard and the rest .
The city is ready to kick the homeless out of their camps but has absolutely no interest in spending any budget money to help these people survive and get on their feet once they ’ve been kicked out of their tents , leaving that job to severely under - funded and under - staffed nonprofit groups .
While the camps are far from ideal ( three particularly crime - ridden camps are being called “ meth ” camps , one a “ heroin ” camp ; others have reportedly been plagued by sexual and physical abuse , with rumors of girls as young as 12 being pimped out in return for a place to stay ) there are few other options available for the homeless .
As awful as living in the tent cities is , what comes next is the abyss .
Not surprisingly , Colorado Springs is Tea Party country .
A local measure on last November ’s ballot to raise property taxes went down in defeat , with 62,923 voters ( 63 % ) saying “ you can have my precious dollars when you pry them from my cold dead hands . ”
The good Christian folks here have a simple philosophy : they love their tax breaks big , and their government small .
Now that the city can’t even fund basic services , we ’ll see how locals deal with the consequences .
The recent budget cuts became somewhat of a national story , and for good reason .
Colorado Springs is going to become a fitting example , and perhaps preview for others , of what massive cutbacks look like : greatly reduced street lighting , more unfilled potholes than you can imagine , brown public lawns resulting from water cutbacks when the weather warms up , and probably some foot - high brown public lawns ( the city is asking citizens to help mow the property ) .
Not exactly Third World , post - apocalyptic hell , but not what you would expect from perhaps the “ moral ” and militaristic hub of a global superpower either .
So while the city government tries to get rid of the tent camps that are supposedly muddying the city ’s image , it lets its own parks and public terrains decay .
Recreation centers and museums will shut down unless private funding can be found .
Unfilled jobs in the fire department and law enforcement agencies could have an even more severe impact .
Surprisingly , or perhaps not , depending on how jaded you are , the average person here seems unaware or apathetic about the looming disasters .
The conservative voters seem obliviously content , for the time being at least –everything ’s playing out exactly as they ’d wished all along .
As for the other side , even the Springs has a small liberal population that , like everywhere else , is feckless .
These types do n’t live in the suburbs .
The lefties can be found in the midtown area , the Westside ( location of my current digs ) , and the nearby hippie settlement further to the west , Manitou Springs .
They are more irritating than anything else , and certainly nothing for the right to fret over .
The most typical liberal here seems to be some strange breed of yuppie and hippie .
They wear outdoor / backpacker apparel , love to discuss their wilderness exploits , and go to coffee shops to listen to folk groups and “ authentic ” roots music .
If you ’re ever looking to have a deep conversation about rock climbing or “ Flight of the Conchords , ” look no further .
If you want to find someone with whom to commiserate on the sorry state of this city and country , good luck .
I realize that it ’s too much to ask for any sort of activism or public anger these days–unless you ’re old , white , rightwing and enjoying your Medicare .
But I do n’t even see any liberal anger in private .
It seems for many liberals out here that if it ’s not about the environment , while certainly a noble cause , it is of little concern to them .
In the end , it ’s fitting that this community was the home of “ Obamaville . ”
While the streets grow dark around the average citizen ’s home and basic services slip , the outlook for those without a home is even bleaker .
If the city refuses to pay for what most every other American community has , what are the chances it will want to do anything to help the homeless ?
You know , besides kick them out and tell them to move on ?
Is Colorado Springs becoming a model of the new American City ?
We ’ll find out soon enough .
For the time being , keep an eye on the Springs , because this could get messy .

HONOLULU -- The Pro Bowl will be played before the Super Bowl when it returns to Honolulu next year .
The Hawaii Tourism Authority and the NFL announced Tuesday that the game will be at Aloha Stadium on Jan. 30 , the Sunday before the Super Bowl in Arlington , Texas .
The Pro Bowl had historically been played in Honolulu the week after the Super Bowl , but was changed when the all - star game moved to Miami this year .
Frank Supovitz , the NFL 's senior vice president of events , said playing the Pro Bowl before the big game generated more excitement and interest and was a good kick off to Super Bowl week .
Ratings were up for the AFC - NFC matchup that was televised on ESPN .
It was watched by an average of 12.3 million viewers , the most since 2000 .
That 's up 40 percent from the 2009 Pro Bowl on NBC , which drew 8.8 million viewers when the event was held after the Super Bowl .
This year 's game was in a later time slot , when more people watch TV , and competed against the Grammys on CBS , which attracted 25.8 million viewers , the most since 2004 .
However , one drawback of playing the Pro Bowl first is not having any Super Bowl players .
About 40 percent of those originally selected did n't play in Miami .
That included seven Indianapolis Colts and seven New Orleans Saints because they were preparing for the title game .
Besides ratings , the Miami experiment also produced more ticket sales because of the larger venue and media coverage .
But several players have said they preferred playing in the islands .
And cash - strapped Hawaii , which heavily depends on tourism as its economic engine , is eager to say " aloha " again .
Mike McCartney , president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority , said the Pro Bowl has been a part of Hawaii for more than 30 years and the state welcomes the game back .
" We know how much the Pro Bowl means to our residents , the players and to the thousands of fans from the mainland who enjoy visiting our state for the game , " he said in a statement .
" The Pro Bowl is a great investment for our state with both economic and community benefits . "
Hawaii is paying $ 4 million per game to host the Pro Bowl in 2011 and ' 12 .
The site for 2013 and beyond has n't been determined .
The tourism agency estimated the 2009 game at Aloha Stadium accounted for $ 28.6 million in visitor spending , generated $ 2.9 million in state taxes and attracted 18,000 visitors .

What happens when you mix together a batch of hillbilly , and cheeseburgers ?
Welp , take a look ... This hilarious video of a man arguing over a cheeseburger turns into something like a wrestling match .
Sir Thomas angered MPs by imposing retrospective limits on some claims MPs should repay £ 1.12 m of their second home expenses , an audit of claims dating back to 2004 has said .
Sir Thomas Legg recommended that 389 MPs , more than half the current and past MPs reviewed , should repay £ 1.3 m .
Some complained about the way he carried out the audit and £ 180,000 was cut off the total after appeals .
Sir Thomas said the expenses system was " deeply flawed " , the rules " vague " and it had been up to MPs to " self certify " the propriety of their claims .
MPs had to sign a declaration with each claim saying " that I incurred these costs wholly , exclusively and necessarily to enable me to stay overnight away from my only or main home for the purpose of performing my duties as a Member of Parliament " .
LEGG AUDIT 752 MPs and ex-MPs investigated Legg asked 389 to repay money - reduced to 372 after appeals 363 not required to repay money 75 appealed against rulings 31 appeals dismissed 17 repayments reduced to zero 42 appeals wholly or partly successful
MP - by - MP : Repayments
Read the report in full
In his report Sir Thomas pointed out there had been a " culture of deference " to MPs by expenses officials and " no audit of any kind " of second homes expenses during the period he covered .
" Neither internal nor external auditors could ' go behind the member 's signature ' , " he said .
The report said £ 800,000 had been repaid already - some unconnected to Sir Thomas 's demands - since April 2009 , the month before the scandal broke .
Sir Thomas said 389 people should repay money but this was reduced to 372 after an appeals process .
The highest amount recommended for repayment , following the appeals process , is £ 42,458 for Labour junior minister Barbara Follett .
It relates to claims for mobile security patrols at her second home - which Sir Thomas said went beyond what was allowed under the rules , claims for six telephone lines which he ruled was " excessive " and an insurance premium for fine art .
Ms Follett has already repaid £ 32,976 and told the BBC : " This has been a very sad affair , I 'm very sorry about it , I did try to act as honestly as possible but where I failed , I am sorry . "
Other large repayment requests were about £ 60,000 in total from husband and wife Conservative MPs Andrew MacKay and Julie Kirkbride and £ 24,878 from shadow defence secretary Liam Fox - all of whom have repaid the money although Liam Fox says his appeal is still pending .
Some MPs have criticised Sir Thomas 's audit - which itself cost £ 1.16 m - saying mistakes were made and some said their reputations were unjustly damaged .
The audit covered all MPs apart from inner London ones who were not eligible to claim the second homes allowance .
WHAT MPs MUST REPAY £ 4,000 for hotel stays £ 711,000 for mortgage / rent £ 12,000 for food 30 £ 10,000 for utilities £ 35,000 for 59 Council Tax / Rates £ 23,000 for phone & telecoms £ 105,000 for cleaning £ 81,000 on service / maintenance £ 73,000 repairs / insurance / security : £ 252,000 - 182 other payments : Total : £ 1,305,000
Analysis :
No closure yet Flat expenses MP ordered to repay MP expenses charges decision due
How the newspapers react Seventy five MPs and former MPs appealed against Sir Thomas 's recommendations - 31 were dismissed , 27 had the repayment reduced and 17 had the demands overturned entirely .
Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin had a request for £ 63,250 reduced by £ 27,000 while the ex-Conservative minister Peter Lilley had his demand for £ 41,057 overturned entirely .
The judge who ruled on appeals , Sir Paul Kennedy , said each case had to be looked at " on its own merits " .
He also said he was " particularly troubled " that MPs who had not broken any rules at the time had been accused of making " tainted " claims or having " breached the requirement of propriety " .
Many MPs complained that Sir Thomas had retrospectively applied limits to claims for gardening and cleaning that were not in place at the time .
Tory MP
Ann Widdecombe said there had been " no faith " in the report and told the BBC : " It was illogical because Legg went back and said well we 're going to have retrospective limits for gardening and cleaning but not for food and mortgages . "
Deadline to repay But Sir Thomas said the rules stated that MPs should only be reimbursed " for specific and proportionate expenditure ... needed for the performance of Parliamentary duties " .
Just because MPs and officials " acted in apparent ignorance " of those standards - it did not mean the payments had been valid .
He also criticised a " widespread lack of proper evidence on the record from MPs to support substantial payments " and said the second homes expenses were " deeply flawed " .
" In particular , the rules were vague , and MPs were themselves self - certifying as to the propriety of their use of the allowance , " he said .
ANALYSIS Ben Wright , BBC political correspondent
Throughout the whole expenses saga there have been plenty of MPs who have felt aggrieved .
They say there was a system in place which they were encouraged to use , yet they are now being punished for doing so .
That feeling of injustice still has n't gone away - in fact for those who have lost appeals it may be greater now than ever .
But despite this I think we 're unlikely to see many - or indeed , any - MPs complaining publicly today .
Sir Thomas is clearly incredibly unimpressed with them , to put it mildly , and I think most will now decide it best to swallow their objections and try to draw a line under the entire sorry mess .
Q&A : Expenses row explained Key points : Expenses report " Taken with the prevailing lack of transparency and the ' culture of deference ' , this meant that the [ Commons ] fees office 's decisions lacked legitimacy ; and many of them were in fact mistaken . "
Sitting MPs have until 22 February to repay the amounts requested or make " firm arrangements " to do so , otherwise Commons leader Harriet Harman told MPs a " recovery process from pay or allowances " would begin .
It is thought that 76 people have not yet repaid the money - 60 of whom are current MPs .
Some MPs have gone further than Sir Thomas required and repaid sums voluntarily when details of claims broke last year .
The Labour MP Phil Hope repaid more than £ 42,000 on his own initiative last May - because he said his reputation with his constituents had been dealt a " massive blow " - Sir Thomas only recommended that he repay £ 4,365 .
' Failed to clean up system ' Hazel Blears - the former cabinet minister who famously went on TV with a cheque for £ 13,332 after being criticised for not paying capital gains tax on the sale of two flats , which was not against the rules , was only told to repay £ 225 for a shelving unit .
The prime minister 's spokesman said Gordon Brown was fully supportive of Sir Thomas Legg 's review and that he encouraged MPs to pay back money owed as quickly as possible and it was an important step in overhauling a discredited system .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Is the row over MPs ' expenses now over ?
Not by a long chalk Richard Hill , Birmingham Conservative leader David Cameron told the BBC it was " absolutely essential " that MPs pay back the money .
" Those MPs who refuse to pay it back , they should have it taken off their salaries or their redundancy payments - that 's got to happen . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told the BBC : " I hope it 'll be the final chapter in this rotten Parliament so we can look forward to a new Parliament with new rules . "
Meanwhile the Crown Prosecution Service says it will announce on Friday whether it will bring charges against MPs and peers over expenses .

PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti 
Along the capital ’s main commercial strip Saturday afternoon , dozens of armed men  some wielding machetes , others with sharpened pieces of wood  dodged from storefront to storefront , battering down doors and hauling away whatever they could carry : shoes , luggage , rolls of carpet .
Jean - Mario Mondésur , 41 , a bookkeeper , wandered by the street , Boulevard Jean - Jacques Dessalines , to join the crowd of onlookers .
Minutes later , he had seen enough .
“ There are bad men here , we must run ! ” he shouted .
While most of this city of 3 million people focused on clearing the streets of debris and pulling bodies out of the rubble left by Tuesday ’s earthquake , there were pockets of violence and anarchy , reports of looting and ransacking , and at least one lynching of an accused looter as police officers stood aside .

Both impulses  the riotous theft and the vigilante response  were borne of desperation , the lack of food and water as well as the absence of law and order .
Given the conditions , it was all the more remarkable that a spirit of cooperation and fortitude prevailed nearly everywhere else , as people joined together to carry corpses , erect shelters and share what food they could find .
With the number of fixes still going into the 4.4 branch after RC2 last week , the release managers have decided to pop another release candidate in between .
Last night , Dirk tagged KDE Software Compilation 4.4 RC3 , and we 're releasing it today already .
Overall the release is shaping up nicely , with many bugs still being squashed even in this late phase .
Thanks everybody for participating in making KDE SC 4.4 a solid release .
Meanwhile , RC3 is trickling through to our mirrors .
Packagers did n't have time to build packages yet , as we 're basically attempting to get the release candidates out as quickly as possible to shorten bug - hunting cycles .
Please give this RC another whirl and report bugs to us using bugs.kde.org .
Another day , another spurious paper from IPCC AR4 , as reported by James Delingpole in the UK Telegraph :
AGW theory is toast .
So ’s Dr Rajendra Pachauri .
So ’s the Stern Review .
So ’s the credibility of the IPCC .
But if you think I ’m cheered by this you ’re very much mistaken .
I ’m trying to write a Climategate book but the way things are going by the time I ’m finished there wo n’t be anything left to say : the battle will already have been won and the only people left who still believe in Man Made Global Warming will be the eco-loon equivalents of those wartime Japanese soldiers left abandoned and forgotten on remote Pacific atolls .
Here ’s the latest development , courtesy of Dr Richard North – and it ’s a cracker .
It seems that , not content with having lied to us about shrinking glaciers , increasing hurricanes , and rising sea levels , the IPCC ’s latest assessment report also told us a complete load of porkies [ Cockney rhyming slang , “ pork pie ” = lie – Ed ] about the danger posed by climate change to the Amazon rainforest .
This is to be found in Chapter 13 of the Working Group II report , the same part of the IPCC fourth assessment report in which the “ Glaciergate ” claims are made .
There , is the startling claim that :
At first sight , the reference looks kosher enough but , following it through , one sees :
This , then appears to be another WWF report , carried out in conjunction with the IUCN – The International Union for Conservation of Nature .
The link given is no longer active , but the report is on the IUCN website here .
Furthermore , the IUCN along with WWF is another advocacy group and the report is not peer - reviewed .
According to IPCC rules , it should not have been used as a primary source .

Drug dealing streets of Scampia avoided as Google films districts of Naples for Street View
NAPLES – Today , you can see on your computer screen , so realistically that you might almost be there , the streets of the Bronx , the bainlieues of Paris , Amsterdam ’s red light district or even Tepito , the stronghold of Mexico City ’s drug trade .
But you ca n’t see the Scampia district of Naples , Italy .
Like Medellin , home of the Colombian narcos , the casbah of Algiers and the favelas of Rio de Janeiro , the Scampia district of Naples with its ugly high - rise housing , round - the - clock drug dealing and the last of the turf wars , between the Di Lauro gang and the “ Secessionists ” , is off - limits for Google Street View , the service that has put the rest of the planet just a mouse click away .
No one knows precisely why .
No explanations are forthcoming from Google Italia .
A spokesperson admits that “ sometimes our cars do n’t go into areas where the lanes are particularly narrow ” but that is hardly the case with Scampia , whose streets are some of Naples ’ widest .
No other reasons are offered .
“ The service is run by our international department .
We ’ll have to ask them , which will take a few days ” .
We ’ll find out all in good time , then , even though internet ’s virtual reality has accustomed us to near - instant responses .
In the meantime , Google Maps is online .
Scampia is a blacked - out island in the middle of an area entirely covered by Street View .
The satellite images are in place .
You can pick out the sail - like “ Vele ” high - rise blocks , ill - famed Via Baku , where so many murders have taken place , and the blue - painted " Smurfs ’ houses " , where there are more dealers than residents .
But the street - level pictures stop at Via Fratelli Cervi on one side and Via Labriola on the other , areas where the police are constantly making arrests but which are still on the outer edges of the urban decay .
Without any official explanation , it is not possible to say why .
We can conjecture that the local gangs did n’t want a car going round filming everything and then posting it on the net .
The criminals might have stopped the car , had a quiet word with the driver and camera operator and persuaded them to go somewhere else .
But a quick check with the local police station rules this out .
No Google operative has reported threats , nor has anyone requested a police escort , as usually happens with TV crews from Italy or abroad .
The other possibility that comes to mind is that Google ’s crew might have opted to steer clear of the area , even without threats , because they were rightly concerned about Scampia ’s appalling reputation .
But that argument holds only up to a point because Street View is available in districts like Palermo ’s Zen and Brancaccio .
It may not be available for Bari ’s old town but the streets there really are narrow .
It all comes back to Scampia .
And , at least for now , it is a missed opportunity to show the district on the web .
Scampia may be teeming with gangsters but it is also full of ordinary , decent people , parishes and schools , where residents go to work every day , just as they do in other parts of Naples .

Bangkok , March 14 , 2010
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
March 15 , 2010 -- Hundreds of thousands of Thai Red Shirt pro-democracy demonstrators took to the streets of Bangkok and other cities over the weekend of March 13 - 14 .
This was a show of force to prove the strength of the movement and to dispel any lies by the royalist government and the media that the Red Shirts are not representative of the majority .
The stated aims of the movement are to force the military - installed government of Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and hold fresh elections .
However , it is difficult to see how the Red Shirt leadership is going to turn this massive show of popular anger into a force that can confront and overcome the army , which staged a coup back in 2006 .
This is because the Red Shirt leaders are not yet prepared to launch an all out ideological attack on the military and the monarchy .
Calling fresh elections will not solve this problem .
However , the massive turn out of Red Shirts from Bangkok and the provinces is an important step forward .
The vast majority of Red Shirts are poor people , both urban and rural , and the Red Shirt leaders are at last talking openly about a “ class struggle ” between the people and the elites .
They need to go further and agitate among the urban working class and the lower ranks of the army in order to build up the momentum for revolutionary change .
Any compromise will retain the power of the royalist elites who have constantly frustrated democracy .
The political crisis and unrest which we have seen in Thailand since the September 19 , 2006 , military coup against the elected government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra represents a serious class war between the rich conservatives and the urban and rural poor .
It is not a pure class war and those taking part have different aims and different concepts of democracy .
Due to a vacuum on the left since the collapse of the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) , millionaire and populist politician Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai party managed to inspire millions of ordinary Thais .
Despite the fact that many commentators try to explain the present conflict as only an elite dispute between Thaksin and the conservatives , and that it is a dispute between “ the old feudal order ” fighting back against “ the modern capitalist class ” , this is not what the conflict is really about .
The missing element in most analyses is the actions of millions of ordinary people .
Thaksin built an alliance with workers and peasants through his pro-poor policies such as the first ever universal healthcare scheme and local village funds to develop rural areas .
The Red Shirts like Thaksin , but they are not just being used by him or fighting only for his return .
They want real democracy and social justice .
Both Thaksin and his conservative opponents are royalists in modern terms , in that both sides seek to use the institution of the monarchy in order to help support capitalist class rule .
Feudalism was abolished in Thailand in the 1870s .
What gradually turned the conservatives against Thaksin was their fear that they would lose their privileges in the face of Thaksin ’s widespread modernisation program , which had mass popular support .
In the past the elites had used a combination of military power , royalist ideology and money politics in order to ignore the wishes of the population .
Neither Thaksin nor the conservative royalists intended their dispute to turn into a class war .
But the mass pro-democracy movement is starting to question the entire elite structure , including the monarchy .
This is because of the arrogant attitude of the conservative royalists and the prolonged nature of the crisis , plus the self - organisation and self - funding of millions of Red Shirts at grassroots level .
This class war is bringing about changes in political attitudes and putting all sections of society to the test .
But the real question facing the movement is how to seize state power .
[ Giles Ji Ungpakorn is a Thai socialist currently in exile in Britain .
His latest book Thailand ’s Crisis and the Fight for Democracy ” will be published in April 2010 . ]
Nebakaneza is nuts !
I think he is certifiably insane , but he seems to find his therapy by slamming Dubstep through the speakers .
Do n't be surprised if he interacts with the crowd and throws random things at you in the name of fun and mayhem .
He has an eerie yet sexy style that covers many aspects of Dubstep from the face melting wobbles ,
to the strip your clothes off sultry sounds .
He is a DJ that likes to use his mixer and turntables as instruments , so you will see him playing with the music like a DJ should .
He looks scary , but is a friendly soul .
Do n't be afraid to run up to him during a set and show him some love .
He may just give you a bear hug and show you love back .
This masked DJ has created quite the splash in the Bay Area dubstep scene .
Since crawling out of the shadows in January of 2010 and joining the Irie Cartel crew ,
he has put out countless mixes , been in various publications , and helped start Ritual ,
one of the largest reoccurring dubstep events on the West Coast .
He is a dubstep DJ with a wide range of styles from the ragga joints , to the sexy sub bass sounds ,
to the nasty filth , or the UK uptempo style .
You may have seen him at the Emissions campout , the Dub Fillmore festival ,
the Elements campout , Camp Questionmark 's stage at Burning Man , or opening for Borgore and Caspa .
This phantom is showing no signs of slowing down and is forever expanding his style , and his passion for bass is infectious .
The name comes from King Nebuchadnezzar II who was an evil ruler of ancient Babylon , and who built the Hanging Gardens .
Eventually he was exiled and spent 7 years in the wilderness wandering the land like a beast .
There are many rumors about the mask , no one knows the truth .
In a recent interview , Nebakaneza says , " I eat paint .
I like to climb up into trees and jump down on little kids in the park and make them pee themselves .
I am a convicted felon in 49 states and like to eat paint .
I frequently go to Bingo tournaments and pretend I speak Italian , to Koreans .
I have 17 girlfriends that are between the ages of 62 and 78 , and I enjoy dining on a healthy plate of paint .
On the 3rd Wednesday of every other month , in even numbered years , I take a bath in canned tuna fish mixed with live tuna fish ,
then lay in the street while dozens of feral cats lick my body clean .
I frequently eat paint .
Last night I met a sailor that I paid 73 cents to , and he beat me senseless while I did cart wheels on a 2007 Ford Fiesta .
I am so much of a hippy vegan that I do not actually even eat food anymore ,
I just meditate until I am no longer hungry ,
and I have done this for 19 years ,
but for some reason I still have regular bowel movements that come out in vivid technicolor because it is only paint . "

Australian of the Year Pat McGorry has backed calls for a Senate inquiry into Scientology , saying its views on mental health are putting lives at risk .
" They are the deniers of the realities of mental illness , which I find incredibly irresponsible and dangerous , " he told ABC Radio this morning .
The renowned mental health expert has joined psychiatry boss Louise Newman and the Brain and Mind Institute 's Ian Hickie in urging senators to vote for an inquiry .
The Senate is expected to vote on the issue , brought forward by independent senator Nick Xenophon , by the end of next week .
Professor McGorry met Senator Xenophon yesterday to lend his voice to the cause .
The Microsoft browser ballot released this month to Windows users in the EU is already doing Microsoft 's rivals a favor .
Two of the major competitors to Internet Explorer have seen an increase in downloads , while the other two are not willing to share data .
We contacted the makers of Firefox , Chrome , Safari , and Opera ; here 's what they had to say .
Opera , the Norwegian browser maker that first filed a complaint with the European Union in December 2007 , accusing Microsoft of violating EU antitrust law by bundling IE with Windows , is pleased with the progress its browser is making .
" Since the browser choice screen rollout , Opera downloads have more than tripled in major European countries , such as Belgium , France , Spain , Poland , and the UK , " an Opera spokesperson told Ars .
The company said it currently did not have more detailed numbers but plans on sharing more as they become available .
Mozilla , which has a particularly solid foothold in Europe , was slightly more specific in the progress it was seeing with its browser downloads .
" Early data suggests 50,000 to 100,000 new users chose Firefox as a direct result of seeing the Ballot Choice screen , " a Mozilla spokesperson told Ars .
" We expect these numbers will increase as the Ballot Choice rolls out in additional countries and will share updated metrics as they become available . "
Apple did not respond at all , and while Google was happy to respond , the company would n't get specific : " We generally do n't share download stats on that granular of a level , " a Google spokesperson told Ars .
The company did not respond to a follow - up question if Chrome saw an increase in number of downloads period .
While Apple and Google have n't said much , we think it 's likely that both have also seen a bump in the number of downloads of their browsers .
Hundreds of thousands of users who may not have known of a world outside of Internet Explorer are being confronted with the alternatives .
The browser ballot will be presented on Windows computers across the EU for at least the next five years .
Microsoft 's rivals are , however , already pushing to have it appear outside of Europe as well .
It ’s because of the kindness of strangers that a single mother says she and her two children have been able to find a place to live after a fire destroyed their Richmond Hill home two months ago .
There are some questions that are persistently treated as though they were ethical , spiritual or philosophical when actually , they 're just plain factual .
" Does suffering improve us ? " is one of them .
There are some theoretical issues around what " improvement " and " suffering " mean , but the answer comes mostly not from intellectual reflection but empirical observation .
And that answer seems to be a pretty unequivocal no .
Take psychic suffering first of all .
Severe depression is one of the most acute forms of pain known to humanity .
Those who have suffered from both depression and serious physical illness are almost unanimous in agreeing that the depression is worse .
Does this make them better people ?
Certainly not at the time .
I 've seen depression close up with several people , and one of them hit the nail on the head when they said that depression makes you really selfish .
You can see that it 's taking its toll on people close to you , but you are just too self - absorbed to change how you treat them .
Are they better having come through the depression ?
I see no evidence for this , I 'm afraid .
It is often said that having gone through any kind of suffering tends to makes you appreciate life more and live more in the present .
I 'm not sure how universal or long - lasting these effects really are .
I suspect that , as usual , The Simpsons gets it right .
In one episode , Homer thinks he has 24 hours to live , but actually survives into the 25th .
Jubilant , he declares , " From this day forward , I vow to live life to its fullest ! "
Over the credits , we see him back in front of the TV , his belly the only thing filled to its fullest .
But even if most people do appreciate life more , let 's not confuse that with being a better person .
Indeed , I can easily imagine someone coming through a health scare and saying , " I used to worry constantly about the world 's poor and the the future of the planet .
But you know what ?
Life 's too short .
Just savour each day .
After all , the poor will always be with us , as the Good Lord said . "
It is good to appreciate every moment , but doing so does n't make you good .
Think of other common forms of suffering and most of the time , you will see no evidence that it improves people at the time of suffering or afterwards and quite a lot that it makes them worse .
Soldiers return from the horrors of the front line broken men and women .
Someone goes into what becomes a terrible , traumatic relationship open to love and leaves it suspicious , more misanthropic and full of self - loathing .
In areas of socio- economic suffering there is more crime and more violence .
You 'll need to point to a lot of examples where the suffering has a good effect to balance out the innumerable cases where it clearly does n't .
Why then do so many persist with the idea that suffering is good for us ?
The religious need to , of course .
If suffering is not , on balance , a good thing , then there can be no benevolent creator in charge of this show .
But even without a theological motivation , the thought of so much suffering without redemption can be almost intolerable .
Believing it has a point can be the only way to make life bearable .
If human weakness is one reason to persist with the myth , there is another , better one .
Whether or not suffering does tend to improve us , we can ask whether it can improve us .
And that depends on how we react to it .
We can take suffering to be an opportunity to learn and to grow .
But if we are honest , we should remember that this is making the best of a bad job , and that minimising suffering takes priority over optimising its outcome .
" That which does not kill me makes me stronger " is not a law of the universe .
What it can be , if we so choose , is a resolution .
' Catastrophic event ' behind halt of star birth in early galaxy found

Scientists have found evidence of a " catastrophic event " they believe was responsible for halting the birth of stars in a galaxy in the early Universe .
The researchers , led by Durham University 's Department of Physics , observed the massive galaxy as it would have appeared just three billion years after the Big Bang when the Universe was a quarter of its present age .
According to their findings the galaxy exploded in a series of blasts trillions of times more powerful than any caused by an atomic bomb .
The blasts happened every second for millions of years , the scientists said .
The explosions scattered the gas needed to form new stars by helping it escape the gravitational pull of the galaxy called SMM J1237+6203 , effectively regulating its growth , the scientists added .
They believe the huge surge of energy was caused by either the outflow of debris from the galaxy 's black hole or from powerful winds generated by dying stars called supernovae .
The research , funded by the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society , is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Observations were carried out using the Gemini Observatory 's Near - Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer ( NIFS ) .
The Durham - led team hopes the finding could increase understanding about the formation and development of galaxies .
Properties seen in massive galaxies near to our own Milky Way suggest that a major event rapidly turned off star formation in early galaxies and halted their expansion .
Theorists , including scientists at Durham University , have argued that this could be due to outflows of energy blowing galaxies apart and preventing further new stars from forming , but evidence of this has been lacking until now .
Lead author Dr Dave Alexander , of Durham University 's Department of Physics , said : " We are looking into the past and seeing a catastrophic event that essentially switched off star formation and halted the growth of a typical massive galaxy in the local Universe .
" Effectively the galaxy is regulating its growth by preventing new stars from being born .
Theorists had predicted that huge outflows of energy were behind this activity , but it 's only now that we have seen it in action .
" We believe that similar huge outflows are likely to have stopped the growth of other galaxies in the early Universe by blowing away the materials needed for star formation . "
The Durham - led team now plans to study other massive star - forming galaxies in the early Universe to see if they display similar characteristics .
Durham University is part of a team building the K - Band Multi-Object Spectrometer ( KMOS ) for the European Southern Observatory 's ( ESO ) Very Large Telescope .
KMOS will be used to further investigate the physical and environmental processes that shape the formation and evolution of galaxies .
We checked out the Tron : Legacy " secret screening " today in Manhattan , along with about 100 other die - hard fans .
Here 's what we discovered .
Advertisement
The event was part of a viral marketing scheme for the film , which comes out in December .
Fans had to sign up and create a profile on the site flynnlives.com and then request tickets at 4 pm Friday to get the latest on Tron : Legacy .
So all of us had put some effort into this .
A motley crowd of mostly die - hard Tron fans was conducted through a gauntlet of security and received " Flynn Lives " t- shirts and 3D glasses .
We waited in the IMAX movie theater for about ten minutes while excited discussions ranged all things Tron .
A hundred or so people were in attendance , with a median age of 30 but outlying teenagers and seniors .
At one point , a man announced , " Someone flew in from Toronto just for this ! " and a ski-hatted Canadian raised his hand proudly .
This prompted a shout - out of " Florida guy right here ! " which was followed up by a rather weak " there 's a guy here from the Alderaan system " that fell flat amongst the fans .
" Did he make it in 12 parsecs or less ? " someone finally obliged , but we were not here for Star Wars .

1982 's virtual reality hacker / video game cult classic movie Tron , starring grand high cult pooh - bah Jeff Bridges , retains enough of an enthusiastic following that a sequel 22 years later motivates its fans to travel to a snowy New York City for footage .
There had n't been many clues about what we 'd actually be shown .
At last , the lights darkened , the studio logo popped up in 3D , and this is what we saw :
Kevin Flynn's now grown - up son , Sam ( Eragon 's Garrett Hedlund ) misses his heroic hacker dad .
He 's talking to Tron 's old computer programming pal Alan Bradley ( Bruce Boxleitner ) , who tells Sam that his father was doing work of importance to " science - medicine - religion " and that he suspects Flynn could still somehow be around .
This prompts Sam to approach the dusty , abandoned Flynn 's Arcade , with its covered - up consoles , to find the Tron machine and the office behind the wall .

The quick cut -scenes complete with 3D effects that we were shown of Sam in the virtual world are very cool , if a bit jarring .
We see Sam and other players popping out of the screen in aggressive gladiatorial gaming .
We see an epic virtual city , an attractive , white - haired lady , and a man inexplicably playing a futuristic guitar .
Finally , we see a figure in the beloved Tron glow - suit , the screen darkens and a hint of the Bridges beard appears : " Dad , " Sam 's voice says .
" Sam , " says the dude .
" Long time , " Sam says .
" You have no idea , " says Kevin Flynn .
Does Flynn really live or am I living a lie in my new t- shirt ?

The screen flashes to Tron : Legacy , and then comes back to give us the roaring hint of a 3D virtual reality motorcycle romp .
Then the lights came up , and we were being ushered out of the theater .
The trailer could not have been more than a couple of minutes , a pre-movie standard .
The crowd went a bit indignant : " Show it again ! " several shouted .
People had come from Canada for this !

While people seemed enthusiastic , that was tempered by a feeling that they had n't seen enough and what was shown was n't new .
" The best fifteen seconds of my life , " a guy only half - sarcastically declared as we shuffled out , summing up the experience for most .
Others seemed less persuaded .
A group I talked to were n't die - hards and had been curious about the screening ; one of them had seen fifteen minutes at a Con was annoyed at the whole production .
His friend said that some of the 3D shots felt slightly off , and that the trailer made it seem like " you already know what happens . "
( It 's true that anyone who 's seen genre / action movies or any movies could probably put together Tron : Legacy 's plot arc , but we 're in it for the Bridges . )
He went on to wonder if the computer - generated vector look from the first film would really translate in 3D .
And the scene of the guy with the guitar moves : " What was up with that ? "

Their friend was more optimistic about the whole thing : " I love a movie with daddy issues , " he said dryly .
Downstairs , I talked to two fans , Tehnakki and Waterborn , who had come from Boston for the screening .
It seemed fitting with the theme of the day that they went by their online handles .
Tehnakki had on a great Flynn 's Arcade shirt and had enjoyed the trailer , but was somewhat disappointed .
None of the footage had been new to them , they said , and felt recycled and repackaged from past Con presentations .
Still , were they excited for the new movie ?
Incredibly so — they had stopped to take pictures by the poster in the lobby .
Everyone left talking about Trons old and new amidst the grumblings that we had n't seen more of the film , which was what the studio wanted from us in the first place .
Two decades in , Tron and its offspring 's virtual world remains a cyberdream .
Leap Year is a Time Travel Rom Com , possibly set in Lost universe
It ’s easy to write Leap Year off as another inbred descendent of The Quiet Man .
First appearances are of a film full of twinkly - eyed drunken charmers with secret pasts and promiscuous fists having twinkly eyed drunken fights over promiscuous pasts in secret fields .
However , this mere shillelagh shop window dressing hides a more sophisticated cloth cap of time travel and love and – begorrah , no it does n’t .
Amy ’s Anna ’s desperately trying to get to Dublin to propose to her cardiologist boyfriend ( to give him her heart , see ? ) on Leap Day , which is Monday 29th February in the film .
The last time 29th February was on a Monday was 1988 .
Is Anna intending to travel back in time as well as cross the Atlantic ?
It would certainly put the depictions of Ireland in context .
There ’s no doubt where the film is headed when Anna boards the plane .
She ’s seated beside a twinkly eyed priest , played by the baddie from Ros na Rún , who looks about as comfortable as Harrison Ford must feel when he sits down to shoot a Japanese whisky commercial .
( Further evidence of the time travel thesis : Quantum Leap , a show about time travel , has the word Leap in the title .
The main protagonist of that show is called Samuel Beckett .
Samuel Beckett is the name of a drunken , twinkly eyed Irish playwright .
Anna goes to Ireland .
Ergo , time travel .
Also ,
She ’s travelling back in time to 1988 .
CIE was rebranded in 1988 .
There is an Irish Rail train in the film .
Coincidence ?
I think not ) .
The plane hits bad weather before it reaches Dublin and has to make an emergency landing in “ Cardiff , Wales ” because Cork , Shannon and Belfast must have been choc-a - fucking - block with American chicks arriving looking for love .
The oxygen masks fall from the roof , demonstrating that the cabin crew are every bit as shit as the pilot : not a single passenger puts one on .
The airline is called Gaelic Air , and has obviously since ceased trading .
That or Aer Lingus were too tight to stump up for the product placement .
Stranded in Cardiff the intrepid / stupid Anna hires a boat to take her to Cork , a journey of 370 km or so .
Cardiff to Dublin by sea is around 400 km .
Obviously the Irish Sea and the entire eastern coast of Ireland was too chock - a- fucking - block with American chicks looking for love for the boat to dock .
However , the weather is so bad the ship ’s pilot ca n’t berth in Cork , so he decides on Dingle instead .
You know , on the weather - beaten , dangerous Atlantic coast .
Much safer .
And only 620 km from Cardiff by sea .
After dropping Anna off on a beach ( why would you bother using the pier in Dingle ? ) the boat heads off again , presumably back to Cardiff ( 1240 km round trip ) .
Do n’t worry about all that bad Cork weather though , he probably went up around Ulster to avoid it .
Dingle has obviously shrunk in the rain , all Anna can find is a little pub where the cast of Killinaskully are on holidays .
She meets Pádraic Breathnach Declan .
Declan has a brain disease that affects his speech , because that is not an Irish accent .
After Anna ’s American technology proves incompatible with backwards Irish electricity and a night in which she manages to trash her room with her arse , Declan agrees to taxi her to Dublin for some of her American wealth .
The wily bastard just drives her around the Dingle peninsula for the morning .
I ’ve worked this out by the complete lack of any driving on anything that looks like the N86 that would get you to Tralee in about 20 minutes from Dingle where you can get any amount of buses or trains to Dublin .
Then they meet some cows and Anna manages to destroy the parked car in a scene notable for its lack of hilarity .
There is much walking around and talk about suitcases .
Declan totally perves on her arse as he falls behind her .
Then Anna ’s suitcase is stolen by men in a van .
Vans play baddies in this film , appearing like Godfathers that belch forth henchmen at several junctures .
Declan ’s promicuous fists get an outing on this gang shortly thereafter , and they end up really sorry for trying on Anna ’s bras on their heads .
They make it on foot to a tiny train station in Tipperary .
Dingle to the Tipperary border on foot would take around 15 hours without stopping , so clearly Anna can add teleportation to her list of incredible powers .
I know that begs the question of why she does n’t just teleport to fucking Dublin , but shut up right ?
There just happens to be a massive CGI castle up a big CGI hill behind the tiny train station , so Anna and Declan decide to prick around up there instead of waiting for the only train .
There ’s some shite about Diarmuid and Grainne , and Anna gets wet in her knickers a bit .
And what do you know , the train comes early and she ’s so slippery in her knickers that she slips on the way down the hill and ends up all covered in clingy wet mud and stranded again .
But never fear , the station master takes them home to the best B &B in Ireland which he and his wife run .
Declan has skillfully avoided any towns or villages and is rewarded with a good view of naked Anna through the shower curtain .
We are thankfully spared the sight of him jerking off but we know it happens .
All that jerking off leaves Declan hungry and murderous , so he offers to cook the dinner .
He and Anna go to the shop no they do n’t they go to the garden and pick ALL the ingredients for dinner and Declan chokes the chicken .
No , he really chokes the chicken .
They have a snogging competition with Mr and Mrs B&B and a random Italian couple who are written into this to fill up another 5 minutes and before it turns into an orgy everyone goes to bed .
Then Anna and Declan ( who are pretending to be married because in this recession - free fantasy Mrs B&B is an uptight Catholic nut who turns away good business from unmarried couples and probably murders gays and buries them in the veg patch out the back ) spend the night trying to dry - hump each other without the other one noticing .
The next morning they set off and Declan again manages to avoid any human settlement until they ’re half murdered by hailstones , which , judging by Anna ’s surprise , they mus n’t have in Boston .
They take shelter by crashing a wedding and , this being Ireland , where we have to act like we ’re the most welcoming fucking people in the world when there ’s an American about , they get to stay for the reception and the afters .
This is all in a marquee by a lake next to a church in the middle of nowhere .
What a coincidence !
Hey , it must be time for Anna to gain a superpower .
This time , she can defy physics and make objects gain momentum when thrown from her foot .
She manages to concuss the bride when one of her shoes flies off during a dance .
It ’s a brilliant aim , she gets her right between the eyes .
Also , we ’re starting to believe Anna ’s heart ’s not really in this marriage thing any more as she has n’t bothered her hole to contact her boyfriend in 2 days to let him know she ’s still safely defying the laws of physics .
Anna gets pissed on vodka by the lake after they get kicked out of the wedding and passes out .
Then Declan obviously gets a crafty taxi because suddenly it ’s Monday morning and they ’ve slept the night on a bench IN A TOWN !
And they get a bus !
To Dublin !
After 2 days !
They should have frozen to death but let ’s not quibble at this stage !
Now , I thought I ’d be spared any further insult at this point .
I thought they could n’t do much harm in Dublin .
I thought they ’d just get lots of establishing shots of Dublin landmarks , and it really looked like that for a time .
They prick around Stephen ’s Green , which appears to think it ’s June , what with the leafy trees and flowers everywhere .
Then Declan , being a backwards Kerryman with no mobile phone , needs to make a phonecall .
In the middle of Dublin .
In one of these :
Now I ’m not going to tell you how this ends .
I would n’t want to spoil it for you .
But it ’s not the gay sex / threesome ending I was expecting .
Ah fuck it I am going to tell you : Anna gives into her Stockholm Syndrome , drops her whole life in Boston and returns to the pub in “ Dingle ” , which seems to be the only place left to get anything to eat in Ireland judging by how busy it now is .
Declan pricks about with Anna , she gets upset and teleports to Dun Aengus on Inis Mór , he teleports after her and asks her to marry him .
She says yes and R2D2 and C - 3PO turn up to watch them dangerously consummate their love right on the edge of the cliff .
If the writers of this film ( Simon Beaufoy , Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan ) had bothered to get out a map and set this in Ireland the script would have been serviceable enough to make a mild , harmless romantic comedy .
But the diddley - iddley fuckwittery of setting and the sheep ’s raisons that fall from the sawdust - filled characters ’ mouths maim it .
However it is the performance of Matthew Goode that nails the coffin shut , lowers it in the ground and makes sandwiches for the bereaved .
I ’m so offended by his performance I ’m petitioning my local TD to pass the Matthew Goode Bill that will make it illegal for him to ever set foot here again .
And if you ’re wondering why I went to see it , well , Emer wanted to see it .
I did it for love .

Editor ’s note :
This is the second essay in a series by Thomas F. Bertonneau , who teaches literature at SUNY Oswego .
The first essay in the series was “ Ca n’t Read , Can’t Watch , Can’t Comprehend . ”
Recently at SUNY Oswego , an online conversation burst forth among faculty members about the pandemic reluctance of college students to complete , or even simply to begin , the assigned readings in courses .
I refrained from participating because it struck me as an old story .
I have been writing about the declining literacy of the young since the 1990s , when I taught in Michigan .
I noticed , from my first public utterance on the topic , that it incited terrific hostility from the faculties — especially the writing or composition faculties .
They seemed willfully opposed to seeing what I plainly saw — or , if they did see it , they were determined to excuse it by various romantic hypotheses premised on the supposed naïve authenticity of the sub-literate .
I guess that the breakthrough in faculty perception represents a good development , better than nothing anyway ; but it is terrifically belated , perhaps too much so to help us out of the pervasive social crisis of our emerging “ post - literate ” condition .
In my first article in this series , I wrote about the failure of many of my SUNY Oswego undergraduates to understand the movies with which I supplement the readings in my literature courses .
I argued that students who are not readers and who struggle to interpret novels , plays , and poems also struggle to interpret movies .
Understanding the relation of cause to effect in film is difficult for people who are not habitual readers .
There are reasons why this should be the case .
These reasons have to do with the difference between the thinking of habitual readers and the thinking of those whose primary experience of language is with speech rather than the written word or whose thought processes are heavily influenced by images unaffiliated with language , either oral or written .
I argue that we are witnessing a decline of literacy , which will have widespread social effects .
This observation is not peculiar or original to me .
The subject of the decline of literacy has generated a considerable theoretical literature .
Among those who have written perceptively on the topic are the late American writer Neil Postman ( 1931 – 2005 ) and the French writer Jacques Ellul ( 1912 – 1994 ) .
I take particular interest in Postman ’s Amusing Ourselves to Death ( 1985 ) and Ellul ’s Humiliation of the Word ( 1981 ; English version 1985 ) .
Along with Walter Ong ’s Orality and Literacy ( 1981 ) , to which I will also devote a few comments , Amusing Ourselves and Humiliation helped me to understand what I was witnessing in my classrooms when I started out as a college - level English teacher .
Perhaps Ong provides the best introduction to Postman and Ellul .
Father Ong ( 1912 – 2003 ) , a Jesuit priest , devoted a major portion of his scholarly life to studying the characteristics that differentiate the thinking of literate people from that of pre-literate or non-literate or illiterate people .
Most literates casually regard illiterates as naïve , undeveloped versions of themselves , but Ong shows that the mental processes of illiterates — or , as he preferred to say , people whose mental style is that of an oral society — differ entirely from those of literates , even from the cognitive style of people only barely literate .
The mere ABCs can take one a long way .
Ong avoided making moral judgments , likely so as not to alienate people who react reflexively against any assertion of hierarchy .
Here is the gist of Ong ’s taxonomy of the oral and the literate :
Orality .
In oral societies , all knowledge is personal knowledge ; every utterance is subjective and egocentric .
Because speech is always connected with specific persons , the idea of objective knowledge apart from an ego remains unknown .
Because the ego - element dominates , dialogue in an oral context tends to be aggressive and emotive , “ agonistic , ” as Ong says , and testy .
In oral societies , thinking must be formulaic ; the formulas must be “ coded ” in simple , easily remembered verbal images — of the “ stitch in time saves nine ” variety .
Questioning the coded veracities is rare , because interrogation might destabilize them , and because they are a matter of social survival ; the ethos often forbids questioning .
An oral context knows no such thing as “ critical thinking . ”
Indeed , confronted with analytic statements or logical summaries , oral people suspect and reject them , as Ong showed by drawing on anthropological fieldwork .
Literacy .
The written word , as Ong remarks , “ separates the knower from the known ” and in so doing opens up the space of non-ego - centered objective knowledge .
Because writing overcomes the ephemeral quality of spoken language and frees the mind from the task of having to remember things through the medium of simple , “ coded ” images , it also opens up possibilities of reflection , which , with alphabetic literacy in particular , gives rise to the critical discourses , from physics through moral philosophy to history and law .
With the aide of a text , the literate subject can “ backtrack , ” examining the sequence and relatedness of propositions or the logic of a story .
Literacy in this way provides the basis of systematic knowledge in all the higher civilizations .
Of course , in introducing the phrase “ higher civilizations , ” I have made explicit the implication that Ong , for argumentative reasons , de-emphasizes : that the orality - literacy opposition entails a hierarchy .
Neil Postman recognized that hierarchy .
In book after book , Postman celebrated the high level of literacy that persisted in American society right through World War Two , but which entered into a steep and accelerating decline in the second half of the century .
The singular title , Amusing Ourselves to Death , with its reference to fatal insouciance , already tells much about its author ’s thesis in the mid-1980s , which becomes more prescient and unavoidable with every year .
It is that the mass media , the forms of “ entertainment culture , ” even though they are the invention of literates , sapped literacy from their inception , infantilizing the culture , obliterating custom and tradition , and depriving people of history and ideas .
Postman minces no words : “ A great metaphor shift has taken place in America , with the result that the content of much of our public discourse has become dangerous nonsense . ”
To what “ shift ” does Postman refer ?
He refers to the shift from a “ typographic culture , ” in which “ discourse [ is ] generally coherent , serious and rational ” — to a media culture , dominated by television , in which discourse “ has become shriveled and absurd . ”
Postman ’s “ typographic culture ” is the high literate culture that characterized American civic life in the nineteenth century and that corresponded to what Postman calls the “ typographic mind . ”
Postman adduces the Lincoln - Douglas debates to indicate the forms of attention of which fully literate people are capable .
He reminds us that these debates , seven in number , were all - day affairs ; that the debaters either read from prepared remarks or extemporized on the basis of extensive notes .
They took notes in order to reply to one another .
Although many other things were going on in the debating locales — a carnival - like atmosphere accompanied the main event — most people attended in order to listen to the candidates and evaluate the merits of their contending positions .
The audiences of 1858 could do this largely because their learning was book learning , which inculcates patience and promotes the ability to correlate parts and wholes whether in narrative or argument .
As the professorial conversation alluded to at the beginning of this essay indicates , contemporary college students reject books and disdain reading .
Postman notes that reading imposes radical requirements , some of which are bodily requirements .
Thus , to read , one must “ remain more or less immobile for a fairly long time . ”
Of course , “ you must also have learned to pay no attention to the shapes of the letters on the page , ” but rather “ you must see through them … so that you can go directly to the meanings of the words they form . ”
Finally , “ you are required to assume an attitude of detachment and objectivity . ”
I am not saying that today ’s representative college student absolutely cannot do these things ; I am saying that he wishes not to and that his disinclination stems from the fact that reading and writing are for him noticeably alien and difficult .
His learning is not book learning .
He resembles an oral person , as described by Ong.
Subordinate clauses , consequentiality , and logical analysis — these things arouse his suspicion and hostility .
What has made him this way ?
Postman indicts an array of technical non-print innovations : telegraph , photography , motion pictures , sound recording , radio , and television .
He writes , “ Together this ensemble of techniques called into being a new world — a peek - a - boo world , where now this event , now that pops into view for a moment , then vanishes again . ”
Not only is it the case , according to Postman , that the peek - a- boo world “ is a world without much coherence or sense , ” but it is averse to coherence and sense .
In a phrase , “ Thinking does not play well on television . ”
Thus the trend of acculturation in a media - intensive , image - based society will run in the direction opposite to the attitudes and behaviors demanded historically by higher education , whose foundations are entirely literate .
Postman cites Aldous Huxley and H. G. Wells in worrying that “ we are in a race between education and disaster . ”
In Technopoly ( 1992 ) , a follow - up to Amusing Ourselves to Death , Postman argues that averting disaster will require education at all levels to return to a literature - intensive curriculum .
He notes that the education establishment is not likely to follow his advice , nor has it .
A legal scholar , a philosopher , and a theologian , Jacques Ellul brought immense erudition to his analyses of modern culture .
He saw independently almost precisely what Postman saw .
Ellul ’s Humiliation of the Word addresses an epochal change in modern western society , in which the image triumphs over the word .
The results imply a catastrophe for all norms , expectations , and institutions predicated on linguistic competence .
Ellul links language sensitivity and literacy to the sense that people have of history and meaning , as rooted in a familiar past ; mere images , by contrast , exhibit a mute and static quality , requiring explanation , which only language can give .
In an observation that Postman would have endorsed , Ellul notes that “ there is no possible instantaneous approach to the written page . ”
To read , one must slacken his pace , eschew the merely practical , and enter the domain of the symbolic .
Ellul extols language , including written language , for its halo of meanings .
To language , for Ellul , belong both truth , with the possibilities of falsehood and error , and freedom — for example , the freedom of non-conformity .
In contrast , Ellul writes , “ Images never reinforce anything but conformity to the dominant doxa . ”
Literacy threatens conformity because it demands that the subject slow down so as to review the opinionated fixities ; literacy invites the subject to approach propositions from a non-literal perspective , to appreciate ambiguities , and to think .
Ellul argues that images dominate the cultural landscape of the recent modern period ; he describes the typical creature of that domination as “ the image - oriented person . ”
Such a person “ thirsts for more and more of the images that are so dear to [ him ] . ”
Mistaken for reality , images inculcate a false conviction that , having once seen something , one possesses knowledge of it .
Perception trumps cognition .
Language becomes a mere caption under the picture ; anything in excess of a caption irritates the image - consumer .
When the SUNY Oswego professors began effusively to notice the reluctance of their students to engage with books or to complete reading assignments , they were catching up , after a thirty - year gap , with Postman and Ellul .
Because I have devised ways of making it tough for students to avoid reading , I have had the opportunity to study what reluctant , marginally competent readers , who are in fact image - rather than word - oriented , make of the seriousness , coherency , and paradoxical character of written narrative .
I have detailed what such people make of such things in my series “ What , Me Read ? ” for the Pope Center .
In sum , they discern isolated situations , phrases , and actions , but assemble these into mental wholes quite haphazardly .
They express themselves in banalities and stock figures , which often hardly touch the actual topic .
As Ellul avers , they emote ; they like what they like and recoil from the unfamiliar , especially discourse .
I believe that Postman and Ellul are both right , in their respective commentary .
Students deprived of a genuinely literate education fall back by default into a kind of orality .
But these same students , bombarded by a steady stream of wordless images , also exhibit the symptoms of what one might call language - less - ness .
Their orality thus qualifies as less than a full or intact orality .
They are neither fully literate nor fully oral .
They are mutely image - oriented , as Ellul describes that condition .
This stultification affects student cognition in areas outside the realm of the written text .
My previous article addressed whether college students are , as some claim , image - culture keen .
I suggested that students make sense of serious movies only about as well as they make sense of novels and non-fiction arguments — that is to say , poorly .
In an essay to follow this one , I will detail my attempt , in a “ popular culture ” course , to jolt students out of their image - dominated mental passivity and provoke them to take an interest in the subtlety and freedom of vaudeville , music hall , and classic English - language film .

Are you overloaded with a toxic fire starter that has been linked to Alzheimer ’s disease ?
You ’d be hard - pressed to find a doctor who has n’t seen the studies linking yes , tap water with this disease .
But while the subject is often talked about behind closed doors , few doctors would ever come right out and say that our most common source of drinking water may be toxic to our brains .
Instead , they ’ll say publicly that we need more studies .
More studies ?
What more do you need to know ?
In fact , one study showed that drinking water that contains a high concentration of aluminum may increase your risk of developing Alzheimer ’s disease by 250 percent !
And we already know that autopsies done on people who had Alzheimer ’s actually show higher than normal levels of aluminum in their brains .
These are astonishing findings , and I find them hard to just sweep under the carpet , because aluminum is n’t just in your drinking water — it ’s in antiperspirants , baking powder , and antacids to name a few places .
No one can deny that aluminum is prevalent in our environment and is permeating our bodies .
And the longer you live , the more chance you have of accumulating dangerously high levels of it — upping your risk for one of the scariest diseases you could ever be faced with .
Tips to Reduce Your Exposure to Aluminum :
· Drink filtered water .
I recommend purchasing a reverse osmosis water filter for your home .
Such filters do the best job of removing most contaminants from your drinking water ( Otherwise , your body will filter them for you ! )
Another interesting product I use is the Wellness Filter , which not only removes contaminants , but also mineralizes the water and confers additional long term health support from dozens of valuable trace minerals .
( Visit www.WellnessFilter.com)
· Cook with aluminum - free cookware .
There are many good brands to choose from .
I actually use Revere Ware — which is not very fancy but is the same kind my mother used when I was a kid .
· Do n’t use antiperspirants that contain aluminum .
Period .
There are many natural deodorants and antiperspirants .
· I like the products from Tom ’s of Maine and Weleda , which are widely available .
· Avoid processed foods .
Aluminum is added to items like baking powder , food coloring , and self - rising flour .
· Avoid eating anything wrapped in aluminum foil , especially those little snack cheeses !
· Eat cilantro , nature ’s very own chelating agent .
In order to help prevent the long - term build - up of heavy metals — and to lower your chances of getting Alzheimer ’s — include it in your diet at least several times a month , ramping it up to daily use for two weeks at a time three to four times a year .
· For extra benefit , add some daily chlorella ( a fresh - water algae and an excellent detoxifier . )
Take 1,200 mg in three divided doses during the day when you are also eating cilantro .
Aluminum accumulates in the brain because it is able to cross the blood - brain barrier — which is no easy task .
This barrier is formed by a tightly knit group of cells that are ordinarily able to prevent most molecules from moving through and into the brain .
Unfortunately , aluminum is quite successful at crossing that barrier .
Once it ’s nestled in , it promotes the formation of free radicals , which , in turn , causes oxidative stress .
These free radicals wreak havoc on the delicate membranes that surround our brain cells , which is where the action is when it comes to healthy brain functioning .
Free radicals promote inflammation , and your brain is no less susceptible to this than any other organ .
The ravaging effects that chronic inflammation has on tissues , nerves , and healthy brain function pave the way to Alzheimer ’s disease .
In fact , a brain with Alzheimer ’s is essentially a brain on fire .
But the damage does n’t stop there .
When aluminum gets into your brain , it also promotes the formation and clumping of amyloid plaque , which is made up of a certain type of protein , called beta amyloid , we all have in our bodies .
This plaque accumulates much faster in the brains of Alzheimer ’s patients than in normally aging brains .
Once there , it slowly damages brain cells , especially in the hippocampus , the area responsible for memory .
There ’s also a much steeper decline ( more than in normally aging brains ) in acetylcholine — an important neurotransmitter for cholinergic neurons , which helps brain cells to communicate with one another and preserves memory function .
It ’s possible that aluminum may be linked to this decline , as it interferes with cholinergic activity .
Doctors and scientists continue to argue over whether aluminum is a true cause of Alzheimer ’s disease or simply a toxic but innocent bystander .
I expect the truth is as follows :
This extremely sticky heavy metal has known disruptive effects on the human brain .
It was not mined for human use until recently , so it is new to the human body .
Aluminum does n’t belong in your body , much less in your brain .
Along with other factors , it plays a significant causal role in Alzheimer ’s disease .
Some scientists and doctors say , “ Prove to me that aluminum is harmful . ”
I say , “ No .
You prove to me , given all we know , that aluminum is n’t harmful . ”
When it comes to aluminum , you have to do one of two things depending on your situation : either avoid exposing yourself to it in the first place or get rid of it if it ’s already in your system .
What to eat ( or not to eat ) to reduce aluminum intake
Inevitably , even if you follow all these precautions to a T , a little bit of the substance is going to enter your system .
That ’s why boosting your intake of foods rich in magnesium , zinc , and selenium is such a good idea .
Magnesium competes with aluminum for absorption , which means that your body is less likely to absorb so much of the latter .
Some of the best food sources of magnesium are halibut , almonds , cashews , soybeans , and spinach .
Zinc and selenium are powerful because they protect against heavy metal poisoning in your tissues .
The best sources of zinc include cooked oysters , red meat , beans , pumpkin seeds , and other nuts .
Eating a handful of nuts per day gives you 15 mg of zinc .
The richest source of selenium is the Brazil nut .
As few as two per day will do the job — but do n’t overdo it because eating a bowl of Brazil nuts could result in selenium toxicity .
Other sources include wheat germ , beef , cod , turkey , and Swiss chard .
Levels of the mineral silica decrease with age in our bodies .
It helps prevent the absorption of aluminum .
Foods high in silica are mainly high fiber foods such as unrefined whole grains , string beans , turnips , cucumbers , nuts , seeds , and alfalfa sprouts .
When you peel the skin of a fruit or vegetable , you reduce the amount of silica in that food .
Organic foods properly washed with skins intact will supply the maximum amount of silica your body needs .
Include healthy foods with antioxidants and trace minerals in your diet .
Stick with the following : unprocessed whole grains , lots of fruits and vegetables ; healthy fats from olive oil , avocados , cold - water fish like salmon , herring , sardines , moderate amounts of dairy products , and meat from natural sources ( without added hormones or antibiotics ) .
Foods like these protect your brain , your heart , and your whole body .
They also slow down the aging process .
Avoid packaged junk full of trans fats ( usually labeled as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils ) .
The body does n’t know what to do with these lethal , man -made fats .
They incorporate themselves into your cell membranes , including your brain cells , wrecking everything .
Just say no !
Do n’t forget supplements
After you take care of the basics through food , I recommend you try a combination of supplements .
Though the list of all the beneficial ones that you could take would make a great memory test , I ’ve simplified it by narrowing it down to the top seven key vitamins and some overall brain - support supplements .
You should be able to find all of these at your grocery , health - food store , or vitamin shop .
My top recommendations are the following :
Research has shown
Gary marijuana use typically levels off after a few episodes of Caprica .
COLUMBUS , OH — In an alarming trend that some are calling a failure of U.S. drug prevention policies , daily marijuana use increased nearly threefold this month among 26 - year - old Gary .

Researchers at the Department of Health and Human Services are attributing the spike in cannabis consumption to a number of troubling factors , including Gary - related underemployment , decreased motivation , and prolonged exposure to Josh .
" This is very distressing , to say the least , " said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , who blamed the increase on a lack of programs designed to educate Gary about the dangers of marijuana .
" As a nation , it is vital that we learn how to talk to Gary about drugs — and how to listen to what he 's trying to tell us . "

" We 've failed to recognize warning signs such as boredom and a growing need to just chill out , " Sebelius added .
" But we intend to use every resource at our disposal to meet our goal of cutting marijuana use among Gary by half over the next 10 years . "
A recent survey conducted by HHS suggests that the drug 's recent popularity with Gary might be linked to his girlfriend Laura working longer hours lately , to his recent acquisition of a quarter ounce of weed , or to his growing belief that it is socially acceptable to be stoned as fuck all day long .

According to federal records , daily Gary marijuana use began at age 15 and rose steadily over the next two years , only to plummet dramatically in 2001 when Gary 's mother discovered the remains of a joint in an Altoids container on his dresser .
Despite the momentary decline , usage began creeping back up to previous levels almost immediately , with intake peaking in 2005 following the purchase of a sweet 3 - foot glass bong .

" Our efforts to keep marijuana out of the hands of Gary have clearly been insufficient , " said Benjamin Whitmore , a researcher with the National Institute on Drug Abuse who recently found evidence that Gary can easily obtain pot from that one guy who always scores the super dank shit with all the crystals .
" He already smoked his half of the bag he split with Kevin , and now he 's dipping into the rest of it .
We 're looking at a full - blown , Gary - wide crisis here . "
Whitmore 's study indicates that constantly being fried can have a variety of negative effects on Gary , including a sharp uptick in the viewing of crappy movies and a noted decrease in Pop - Tart reserves .

In addition , being so fucking stoned all the time can affect job productivity , with Gary often delivering pizzas to the wrong house , or just showing up in customers ' living rooms without thinking to bring their orders .
One local marijuana expert confirmed that the drug has become a regular routine — and even a lifestyle — for Gary .

" Dude , he 's been smoking up like crazy , " roommate Chip Nichols said while carefully breaking apart a bud on the sleeve of Herbie Hancock 's 1974 record Thrust .
" It 's awesome .
First thing each day he wakes and bakes , and then an hour later he 's yelling that we 've got to pack another bowl .
He usually stops home between pizza deliveries to pull a couple tubes before driving back to work . "
Continued Nichols , " Dude , he 's been smoking up like crazy . "
Nichols said that pot-smoking among Gary had steadily dropped off in 2009 , reaching an all - time low early this February , a circumstance possibly connected to Laura 's increasingly vocal disapproval of his habit and to Gary 's dealer getting busted .

Despite her criticism of federal policies that have failed to reverse the trend in Gary , Secretary Sebelius said the nation should be heartened by new reports that marijuana use has completely ceased among Chicago resident Erica , who recently got really high and totally freaked out while watching Starship Troopers .

The Loch Ness Monster is an alleged creature purportedly inhabiting Loch Ness in Scotland .
Popular interest and belief in the animal has fluctuated since it was brought to the world 's attention in 1933 .
Evidence of its existence is largely anecdotal , with minimal and much disputed photographic material and sonar readings .
The scientific community regards the Loch Ness Monster as a modern day myth , and explains sightings as a mix of hoaxes and wishful thinking .
Despite this , it remains one of the most famous examples of cryptozoology .
The legendary monster has been affectionately referred to , by the diminutive , Nessie , since the 1950s .

Att samlas runt fikabordet , gärna flera gånger om dagen , är vanligt både på arbetsplatsen och i hemmet .
Sverige är ett av de land som konsumerar mest kaffe i världen , men det handlar nog mer om att vara social än koffeinet .
China hat Google mit ernsten Konsequenzen für seine Geschäftsinteressen gedroht , sollte der Internetgigant tatsächlich seine chinesische Suchmaschine abstellen .
Die Tageszeitung China Daily warf Google am Montag vor , seinen Streit mit der chinesischen Regierung über Einschränkungen bei der Berichterstattung über Menschenrechte zu " politisieren " .
Eine Entscheidung des Unternehmens , die unter anderem mit Hackerangriffen auf Google aus China zusammenhängt , wird möglicherweise noch in dieser Woche erwartet .
Nach Medienberichten soll der Internetriese einen Rückzug aus dem chinesischen Markt für Mitte April planen .
Google habe vier Jahre lang die Regeln eingehalten , schrieb China Daily .
Jetzt glaube das Unternehmen , " mit den Vereinigten Staaten im Rücken und unter dem Vorwand der Internetfreiheit " die chinesische Regierung dazu zwingen zu können , alle geltenden Beschränkungen für seine Suchmaschine aufzuheben .
" Geschäft ist Geschäft .
Aber wenn dabei politische Tricks angewandt werden , ist das Geschäft schnell zu Ende " .
" Je mehr Google die Angelegenheit politisiert , desto weniger Spielraum gibt es für Verhandlungen " , hieß es. Unklar ist , ob Google derzeit Gespräche mit der Regierung in Peking führt , wie vom Internetdienst der Zeitung Wall Street Journal berichtet wurde .
Die chinesische Seite hat das bisher bestritten .
Bereits Anfang des Monats hatte die Regierung in Peking Google davor gewarnt , die Zensur von Suchergebnissen zu stoppen .
Der US - Konzern verstoße gegen chinesische Gesetze , falls er die Ergebnisse seiner chinesischen Suchmaschine nicht mehr selbst zensiere , hieß es .
Die chinesischen Behörden verlangen , dass aus ihrer Sicht politisch heikle Suchergebnisse – zum Beispiel zu Tibet oder zur blutigen Niederschlagung der Studentenproteste am Platz des Himmlischen Friedens – herausgefiltert werden .
Google hatte seine Haltung zu der von Peking verordneten Zensur nach dem massiven Hackerangriff auf sein E - Mail - System Gmail Ende vergangenen Jahres überdacht .
Das Unternehmen beharrt nun auf seinem neuen Kurs , weltweit entschiedener gegen Zensur vorgehen zu wollen .
Aber auch wenn die chinesische Suchmaschine google .cn geschlossen werden sollte , will der Internetriese offenbar seine anderen Geschäfte in China weiterverfolgen .
Ein kompletter Rückzug aus China sei nicht geplant , berichtete das Wall Street Journal kürzlich .
Vor wenigen
Tagen erst hatten sich auch Googles chinesische Geschäftspartner beschwert , dass der Konzern sie über sein Vorgehen in China in keiner Weise informiert habe .
Schließe Google seine chinesische Site , sei das für Googles Partner geschäftsschädigend ; man würde nun doch gerne wissen , wie man dafür entschädigt würde . ( jk )

It ’s wondrous how the vast and the infinitesimal combine to make our planet work .
Scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) have found that bacteria in the ocean , gathering in sort of “ microbial block parties , ” communicate and cooperate with each other to have a significant impact on how carbon dioxide is transferred from the atmosphere to the deep sea .
In this newly discovered mechanism , bacteria coalesce on tiny particles of carbon - rich detritus sinking in the ocean .
They send out chemical signals to discern if other bacteria are in the neighborhood .
If enough of their compadres are nearby , the bacteria en masse commence sending out enzymes that break up the particles into more digestible bits ( see interactive ) .
As a result , a substantial amount of carbon does not sink to the depths , which affects both the marine food web and the planet ’s climate .
The re-released carbon can be reused by marine plants , and less carbon dioxide , a heat - trapping greenhouse gas , is drawn out of the air into the ocean .
In addition , less carbon is effectively transferred to the bottom of the ocean , from where it cannot easily return to the atmosphere .
The finding represents the first evidence that bacterial communication plays a crucial role in Earth ’s carbon cycle .
It was reported in the Sept. 29 , 2011 , online issue of Environmental Microbiology Reports , by WHOI marine biogeochemists Laura Hmelo , Benjamin Van Mooy , and Tracy Mincer .
Ready , set , secrete enzymes
The carbon cycle works like a planetary conveyor .
Carbon is spewed into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas — naturally and gradually over geological time from volcanoes and plants , but much more rapidly in recent history from industrial smokestacks and cars .
The gas is absorbed by photosynthetic plants , which convert it into bigger organic carbon molecules that they use as food and building blocks for their cells .
The oceans harbor multitudes of marine plants ; the detritus created when they die or are eaten is sticky and it agglomerates into particles that are heavy and start to sink .
These particles , raining into the deep , are sometimes visible and often called “ marine snow . ”
Marine bacteria see food in these particles and begin to colonize them .
But the carbon - and nitrogen - rich material is in the form of complex molecules too big to get through bacterial cell membranes .
“ A protein is too big , ” Hmelo said .
“ The bacteria want one amino acid . ”
The bacteria can manufacture enzymes to break down the molecules , but here ’s the catch :
It costs precious energy to make the enzymes , and a lone bacterium does n’t stand a chance .
“ For any one bacterium to engage in this , there ’s a risk that they would n’t get a return on their investment , ” Van Mooy said .
“ It would have to send out enzymes and hope that they hit something and blow it up so they can get something to eat out of it . ”
Instead , the bacteria conserve their resources by making other chemicals , called acylated homoserine lactones , or AHLs , which cost much less energy to produce , Hmelo said .
They send these AHLs into the environment to see if any other bacteria are around .
If no other AHL - producing bacteria are in the vicinity , the AHLs will diffuse away and quickly degrade , and bacterial “ silence ” will prevail .
But if enough AHL - producing bacteria are nearby , the concentration of AHLs outside the bacteria will eventually rise .
That ’s the chemical signal to each bacterium that it ’s got a lot of buddies in the area .
In this way — a process called quorum sensing — the bacteria sense that they have achieved a quorum , in this case a sufficient density to begin to make and release enzymes .
You might think of it as the microbial equivalent of sending out tweets to organize a block party .
Chemical conversations
The scientists investigated this unexplored mechanism by using mesh traps to collect particles of marine snow sinking in Clayoquot Sound off Vancouver , where fjords extend into the ocean .
Tides go back and forth over the shallow bottoms of the fjords , stirring up nutrients that spark blooms of marine algae .
Back in the lab at WHOI , the scientists incubated the collected particles and confirmed the presence of AHLs in the marine snow .
They also added AHLs to samples and found that the chemical signals stimulated bacteria to make enzymes that broke apart the particles — confirming that bacteria “ talk about it ” before launching a coordinated assault .
In the natural world , Van Mooy said , only about 10 percent of particles makes it all the way to the ocean depths ; the scientists theorize that this quorum - sensing mechanism plays a key role in disaggregating most of the particles .
“ So microscopic bacteria buffer the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through their ‘ conversations , ’ ” he said .
“ I think it ’s amazing that there is an infinite number of these conversations going on in the ocean right now , and they are affecting Earth ’s carbon cycle . ”
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
The American parents sit stoically in a sky - lit courtroom , listening to testimony about how an Israeli military bulldozer crushed their daughter to death seven years ago .
They hear about the dangerous game of chicken played for several hours that winter afternoon in 2003 , between bulldozers and international activists trying to protect Palestinian homes , before Rachel Corrie disappeared under a creeping mound of dirt .
Now her parents , calling an Israeli investigation that found no fault a “ whitewash ” and suspecting that the bulldozer driver deliberately ran over their daughter , are pursuing a civil lawsuit against the government .
It opened this month in Haifa .
“ We need to know what really happened , ” said Cindy Corrie , mother of the 23 - year - old college student from Olympia , Wash .
But it ’s a cause that has been met in Israel with indifference or , more often , hostility .
When the Corries arrived for the trial opening , University of Haifa professor Steve Plaut called them a “ two - person anti-Israel SWAT team . ”
On his website , the right - wing commentator likened Rachel Corrie to a Nazi sympathizer and accused her parents of exploiting the “ suicide death of their clueless daughter ” to launch a “ pogrom ” against Israel .
One newspaper columnist called Rachel Corrie a “ propaganda treasure . ”
Most Israeli media have ignored the trial altogether .
On the streets outside the courtroom , there ’s little sympathy .
People point to the many Israelis who also have died , from suicide attacks and rockets .
Foreign activists “ live in a bubble , ” said Haifa student Yehuda Efraim , 26 .
“ They romanticize reality .
But they do n’t live in our reality . ”
Even in the U.S. , pro-Israel activists sometimes picket the family ’s public appearances .
Last summer , opponents lobbied unsuccessfully to cancel Cindy Corrie ’s participation in a panel at the San Francisco screening of the documentary “ Rachel . ”
A New York production of the play “ My Name Is Rachel Corrie ” was delayed because of protests .
Rep. Brian Baird ( D - Wash . ) , who represents the Olympia area , said the family had been subjected to an ugly counter - campaign for pursuing their daughter ’s case .
He and others say it ’s a pattern that ’s increasingly common .
“ Any questioning of Israel is met with hostility , no matter who asks the questions -- a congressman , a journalist or even the president of the United States , ” said Baird , adding that his support of the Corrie family had cost him campaign donations .
Mark Regev , an Israeli government spokesman , said much of the criticism in Israel is directed at the International Solidarity Movement , the pro-Palestinian protest group with which Rachel Corrie worked .
“ It ’s more about ISM , not about her , ” he said .
“ The idea that they would send young activists into ground zero of a war zone is criminally reprehensible .
But of course , no one is taking them to trial . ”
In fact , some of the Israeli hostility toward the case may reflect how Palestinians have embraced the young woman as a hero .
They dedicated a street in her name .
Her parents started a foundation to support Palestinian causes .
Baird compared her courage to that of the Tiananmen Square protester who faced down a Chinese tank in 1989 .
Many thought Corrie ’s death would be settled out of court , given the close U.S. - Israeli relations and disturbing circumstances .
But diplomatic efforts to resolve the case failed and Israel ’s government insists that it bears no responsibility .
An internal military inquiry concluded that the driver did not see Corrie and that the young woman should never have put herself in the middle of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The Corries accuse the Israeli government of stonewalling their case .
The full military report , including video evidence , has never been publicly released , they say .
This month , they learned that an Israeli autopsy doctor took tissue samples from Corrie ’s body without authorization and then lost track of them .
U.S. officials had to intervene when the Israeli government refused to allow key witnesses to enter the country to testify , officials said .
Last week , the family learned that legal proceedings might be delayed until next year .
“ Our family never wanted to file a lawsuit , ” said Sarah Corrie Simpson , Rachel ’s sister .
“ But we need some level of accountability taken by the Israeli government for what happened to Rachel . ”
Family members say Israel has never apologized .
Shortly after the incident , an Israeli consul in the U.S. phoned the family and offered condolences , Cindy Corrie said .
A few days later , he called to retract them , clarifying that he was speaking only personally .
For Cindy Corrie , the hardest part has been the vilification of her daughter by critics who often portray the woman as an anti-Semitic supporter of violence .
Simpson , who first learned about her sister ’s death from a television news ticker , said the family tries to take the verbal attacks in stride .
“ My sister being killed is the worst pain you could ever give to this family , ” she said .
“ Everything else that is said or done just pales in comparison . ”

Christians say that the image is highly offensive
The government in the Indian state of Meghalaya has confiscated textbooks showing pictures of Jesus Christ holding a cigarette and a can of beer .
The book has been used for primary classes and has caused a furore in the north - eastern state , where more than 70 % of the population are Christians .
State Education Minister Ampareen Lyngdoh said legal action against the publishers was being contemplated .
The company , based in Delhi , has so far not responded to the complaints .
' Insensitivity '
" We are now considering legal action against the Skyline Publications of New Delhi who published the controversial textbooks , " Mr Lyngdoh said .
The controversial picture of Jesus was discovered in cursive writing exercise books being used at a private school in the state capital , Shillong .
Many people in Meghalaya are Christian
The minister said that although private schools were not obliged to use textbooks prescribed by the Meghalaya Board of Secondary Education , his government has taken speedy action by seizing all the copies of the textbook from schools and bookshops .
" We are deeply hurt by the insensitivity of the publisher .
How can one show such total disrespect for a religion ? " asked Dominic Jala , the Archbishop of Shillong .
" Just think how this would impact on students at such a tender age . "
The Catholic Church in India has banned all textbooks by Skyline Publications from all its schools .
" We have told all our member schools across the country to ban this publisher , " said Catholic Bishops ' Conference of India ( CBCI ) spokesman Babu Joseph .
The Church has also asked the government to take strict action against the publisher and to ban any such " objectionable publications " from all schools in future , he said .
" Jesus Christ is central to Christian faith and Christian life .
The attempt to tarnish his image is highly objectionable and goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in India , " Mr Joseph said .

Rebecca Solomon is 22 and a student at the University of Michigan , and on Jan. 5 she was flying back to school after holiday break .
She made sure she arrived at Philadelphia International Airport 90 minutes before takeoff , given the new regulations .
She would be flying into Detroit on Northwest Airlines , the same city and carrier involved in the attempted bombing on Christmas , just 10 days before .
She was tense .
What happened to her lasted only 20 seconds , but she says they were the longest 20 seconds of her life .

Space apparently has its own recipe for making carbon nanotubes , one of the most intriguing contributions of nanotechnology here on Earth , and metals are conspicuously missing from the list of ingredients .
The finding is the surprising by - product of lab experiments designed by Joseph Nuth at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. and his colleagues to address the astronomical question of how carbon gets recycled in the regions of space that spawn stars and planets .
The work also could help researchers understand puzzling observations about some supernovas .
In a recent paper in Astrophysical Journal Letters , Nuth 's team describes the modest chemical reaction .
Unlike current methods for producing carbon nanotubes -- tiny yet strong structures with a range of applications in electronics and , ultimately , perhaps even medicine -- the new approach does not need the aid of a metal catalyst .
" Instead , nanotubes were produced when graphite dust particles were exposed to a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases , " explains Nuth .
" I am amazed at the implications of this paper , not only for astrophysics but also for materials science , " says Dick Zare , the chair of the chemistry department at Stanford University , Stanford , Calif .
" Could Nature know a new chemistry for making carbon nanotubes that we have yet to discover ? "
One indication of that possibility came in 2008 , when the long , thin carbon structures known as graphite whiskers -- essentially , bigger cousins of carbon nanotubes -- were identified in three meteorites .
That finding offered the tantalizing prospect that a haze of graphite whiskers in space could explain why some supernovas appear dimmer , and therefore farther away , than they should be , according to current models .
Yet , " very little is known about graphite whisker formation , and so it is difficult to adequately interpret their discovery , " says Marc Fries of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
Fries and Andrew Steele at the Carnegie Institution for Science , Washington , reported the meteorite findings .
advertisement
Now , the experiments by Nuth 's team suggest a possible route for forming such structures .
This " is exactly the sort of fundamental approach needed for a meaningful understanding of what graphite whiskers are and what their presence means in the larger context of solar system formation and astronomical observations , " Fries explains .
Nuth 's approach is a variation of a well - established way to produce gasoline or other liquid fuels from coal .
It 's known as Fischer - Tropsch synthesis , and researchers suspect that it could have produced at least some of the simple carbon - based compounds in the early solar system .
Nuth proposes that the nanotubes yielded by such reactions could be the key to the recycling of the carbon that gets released when carbon - rich grains are destroyed by supernova explosions .
The structure of the carbon nanotubes produced in these experiments was determined by Yuki Kimura , a materials scientist at Tohoku University , Japan , who examined the samples under a powerful transmission electron microscope .
He saw particles on which the original smooth graphite gradually morphed into an unstructured region and finally to an area rich in tangled hair - like masses .
A closer look with an even more powerful microscope showed that these tendrils were in fact cup - stacked carbon nanotubes , which resemble a stack of Styrofoam cups with the bottoms cut out .
These observations surprised Kimura because carbon nanotubes are typically grown with platinum or another metal as a catalyst , yet Nuth 's reaction had used no metals .
Kimura checked for contamination but " did not find the presence of metallic particles accompanying the nanotube in the sample , " he says .
If further testing indicates that the new method is suitable for materials - science applications , it could supplement , or even replace , the familiar way of making nanotubes , explains Kimura .
That possibility " is most exciting and invites yet more study , " says Zare .
The findings also might open a new realm of investigation in astronomy , because " we can take the whiskers produced by Joe and interrogate their properties , " says Steele .
In particular , researchers can evaluate whether graphite whiskers absorb light , he notes .
A positive result would lend credence to the proposition that the presence of these molecules in space affects the observations of some supernovas .
The ability to test this hypothesis could start a reaction of its own .
A Chinese company is claiming that its iPad knockoff is in fact an original design that has been copied by Apple .
The P88 has been on the market in China for six months .
It 's easy to recognize :
It looks just like a big iPhone .
Xiaolong
Wu , the president of the Shenzhen Great Loong Brother company that makes the P88 , gave an interview to Spanish national newspaper El Mundo .
If the iPad comes to China , he says , " We wo n't have any choice but to report them , " because " it will certainly affect our sales . "
The charge ?
Oddly , El Mundo reports the crime as " plagiarism , " although we assume it means IP or copyright infringement .
Wu says that Apple has not only copied the concept of a multitouch tablet , but also the design of the case and screen bezel .
And pre-empting our obvious criticism , that the P88 is just a large - scale iPhone or iPod Touch rip - off , Wu says that " they have nothing to do with it , as they have completely different functions . "
As you can see from the picture above , Wu is being rather generous when he describes the P88 and the iPad as " completely identical " .
The specs tell a different story .
The 10.2 - inch screen is n't multitouch ( it uses resistive touch ) , the P88 uses a hard - drive ( 250 GB ) , has an Ethernet port , a 1.3 - MP webcam and Intel 945GSE chipset ( likely to be paired with an Atom CPU , not listed ) with a gig of RAM .
It also runs Windows .
The kicker , though , is the battery life , low even for a keyboard - less netbook , which is what this is .
Without the power cord you get just 1.5 ( claimed ) hours .
The whole story is ridiculous , and most likely a cheap play for publicity .
Anyone confusing the two products deserves the P88 .
What is clear is that the Chinese company squeezed a ( very bad ) netbook into an oversized iPhone - style case and claimed to have some kind of ownership of this design .
Good luck , Mr. Wu .
And one final thing .
How much do you think this " cheap " Chinese copy might cost ?
It is $ 525 .
Oops .

February 7 , 2010 -- Tegucigalpa , Honduras -- MiMundo.org
“ The 1980s were characterised by a wave of violence in several countries in Latin America .
Our country , Honduras , was not an exception .
Even though the phenomenon of ‘ disappearances ’ occurred mostly during the military dictatorships , many people also vanished during democratically elected governments . ” [ 1 ]
“ A forced disappearance can be defined as : The illegal detention of a person by a state security agent or a force acquiesced by it , without the appropriate legal procedure , and in which the act is denied without any further information regarding the location or wellbeing of the detainee . ” [ 2 ]
“ An important characteristic of forced disappearances is that ultimately the victim is executed and the body hidden for good , hence disappeared .
In all cases , the main objective is to avoid that the remains be found .
Or , if the body is found , to make sure the victim cannot be identified due to grave disfigurement .
This important aspect differentiates forced disappearances from another tragic human rights violation : the extrajudicial execution . ” [ 3 ]
“ The victims are not only those disappeared , but also the parents , spouses , offspring , or any other close friend or relative .
These secondary victims are placed in a situation of uncertainty and anguish that can last for many years .
Due to these reasons , forced disappearances tear open deep wounds within the social fabric of a nation - wide community which ultimately affect political , social and professional circles , and thus weaken the fundamental institutions of a country . ” [ 4 ]
“ By 1982 , sixty - nine families were victims of forced disappearances .
On November 30 of that same year , twelve families came together to form the Committee of Relatives of the Detained - Disappeared in Honduras ( COFADEH ) .
The organisation ’s primary objective was to recover alive , if possible , their family members disappeared by state forces .
As sometimes the victims were held in clandestine jails for weeks or months before being irreversibly disappeared , COFADEH ’s main objective was accomplished in a few cases .
But most of the victims ’ remains were never recovered .
Between 1980 and 1989 , 184 people were disappeared by the State of Honduras without any due course of legal action followed by the authorities against those responsible . ” [ 5 ]
" Halfway through the 1990s , COFADEH proceeded with attempts to exhume bodies found in clandestine cemeteries , where some of the disappeared were brutally dumped …
Beginning in 1998 , a new series of objectives were included in the organisation ’s formal mission :
To defend collective rights , the right to a healthy environment and liberty of expression .
In addition , COFADEH has sought to demilitarise Honduras , build democratic processes and act as a human rights watchdog over state security forces .
The importance and quantity of COFADEH ’s work increased dramatically after the military coup d'état removed Honduras ' democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya on June 2 , 2009 .
During the following seven months of de facto governance by Roberto Micheletti , COFADEH ’s offices served as a central headquarters for documentation and analysis of the human rights situation .
Human rights violations carried out by the illegal regime continue to be compiled and recorded here on a daily basis , and numerous foreign delegations and alternative media head here first for last - minute information .
Just between June 28 and October 10 , 2009 , COFADEH documented 4234 human rights violations . [ 7 ]
( For more information on the coup d'état carried out in June 2009 , please view previous photo essays :
Mel , our friend , the people are with you !
and Tragedy at Toncontin : army shoots and kills protesters . )
Shortly before Micheletti’s de facto regime carried out a dubious national election in November 2009 , Bertha Oliva de Nativí ( above ) , director of COFADEH , declared : “ I believe we are experiencing a dictatorship without precedent , even worse than in the 1980s .
Back then , while we lived under the military boot , paramilitary groups and death squads would assassinate and disappear people in a clandestine manner , so that it was difficult to point them out as the criminals .
Today , they do it in broad daylight , openly challenging all national and international structures of human rights and governance . ” [ 8 ]
Tomás Nativí , founder of the People ’s Revolutionary Union ( URP ) , was abducted from his home , in Tegucigalpa , before dawn on June 11 , 1981 .
His wife , Bertha Oliva , three months ' pregnant at the time , witnessed the illegal abduction and recognised one of the assailants as Alexander Hernández , leader of Intelligence Battalion 3 - 16 .
Nativí was forcibly detained - disappeared by state forces and 30 years later , his corpse has still not been found . [ 9 ]
During the 1980s , General Gustavo Adolfo Álvarez Martínez was primarily responsible for the organisation of the death squads in Honduras .
First as chief of the public security forces ( FUSEP ) and eventually as chief commander of the Honduran Armed Forces , Álvarez Martínez established “ an elite counterinsurgency force [ in Battalion 3 - 16 ] that became the spearhead of the dirty war in Honduras ” .
The whole set - up emulated the Argentinean counterinsurgency structure and was assessed by military personnel from Argentina , the US and former Nicaraguan Elite Guard members ( pro-Somoza dictatorship ) . [ 10 ]
“ The information acquired from witnesses , surviving victims , family and the press regarding the forced disappearances clearly indicates that special units such as the National Direction of Investigation ( DNI ) and Intelligence Battalion 3 - 16 were [ directly ] responsible for the atrocities …
This latter unit specialised in vigilance and the production of intelligence regarding specific Honduran citizens who were suspected of subversive acts by the Armed Forces . “ [ 11 ]
s in other countries , powerful elites in collaboration with the armed forces nurtured the dirty war in Honduras economically and ideologically .
These national elites — who have historically controlled the government in order to protect its economic interests — literally felt threatened by the 1979 triumph of the Sandinista revolution in neighbouring Nicaragua .
This powerful oligarchy , allied with foreign corporate and political interest groups , helped finance the dirty war through an entity named the Association for the Progress of Honduras ( APROH ) .
“ The APROH was the sole creation of two men : Gustavo Adolfo Álvarez Martínez and [ US ambassador to Honduras ] John Dimitri Negroponte [ in 1982 ] .
Its origins go back to secret meetings held by Álvarez with elite businessmen , bankers , industrialists , commerce moguls , public administrators and [ right - wing ] intellectuals . ” [ 12 ]
APROH gained legal status through a presidential resolution issued by then - president Roberto Suazo Córdoba and its board members were : “ President : Gustavo Adolfo Álvarez Martínez ; Vice - president : Miguel Facussé ; Secretary : Oswaldo Ramos Soto ; Treasurer : Bernand Casanova ; Finances and Membership : Rafael Ferrari… [ in addition to ]
Paul Vinelli , Leonardo Callejas Romero , Osmond Maduro , Benjamín Villanueva , Abraham Bennaton , Edgardo Sevilla and Emín Barjún . ” [ 13 ]
Leticia Salomón , researcher from the National Autonomous University of Honduras , states : “ The coup [ against Mel Zelaya on June 2009 ] was planned by a loose association of businessmen lead by Carlos Roberto Flores Facussé , former President of Honduras ( 1988-2002 ) .
Flores Facussé ’s La Tribuna newspaper , in cahoots with two other major newspapers , La Prensa and El Heraldo , and TV channels 2 , 3 , 5 and 9 , were the main pillar behind the coup …
This group of businessmen , who control 90 % of the country ’s wealth , also includes Jaime Rosenthal and Gilberto Goldstein ( directors of the Continental Group , a conglomerate that monopolises the Honduran banking system , agroindustry and owns mass media outlets like El Tiempo and channel 11 ) , José Rafael Ferrari , Juan Canahuati , financier Camilo Atala , lumber mogul José Lamas , energy industrialist Fredy Násser , Jacobo Kattán , sugar baron Guillermo Lippman , construction tycoon Rafael Flores and real estate and African palm magnate Miguel Facussé ” . [ 14 ]
The similarities between APROH from the early 1980s and the elite business association identified by Leticia Salomón are remarkable .
Aside from the fact that some men are found on both lists ( Ferrari , Facussé ) , the two groups represent and defend the same economic interests .
And , just as in the 1980s , these economic elites are once again fueling repression via death squads run by the criminals of yesteryear .
During an interview with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! , ousted president Zelaya confirmed that Billy Joya Améndola , a former member of Battalion 3 - 16 who has been accused of numerous human rights violations during the 1980s , served as advisor for Micheletti and has led terror and torture campaigns for the de facto regime .
Recently inaugurated president Pepe Lobo has wasted no time in revealing his firm associations with the coup plotters .
“ His first presidential act consisted of ratifying a political amnesty law proposed by the National Congress , intended to clear all crimes related to the political crisis stemming from Zelaya ’s forceful removal from power . ” [ 16 ]
Such bold action awards full impunity to the hundreds of criminals who committed thousands of human rights violations against members of the civic resistance movement . ” [ 16 ]
In addition , Lobo immediately set forth his strategy of containment against the ever - growing popular resistance catalysed by last June ’s events , naming Oscar Álvarez as his minister of security .
Having already served in this post during the presidency of Ricardo Maduro ( 2002 - 2006 ) , Álvarez has been highly criticised for his evasion of legal procedures , disregard for human rights and hard - line approach , all reminiscent of his uncle , the aforementioned Gustavo Adolfo Álvarez Martínez .
“ Less than 24 hours after having been sworn in , Minister Álvarez carried out one of his infamous madrugones , or pre-dawn raids .
These illegal forced - entry procedures , which often violate national laws , were rather common during his stint under Maduro .
On this occasion , he sent a clear message to the Popular Resistance Movement . ” [ 17 ]
Researcher Robinson Salazar Pérez analyses : “ The coup d'état in Honduras on June 28 , 2009 , clearly marks a turning point in the future path of Latin American politics .
Three issues in particular have been clearly signaled and appear to be the target of right - wing hardliners : Avoid any economic alternative [ i.e. ALBA ] that may block the markets of multinational corporations , detain the progressive advance of the nationalist governments of Bolivia , Venezuela , Ecuador , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and sow the seeds of fear among Latin American leaders , by reminding them that extra-national interests are well above legitimate internal governance , even if this latter one is backed up by votes . ” [ 18 ]
The powerful Hall of Living Memories ( above ) , inside COFADEH ’s headquarters , reminds us that certain chapters in history must not repeat themselves .
Nevertheless , in Honduras , the oppressors of the past , using proven methods , once again apply their tyrannical despotism in 2010 .
A concerned Bertha Oliva concludes : “ I am convinced that this is a project they want to emulate throughout Latin America .
If they succeed in Honduras , they will also try to do so in other countries that have already been identified . ” [ 19 ]

On Earth , helium is a gas used to float balloons , as in the movie " Up . "
In the interior of Jupiter , however , conditions are so strange that , according to predictions by University of California , Berkeley , scientists , helium condenses into droplets and falls like rain .
Helium rain was earlier proposed to explain the excessive brightness of Saturn , a gas giant like Jupiter , but one - third the mass .
On Jupiter , however , UC Berkeley scientists claim that helium rain is the best way to explain the scarcity of neon in the outer layers of the planet , the solar system 's largest .
Neon dissolves in the helium raindrops and falls towards the deeper interior where it re-dissolves , depleting the upper layers of both elements , consistent with observations .
" Helium condenses initially as a mist in the upper layer , like a cloud , and as the droplets get larger , they fall toward the deeper interior , " said UC Berkeley post - doctoral fellow Hugh Wilson , co-author of a report appearing this week in the journal Physical Review Letters .
" Neon dissolves in the helium and falls with it .
So our study links the observed missing neon in the atmosphere to another proposed process , helium rain . "
Wilson 's co-author , Burkhard Militzer , UC Berkeley assistant professor of earth and planetary science and of astronomy , noted that " rain " -- the water droplets that fall on Earth -- is an imperfect analogy to what happens in Jupiter 's atmosphere .
The helium droplets form about 10,000 to 13,000 kilometers ( 6,000 - 8,000 miles ) below the tops of Jupiter 's hydrogen clouds , under pressures and temperatures so high that " you ca n't tell if hydrogen and helium are a gas or a liquid , " he said .
They 're all fluids , so the rain is really droplets of fluid helium mixed with neon falling through a fluid of metallic hydrogen .
The researchers ' prediction will help refine models of Jupiter 's interior and the interiors of other planets , according to Wilson .
Modeling planetary interiors has become a hot research area since the discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planets living in extreme environments around other stars .
The study will also be relevant for NASA 's Juno mission to Jupiter , which is scheduled to be launched next year .
Militzer and Wilson are among the modelers , using " density functional theory " to predict the properties of Jupiter 's interior , specifically what happens to the dominant constituents -- hydrogen and helium -- as temperatures and pressures increase toward the center of the planet .
These conditions are yet too extreme to be reproduced in the laboratory .
Even experiments in diamond - anvil cells can only produce pressures at the Earth 's core .
In 2008 , Militzer 's computer simulations led to the conclusion that Jupiter 's rocky core is surrounded by a thick layer of methane , water and ammonia ices that make it twice as large as earlier predictions .
The two modelers embarked on their current research because of a discovery by the Galileo probe that descended through Jupiter 's atmosphere in 1995 and sent back measurements of temperature , pressure and elemental abundances until it was crushed under the weight of the atmosphere .
All elements seemed to be as slightly enriched compared to the abundance on the sun -- which is assumed to be similar to the elemental abundances 4.56 billion years ago when the solar system formed -- except for helium and neon .
Neon stood out because it was one - tenth as abundant as it is in the sun .
Their simulations showed that the only way neon could be removed from the upper atmosphere is to have it fall out with helium , since neon and helium mix easily , like alcohol and water .
Militzer and Wilson 's calculations suggest that at about 10,000 to 13,000 kilometers into the planet , where the temperature about 5,000 degrees Celsius and the pressure is 1 to 2 million times the atmospheric pressure on Earth , hydrogen turns into a conductive metal .
Helium , not yet a metal , does not mix with metallic hydrogen , so it forms drops , like drops of oil in water .
This provided an explanation for the removal of neon from the upper atmosphere .
" As the helium and neon fall deeper into the planet , the remaining hydrogen - rich envelope is slowly depleted of both neon and helium , " Militzer said .
" The measured concentrations of both elements agree quantitatively with our calculations . "
Saturn 's helium rain was predicted because of a different observation : Saturn is warmer than it should be , based on its age and predicted rate of cooling .
The falling rain releases heat that accounts for the difference .
Jupiter 's temperature is in accord with models of its cooling rate and its age , and needed no hypothesis of helium rain until the discovery of neon depletion in the atmosphere .
Interestingly , theoretician David Stevenson of the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) predicted neon depletion on Jupiter prior to the Galileo probe 's measurements , but never published a reason for his guess .
An Open Letter to Liz Cheney on Torture
Created : February 21 , 2010 11:24 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Dear Ms. Cheney ,
I do n’t know if you saw ‘ Meet The Press ’ this morning , but a general you may have heard of named David Petraeus — he ’s the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia and is the most distinguished Army general since Colin Powell — graced your television .
He was asked about whether the U.S. ought to torture Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , the deputy commander of the Taliban , recently captured in Pakistan .
“ I have always been on record , in fact since 2003 , with the concept of living our values , ” Petraeus replied .
Every time the U.S. took what he called “ expedient measures ” around the Geneva Conventions , those deviations just “ turned around and bitten us on our backside . ”
The effect of torture at Abu Ghraib is “ non-biodegradable , ” he continued , and boasted that as commander of the 101st Airborne in Iraq , he ordered his men to ignore any instruction to use techniques outside the Army Field Manual on Interrogations .
Besides , the non-torture techniques that manual has long instructed ?
“ That works , ” he said .
“ That is our experience . ”
But hey .
You ’re a former deputy assistant secretary of state !
You obviously know better than the man who implemented the surge in Iraq .
Why do n’t you enlighten Gen .
Petraeus about all the glories of torture ?
And since you consider “ enhanced interrogation ” so necessary to secure the country , perhaps there ’s a full - page ad you ’ll take out in a major newspaper ?
Cordially ,
Spencer
The government spends billions of euros in grants and subsidies for sustainable energy projects which are making companies lazy , economic affairs minister Maria van der Hoeven says in an article in Tuesday ’s Volkskrant .
The minister has allocated billions of euros to companies developing wind and solar energy under the so - called SDE ruling – a central part of Dutch efforts to meet the Netherlands Kyoto targets on climate change .
‘ Sustainable energy will still be too expensive to contribute to CO2 reduction for years to come , ’ Van der Hoeven said .
‘ We should not go on for ever subsidising the difference between the market price and the cost price .
‘ That costs the government billions of euros and makes companies lazy .
We have to stop it , ’ the minister wrote .
The minister also said grants for clean energy projects are leading to ‘ subsidy wars ’ between European countries .
For example , wind parks at sea are built where the subsidies are highest , she said .
Van der Hoeven has already announced she is leaving active politics after the June 9 election .
Ulaan Baatar has 150,000 households who burn cheap , low quality fuels that foul the air , filling it with fine particles .
A project is now underway to get families to buy more efficient , less polluting stoves .
Ulaan Baatar ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) – A thick cloud of smog hangs over Ulaan Baatar for seven months a year .
Now , local bankers and development organisations plan to combat pollution at its main source , suburban family homes .
From October to April each year , residents of the city ’s sprawling ger districts generate 60 per cent of Ulaan Baatar ’s air pollution , this according to World Bank data .
These residential areas on the outskirts of the capital are home to an estimated 150,000 households , with most residents living in traditional Mongolian gers , also known as yurts , and single - family homes that resemble log cabins .
However , they are not linked to the city ’s central heating system for flats and office buildings .
Thus , most families in the ger districts burn a combination of wood and coal for heating and cooking .
At this time of the year , the poorest families also burn tires , trash , and whatever else they can find , releasing large quantities of particulate matter .
On average , this kind of pollution is two to ten times above Mongolian and international air quality standards .
When inhaled , these particles can settle in the lungs and respiratory tract and cause health problems .
According to the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) , air pollution - related health costs account for as much as 4 per cent of Mongolia ’s GDP .
At the government ’s urging , several major development organisations , including the World Bank as well as foreign and local development agencies have launched a project to make new stoves available , thereby reducing fuel consumption and particulate emissions .
In the past , similar programs have met with mixed success .
Some fuel - efficient stoves required specific , often expensive fuel types , subject to unreliable availability .
GTZ , the development arm of the German government , developed a new ger stove model , which can burn all types of fuel and cut emissions .
A traditional stove can use up 40 per cent of a family ’s monthly income in winter , according to Xac Bank estimates .
Hence , fuel efficiency means savings .
Even so , high consumer costs appear to be hindering the spread of the improved stoves , which cost 152,000 tugrik ( approximately US $ 110 ) .
“ The people who are creating the mass of the pollution are [ living ] in poverty , ” lamented Munkhbaatar Tsagaadai , a Xac Bank product officer .
Proponents of the fuel - efficient stoves are now searching for ways to improve distribution .
Xac
Bank maintains that its eco-loan borrowers who receive their loans and buy their stoves directly from bank branches save money from reduced fuel consumption , whilst re-paying the loan .
Only a few hundred families have obtained loans for the stoves , along with other eco-products , from Xac Bank since the lending program began last December .
Nevertheless , the project has access to US$ 30 million earmarked for clean energy initiatives .
CERN has been able to take the first measurements of collisions between particles with the highest energy ever generated .
These collisions were performed at CERN's new LHC accelerator and recorded with the CMS Experiment , which involved a key component ( the barrel pixel detector ) contributed by the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI in collaboration with Swiss Universities .
The first LHC operation in December 2009 has now resulted in a first particle physics publication of the CMS experiment .
This is after a remarkably short time , given the complexity and the size of this gigantic experiment constructed and operated by more than 3000 physicists and engineers from close to 40 countries .
The new ring accelerator at CERN , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) resumed operation end of November 2009 after the major incident , which caused a delay of more than a year .
However , now it is working so well that millions of collisions between protons from the two different beams have been induced .
Each head - on collision between a pair of protons creates new elementary particles , which fly away from each other like flinders of an explosion .
The pixel detector developed by the Paul Scherrer Institute is located just a few centimetres away from the collision site , and registers the particles ' flight direction from this ring - side seat .
Three layers of pixel detectors are positioned around the beam containing the colliding protons , like the layers of a vast Russian doll ; the innermost of the three detectors is located just 4 cm from the proton collision site .
It has to operate with great precision to deliver three - dimensional images of the particles ' flight paths .
In just a few hours , researchers from the participating institutes were able to collect enough data to take an initial particle - physics recording .
This confirmed the predictions made in advance by computer simulation , and led to the first scientific article based on this experiment , which was accepted for publication in record time .
At last , scientists can be absolutely certain that their detector is working as required .
' Crazy ' project
The development of this pixel detector alone has involved 15 years of work by dozens of scientists -- from other institutions as well as PSI .
For example , the lightweight carbon fibre mechanics was supplied by the University of Zurich .
ETH Zurich made vital contributions to the design of the overall electronic system .
Key components , such as the connection technology , sensor and readout chip , were developed at PSI where the detector was also assembled .
" In the beginning the project seemed completely crazy " said Project Manager Roland Horisberger .
An accurate , powerful detector was required which exceeded the specifications of the technologies available at that time
This meant that every aspect had to be developed from scratch ; there was nothing but an ambitious vision , and nobody knew if this could become a reality .
By now , however , it has long since proved its viability .
Detectors based on the technology developed for this project have already been in use for some years at the Swiss Light Source SLS , one of PSI 's large - scale facilities .
In the meanwhile the concept of pixel detectors stepped out of the institute .
The Dectris company , a PSI spinoff , manufactures and sells these detectors extremely successfully world - wide .
They are still without competitor in this market .

Gigantic equipment in the search for miniscule particles
What is the reason for the enormous effort ?
The pixel detector developed by PSI 's scientists is placed in the centre of the 22 - metre long CMS ( Compact Muon Solenoid ) detector at CERN .
It weighs 12,500 Tonnes and is one of the largest measuring instruments ever built .
CMS is one of four experiments at the enormous LHC ( Large Hadron Collider ) accelerator at CERN , which physicists hope to use to discover more about the solution to the great mysteries of matter .
For example , scientists hope that they will be able to use these particle collisions to prove the existence of the legendary Higgs particle , the last missing ( but fundamental ) component in the standard model of elementary particle physics .
Once they find this particle , they will be able to explain how elementary particles achieve their mass .
Particle physicists also want to find out whether so - called super - symmetrical ( SUSY ) particles exist .
These could be used to explain the dark matter in space , which continues to puzzle physicists .
One theory , which is still speculative , suggests that it might be made up of super - symmetrical particles -- but nobody has seen them , yet .
Nevertheless , if they did exist , they would decay into a large number of subatomic particles called B mesons .
The easiest way to recognise these particles is by their habit of flying a few millimetres away from the point at which they are produced , before they themselves decay into lighter elementary particles .
If these decay locations could be measured accurately , this would help to filter out the few spectacular results from the billions upon billions of particle collisions taking place in the CMS .
Finding and investigating B mesons represents one of the main activities of the PSI 's particle physicists .
Tracking down new laws of nature
Roland Horisberger explains : " If the particle energy crosses a critical , still unknown threshold , we may discover new laws of nature .
Even those physical laws that we find very familiar today are only valid up to a certain point . "
The measurements quoted in the publication were obtained at 0.9 to 2.36 teraelectron volts ( TeV ) .
This alone is a world record .
However , the aim of the physicists is to achieve collisions at 14TeV .
These would represent conditions as present shortly after the Big Bang .
By that stage at the latest , the Higgs or super - symmetrical particles should have appeared -- if they exist at all .
Last night 's Super Bowl telecast on CBS is shaping up to be one of the highest rated football championship game in decades , if not all time .
According to early Nielsen figures , the game drew a 46.4 rating in the top markets .
The figures indicate a 10 % increase over last year 's Super Bowl between the Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers .
There 's even talk that when final numbers are tallied the game will surpass the 1983 M * A * S * H finale as the most watched TV program ever .
Our media critic friend nineteen80 snore predicted such an outcome , also rightly guessing that ratings would be huge in Washington D.C. because the ...
How to Cook a Wild Turkey
ROASTING
This traditional whole turkey dinner is not difficult .
You clean the bird , stuff it if you wish .
Season it any way you like , cover it with an aluminum foil " tent , " insert a meat thermometer into the heaviest portion of the breast , and put it in the oven at 325 ˚ F. , until it 's done .
Some strong caveats :
Wild turkey , like any poultry needs to be cooked thoroughly .
Most suggest an internal meat temperature of 180˚ -- some even go to 190˚ -- or " in between . "
Cooking thoroughly is particularly critical because wild turkey -- is just that – " wild , " and thorough cooking will kill any pathogens that may be present .
A good idea is that when the temperature on your meat thermometer reaches 160˚ - 170˚ , remove the foil " tent , " and let the bird finish cooking .
The skin will brown and crisp up beautifully .
Do n't toss those " drippings " in the bottom of the roasting pan .
Drain them , and combine them with seasonings and a simple flour roux , and you 'll have a fabulous smooth gravy ( assuming you " stir " continuously when making the roux and combining it with the drippings ) to serve along with the bird itself .
One quick tip -- I usually put the turkey on a rack in the roasting pan , so that the entire bird is cooked evenly .
BREAST ONLY
Follow the same procedure as roasting the whole bird , but do n't remove the foil " tent " until almost the very end of the cooking , as the breast will dry out more rapidly than a whole bird .
A few minutes without the " tent " will still " brown " the breast without drying it out .
We also very lightly " brush " the turkey breast with a bit of olive oil to keep things " moist " before we start roasting .

TURKEY " FINGERS "
Cut the turkey into strips -- breasts – thighs -- whatever .
Dip them in your favorite " wash " and breading and deep fry them .
You 'll never be able to eat fast - food chicken " nuggets " again .

GRILLING
Marinate whatever part of the turkey you 're going to grill -- teriyaki , Caribbean jerk , BBQ – whatever -- for 24 hours – and then grill .
But grilling can fail , so make sure that , for instance , if you use " strips " -- that they 're wide enough so they do n't drop through the grill grates ; and if you 're grilling a breast , I would suggest you cut it into half - inch or so slices , because if you grill the whole breast , you 're liable to overcook the outside layer (s ) while the interior never gets done .
DEEP FRYING
In the last few years , deep frying a whole turkey has become very popular .
Any number of capable fryers are offered for sale .
Prices can vary from $ 60 to $ 100 -- and more -- depending on its size ( 30 quarts and up ) , and materials .
The nice thing about deep frying a turkey is that it 's fast , and the deep frying seals in the juices so that you 've got a totally moist bird with a wonderful crispy outside when finished .
Now there are so many variables that we 'll just provide some basics , and you can " fine tune " the method you want to use .
First -- do " whole bird " only – with bones in .
Read the instructions CAREFULLY on the electric deep fryer you 'll be using .
Fill the oil to the recommended level depending on the size of the bird .
If you do n't carefully do this , hot oil can and will be displaced by the bird when you insert it for frying .
Do n't " play any games " with a deep fryer .
The oil is usually about 350˚ and can cause very severe burns .
Figure that it 'll take about seven to eight minutes per pound to deep fry a whole bird with its bones in That 's super quick when compared to roasting .
Again , our suggestions are just that -- " suggestions , " and each bird and each fryer can be different .
So be extremely cautious and enjoy the rewards .
SOUP
Nothing better than parboiling skinned turkey in a big pot ( make sure you include the bones ! ) , remove the collected scum as the turkey cooks , then combine with any / all kinds of veggies , onions , leeks , beans , pasta , rice , barley , and you 'll have a soup to remember .

CASSEROLES
Cut turkey into chunks or slices , and combine with veggies , potatoes , rice , pasta , soup mixes , seasonings , and some stock for moisture ,
by Naomi K. ShapiroThe " sky 's the limit " when it comes to methods of preparing wild turkey -- all of them work , and all will provide some of the finest unattainable - anywhere - else eating .
Trust me on that one !
Here are just some of the ways to do it :
While a wild turkey breast looks like " white meat " , generally , wild turkey TASTES more toward " domestic turkey dark meat " than " white . "
That 's really a good thing .
The flavor is full and magnificent without being overpowering -- and there is little , if any , " gaminess " to the flavor of wild turkey .
And yes , depending on the age of the bird , and what it generally has eaten , the flavor will vary , but not greatly .

It 's no secret that online service providers cooperate with law enforcement agencies and will hand over personal information of various kinds when subpoenaed , subject to court order , or compelled by search warrant .
What is secret has been exactly what information these companies store about their users , and what they will hand over to the authorities when required .
In recent days a series of these documents have been leaked to whistle - blowing site Cryptome .
The policies of ( among others ) Facebook , AOL , and Skype have all been posted to the site , and several more were posted last December , including those of Verizon , Sprint , and Yahoo .
While most companies have not responded to these leaks , Yahoo , back in December , and Microsoft , whose Global Criminal Compliance Handbook was posted on Saturday , both issued DMCA takedown notices to have the documents removed .
In both cases , Cryptome refused to take any action .
Yahoo's demand went no further , but Microsoft decided to take things to the next stage , and told Cryptome 's ISP , Network Solutions , to take the document down .
Network Solutions duly responded by removing the entire site .
Microsoft now has 14 business days to begin litigation , after which the site will be reinstated .
John Young , Cryptome editor , notes that only Microsoft and Yahoo have " behaved like assholes " and taken legal action to try to get the documents removed .
Though the other companies are no doubt far from thrilled to have their internal documents posted , they have not seen fit to take any action as a result .
Cryptome , for its part , has moved to a temporary new host , and all the documents remain available to download .
The information that Microsoft could give to law enforcement is for the most part exactly the information one would expect .
They cover the full range of Microsoft 's online services ; Hotmail , Windows Live ID , Windows Live Messenger , Office Live , and Xbox Live to name a few .
The document describes what the services are , how long they retain data , and what data they do and do n't keep .
For example , Windows Live Messenger 's logging records the Windows Live ID activity ( sign on and sign off ) and contact IDs , but does not retain any data about the actual messages .
Xbox Live records indicate which gamertag was playing what game and when , but no mention is made of , say , whether the messages sent between users on the system have any accessible logs , or who is playing with who .
What 's more surprising is why Microsoft should take such a hard line against the document 's posting .
While the company could argue that yes , technically the information contained is all proprietary and copyrighted , the fact is , it 's what any half - way competent developer would expect to log .
Some companies such as Cisco have even made their documents public voluntarily , for precisely this reason : there are no exciting dirty little secrets here .
It 's a bit surprising in places — it has to explain to readers that Microsoft can't provide access to e-mails stored on local hard drives ( something that does not speak highly of the wit of the law enforcement officers who might be making such requests ) — and is both quite specific in some places ( explaining how to read and interpret the logs that Windows Live ID creates ) and annoyingly vague in others ( when discussing Office Live Small Business and Windows Live SkyDrive ) — but for the most part , the thing that is striking is how mundane it is .
About the only real value in the whole document is that it makes clear that criminals should clearly conduct their business over Windows Live Messenger — unlogged — rather than e-mail .
Law enforcement can't request what Microsoft does n't keep in the first place , after all .
The decision to take action under the DMCA is also surprising because of the counterproductive result .
If Redmond had done nothing , the likelihood is that few people would have even noticed that the document had been posted .
Sure , it would be " out there " on the Web , but the thing is hardly compulsive reading .
By having Cryptome taken offline , the Handbook has garnered far more attention — and far more redistribution around the Web — than it ever would have if the company had left the site alone .
At least Yahoo's compliance guide contained pricing information — about $ 30 - $ 40 to get a copy of a Yahoo user 's e-mail .
Microsoft 's lacks anything even that juicy .
All in all , it is a strange fight for Redmond to pick .
No good can come of it — the document is out there , and probably distributed more widely than ever — and the handbook tells us only what we already knew anyway .
There are surely better ways to tarnish a reputation and accumulate legal costs .
Update : Microsoft will withdraw the infringement complaint against Cryptome and the site will soon be back online , according to ReadWriteWeb .
Update 2 : Microsoft has released an official statement : " Like all service providers , Microsoft must respond to lawful requests from law enforcement agencies to provide information related to criminal investigations .
We take our responsibility to protect our customers ’ privacy very seriously , so have specific guidelines that we use when responding to law enforcement requests .
In this case , we did not ask that this site be taken down , only that Microsoft copyrighted content be removed .
We are requesting to have the site restored and are no longer seeking the document ’s removal . "
Dutch “ coffee shops ” , a euphemism for outlets selling soft - drugs , have announced they are going on strike on 9 June , the day the country will hold parliamentary elections .
The idea behind closing for the day is to encourage all those who like to smoke a joint to get out and vote for the parties which will ensure that coffee shops will not be banned in the Netherlands .
Nol van Schaik , who owns a coffee shop in Haarlem , launched the campaign because he feels the current government is biased against “ shops ” like his .
“ We have been under a lot of pressure in recent years because of a very conservative government ” , he says .
“ The pressure on us is mounting and with the possibility of a new right - wing cabinet , I think we should mobilise people to vote for parties that are cannabis - friendly ” .
Restrictions
The last Dutch coalition cabinet – comprising Labour , Christian Democrats and a small Christian party – introduced tighter restrictions on coffee shops .
It wanted to ban them within 250 metres of schools and restrict the sale of cannabis and other soft drugs to local residents only .
If approved , the latter measure would be a major blow for coffee shops in tourist areas such as Amsterdam , where their customers include many foreign visitors .
Conservative parties
Mr Van Schaik fears that the pressure on his trade will increase if centre - right party CDA ( Christian Democrats ) or the populist Freedom Party of Geert Wilders – not known for their cannabis - friendly policies – will dominate the new coalition cabinet after the 9 June elections .
“ We can only wait and see whether more coffeeshops will be forced to close ” , he writes on his website .
“ Maybe you and me are next , maybe all of us ” , he warns other cofee shop owners .
The strike is not just about closing for a day .
It ’s also a call for coffeeshop clientele to go out and vote on that day .
“ We ’re putting up posters in our coffeeshops to warn our customers of the consequences of a new right - wing cabinet ” , Mr Van Schaik says .
“ They ’re people who normally do n’t vote , saying for them politics is just one big mess .
But it ’s better to have a big mess and be allowed to smoke a joint than to have a mess with the coffeeshops closed .
I hope that ’s enough encouragement to at least go out and vote ” .
Make a difference
Mr Van Schaik thinks that the pro-cannabis vote by Dutch coffee shop customers can make a difference on 9 June .
“ There are a million people who regularly smoke cannabis and who are eligible to vote .
That ’s 18 seats in parliament .
If Labour wins four or five seats more , just because of our votes , they ’ll be bigger than other parties and they ’re very much pro-coffeeshop ” .
Job Cohen
Mr Van Schaik therefore welcomes Friday ’s political upheaval over the announcement by Labour party leader Wouter Bos that he ’s leaving politics , with Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen almost certain to take his place .
“ Mr Cohen has been very good for Amsterdam ’s coffee shops , especially when it comes to regulating the supply chain .
He will have a major impact on Dutch politics and we can only be hopeful about that ” .

Chris Prior of the Gamers4Croydon party has this to say on his Twitter :
THE Israeli government , deeply worried about the country 's declining international image , has begun a campaign to turn every Israeli - and ultimately every Jew - into a travelling public relations agent .
With a website backed by an advertising blitz , the Information and Diaspora Affairs Ministry on Wednesday started issuing pamphlets to passengers on Israeli airlines and offering coaching courses to groups heading abroad .
The message : '' Are you fed up with the way we are portrayed around the world ?
You can change the picture . ''
Information Minister Yuli Edelstein said in a statement that a poll he had commissioned found that 91 per cent of Israelis believed their country had a poor image and that the vast majority wanted to play a role in improving it .
'' To counter the big money invested by Arab states in propaganda against Israel , we have to mobilise our human capital , meaning the residents of Israel , '' Mr Edelstein said .
On the website , fake news clips show a British television journalist asserting that in Israel the camel is the main means of transport and a Spanish reporter claiming Israelis grill meat outdoors because they lack kitchens .
A spoof French news anchor is seen saying life here is a series of explosions .

'' The campaign stems from a genuine fear that Israel is misrepresented , '' observed Shlomo Avineri , who teaches political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
'' But I think it is puerile .
Some of the information is ridiculous , and behind it I find a Bolshevik mentality . ''

A federal judge on Monday nullified patents associated with human genes known to detect early signs of breast and ovarian cancer .
It was the first time a federal court has invalidated a patent on genes .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which brought the case , said the New York federal court decision " calls into question the validity of patents now held on approximately 2,000 genes . "
U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet agreed with the civil rights group that the patents were invalid because they covered the most basic element of every person 's individuality .
" Products of nature do not constitute patentable subject matter absent a change that results in the creation of a fundamentally new product , " Sweet wrote in a 152 - page opinion .
The lawsuit claimed the patents were so broad they barred scientists from examining and comparing the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at the center of the dispute .
The patents issued more than a decade ago covered any new scientific methods of looking at these human genes that might be developed by others .
The patents gave Myriad Genetics a virtual monopoly on such predictive testing for breast and ovarian cancer .
Women who fear they may be at an increased risk are barred from having anyone look at their BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes or interpret them except for the patent holder , which charges about $ 3,000 for a test .
About 10 percent of women with breast cancer are likely to have a mutation inherited from their parents in the genes at issue , according to the suit .
Patents for exclusive genetic testing have also been issued for a host of genes , including those related to cystic fibrosis , heart arrhythmias and hemochromatosis .
The Patent and Trademark Office first issued a patent for a human gene in 1982 to the Regents of the University of California in connection to a hormone promoting breast development during pregnancy .
Myriad did not immediately respond for comment .

Former ministers said to have been caught on camera by journalists
A group of MPs , including former ministers , have been targeted in an elaborate sting operation in which journalists set up a bogus lobbying company and offered to pay them in return for political influence .
Among the politicians approached was Stephen Byers , the former cabinet minister and arch - Blairite , who was filmed describing himself as a " bit like a sort of cab for hire " .
He offered to trade Westminster contacts for £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 a day .
Others who were targeted in the undercover operation included former cabinet ministers Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt .
Margaret Moran , the Labour MP for Luton , was also involved .
The party tried to limit the damage last night by saying some MPs were " mortified " by how stupid they had been .
However , nothing illegal has been alleged .
Twenty MPs were invited to attend meetings to discuss joining an advisory board and 10 turned up .
The meetings were mainly held at offices in London 's St James 's Square .
An undercover Sunday Times journalist asked them how the company could go about influencing policy and how it could improve its chances of winning a government contract .
Byers told her he had saved hundreds of millions of pounds for National Express through his contact with Lord Adonis , the transport minister , and had influenced food labelling proposals for Tesco after phoning Lord Mandelson , the business secretary .
The MP said that his friendship with Mandelson was one of his " trump cards " .
However , the next day he wrote an email to the meeting 's organisers saying he had " overstated " the part he had played in trying to secure changes to the way in which the government deals with issues .
" This means that I have not spoken to Andrew Adonis … or Peter Mandelson about the matters I mentioned , " he wrote .
Byers issued a statement last night saying that at an informal meeting about a potential job opportunity he had made some " exaggerated " claims .
" Having reflected on my comments I knew that I should immediately put the record straight .
I did so the following morning by making it clear that I have never lobbied ministers on behalf of commercial interests .
I later withdrew my name for consideration .
I have always fully disclosed my outside interests , " he said .
Byers described the set - up as a " massive deception " .
The operation is reported to feature in a Dispatches programme to be aired tomorrow on Channel 4 .
The journalists set up a lobbying company known as Anderson Perry Associates , supposedly based in the US .
Its website described it as a " bespoke consultancy that helps organisations and individuals maximise and exceed expectation " .
It claimed to have 120 clients in Europe , the Middle East and the US , operating in the health and defence industries .
The exposé is likely to thrust the issue of standards back to the heart of the election campaign as party leaders battle to show they will clean up parliament .
The operation , which targeted MPs who are standing down from parliament , also targeted the Lords , with Baroness Sally Morgan , a former aide to Tony Blair , reported to have been approached .
La guerra contra el narcotráfico se va ganando .
Les hemos roto sus cadenas de distribución y comercialización , y por eso han subido los precios de la cocaína en el mercado .
México no es el país más violento ; Brasil y Colombia están peor .
La violencia subió porque después de muchos años que no se hizo nada , fue como golpear el avispero .
Por supuesto que vamos ganando .
Quien piense lo contrario es enemigo del país , aliado de los criminales .
Este es el discurso del gobierno mexicano en su cruzada nacional contra los cárteles de las drogas .
Ni un paso atrás .
No hay necesidad de ningún cambio de estrategia .
Todos están equivocados .
Nosotros el gobierno , y México , vamos ganando .
Por eso , satisfecho frente a su jefe el Presidente , el secretario de Seguridad Pública Federal , Genaro García Luna , dijo la semana pasada en Ciudad Juárez , donde cada día se registra una ejecución , que los homicidios dolosos habían bajado en esa comunidad en 40 % de febrero de 2009 a febrero de 2010 .
En muchos lados levantaron las cejas , y uno de los líderes sociales que participó en esa reunión le dijo al secretario que sus datos no correspondían a la percepción .
Objetivamente hablando , los dos tienen razón , pues las cifras duras - que son objetivas - no tienen porqué corresponder a las percepciones - que son subjetivas - .
Pero al mismo tiempo , esta dinámica de antagonismo entre lo cierto y lo verosímil , la dialéctica en la cual se mueve el mundo de Felipe Calderón y el mundo que sienten muchos mexicanos , cada vez le está costando más al Presidente .
La percepción en la política es fundamental , y es un primer paso para atacar un problema de fondo .
Cuando la percepción en Nueva
York era que la ciudad era muy peligrosa hace ya varios años , contrataron al jefe de policía de Boston , William Bratton .
Lo primero que hizo fue aplicar una tolerancia cero en el metro neoyorquino , donde el que se metiera sin pagar boleto se iba automáticamente a la cárcel .
Mandó pintar todos los andenes donde había graffiti , colocó jardineras en Times Square , el corazón de la ciudad , y en donde había una oficina de reclutamiento militar , puso una subestación de policía .
Aunque el índice delictivo no bajó , la sensación de la gente era de mayor seguridad y confianza .
El índice se redujo al paso de los años , porque la percepción positiva de la gente permitió al gobierno realizar las políticas de fondo que necesitaba para combatir la delincuencia .
Es decir , trabajar las sensaciones y reducir las frustraciones , le dio el espacio al gobierno local para poner en práctica sus políticas públicas sin tener encima la presión de la opinión pública .
Un ejemplo mexicano sobre cómo puede impactar negativamente no atender la parte sicológica de una política , es el inicio de la crisis en diciembre de 1994 conocido como el " error de diciembre " .
Aunque de origen financiero , tuvo un fuerte componente sicológico .
Ernesto Zedillo acababa de asumir la Presidencia y tenía que hacer un ajuste en el tipo de cambio para evitar un traspiés económico .
Su equipo determinó una devaluación de 15 por ciento , que sorprendió a todo el gobierno cuando al decretarla empezó una loca reacción en los mercados .
En cuestión de horas el peso se había desplomado frente al dólar en casi ciento por ciento y llevó al país a una profunda crisis .
El gobierno de Zedillo había visto el ajuste en el tipo de cambio únicamente desde el ángulo técnico , sin darse cuenta que el contexto mexicano iba a provocar una estampida de pánico , como había sucedido históricamente en cada devaluación .
De haber tomado en cuenta ese factor , es probable que la crisis jamás hubiera llegado a los niveles que alcanzó .
Pero el gobierno de Zedillo aprendió , como lo demostró el invento de un mecanismo para apoyar a las clases medias para que no perdieran sus propiedades en aquella crisis .
El propósito era rescatar a un grupo relativamente pequeño pero estratégico .
Entre ellos había muchas personas que tenían acceso a tribunas públicas y a medios de comunicación , y que si no se les ayudaba , consideró el gobierno en ese momento , el ruido mediático que podían hacer sí podría afectar las políticas económicas de fondo que se necesitaban para salir de la crisis .
Estos ejemplos arrojan luz en la dinámica de la percepción frente a la realidad .
Tan importante una como la otra , y ambas se complementan en política de manera indivisible .
En el caso de la guerra contra las drogas , el presidente Calderón ha actuado como un fundamentalista del dato duro , que choca con la percepción ciudadana de que vivimos una guerra cruenta a nivel nacional donde cualquiera puede morir en cualquier momento .
No es cierto , pero esa es la sensación .
Casi el 55 por ciento de la violencia del año pasado se concentra en 12 de los poco más de 2,500 municipios , pero no hay manera de que pueda penetrar ese mensaje .
Los datos duros , como los que presentó García Luna en Ciudad Juárez , son inverosímiles , aunque sean reales .
Si Calderón es visto como el mariscal que nos llevó a una guerra sin fin , García Luna es considerado como el general que la encabeza .
Si García Luna , entrenado por los mejores del mundo en la técnica y la ciencia no ha podido procesar que un secretario de Estado es principalmente un político que debe de entender que realidad y percepción van de la mano , Calderón sí tendría que haber entendido que en las guerras , la campaña militar y policial sin la política no va a ningún lado .
Por razones inexplicables , dado que es político , se empeña en soslayar la percepción nacional y está terco en sólo ver la estadística .
No miente , pero se engaña .
Su realidad es parcial , y no es la de un creciente número de mexicanos que reclama lo mismo que dijeron en Juárez .
Tampoco está entendiendo que con su necedad está cavando una fosa para lo que le queda de credibilidad .
Lo que tendría que hacer el Presidente es , sin dejar de atacar el problema de fondo , tratar de modificar la percepción , lo que significa un cambio a su estrategia , a su concepto de guerra , a sus métricas , a sus definiciones y al diseño de su mensaje .
Cierto .
Es un cambio tan radical que para alguien tan terco como ha mostrado ser el Presidente hasta ahora , se antoja imposible .

Perspectives on life so far .
South Korea has not given up all hope of finding survivors
The force of Friday 's mysterious explosion which sank a South Korean naval ship appears to have split the vessel 's hull in two , officials say .
The two halves are lying on the sea bed but bad weather has prevented military divers from reaching the wreckage .
Forty - six sailors are missing and rescue workers say it is unlikely that anyone could have survived three days in the near - freezing water .
The cause of the explosion on the 1,200 - tonne Cheonan remains unclear .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says several possibilities have been suggested : an accidental onboard explosion
a blast caused by hitting rocks or sea mines
or a deliberate outside attack .
The naval patrol vessel sank near the disputed maritime border with North Korea but military officials say there is no indication the North was involved .
I was trapped in the cabin for five minutes before my colleagues broke the window in and let me out
Choi Won-il
Cheonan captain
In pictures : Search for survivors Fifty - eight sailors , including the captain , were rescued from one of the South 's worst sea disasters .
Some rescue - workers say it is still possible that some people could have survived in air - pockets inside the ship , although the water in the Yellow Sea is about 4C .
After visiting the disaster site , Defence Minister Kim Tae - young said : " The vessel appeared to have been split into half , " reports South Korea 's Yonhap news agency .
Although the waters are fairly shallow , the exact location of the wreckage has not yet been located , according to defence ministry spokesman Won Tae -jae .
Navy and coast guard vessels , as well as air force planes , are still scouring the area near South Korea 's Baeknyeong Island .
A group of 80 family members have sailed around the crash site and watched the rescue efforts , the AP news agency reports .
But some relatives are accusing the navy of a cover - up , saying the ship was in need of repair .
' Save me '
Earlier , the ship 's rescued captain has been recounting what happened .
" There was the sound of an explosion and the ship keeled to the right .
We lost power and telecommunications , " Yonhap quoted Choi Won-il as saying .
" I was trapped in the cabin for five minutes before my colleagues broke the window in and let me out .
When I got out , the stern had disappeared . "
A number of the crew jumped into the water , Yonhap said .
" Yells and screams filled the air , " witness Kim Jin-ho , a seaman who was on a local passenger ship bound for Baeknyeong , told cable news channel YTN .
" Marines on deck were desperately shouting : ' Save me ! " '
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak convened an emergency meeting of security officials and said all possible causes for the sinking would be investigated .
He ordered the military to focus on rescuing the sailors .
There were initial reports that another South Korean ship had fired shots toward an unidentified vessel , but officials later speculated the target had been a flock of birds .
The incident comes at a time of tension between the two Koreas .
International talks aimed at ending the communist North 's nuclear ambitions have been stalled for months .
North and South Korea are still in a official state of war because the 1950 - 53 Korean War ended only in a truce .
Since then , they have fought three bloody skirmishes in the Yellow Sea .
In January , North Korea fired about 30 artillery shells not far from Baeknyeong .
South Korea fired 100 warning shots in response , but no injuries were reported .
South Korea recognises the Northern Limit Line , drawn unilaterally by the US - led United Nations Command to demarcate the sea border at the end of the Korean War .
The line has never been accepted by North Korea .

AMERICA'S north - east was hit by a devastating winter storm today that dumped several feet of snow around Washington DC and caused widespread chaos .
The gigantic weather system , predicted to be one of the largest storms on record in the region , effectively brought the US federal government to a halt .
Workers were sent home early on Friday and it was unclear whether federal offices would reopen tomorrow .
Government advisors suggested all residents of the city stay indoors and the underground train system stopped running in many places .
" Stay in unless you absolutely have to be out , " said John Lisle , of the district department of transportation .
Flights were also badly hit , with hundreds of cancellations and several airports closing .
Washington 's international airport , Dulles , was using just one runway .
Hundreds of thousands of people were also left without power in the storm 's wake after fallen trees hit power lines .
The sudden cold snap caused hundreds of crashes on the roads and saw major routes littered with abandoned cars as the weather took hold .
However , there were only two confirmed deaths : a father and son in Virginia were hit by a vehicle after they stopped to help a stranded motorist .
But there was also a lighter side to the weather .
The cable news shows dubbed the storm the " Snowpocalypse " or " Snowmageddon " and sent dozens of reporters out into the freezing cold to provide blanket coverage of the blizzard .
The Washington Post newspaper took the unusual step of providing details of organised snowball fights around the capital and in other cities .
Even President Barack Obama got in on the snow action .
Last year he raised eyebrows when he slammed Washington for not being as prepared for snowy weather as his home town of Chicago , where huge winter storms are more common .
But in the face of this huge storm Obama 's spokesman confessed the weather in the capital now had the president 's full attention .
" I think even a transplanted Hawaiian - to - Chicago has sufficient respect for a forecast of nearly two feet of snow , " said Robert Gibbs .
ST . LOUIS —
When rumors circulated at the NHL draft in Montreal last summer that the New York Islanders might take Matt Duchene with the first overall pick , some of their hardened fans threatened to burn their season tickets .
Islanders fans had their hearts set on John Tavares , after all .
Nine months later , the question is , “ Would the Islanders do it differently if they could ? ”
In the horse race for the NHL ’s Calder Trophy for rookie of the year , the Isles ’ Tavares is stumbling around in the middle of the pack , while Duchene seems to be picking up another furlong every few days .
In 68 games , Tavares has 18 goals , 18 assists , a minus - 18 and 18 penalty minutes .
The scoring numbers are respectable , but they do n’t stack up to those of Duchene , the No. 3 pick .
The Avs’ 19 - year - old center has 23 goals , 24 assists and a plus - 2 .
And , just as important , his team has been a surprising success story , while the Islanders appear headed for another nonplayoff finish .
On an off - day here Monday , Duchene said the playoffs remain foremost in his mind but he would be lying if he said the Calder did n’t sneak in as well .
“ It ’s always there .
You have goals you want to achieve , and you only get one shot at it , ” Duchene said .
“ It was n’t there as much earlier in the year , because your first goal is just to make the team .
…
Now , things are falling into place a little bit more . ”
Duchene ’s finances also would improve if he wins the Calder .
Rookies no longer are allowed to negotiate bonuses for NHL awards , but the Calder winner gets a mandated $ 212,500 .
The runner - up receives $ 150,000 , and third place gets $ 100,000 .
The Islanders say Tavares still is their guy and retain faith he will blossom into one of the NHL ’s most exciting players .
But Duchene is outpacing all rookies in scoring , which does n’t come as a surprise to everyone .
Du-chene ’s junior coach , Brampton ’s Stan Butler , said he was the best all - around player in the draft and added , “ Matt will lift the Stanley Cup some day . ”
Duchene ’s boyhood idol , former Avs great Joe Sakic , is no less complimentary .
“ He ’s just a great hockey player .
He ’s got the whole package , ” Sakic said .
“ I think what you really see with him is his hockey sense .
He just knows how to play hockey .
For a young guy , he ’s really strong on the puck and just has a good sense and knows where to be . ”
Early in the season , Du-chene seemed destined to be an also - ran in the Calder race .
He had trouble getting scoring chances , and when he did , he hit a lot of posts and crossbars .
He entered a Nov. 18 game in Edmonton without a point in 10 of his previous 11 games , but two first - period assists that night , he said , finally started to calm him down .
His production took off after that , and he has been a plus - 10 since Feb .
1 .
“ I remember feeling like those two assists kind of broke my own slump , ” Du-chene said .
“ I ’ve always been the kind of player who gets better as the season goes along , because I think I ’m always learning .
I started watching guys more , where they were scoring from , and started to focus a lot more on just going to the net and not trying to skate 90 mph around some D-man and making five or six fakes before getting a shot off .
“ You realize you ca n’t score goals on a regular basis like that in this league , and I think maybe I was trying to do too much and overcomplicated things . ”
Duchene started using a curl - back move that opened up the ice for more options .
When he would pass off the puck , he ’d immediately go to the net and got some goals off rebounds too .
His power - play efficiency improved as well , as 10 of his 23 goals have come on the man advantage .
Hockey analyst Pierre McGuire said the Islanders and Avs could n’t miss with either Duchene or Tavares , and he is n’t ready to declare one better than the other .
“ It ’s far too early to tell , ” McGuire said .
“ Tavares will be fine .
Duchene is exceptional .
And ( No. 2 pick ) Victor Hedman is going to be really good too . ”
Duchene ’s biggest competitor for the Calder might be 6 - foot - 8 Buffalo defenseman Tyler Myers , who not only has been strong defensively but has nine goals and 36 points .
“ We won a gold medal together in Russia at the World Championships , and he ’s a great guy and a real good player , ” Duchene said .
About Tavares , who started off strong but has tailed off in the second half , Duchene said : “ I went through the same thing early on , and maybe it ’s something he ’s going through a little bit right now .
But he ’s got the kind of ability that very few players have , and I think he ’s still going to be a great player . ”

NHL reporter Adrian Dater analyzes his likely competitors :
John Tavares , Islanders center :
Has n’t been the phenom some predicted ; has slumped in second half .
Tyler Myers , Sabres defenseman : Strong two - way season will earn votes .
Victor Hedman , Lightning defenseman : No. 2 overall pick has mediocre numbers but huge potential .
Tuukka Rask , Bruins goalie :
Has best statistics among rookie goalies .
Niclas Bergfors ,

Kariya has points in five of his past seven games for a Blues team still within shouting distance of a playoff spot .
Avalanche : Peter Budaj will start his first game for the Avs since Jan. 8 , giving Craig Anderson a night off .
Budaj shut out the Blues 4 - 0 on Dec. 7 at the Scottrade Center . . . .
Forwards Stephane Yelle and Cody McLeod are listed as questionable for the game with leg injuries .
. . .
Right wing Chris Stewart has eight points ( five goals ) in the past four games .
. . .
Peter Mueller has at least one point in the six games he has played for the Avs since being acquired from Phoenix .
Blues : Veteran Keith Tkachuk returned Sunday after missing eight consecutive games with a hand injury .
. . .
St. Louis has won its past three games at home and seven of the past nine games overall .
. . .
St. Louis is averaging 36.2 shots per game in its past 12 .

Natasha Verco and Noah Weiss with the incriminating evidence .
By Kieran Adair
March 23 , 2010 --
In Copenhagen , Sydney - based climate justice advocate Natasha Verco , as well as US activist Noah Weiss , faces charges under Denmark ’s “ terrorism ” laws .
Verco faces up to 12 - and - a- half years ' jail for her role in organising protests against the United Nations Copemnhagen climate summit in December .
The two activists appeared in court on March 18 ( see report below ) .
Verco was arrested while riding her bike on December the 13 ahead of a national day of action she was helping organise the following day .
She said : “ A plainclothed police women jumped out at me and ... took me to an unmarked police van .
I asked them , ‘ Are you randomly picking me up ? ’ and they said ‘ No , we hunted you ’ . ”
Verco was then held in in isolation — in an underground carpark — for about 16 hours before being taken to Copenhagen ’s Vester prison where she was held for a further 23 days .
Verco said she was charged the day after being taken to prison , but bail was refused .
“ I wonder what the hell they ’re going to argue because I ca n’t see what evidence they ’ve got for these charges ” , Verco said .
“ Under the new anti-terror laws they can do this , but it seems to me that applying terror laws to activists is steadily eroding the base of our democracy . ”
During the December 7 - 18 UN summit , “ dozens of protests from the small to mass rallies of 40,000 people , took place ; the Danish police arrested nearly 2,000 people ” , a March 18 Mobilization for Climate Justice statement said .
“ The police are now processing nearly 200 legal complaints about the treatment of the arrestees . ”

Dear all ,
First of all , Noah and I wanted to say a massive thank you for all the solidarity , the actions , articles , petitions and messages of care that have been organised in solidarity with our trial .
Although we know that political repression of this sort targets all activists , it does feel very isolating being the people picked out and charged .
Every single action of solidarity has made this process easier for us and reminded us that we are not alone .
So thank you !
We have had several victories , some beautiful court moments , and a very stressful week in court .
Our case was extended for three more days -- which will not happen until August .
Noah and I are both sad that the trial is not over but relieved to have not been judged yesterday .
I have included english versions of some of the danish press coverage on the case below to give you a better idea of what has been going on in our trial .
We were originally given two days in court for our trial ( the Tuesday and Friday just passed ) .
We had been charged with organising violence against the police , gross public disorder , systematic destruction of property and gross disturbance of public infrastructure .
Two of these are charges associated with Danish terror laws .
The police said that we did this from the period of october to December 2009 but that these things were mostly to be carried out in Copenhagen during the period of the 11th to the 18th of December .
They said that the alleged actions we are accused of mostly failed because the police managed to stop them -- in part by arresting Noah on the 11th and me on the 13th of December and keeping us in prison for the rest of the COP ( and three more weeks -- just to be sure ! ) .
On the morning of the first day in court our lawyers argued for the case to be dropped .
They explained that charges in Denmark usually have to include some description of what people are accused of doing , including things like how they were doing it , where , when … anything really .
They successfully removed one of the terror charges ( gross disturbance of public infrastructure ) and got the police prosecutor to admit that none of the things we were accused of had any relation to what happened on the streets in Copenhagen during the COP 15 .
So now we are just accused of attempting actions , not actually carrying anything out !
It was at this point that the police prosecutor introduced the crystal - ball defence .
No more details than “ something bad was supposed to happen at some point somewhere in Copenhagen ” could be supplied by the police because they could n’t look into their crystal ball when they charged us !
In a spectacular display of confidence in the charges she then asked the court to note that she had not actually written them herself !
The court decided to continue with the rest of the charges regardless , but after two days in court I am wondering if they regret that decision .
The " evidence " for the non-specific things we are accused of organising is spurious at best and in the worst cases produced bursts of laughter from both judges and spectators in court .
They have trucked out tiny bits of conversations from tapped phones between other people and asked us to interpret them , radically reinterpreted what we and others have said on the phone ( from over three months of our private conversations that they recorded ) to the point where even the judge objected .
They used notes from brainstorms , scribbled notes from media report backs , and outlandish conjecture to try to demonise us .
My personal favourite is a note I made about big bolt cutters .
Instead of asking to interview her during her three weeks in prison ( although they said one of the reasons I was kept was for further investigation ) , they chose to leave until court to ask what was meant by this note in my confiscated personal note book .
I explained that it was prop for a demonstration that was a huge two - metre tall papier - mache bolt cutter .
It was to be used on the day of the climate " no - borders day of action " as both a humourous and serious way to say it is illegitimate to cage human beings .
The prosecutor tried to throw doubt on the honesty of my reply until two of the audience in court went to pick them up from a local social centre and brought them in for the court to see .
Everyone but the prosecutor laughed .
The state of the evidence would really be hilarious if the case did n’t carry such serious consequences both for us personally and for democracy in Denmark .
We are the first of a series of cases against people accused of organising .
It seems that the Danish state is using us as a test case for new anti-activist laws they have passed , the extension of terror legislation to cover any form of political protest and to establish the ability to try people for things that never actually occurred .
Noah and I were both picked up and arrested on the side of the road while riding our bikes by ourselves , threatened , isolated and kept in prison for over three weeks of " preventative detention " .
The personal impacts of this have been huge .
Even scarier though is the potential effect this has on everyone ’s ability to speak up about things they care about in Denmark .
If they manage to criminalise protest to the extent that going to meetings , organising speakers for a demonstration , or being a media spokesperson can land you in jail , then what sort of world will we be living in ?
If they manage to say intense surveillance and monitoring of activists and their lovers and friends is legitimate , and arrests should be made on crystal - ball suspicions of potential actions -- then we have moved from even the sham of liberal democracy to a society more reminiscent of 1984 than any of us would like to admit .
It is clear also that this is not just happening in Denmark .
Since our arrests we have heard of countless political prisoners facing the hard end of political repression .
After our experience of injustice and repression in Denmark we feel very personally that it is so important that all of us speak out and not let this repression continue .
Free all political prisoners , drop the charges for the COP 15 defendants and all people arrested during the COP15 , and end political repression NOW !!!
Love , solidarity and actions for a better world
Tash and Noah

" Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . ”
These powerful words were penned in a prison cell in 1963 , by one of the best - known advocates of equal rights – Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .
Two environmental activists appeared in court on March 18 accused of terrorism - related offences during the Copenhagen climate summit in December .
Natasha Verco , an Australian honours student , and Noah Weiss , an American citizen who lives in Denmark , will face similar charges in a trial which is due to last all week .
Verco , who has organised non-violent direct action in her native country and who has been part of the Climate Justice Action ( CJA ) network in the lead - up to the summit in Copenhagen , has been charged with organising violence , organising public disorder , significant damage to property , and organising disorder during the international talks on climate change which took place in Copenhagen last year .
If found guilty , Verco faces a maximum of 12 and a half years in prison .
Speaking a day ahead of the start of the trial , Verco recalled her arrest : “ On December 13 I was riding my bike down by the Copenhagen lakes , and a plainclothes police woman jumped out at me and pushed me off the bike .
She took me to an unmarked police van with six or seven plainclothes policemen .
I asked them ‘ Are you randomly picking me up ? ’ and they said ‘ No , we hunted you ’ .
They held me by myself in an underground carpark for about 16 hours , I think .
Then I was taken to Vester prison and held there for three weeks and two days .
I was charged the day after I got to prison , but bail was refused because , they said , the investigation was ongoing and I would influence it if I was released . ”
Verco and Weiss say they both had their phones tapped , along with 17 other activists , which is legal under recently introduced terror legislation in Denmark .
Verco said : “ I feel nervous and indignant at the same time , I wonder what the hell they ’re going to argue because I ca n’t see what evidence they ’ve got for these charges .
And looking back at the calls that they ’ve taped , it feels very invasive .
Under the new terror laws they can do this , but it seems to me that applying terror laws to activists is steadily eroding the base of our democracy . ”
Verco was heavily involved in organising the day of action on December 14 , but was arrested before it happened .
When it took place , she was still being held by police .
“ The police say that they prevented anything happening by taking me in .
There was no violence , and no disruption of the public infrastructure , because they ’d arrested me . ”
During the fortnight of talks , dozens of protests from the small to mass rallies of 40,000 people , took place ; the Danish police arrested nearly 2,000 people .
The police are now processing nearly 200 legal complaints about the treatment of the arrestees .
Verco and Weiss were both involved with CJA , the network which helped to organise some of the protests during the talks , most notably the Reclaim Power demonstration outside the conference centre for the negotiations .
Apart from Weiss and Verconone of the other activists charged during the protests , including the Greenpeace Four who were arrested and held for three weeks after unfurling a banner during a black tie event , have yet had their court dates set .

Home Secretary says threat has increased but there is no evidence to suggest an attack is imminent
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The threat of international terrorism to the UK was raised from substantial to the second highest level of severe last night , meaning an attack is " highly likely " .
Alan Johnson , the home secretary , said there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was imminent .
The escalation reversed a decision in July to downgrade the likelihood of a terror attack from " severe " to " substantial " .
Johnson said the change was not ­specifically linked to the increased threat from international terrorism following the failed Detroit plane bombing on Christmas Day or to any other incident .
He said the Joint Terrorism ­Analysis Centre ( Jtac ) , a unit within MI5 , had taken the ­decision based on a broad range of ­factors , ­including the intent and ­capabilities of international terrorist groups in the UK and overseas .
Johnson said : " We still face a real and serious threat to the UK from ­international terrorism , so I would urge the public to remain vigilant and carry on ­reporting ­suspicious events to the appropriate authorities , and to support the police and security services in their ­continuing efforts to discover , track and disrupt ­terrorist activity . "
He said the public should be reassured by the UK's " very adept and very focused counter - terrorism " services .
The terrorist threat has been at ­substantial , meaning an attack is a " strong possibility " , since July .
The independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , Lord Carlile of Berriew , said the government was right to announce the change in the threat level .
" It is absolutely essential that there should be public vigilance and the government has – quite rightly – decided that if you do n't tell the public to be vigilant , they are not going to be vigilant , " he told the BBC .
" The message from the current change of assessment is not that we should be more afraid but that we should be a little bit more vigilant than we have been . "
There are five ­levels of terror threat , ranging from low – meaning an attack is unlikely – to critical , when an attack is expected imminently .
More security measures have been taken to protect airports since the failed Detroit attack .
On Wednesday , Gordon Brown announced fresh measures to track terror suspects and improve airport security , including a suspension of direct flights between Yemen and the UK and a " no - fly list " to stop suspected terrorists from travelling to the UK .
A senior Whitehall security source said Jtac had assessed events , ­including the Christmas Day bombing attempt and an ­international counter - terrorism meeting on Yemen in London on Thursday , which will be held alongside a conference on the future of Afghanistan .
The source added other factors which could not be discussed were also part of Jtac 's decision .
Security officials have no knowledge of a direct plot threat .
The senior source said : " It is not based on a single piece of evidence or event .
There is no knowledge of a new plot or an old plot moving on . "
Officials do not believe there will be a need to make arrests in the next 24 hours .
The source added that a whole series of events and pieces of intelligence ­stretching across continents had led to the decision : " Yemen is a part of it , events in London are a part of it .
There is no specific threat to London . "
The Home Office said that the change in threat level would not cause " any discernable difference " for members of the public taking flights or going about their normal business .
Rather than triggering additional security checks at airports or putting more police onto the streets , the new assessment will send a signal to police and security officials to step up their activities behind the scenes .
" From an operational perspective , there will be change , but that is something we cannot go into , " a Home Office spokesman said .
" There will be changes to security and police arrangements , but there wo n't necessarily be any immediately noticeable change for the public . "
Sources with knowledge of the discussions before the decision said the mood among security officials was sober and they had not been as worried as they had been during recent terrorist crises , such as the disrupted 2006 plot to smuggle liquid bombs aboard planes .
Johnson briefed Janet Napolitano , the US homeland security secretary , about the development , which brings the UK on to a similar level of alert to the US .

Marie Duval 's Calendaria Botanica Ridiculoso ( 1877 ) .
And do not forget to visit A Blog of Bosh , the frequently - updated section of nonsenselit.org .
As the band ’s following grew , the notion that it might have something to offer scholars , particularly in the social sciences , became somewhat less far - fetched , though still not without professional risk .
In the late 1980s , Rebecca G. Adams , a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro , who studies friendships formed across distances , noticed deep bonds between Deadheads .
The bonds seemed to belie the idea , then popular among leading social thinkers , that communities based on common interest , whose members do not live near each other , lack emotional and moral depth — that Deadheads might belong to what sociologists call a “ lifestyle enclave , ” but could n’t possibly form meaningful relationships .
Adams brought a class on tour with the Dead — an opportunity , she thought , to teach classical theory while letting students study a cutting - edge contemporary community .
She became instantly famous , among a small group of scholars , and then , suddenly , among a much larger group of people .
One day , without warning , Senator Robert Byrd , the histrionic and prodigiously opinionated West Virginian , gave a speech decrying what he considered an appalling decline in the standards for higher education , and cited Adams ’s class as an example .
Adams had unwittingly placed herself in the crosshairs of the culture wars and was beset by , among other things , an inquiry from the president of North Carolina ’s state university system .
Though she survived with help from her chancellor and her department head , and though the question fell squarely within her specialty , Adams was politely discouraged from pursuing her line of inquiry .
“ I was advised to concentrate on the more respectable areas of my research , ” she told me .
Other aspects of the band nevertheless continued to invite academic examination .
Musicologists showed interest , although the band ’s sprawling repertoire and tendency to improvise posed a significant challenge .
Lieberman says that fully absorbing the Dead ’s music could take years , and he has noted its similarities with South Indian classical music , with its complex notational system and highly formalized four - hour concerts .
Engineers studied the band ’s sophisticated sound system , radical at the time but widely emulated today .
Even legal scholars took note , some contending that the American criminal - justice system , including the courts , unfairly profiles Deadhead defendants and has , on occasion , treated fandom as evidence of mental illness .
Oddly enough , the Dead ’s influence on the business world may turn out to be a significant part of its legacy .
Without intending to — while intending , in fact , to do just the opposite — the band pioneered ideas and practices that were subsequently embraced by corporate America .
One was to focus intensely on its most loyal fans .
It established a telephone hotline to alert them to its touring schedule ahead of any public announcement , reserved for them some of the best seats in the house , and capped the price of tickets , which the band distributed through its own mail - order house .
If you lived in New York and wanted to see a show in Seattle , you did n’t have to travel there to get tickets — and you could get really good tickets , without even camping out .
“ The Dead were masters of creating and delivering superior customer value , ” Barry Barnes , a business professor at the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship at Nova Southeastern University , in Florida , told me .
Treating customers well may sound like common sense .
But it represented a break from the top - down ethos of many organizations in the 1960s and ’70s .
Only in the 1980s , faced with competition from Japan , did American CEOs and management theorists widely adopt a customer - first orientation .
" It is the means of transport for water , merchandise and ammunition .
It is even used by the Israeli cavalry , " he says in a David Attenborough pose .
Goldman Sachs in new storm over secret deal to mask Greek debts
Goldman Sachs struck a secret deal with Greece to help it mask its vast debts , it emerged yesterday .
The Wall Street giant is claimed to have reaped as much as £ 192 million in fees by entering a complex currency transaction in 2001 that helped Athens borrow cash without putting it on the books as a loan .
The so - called ' swap ' deal , while permitted under EU rules , helped Greece meet eurozone limits on government borrowing .
Fiscal talks : Eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels yesterday as the Eurogroup .
They are expected to back an exceptional measure to instill budgetary discipline in Greece
Greece 's vast deficits caused it to fail the criteria for joining the single European currency in 1999 , but it succeeded in 2001 .
Member nations had to reduce their budget deficit to less than 3 per cent of gross domestic product and trim national debt to less than 60 per cent of GDP .
The Greek deficit stands at nearly 13 per cent of GDP and public debt is almost twice the official ceiling at 113 per cent of GDP .
Under the deal between Goldman and Greece , the country 's government effectively obtained a £ 640 million loan without adding to its public debt burden .
This was achieved because the arrangement was treated as a ' currency trade ' .
The allegations prompted uproar in Europe , where ministers are meeting to discuss a possible Greek bailout .
EU authorities demanded that Athens come clean over its financial engineering .
New storm : Goldman Sachs helped mask Greece 's debts
But the Goldman arrangement is thought to be just one of many that helped mask the full scale of Greece 's fiscal chaos .
Other Mediterranean countries , including Italy , have resorted to similar tactics .
The disclosures triggered questions in Parliament yesterday over whether the UK Government has entered any ' swap ' arrangements curbing its debt burden .
Goldman Sachs declined to comment last night .
The bank has come under steady fire over its role in the sub - prime crisis and the vast bonuses being doled out to employees .
Last month it set aside £ 10 billion for its staff 's performance in 2009 .
The revelations come at a hugely damaging time , given fears that Greece is in danger of defaulting on its debts .
Yesterday the euro fell another 0.3 per cent to 1.36 against the dollar .
Finance minister Georges Papaconstantinou admitted his country was in ' a terrible mess ' as he arrived in Brussels for the talks with fellow ministers .
He sent tremors through the markets by comparing the task of fixing Greece 's deficits to ' changing the course of the Titanic ' .
The suggestion that his country turned to investment such as Goldman to shroud the full extent of its debts will trigger particular fury in Germany , where taxpayers face the unappetising prospect of leading a Greek state rescue .
Conservative MP Michael Fallon said : ' How much confidence can we have in any progress reported from Greece when they ( the EU authorities ) have already failed to pick up fiddles like this ?'
MPs will question Goldman Sachs director Gerald Corrigan on the deal when he appears before the Treasury Committee on Monday , Mr Fallon said .
Yesterday he tabled a Parliamentary question asking the Chancellor whether Britain was party to similar dealings with investment banks .
A Treasury spokesman said : ' The UK does not use swaps of any type for debt management purposes and has not done so under the current arrangements for debt management . '
However , Britain is known to have moved billions of pounds of liabilities off the government books through mechanisms such as the public finance initiative .
Grunge heavyweight Soundgarden will reunite in 2010 after 12 years apart , Chris Cornell announced via Twitter tonight at the stroke of midnight on the East Coast , confirming increasingly persistent rumors the band would reform — perhaps to headline the Coachella festival .
Cornell ’s tweet reads : “ The 12 year break is over & school is back in session .
Sign up now .
Knights of the Soundtable ride again ! www.soundgardenworld.com”
A similar message is posted on the band ’s site , along with a vintage video of the group tearing through “ Get On the Snake ” from 1989 ’s Louder Than Love .
At this point , it ’s unclear what shape the Soundgarden reunion will take — tour , new album , etc. — or if it will involve Coachella .
Just so long as Timbaland ’s not involved , everything should be OK .

These paintings are perfect for fickle art lovers :
Once you tire of them , just ask them to walk away .
Artist Alexa Meade 's subjects are painted people that look like they have just stepped off a canvas .
Instead of using acrylic paints to create portraits of people on canvas , the Washington - based artist paints people and objects to make them look like 2D paintings .
The result is walking , talking optical illusions , 3D paintings that confuse how the eye processes objects in space .
But , look carefully at the photographs and it is possible to see an unpainted hand or an eyeball that makes the illusion a little less convincing .
A former staffer on Obama 's presidential campaign , Meade has no formal art - school training .
She says her projects " spin reality , " and that her experiences in politics have helped shape her work as an artist .
" What one experiences cannot always be interpreted at face value ; seeing is not necessarily believing , " she said .

Recent studies suggest that the world will need 70 to 100 % more food by 2050 .
In this article , major strategies for contributing to the challenge of feeding 9 billion people , including the most disadvantaged , are explored .
Particular emphasis is given to sustainability , as well as to the combined role of the natural and social sciences in analyzing and addressing the challenge .
A threefold challenge now faces the world : Match the rapidly changing demand for food from a larger and more affluent population to its supply ; do so in ways that are environmentally and socially sustainable ; and ensure that the world ’s poorest people are no longer hungry .
This challenge requires changes in the way food is produced , stored , processed , distributed , and accessed that are as radical as those that occurred during the 18th - and 19th - century Industrial and Agricultural Revolutions and the 20th - century Green Revolution .
Increases in production will have an important part to play , but they will be constrained as never before by the finite resources provided by Earth ’s lands , oceans , and atmosphere .
...
Science has a paper on the changes to the current global food system required to support the expanded global population we 'll see in a couple of decades time , noting that radical changes to agriculture will be required to support 9 billion people - " Food Security : The Challenge of Feeding 9 Billion People " .
The full text of the article is available here .
The following is a scenario from the Limits to Growth ( not from the Food Security report introduced above )
It illustrates what may happen , if the goal of producing adequate food for 9 million people is attained .
The Food Security report notes that while global food prices ( a good indicator of food availability for those who can afford it and have access to world markets ) have generally fallen over past decades they have been punctuated by price spikes like that caused by the 1970s oil crisis and the 2008 price spike ( which subsided when the world went into recession ) .
Given that the amount of new land that could be brought under cultivation is limited ( especially when competition for other uses already poses a threat to some existing agricultural land , as do losses of land due to desertification , salinisation , soil erosion , and other consequences of unsustainable land management ) , the report focuses on ways of increasing food production from existing land ( and the oceans ) .
The primary recommendations of the report are :
* " Closing the Yield Gap " ( achieving " best practice " results everywhere )
The yield gap is not static .
Maintaining , let alone increasing , productivity depends on continued innovation to control weeds , diseases , insects , and other pests as they evolve resistance to different control measures , or as new species emerge or are dispersed to new regions .
Innovation involves both traditional and advanced crop and livestock breeding , as well as the continuing development of better chemical , agronomic , and agro-ecological control measures .
The maximum attainable yield in different regions will also shift as the effects of climate change are felt .
Increasing atmospheric CO2 levels can directly stimulate crop growth , though within the context of real agricultural production systems , the magnitude of this effect is not clear .
More important will be the ability to grow crops in places that are currently unsuitable , particularly the northern temperate regions ( though expansion of agriculture at the expense of boreal forest would lead to major greenhouse gas emissions ) , and the loss of currently productive regions because of excessively high temperatures and drought .
* Increasing Production Limits
The Green Revolution succeeded by using conventional breeding to develop F1 hybrid varieties of maize and semi-dwarf , disease - resistant varieties of wheat and rice .
These varieties could be provided with more irrigation and fertilizer without the risk of major crop losses due to lodging ( falling over ) or severe rust epidemics .
Increased yield is still a major goal , but the importance of greater water - and nutrient - use efficiency , as well as tolerance of abiotic stress , is also likely to increase .
Modern genetic techniques and a better understanding of crop physiology allow for a more directed approach to selection across multiple traits .
The speed and costs at which genomes today can be sequenced or resequenced now means that these techniques can be more easily applied to develop varieties of crop species that will yield well in challenging environments .
These include crops such as sorghum , millet , cassava , and banana , species that are staple foods for many of the world ’s poorest communities .
Currently , the major commercialized genetically modified ( GM ) crops involve relatively simple manipulations , such as the insertion of a gene for herbicide resistance or another for a pest - insect toxin .
The next decade will see the development of combinations of desirable traits and the introduction of new traits such as drought tolerance .
By mid-century , much more radical options involving highly polygenic traits may be feasible .
Production of cloned animals with engineered innate immunity to diseases that reduce production efficiency has the potential to reduce substantial losses arising from mortality and subclinical infections .
Biotechnology could also produce plants for animal feed with modified composition that increase the efficiency of meat production and lower methane emissions .
* Reducing Waste of Food
Roughly 30 to 40 % of food in both the developed and developing worlds is lost to waste , though the causes behind this are very different .
In the developing world , losses are mainly attributable to the absence of food - chain infrastructure and the lack of knowledge or investment in storage technologies on the farm , although data are scarce .
For example , in India , it is estimated that 35 to 40 % of fresh produce is lost because neither wholesale nor retail outlets have cold storage .
Even with rice grain , which can be stored more readily , as much as one - third of the harvest in Southeast Asia can be lost after harvest to pests and spoilage .
But the picture is more complex than a simple lack of storage facilities :
Although storage after harvest when there is a glut of food would seem to make economic sense , the farmer often has to sell immediately to raise cash .
In contrast , in the developed world , pre-retail losses are much lower , but those arising at the retail , food service , and home stages of the food chain have grown dramatically in recent years , for a variety of reasons ( 41 ) .
At present , food is relatively cheap , at least for these consumers , which reduces the incentives to avoid waste .
Consumers have become accustomed to purchasing foods of the highest cosmetic standards ; hence , retailers discard many edible , yet only slightly blemished products .
Commercial pressures can encourage waste :
The food service industry frequently uses " super - sized " portions as a competitive lever , whereas " buy one get one free " offers have the same function for retailers .
Litigation and lack of education on food safety have lead to a reliance on " use by " dates , whose safety margins often mean that food fit for consumption is thrown away .
In some developed countries , unwanted food goes to a landfill instead of being used as animal feed or compost because of legislation to control prion diseases .
* Changing Diets ( primarily eating less meat )
The conversion efficiency of plant into animal matter is ~ 10 % ; thus , there is a prima facie case that more people could be supported from the same amount of land if they were vegetarians .
About one - third of global cereal production is fed to animals .
But currently , one of the major challenges to the food system is the rapidly increasing demand for meat and dairy products that has led , over the past 50 years , to a ~ 1.5 - fold increase in the global numbers of cattle , sheep , and goats , with equivalent increases of ~ 2.5 - and ~ 4.5 - fold for pigs and chickens , respectively .
This is largely attributable to the increased wealth of consumers everywhere and most recently in countries such as China and India .
* Expanding Aquaculture
Aquatic products ( mainly fish , aquatic molluscs , and crustaceans ) have a critical role in the food system , providing nearly 3 billion people with at least 15 % of their animal protein intake .
In many regions , aquaculture has been sufficiently profitable to permit strong growth ; replicating this growth in areas such as Africa where it has not occurred could bring major benefits .
Technical advances in hatchery systems , feeds and feed - delivery systems , and disease management could all increase output .
Future gains may also come from better stock selection , larger - scale production technologies , aquaculture in open seas and larger inland water bodies , and the culture of a wider range of species .
The long production cycle of many species ( typically 6 to 24 months ) requires a financing system that is capable of providing working capital as well as offsetting risk .
Wider production options ( such as temperature and salinity tolerance and disease resistance ) and cheaper feed substrates ( for instance , plant material with enhanced nutritional features ) might also be accessed with the use of GM technologies .
Right Room , Wrong Elephant
Looking at the issue from an Australian viewpoint , The New Matilda has a related article by James Arvanitakis on the debate prompted by the 2010 Intergenerational Report .
The article points out that it is not the size of our population that matters , it 's how we structure our economy to support the population in a sustainable way - Right Room , Wrong Elephant .
In a parliamentary speech on global environmental issues delivered late last year , ALP MP Kelvin Thomson said it was time to discuss the environmental elephant in the room .
At the time , you 'd have been forgiven for assuming he was fed up with the shortcomings of Kevin Rudd 's climate policy as the Government focused all its attention on outmanoeuvring Malcolm Turnbull , rather than addressing the problems with its ETS .
Actually , the elephant Thomson wanted to talk about was population growth , both here and globally .
Thomson read out a long list of global issues , from traffic congestion and waste , to global warming and terrorism , and explained how the population explosion was at the base of each of these problems .
Now , a couple of months later , the issue of population as a so - called " elephant in the room " is front and centre .
Driven by the release of the 2010 Intergenerational Report — as well as by a Prime Minister who seems genuinely excited by the prospect of an Australian population of 35 million — everyone is talking about this particular elephant .
Buying into the debate , entrepreneur Dick Smith and former NSW premier , Bob Carr , have both warned that this level of growth will lead to ecological disaster and that Australia is unlikely to be able to handle many more people .
For myself and many of my colleagues , however , this issue is far from being a new one .
Population and sustainability are concerns that we see raised constantly in our work and we have seen that , while the motivations of those raising the concerns may vary significantly , the way the population question plays out is very specific .
There 's just one question we are asked again and again : " What is the right population number for Australia ? "
Is it a valid question ?
Well , perhaps , but before we even try to answer it , we need to understand that there is another elephant in the room .
This one has been pointed out by British social commentator George Monbiot , and it's one that Kelvin Thomson and his contemporaries have chosen to ignore : that those worrying most about population seem to be post - reproductive middle aged , comfortable white men who have reached a certain level of material success .
Further , Monbiot reminds us , the population explosion is the one environmental problem that this high energy consuming sub-section of the population can not actually be blamed for .
In other words , to ask questions about an ideal population size completely misses the point .

In an earlier post titled “ CDS rates , What Is The Thermometer Telling Us ? ” we said :
Sovereign default rates are moving higher across the globe .
It underscores a concept we detailed in a recent Commentary and Conference Call , namely the credit crisis was never solved .
It was transformed from a reckless private sector borrowing binge to a reckless public sector borrowing binge .
Let us explain :
In the wake of the credit crisis we often talk of deleveraging .
But how much has really taken place ?
The latest Flow of Funds data can help shed some light on this .
The first chart shows total credit market debt in blue on the top and its four - quarter rate of change below .
As of Q3 2009 , total debt stood at $ 52.617 trillion , growing 1.05 % from one year earlier .
< Click on chart for larger image >
Deleveraging requires negative debt growth .
Since the chart above shows total debt growth of 1.05 % over the last year , this is not deleveraging .
To be fair , it is the lowest growth since this series began in 1952 , but it shows no sign of deleveraging .
Breaking down the series above , the next chart shows private credit market debt in the same format .
Private credit is the total credit measure shown above minus Treasury , municipal , agency ( including GSE - guaranteed MBS ) and foreign debt .
< Click on chart for larger image >
This chart shows that the private sector is deleveraging .
The total level of private sector debt is 3.80 % lower than a year ago and negative for the first time since this series started in 1952 .
The next chart further breaks down private sector debt , showing financial and non-financial private debt .
We find that virtually all the private sector deleveraging comes from the financial sector ( blue lines ) , down 10.47 % in the last year .
The non-financial sector ( red lines ) , which has borrowed more than 3 times times the financial sector , has barely deleveraged , down only 1.42 % in the last year .
< Click on chart for larger image >
The final chart below shows total government debt .
This includes Treasury , agency ( including GSE - guaranteed MBS ) and municipal debt .
It is booming and currently stands 9.81 % higher than it did 1 year ago .
During the height of the crisis , Q3 2008 , government debt levels were booming ahead at an 11.57 % pace , a 20 - year high .
This is the opposite of deleveraging .
< Click on chart for larger image >
Conclusion
The “ Great Recession ” has essentially only resulted in deleveraging of the financial sector .
The overall levels of debt are still rising , thanks to a very modest deleveraging of the non-financial sector and a big releveraging of the government sector .
Was the only problem that the financial sector was too leveraged ?
If so , the Great Recession returned the markets to sane debt levels .
If not , then the government releveraging has prevented the correction and deleveraging needed to put the credit crisis firmly behind us .
We fear the latter may be closer to the truth and the credit crisis is only partially complete .
The next major deleveraging will occur in the government sector .
Is this what widening sovereign CDS rates are telling us ?
To stay afloat during this tough economic period , companies must change with the times ; this sometimes includes a new logo or even a whole new brand identity .
Although the changes differ among brands and are unique to the challenges of the company , logos and branding are trending toward simplicity .
A number of well - known companies have redesigned their logos recently , and some have even gone so far as to redesign their entire brand identity system .
Below I have outlined a number of corporate logo redesigns with successful results .
Pepsi
The first major name with a long history of brand evolution is Pepsi .
They have gone through many packaging iterations since their inception in the early twentieth century .
The trend toward simplicity is especially apparent here with the current can flaunting a mostly blue design with the company name and logo as the only ornamentation .
The simple logo only adds to the sparse feeling of the design .
The Pepsi logo began as a highly decorative red wordmark and has evolved to a red , white and blue icon with elegant but straightforward lines .
The abstract quality of Pepsi ’s logo is its best feature – and it is recognizable on its own because of Pepsi ’s longstanding status as a household name , in this way similar to Nike .
Apple
Apple , a relatively new company in comparison to Pepsi , has still gone through a number of identity changes in its short history .
The first change was a drastic one , moving from a busy , dark image - based logo to a more appropriate image of an apple .
The apple concept progressed throughout the years , evolving to its current sleek silver apple icon .
Interestingly , the logo changes seem to mirror the style shifts of Apple ’s hardware .
As time went by , the computers and accessories became more streamlined and less clunky .
Matte gray and black gave way to metallic silver and shiny black .
The physical shapes became smaller and more rounded .
Apple ’s current logo adheres to both of these trends with its shiny silver look and slightly three - dimensional , rounded appearance .
Comedy Central
Comedy Central also modified its logo drastically a couple of years ago , shifting from a busy , illustration - based logo to an extremely simple one .
Using one inverted “ C ” to encase another smaller “ c , ” Comedy Central intended the new logo to reference the copyright symbol .
Some critics complained that it looked too much like it , but that was the point – to literally turn the copyright symbol upside down to make a humorous statement .
By using the copyright symbol to make a joke , Comedy Central is figuratively saying that they have exclusive rights to humor .
Turning the word “ Central ” upside down further drives home their point , and adds visual interest .
The appealing minimalist appearance of the new logo puts Comedy Central on equal footing with other big name competitors .
Animal Planet
Animal Planet also uses the orientation of text to their advantage .
In their new logo , the “ M ” is turned on its side , mimicking the number three .
There is much debate over the reasoning behind this decision , and no clear answer ; but regardless of the motive , the sideways position and lighter green color makes for an attractive and visually stimulating logo .
In my opinion , the negative space on the left of the sideways “ M ” looks like a bird ’s beak – negative space is always more noticeable when a letterform is used in an unexpected way .
Animal Planet ’s old logo focused on imagery , using an elephant and an illustration of the world as its main elements .
The text seemed almost like an afterthought , sitting below the images with no real integration .
The new identity represents the network appropriately , without using imagery as a crutch .
Seattle ’s Best Coffee
Seattle ’s Best Coffee exemplifies this trend toward simplicity with a new identity system that highlights the liquid nature of coffee .
Their old logo was wordy and complex , with too much information squeezed into a small space .
The color combination was outdated , and the shapes were very stylized and three - dimensional .
Their new logo eliminates much of the text , leaving only the company ’s name , and uses uncomplicated shapes to convey their point .
A droplet of coffee placed inside a semi-circle lends a bit of style , while the fresh new color scheme looks modern and unfussy .
The company ’s packaging also changed a bit with the introduction of the new logo , using the simplicity of the new logo as a model .
The overall layout remains similar , but the Seattle skyline drawing has been removed from the background and the typefaces and colors have been updated to complement the new logo .
Conclusion
As design trends shift over the years , companies must keep up with these changes .
Some make the decision to redesign their logos , while others go so far as to revamp their entire brand identity .
Many of these businesses are trending toward more simple , straightforward designs and away from the complicated , multi-colored illustrations popular in decades past .
Regardless of the industry or sector , it is clear that the future of logo design is headed toward easy , concise symbolic representations .
Have you noticed this tendency toward simplicity ?

Brand new Tata Nano goes up in flames
India
oi -Staff
Written by : Staff
Mumbai , Mar 24 : Satish Sawant , an insurance broker , has become the latest in a growing string of Tata Nano customers to see his new car burning in flames at the roadside .
Earlier , three such cases of fires were reported and all while the cars were parked .
Sawant collected his brand new Nano from a showroom in Prabhadevi , and headed home at LIC Colony , Mulund ( W ) .
He had spent Rs 2.4 lakh on the silver Nano ( MH03 AW 913 ) , which he had got fitted with an A/C and a power steering .
As Sawant cannot drive , the Concorde Motors showroom provided him with a driver to take him home safely .
Just 45 minutes after purchasing , Sawant watched his shiny Nano car transform into carbon black as flames engulfed the car .
" I have no idea what happened .
A motorcycle rider overtook me and told me that the vehicle was on fire , " said Sawant adding , " The engine was behind me and I did not realise that the car was on fire . "
A fire tender rushed to the scene and doused the fire .
The Navghar police ( Mulund E ) have registered a case .

Barring an unexpected turn , the Patriots and free - agent tight end Alge Crumpler should be uniting in the coming days .
" We are closing in on a deal , " Crumpler 's agent , James " Butch " Williams , said Friday morning .
Williams added that no contract has been signed at this time .
ESPNBoston.com reported Thursday night that the sides had reached an agreement , citing reports in the Boston Globe and Boston Herald .
Crumpler , 32 , enters his 10th NFL season , having played for the Atlanta Falcons ( 2002 - 2007 ) and Tennessee Titans ( 2008 -2009 ) .
At 6 - foot - 2 , 262 pounds , he has been one of the league 's more durable tight ends , missing only five regular - season games in his career .
Once one of the NFL 's upper - echelon combination tight ends as both a pass catcher and blocker , Crumpler has slowed down of late .
Although he was considered a key cog in the Titans ' rushing attack as a blocker last season , he had just 27 receptions and averaged a career low 8.2 yards per catch .
The Patriots have a major need at the position after releasing veteran Chris Baker -- a surprising move -- and seeing Benjamin Watson sign a free - agent contract with the Cleveland Browns .
Robbie Agnone and Rob Myers are the lone tight ends on the roster , and neither has appeared in a regular - season NFL game .

I wanted to write about this the last time there was a Sexy Sex Worker Has Blog of Fabulous Sexiness ( I think it was to due with the Belle du Jour phenomenon ) but I was n't a commenter then and thought it would be too weird to do for a first comment and probably would n't be approved .
So it will be more about the sex worker celebrity phenomena rather than the social welfare issues .
I want to talk about the elephant in the room when it comes to the glamorfication ( totally not a word I know ) of the self - employed , in - control sex worker : beauty privilege .
Generally speaking , the $ 1000 a night / hour / whatever sex workers , including the " celebrity " blog ones , and including people like Australian writer of " In My Skin " ( I do think that one is just as much , if not more , about Kate 's heroin addiction as about her work in the sex industry , from street level to a high class place , as well as being very well written ) come from a place where they are able to do all that is necessary to adhere to conventional beauty standards .
They 've come from backgrounds where they 've had the benefit of good health and welfare , education and empowerment to make informed choices , and are stable and healthy enough and had enough disposable time and income in the first place to maintain personal appearance standards that made them big earners in the first place , and to maintain those standards once they were working consistently .
When women talk about sex work as if it 's always empowering , including several Australian actresses on a cable TV show here set in a high class brothel called " Satisfaction " in which very glamorous and conventionally attractive actresses play very glamorous and conventionally attractive call girls , they 're not thinking of the trafficked women , or abused or disempowered women , or even just the not quite as stunningly beautiful women who work at the low or middle level of the industry , who do n't enjoy the benefits and privileges that come from looking like Hollywood 's image of a high class callgirl .
I am totally not saying that in order to be a successful sex worker one has to look like Billie Piper , or the original Belle .
But in an industry where , to unfortunately paraphrase the movie " Moulin Rouge " a woman is only worth what a man considers her to be worth , a lot of that is based on how she looks .
Let 's face it , when a client goes to a place and is introduced to all the girls present , he probably is n't ( I never saw it ) having a five or 10 minute conversation with her first , getting to know her as a person , and making his choice based on both her looks and what he thinks of her character and personality .
Please please do n't think I 'm getting into Derailing for Dummies territory , or making the mistake of thinking things I 've seen for myself and heard people I know discuss means that anything anyone else has seen or discussed is irrelevant .
But from what I 've seen of the sex level industry , emphatically at the lower and middle levels , the girls who were n't absolute stunners had it tougher .
They had to work on other ways to attract clients , from changing wigs and personas from shift to shift trying frantically to gauge what worked best , to offering services they were n't totally comfortable with , or lowering rates significantly .
I knew a girl in an agency once , who was stunningly conventionally attractive .
She was one of the biggest and most consistent earners for the agency .
She was fully booked every night , and never had to do anything with clients she was n't comfortable doing .
She was also one of the most horrible women working at the agency .
In the girls ' lounge , in front of colleagues of Indian , Asian and African descent , she would say loudly and repeatedly how she never went with Indian or Asian or black men as " Boongs and chinks and darkies " " turn [ her ] stomach " and " make [ her ] want to puke " .
If a client who was n't white turned up she would n't ever even go out for introductions .
The other girls of ethnic descent were upset and discomfited by her racism , but were too intimidated to say anything as , in most workplaces , if you make waves about someone who happens to be one of the most popular and influential employees there , there will be negative consequences of some kind .
Someone did complain once , and was put on another , less busy , shift .
Stuff like that is why I am patently disinterested when another glamorous sex worker turns into a celebrity .
Because she would n't be talking about how glamorous it is , or how it 's totally the best way she could imagine earning an income , if instead of the tall leggy creature of desire with the background and privilege that developed in her the nous to see right through a man and know specifically how to cater to his whims and fuel his fantasies / delusions , but instead the shorter , less toned , less groomed , less privileged girl in the corner who had to agree to anal sex in order to get a booking . . . well , yeah .
She would n't be where she is today , reminding the rest of us just how society tells us life would be easier if we looked and acted a certain way .
Because we do n't get reminded of that often enough .
MS Brilliance of the Seas is a cruise ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean ’s Radiance class .
It cruises the Mediterranean from April to January , and is based in Dubai sailing to ports around the Middle East and India from January to April , doing two repositioning cruises each year which take it through the Suez Canal .
Brilliance of the Seas is operated by RCL UK Ltd. , which is a subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd .
In July 2005 , Royal Caribbean was plagued by a controversy that involved the disappearance of one of the passengers , George Allen Smith .
Although the cruise line claims that his death was the result of an accident , evidence suggests that foul play may have been involved .

Germany and France have tabled controversial plans to create an “ economic government of the European Union ” to police financial policy across the continent .
They have put Herman Van Rompuy , the EU President , in charge of a special task force to examine “ all options possible ” to prevent another crisis like the one caused by the Greek meltdown .
His mission will be to draw up a master - plan for the best way to oversee and enforce economic targets set in Brussels as a key part of a bail - out package for Greece .
The options he will consider include the creation of an “ economic government ” by the by the end of the year .

MEXICO CITY — Traffic jams are nothing new in Mexico ’s largest cities , but drug traffickers intent on frustrating the authorities have added them as a new weapon to their arsenal , blocking city streets and creating long lines of frustrated motorists , law enforcement officials said .
The center of the action last week was the bustling commercial city of Monterrey , where the authorities said criminals commandeered dozens of tractor - trailer trucks and other vehicles on Thursday and Friday to block more than 30 streets and highways .
The blockades , called narcobloqueos by the Mexican news media , resulted in traffic chaos , with the trucks parked horizontally across highways and vehicles jammed up behind them .
Luis Carlos Treviño Berchelmann , head of public security for the state of Nuevo León , which encompasses Monterrey , described the blockades as a response by the drug cartels to recent antidrug offensives by the government .
Other government officials agreed , labeling the stealing of vehicles and abandonment of them on busy highways as a desperate attempt by drug gangs to show their power .
The chaotic scenes that the criminals created did give the impression they had the upper hand .
Local newspapers described young men carrying stones , baseball bats and , in some cases , even more deadly weapons , assaulting drivers and stealing their vehicles , only to leave the cars abandoned at odd angles on roadways .
In some cases , the vehicles were shot up or burned .

ACCORDING to his spokesman , the man who has just become the acting president of Africa 's most populous country , Goodluck Jonathan , has vowed to “ secure Nigeria 's path to greatness and guarantee our place among the great nations of the world in the shortest possible time . ”
That would be a tall order even for a freshly elected leader with a thumping majority and two terms in office .
In fact , the spokesman 's desperate hyperbole reveals the truth of the matter : Mr Jonathan is taking over the leadership of one of the world 's least governable countries in the least promising circumstances .
Some doubt the constitutionality of his succession to Umaru Yar 'Adua , who supposedly still lies gravely ill in a Saudi hospital .
And as the presidency rotates between a northern Muslim and a southern Christian , to satisfy both sides of Nigeria 's ethnic - religious divide , so Mr Jonathan , a southerner , probably has only a little more than a year in office before being replaced in the next election .
To many of Nigeria 's ambitious politicians , he is more lame duck than Goodluck .
Given these constraints , Mr Jonathan could be forgiven , perhaps , for just keeping his head down and the seat warm for his successor .
His lacklustre record as vice - president and before that as governor of Bayelsa state suggests , alas , that this would be his instinct .
However , he also has a rare chance to be radically more ambitious .
Since Mr Jonathan has little to lose politically , he could position himself as a bold reformer .
If he wants to make a difference in the year he has in charge he should devote himself to two policies .
His first concern should be the Niger Delta .
After six years of an insurgency in Nigeria 's oil - producing region , last summer Mr Yar 'Adua negotiated an amnesty and a ceasefire with the rebel groups .
Thousands of young men gave themselves up and handed over their weapons in return for promises of stipends and training .
Yet with the months of uncertainty at the top of Nigerian politics , the momentum has been lost in the Delta ; money has not been paid , the training programmes have fallen behind and there is little evidence of the roads and schools that were promised to local people .
Mr Jonathan must dispel this dangerous sense of drift .
He has the resources to honour the commitments made by Mr Yar 'Adua in full , and he should do so as quickly as possible .
Give democracy a chance
Even more importantly , Mr Jonathan should also reform Nigeria 's dreadful electoral system .
The last election , in 2007 , was a travesty ; some judged it to be the most rigged poll in the country 's history , others in the history of Africa .
Either would be quite an achievement .
Without fixing the political system , there is no hope of tackling Nigeria 's other woes , such as corruption , because the government will always lack the legitimacy to take harsh decisions and act on them .
An official commission last year suggested several changes to the electoral system , such as taking the power to appoint the head of the body that supervises elections away from the president and giving it instead to an independent committee .
This , and other sensible proposals , were all rejected by Mr Yar 'Adua .
Mr Jonathan should reverse that decision .
Above all , he should create Nigeria 's first truly independent electoral commission .
That will antagonise his fellow politicians , who do so well out of the present wretched system , but it will send a firm signal that Nigeria is on the right track and it will delight the country 's long - suffering voters .
Who knows , the reward for Mr Jonathan might just be to cheat the Buggins turn of presidential succession in Nigeria and win his own popular mandate in 2011 .

In " China 's Water Pistol , " Paul Krugman turned commentary on China into a general attack on those who remain wary of the United States ' large public debt .
In it , he sums up the Keynesian views on saving , consumption , and government spending .
Whatever his intentions , all Krugman does is underscore his own lack of understanding of economic theory .
Yet , it is his misguided view of economics that is most prevalent amongst those pseudo economists who shape national policy .
For the sake of the hundreds of millions of individuals who have their livelihoods at stake , it must be made clear that it is capital accumulation — not consumption — that drives wealth - creation .
Krugman makes the following three assertions :
Given the " paradox of thrift , " all types of savings are bad for the economy .
Government must make up for a loss in private investment .
The United States ' economy would grow if China were to sell its US treasury bills .
Unsurprisingly , Krugman is wrong on all three points .
What his argument boils down to , after wading through the myriad of contradictions that make up the majority of his writing , is the belief that our economic woes can be solved through inflation .
His final assertion is the most telling , as it illustrates his faith in the principle that more money — a return of US dollars from China — would bring about more prosperity .
What Krugman offers us is a path , not to prosperity , but to poverty .
Without savings there can be no investment , and as a result no job or wealth creation .
The irony is that without savings government spending cannot be financed , and so the Keynesian bias against " thrift " is absolutely self - defeating .
What Paul Krugman fails to wrap his head around is the fact that money is not synonymous with wealth or capital .
When the Federal Reserve prints a million dollars it does not also produce steel , nails , or any other type of capital good .
The conflation of money and capital is one of the crippling weaknesses of mainstream economic thought .
Thankfully , the world can still fall back on the sound economics espoused by the scholars of the Austrian School : Carl Menger , Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk , Ludwig von Mises , Friedrich Hayek , et cetera .
Within the context of Paul Krugman 's commentary , the most important part of Austrian theory that should be incorporated into the mainstream is capital theory .
A basic understanding of the relationship between capital accumulation , investment , and wealth creation is of the utmost importance , given that this alone is sufficient to undermine the Keynesian fallacies of underconsumption and inflation .
Our purpose here is to offer an introduction to Austrian theory by refuting Paul Krugman 's underlying mistake .
Savings are absolutely necessary for economic growth .
Paradox of Thrift
One of John Maynard Keynes 's biggest contributions to economic theory was his " paradox of thrift . "
Although the fallacy did not originate with Keynes , it was the publication of The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money that popularized it in mainstream intellectual thought .
Keynes wrote ,
The reconciliation of the identity between saving and investment with the apparent " free - will " of the individual to save what he chooses irrespective of what he or others may be investing , essentially depends on saving being , like spending , a two - sided affair .
For although the amount of his own saving is unlikely to have any significant influence on his own income , the reactions of the amount of his consumption on the incomes of others make it impossible for all individuals simultaneously to save any given sums .
Every such attempt to save more by reducing consumption will so affect incomes that the attempt necessarily defeats itself . [ 1 ]
Keynes 's argument is that by saving part of an income , a saver necessarily takes away from the income of another .
Keynes assumes that a person 's income depends on the consumption of the product being sold , and by extension believes that by not consuming , one is denying a wage earner a wage .
Accordingly , saving is self - defeating , as a loss in income will disallow individuals to save over the long - run .
But Keynes 's mistakes are easy to spot .
His principle limitation was his obvious lack of understanding of capital theory , which is interesting given that he made frequent references to Austrian theory and Friedrich Hayek .
It goes to show that John Maynard Keynes really had no idea what he was reading .
This allowed him to overlook Hayek 's point entirely .
To this effect , Keynes finished the above - quoted paragraph with ,
It is , of course , just as impossible for the community as a whole to save less than the amount of current investment , since the attempt to do so will necessarily raise incomes to a level at which the sums which individuals choose to save add up to a figure exactly equal to the amount of investment . [ 2 ]
This passage is a direct reference to the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
Earlier in the chapter , Keynes asserted ,
The notion that the creation of credit by the banking system allows investment to take place to which " no genuine saving " corresponds can only be the result of isolating one of the consequences of the increased bank - credit to the exclusion of the others .
If the grant of a bank credit to an entrepreneur additional to the credits already existing allows him to make an addition to current investment which would not have occurred otherwise , incomes will necessarily be increased and at a rate which will normally exceed the rate of increased investment . [ 3 ]
Here , John Keynes criticized Mises's and Hayek 's theory that an extension of bank credit will lead to malinvestment .
His reasoning was that the inflation brought about by the creation of money necessarily leads to a rise in wages , allowing the ratio between nominal investment and nominal savings to return to one .
His downfall was his reliance on the mechanical quantity theory of money , which had already been refuted by the likes of Benjamin Anderson and Ludwig von Mises . [ 4 ]
While the quantity theory of money suggests that inflation affects all sectors of the market simultaneously and proportionally , it ignores the microeconomic effects of inflation on the relative prices of capital goods versus consumer goods .
[ 5 ]
Paul Krugman keeps John Keynes 's fallacious bias against savings , although Krugman perhaps does it out of blind faith , while Keynes simply misunderstood basic economic theory .
Savings , or capital accumulation , is the most important direct factor in wealth creation .
The volume of capital directly influences the cost to borrow said capital , otherwise known as the rate of interest .
Naturally , the greater the supply of capital , the lower the cost to borrow , providing an incentive for entrepreneurs to borrow and invest .
Investment in lines of production , whether it is the creation of a new factory or an investment in a new method of production , is what leads to rises in productivity .
A rise in productivity leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of any given good , allowing for a reduction in price .
It is this increase in the quantity supplied that leads to an increase in real wages , and an increase in the general wealth of society .
It is thus nonsensical to oppose savings on the grounds that an increase in savings will necessarily lead to a decrease in wages .
Real wages rely directly on investment ; without increases in productivity , wages are bound to stagnate at best .
Furthermore , it has to be considered that the purchase of capital - goods for investment necessitates the payment of wages to workers in the relevant industries .
For example , when a contractor purchases steel to use in the construction of a building , he necessarily pays the wages of the workers involved in the production of that steel , and so in that sense investment fulfils the same function as consumption .
" In an economy , what matters is the exchange and investment of goods , not money .
Money is a standard by which economic agents decipher the exchange value of goods , and so it only becomes relevant at the moment of an exchange . "
The Keynesian fallacy of the paradox of thrift relies on their confusion between real wealth and nominal wealth .
This fallacy builds from Keynesians ' misunderstanding of the role and purpose of money in an economy .
As opposed to being a source of capital , money is a common and widely - accepted good that represents the flow of capital in a common standard .
Money is but a means to accommodate barter within a complex society with an extensive division of labor , in which the direct exchange of heterogeneous goods is nearly impossible .
So , when Ben Bernanke orders the production of one million dollars he does not simultaneously make possible the production of one million dollars worth of steel .
The production of steel can only be made possible through the exchange of goods , represented by dollars , and through the investment of capital goods .
Keynesians fail to understand this complex system of trade , and so do not realize that what is really paying for a worker 's wages is one 's capital , not one 's money .
By consuming capital , an individual necessarily reduces the total volume of capital available , and so over the long - run this is self - defeating in nature .
Who will pay for wages when all the capital has been consumed ?
Keynes would have solved the problem by printing money , but he did not realize that what allowed for capital formation was investment made possible through capital accumulation .
What use is a million dollars if there is no steel for you to purchase for the construction of your factory ?
Finally , the Keynesian myth of hoarding must be dispelled .
On the surface , Keynes 's belief that an individual necessarily contributes to inefficiency by stashing money under his mattress makes sense .
But this is just another product of the conflation of money and capital .
In an economy , what matters is the exchange and investment of goods , not money .
Money is a standard by which economic agents decipher the exchange value of goods , and so it only becomes relevant at the moment of an exchange .
Holding or using money will either increase or decrease the purchasing power of an individual unit of the money standard , but will not influence the flow of capital beyond that .
In fact , the purchasing power of the money in circulation necessarily rises as a result of hoarding . [ 6 ]
Government Spending , China , and Money
Paul Krugman 's thesis centers on the idea that if the private sector is unwilling to risk investment , then the government 's role is to step in and invest .
His prejudice against savings is ironic , given that without savings the government has no pool of capital from which to extract the resources necessary to make the investments Krugman wants it to make .
He alludes to this himself :
As a nation , our dependence on foreign loans is way down ; the surging deficit is , in effect , being domestically financed .
When an individual finances public debt through the purchase of treasury bills , the individual 's time preference will change in favor of future goods .
This is because the individual has allotted a certain percentage of his wage towards a long - term bond in an effort to collect on interest , or increase his wealth .
The individual , in effect , is financing the provision of capital for the government to invest in whatever it fancies .
So , Paul Krugman jumps from blasting savings as a bane to economic prosperity to then suggesting that savings is the only reason why our dependence on Chinese financiers is no longer as relevant .
Whether Krugman believes that government should consume or invest is for anybody to guess .
It remains to be seen whether Krugman even differentiates between the two — both seem to fall under the more common term of " spending . "
The topic of government expenditure has been covered elsewhere , [ 7 ] nevertheless the belief that government can better predict the market than entrepreneurs is befuddling ; it is what Hayek referred to as the " fatal conceit . " [
8 ]
Whilst discussing the topic of government spending and debt , Krugman makes the same mistake Keynes made when writing on the " paradox of thrift . "
Krugman writes ,
The bottom line in all this is that we do n't need the Chinese to keep interest rates down .
If they decide to pull back , what they 're basically doing is selling dollars and buying other currencies — and that 's actually an expansionary policy for the United States , just as selling shekels and buying other currencies was an expansionary policy for Israel ( it does n't matter who does it ! ) .
Krugman makes two mistakes .
First , he assumes that by selling securities , China returns dollars to the United States .
In fact , it is quite the opposite .
When buying securities , the Chinese are using dollars earned in trade to buy US debt , and so the dollars used are now spent by the US government .
What the Chinese buy is the promise of a greater amount of future dollars .
When the Chinese sell securities , they receive a greater amount of dollars than they actually gave .
All considered , that does not mean that the sale of securities will cause China to " hoard " dollars .
The Chinese have absolutely no interest in hoarding dollars , because the dollar is only useful to exchange for American goods or to exchange with other individuals who find the dollar valuable .
Krugman 's second mistake is the belief that a greater quantity of dollars leads to greater wealth .
This is the same assumption Keynes erroneously made when expounding his beliefs on the paradox of thrift .
To clarify , what matters is not the amount of dollars in circulation but the amount of capital .
As a final comment , it is important to recognize that it does not matter who holds American debt .
Whether it is a Chinese saver or an American saver does not matter , as what the debt problem comes down to is the fact that the US government cannot permanently finance growing expenditure .
[ 9 ]
The US debt pyramid is bound to collapse when its financers are no longer willing to risk their capital on insecure government bonds .
The trigger point will occur when the distortion caused by government spending is completely unveiled .
The Paradox of Keynesianism
The Keynesian argument against saving cannot stand on its own two feet .
Keynes 's " paradox of thrift " is nothing but the result of a bad economist making poor assumptions based on a weak understanding of economic theory .
Ultimately , the Keynesian 's deficiency comes down to their lack of capital theory , which eventually leads them to believe in a very disjointed monetary theory .
Given his education in the Keynesian framework , Paul Krugman 's economics are nothing more than an extension of Keynes .
His poor training has led Krugman to apply Keynesian theory to current events , and the unfortunate byproduct has been his influence — and the influence of those who think like him — on central macroeconomic policy ; this includes the belief that there should be central planning at all .
Individuals should choose their time preferences based on their own subjective concerns .
If this means that the individual prefers saving over present consumption , then that is all for the better , as saving is what leads to economic growth .
Given the current global economic situation , the individual should not be blamed for a partiality in favor of " hoarding . "
The truth is that individuals should be keener on " hoarding " given that the alternative seems to consist of government - sponsored destruction of wealth .

Kucinich is flipping .
“ In the past week it ’s become clear that the vote on the final bill will be very close , ” Kucinich , who voted No last time because of the lack of the public option , said at a presser moments ago .
He acknowleged that he’d be voting “ not on the bill as I would like to see it , but as it is . ”
“ However , after careful discussions with President Obama , Speaker Pelosi ” and others , Kucinich said , “ I ’ve decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation . ” ....
Kucinich said that ultimately he could n’t escape the argument that “ something is better than nothing . ”
David Dayen , who has been doing the most careful whip counts , assesses :
Adding in Kucinich ’s support , and Ann Kirkpatrick ’s , to the last whip count puts the number at 193 yes , 205 no , and 208-208 with leaners .
That leaves Democrats needing 8 of the final 15 uncommitted votes to come through .
The group includes five who voted no last time , and 10 who voted yes .
So theoretically , if nobody flips to no , the Democrats have the votes .
Here are the final 15 : Lincoln Davis , Jim Matheson , Harry Teague , Travis Childers , John Barrow , Zack Space , Chris Carney , Brad Ellsworth , Jerry Costello , Henry Cuellar , Nick Rahall , Solomon Ortiz , Earl Pomeroy , Bill Foster , Harry Mitchell .
That ’s quite a conservative group , all on the right side of the caucus .
I do n’t think Kucinich ’s announcement really sways any of them ; Kirkpatrick , a freshman from a swing district , would actually do more .
And as I ’ve said repeatedly , it ’s the Stupak bloc , or members from it who split off , who will ultimately be in the position to decide this thing .
Chris Bowers has the same number , 8 votes away .
Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday she would " many times over liberate " Iraq again , but she regretted the Bush administration failed to work closer with Iraqis to rebuild the war - torn country .
Rice , speaking at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , said she believed history would eventually vindicate many of the decisions made during the presidency of George W. Bush .
" I would many times over liberate Iraq again from Saddam Hussein , " Rice said .
" I think he was a danger to the Middle East . "
However , she suggested the U.S. government failed to understand " how broken Iraq was as a society " and should have focused its rebuilding efforts outside of Baghdad , the capital .
" We tried to rebuild Iraq from Baghdad out , and we really should have rebuilt Iraq from outside Baghdad in , " she said .
" We should have worked with the tribes , worked in the provinces , " she said , adding that smaller projects should have been favored over big ones .
" That 's something that in retrospect that we finally got right " several years after the 2003 invasion .
" And it 's one reason I think Iraq has a chance . "
Rice served Bush as national security adviser and later as America 's chief diplomat .
She now is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution public policy research group at Stanford University .
She is en route to the Chinese island of Hainan for the Boao Forum , an annual conference where executives hobnob with global leaders , early next month .
A decade ago , Oldsmobile went .
Last year , Pontiac .
Saturn , Saab , and Hummer were discontinued .
A thousand GM dealerships shut down .
To those who grew up in a “ GM family , ” where buying a Chrysler was like converting to Islam , what happened to GM was deeply saddening .
Yet the amputations had to be done – or GM would die .
And the same may be about to happen to the American Imperium .
Its birth can be traced to World War II , when America put 16 million men in uniform and sent millions across the seas to crush Nazi Germany and Japan .
After V - E and V - J Day , the boys came home .
But with the Stalinization of half of Europe , the fall of China , and war in Korea came NATO and alliances with Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , the Philippines , Thailand , Pakistan , and Australia that lasted through the Cold War .
In 1989 , however , the Cold War ended dramatically with the fall of the Berlin Wall , the retirement of the Red Army from Europe , the breakup of the Soviet Union , and Beijing ’s abandonment of world communist revolution .
Overnight , our world changed .
But America did not change .
As Russia shed her alliances and China set out to capture America ’s markets , Uncle Sam soldiered on .
We clung to the old alliances and began to add new allies .
NATO war guarantees were distributed like credit cards to member states of the old Warsaw Pact and former republics of the Soviet Union .
We invaded Panama and Haiti , smashed Iraq , liberated Kuwait , intervened in Somalia and Bosnia , bombed Serbia , and invaded Iraq again – and Afghanistan .
Now we prepare for a new war – on Iran .
Author Laurence Vance has inventoried America ’s warfare state .
We spend more on defense than the next 10 nations combined .
Our Navy exceeds in firepower the next 13 navies combined .
We have 100,000 troops in Iraq , 100,000 in Afghanistan or headed there , 28,000 in Korea , over 35,000 in Japan , and 50,000 in Germany .
By the Department of Defense ’s “ Base Structure Report , ” there are 716 U.S. bases in 38 countries .
Chalmers Johnson , who has written books on this subject , claims DOD is minimizing the empire .
He discovered some 1,000 U.S. facilities , many of them secret and sensitive .
And according to DOD ’s “ Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country , ” U.S. troops are now stationed in 148 countries and 11 territories .
Estimated combined budgets for the Pentagon , two wars , foreign aid to allies , 16 intelligence agencies , scores of thousands of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan , and our new castle - embassies : $ 1 trillion a year .
While this worldwide archipelago of bases may have been necessary when we confronted a Sino - Soviet bloc spanning Eurasia from the Elbe to East China Sea , armed with thousands of nuclear weapons and driven by imperial ambition and ideological hatred of us , that is history now .
It is preposterous to argue that all these bases are essential to our security .
Indeed , our military presence , our endless wars , and our support of despotic regimes have made America , once the most admired of nations , almost everywhere resented and even hated .
Liquidation of this empire should have begun with the end of the Cold War .
Now it is being forced upon us by the deficit - debt crisis .
Like GM , we ca n’t kick this can up the road any more , because we have come to the end of the road .
Republicans will fight new taxes .
Democrats will fight to save social programs .
Which leaves the American empire as the logical lead cow for the butcher ’s knife .
Indeed , how do conservatives justify borrowing hundreds of billions yearly from Europe , Japan , and the Gulf states – to defend Europe , Japan , and the Arab Gulf states ?
Is it not absurd to borrow hundreds of billion annually from China – to defend Asia from China ?
Is it not a symptom of senility to borrow from all over the world in order to defend that world ?
In their Mount Vernon declaration of principles , conservatives called the Constitution their guiding star .
But did not the author of that constitution , James Madison , warn us that wars are the death of republics ?
Under Bush II , conservatives , spurning the wisdom of their fathers , let themselves be seduced , neo - conned into enlisting in a Wilsonian crusade that had as its declared utopian goal “ ending tyranny in our world . ”
How could conservatives whose defining virtue is prudence and who pride themselves on following the lamp of experience have been taken into camp by the hustlers and hucksters of empire ?
Yet , now that Barack Obama has embraced neo-socialism , Republicans are about to be given a second chance .
And just as Rahm Emanuel said liberal Democrats should not let a financial crisis go to waste , but exploit it to ram through their agenda , the Right should use the opportunity of the fiscal crisis to take an ax to the warfare state .
Ron Paul ’s victory at CPAC may be a sign the prodigal sons of the Right are casting off the heresy of neoconservatism and coming home to first principles .

Here ’s a funny news item , courtesy of Ed Brayton ’s Dispatches from the Culture Wars .
Joe Kovacs , the executive director of the Christian news website World Net Daily , has penned a column arguing that Easter has roots in paganism .
So , in addition to revealing that he is clueless about his own religious holidays ( he ’s only figuring this out now ? ) , he also displays a stunning lack of consistency :
The very first commandment of the Big Ten is perhaps one of the most overlooked in everyday life .
In just eight words , it states : “ Thou shalt have no other gods before me ” ( Exodus 20:3 ) .
Sounds simple enough .
Christians would never put another god in front of the true God who made the universe — right ?
Wrong .
Most Christians , whether knowingly or unknowingly , violate this very first commandment of God each year by placing before God the actual name of a pagan goddess of fertility and the dawn .
In case you have n’t figured it out by now , her name is — believe it or not — “ Easter . ”
That ’s correct , folks .
The word “ Easter ” is actually the name of an ancient , heathen goddess who represents fertility , springtime , and the dawn .
Some of her symbols are flowers , bunnies , eggs , the sun and the moon .
Who ’da thunk ?
What makes this so funny is that World Net Daily has long been one of the loudest defenders battling against the mythical “ War on Christmas . ”
Just a few months ago , folks there were accusing the ACLU and secular retailers of attempting to kill Christmas .
Now , the executive editor is trying to kill Easter .
Someone really needs to point out to Kovacs that this Christmas holiday that he so staunchly defends each year has pagan roots too .
The Prince allegedly hit the officer at Buckingham Palace
Detectives are investigating an incident in which Prince Andrew allegedly struck a police officer while driving into Buckingham Palace .
The Duke of York reportedly struck a uniformed officer as the policeman tried to move two Japanese tourists out of the way of the Prince 's 4x4 car .
The officer is said to have hurt his arm in the incident on 5 February and made a complaint to his superiors .
A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed the accident was being investigated .
A police spokesman said : " A uniformed officer was involved in a collision with a vehicle whilst on duty on Constitution Hill and sustained minor injuries to his arm .
" The circumstances of the collision are now being examined . "
' Health and safety '
The officer has since returned to work at the palace .
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman described it as a " health and safety matter " adding : " The Metropolitan Police are investigating .
" The Duke of York is currently in Mexico - he has been in Panama and Mexico for the past week in his role as UK trade commissioner . "
Prince Andrew is known for his love of cars , having owned a Bentley Arnage and an Aston Martin convertible .
In 2002 he was caught speeding near Heathrow Airport .

( CNN ) --
When Olympic skier Chirine Njeim tells people she 's from Lebanon , they often laugh in disbelief .
Now at the Vancouver Winter Games , and competing alongside two other athletes from her home country , Njeim still has to convince people she 's telling the truth .
" A coach from another country asked me in the elevator the other day where I was from .
I said , ' Lebanon ' and he just started laughing , " Njeim , who is competing in the Ladies Giant Slalom Wednesday , told CNN .
" I think people think of Lebanon as a desert with sand and camels , but nobody thinks of it as a place that has snow ...
He was shocked .
He just laughed at me ... " she said .
Little did that coach know , there has long been downhill skiing in Lebanon -- and world - class ski resorts to boot .
" Skiing in Lebanon is very popular , " explained Ezzad Kraytem , Secretary General of Lebanon 's Olympic Committee .
" The slopes are only 20 minutes away from the coast , so you can go to the beach and ski in the same day . "
That means there 's a clear view of the Mediterranean Sea from the slopes of Mount Lebanon on most days , according to Kraytem .
Lebanon currently boasts six resorts :
The Cedars at Mount Makmel is the largest , while Farya Mzaar is the favored destination of the jet - set ( it 's also where Njeim got her start aged three ) .
Two of the resorts are members - only private mountains .
And an expensive seventh resort is in the works , according to Ronald Sayegh , ofSki Lebanon .
" The quality of the snow is one of the main reasons professional skiers love our slopes .
Powdery on the surface and hard underneath , " explained Joanne Zarife , a manager at the five - star Intercontinental hotel at Mzaar .
Even though the slopes face north , preserving the snow , the region 's sunshine makes the air mild , even warm , she told CNN .
" The terraces at the bottom are constantly filled with apres - skiers enjoying a cold drink under the tanning sun , " said Zarife .
" Skiing is getting more and more popular , [ there is ] more international tourism , " said Sayegh .
" More political stability draws more people here . "
A lot of expats living in the region come back to ski , Lebanese locally come , Europeans , Australians and South Africans ... " he said .
" A lot more people now know there 's beautiful skiing in Lebanon , " said Njeim .
Last year a record 50,000 people visited the country 's ski resorts , according to Tony Khoury , President of the Lebanese Ski Federation and Head of the Lebanese Olympic Delegation at Vancouver .
At more than 3,000 meters , the peaks of Lebanon 's tallest skiing mountains at The Cedars resort top the highest point of the Whistler Blackcomb resort ( 2,284 meters approximately ) , one of the main venues of the Vancouver Games .
Skiing only came to Lebanon in the 1930s though , brought by a student returning from Switzerland where he had developed a passion for the sport at school .
In the 1950s , the sport 's appeal really opened up , after chairlifts arrived .
And today it 's not just downhill skiing that draws the crowds .
From just ten snowboarders in 1991 , today anywhere from 30 to 60 percent of visitors are riders , according to Ski Lebanon .
Lebanon 's high , sunny plateaus also make it ideal for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing , they say .
Exposed to the best of country 's ski scene an early age , Njeim was quickly hooked .
As a child she would watch the sport on television and tell her friends that she wanted to race in the Olympics .
" People thought it was kind of hilarious , " Njeim recalled with fondness .
Can we know if our ancestors were Vikings ?
The short answer is yes , we can .
DNA testing may trace Viking background in our genetic makeup .
However , Nordic ancestry cannot be proven or disproven in all cases .
A few years ago , when I first got interested in genetic genealogy , I thought that there might be some sort of Norse gene that all Vikings transmitted to all their descendants as a heritage .
So you are either positive or negative for it .
However , it ’s not that simple .
This tutorial will explain it all about genes and genetic testing for those who ’d like to find out if they have Viking roots .

New guidelines are being issued to the NHS Maternity services for obese women are not good enough and may be putting mothers - to - be at risk , experts warn .
The Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries said units were short of basic equipment like extra - wide operating tables and beds .
Its poll of UK services also showed obese pregnant women were not getting the right advice and assessments .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said the UK remained " one of the safest countries in the world to have a baby " .
The Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries , an independent research group which is partly funded by the NHS , said it had teamed up with doctors to issue new guidelines to the NHS on treating obese mothers - to - be These cover issues such as what assessments , support and advice should be given to the women .
Obesity has gone up so fast that services are struggling to keep up
Dr Jo Modder , lead researcher
It has also asked services to ensure they have clear policies and the right resources in place .
Obese mothers - to - be are at higher risk of a wide variety of complications , including stillbirths , diabetes and pre-eclampsia .
They are also more likely to need caesareans and should therefore have assessments during pregnancy to see what special arrangements may have to be put in place .
But the survey , which gathered information from 320 maternity units as well as a range of other midwife and obstetric services that come into contact with pregnant women , showed only half of places always offered these assessments .
Only a third gave specific diet advice while 60 % of maternity units did not have central records of what equipment they had available .
And nearly half did not have official policies and guidelines for treating obese patients , the group said .
Rising rates
The findings come amid rising rates of obesity in pregnancy .
One in five mothers - to - be are obese - double the proportion from a decade ago .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Lead researcher Dr Jo Modder said the current standard of services could " potentially be putting women at risk " .
She added : " Obesity has gone up so fast that services are struggling to keep up .
I think services could be improved to provide more appropriate care . "
Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran , president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , which helped draw up the guidelines , agreed the NHS needed to do more .
But he added obese women also needed support to be encouraged to lead healthier lives before becoming pregnant .
" The long - term challenge is behavioural . "
Professor Cathy Warwick , of the Royal College of Midwives , said : " NHS trusts should be looking at what works and learning from each other to ensure the highest standards of care are available . "
The Department of Health spokeswoman said : " It 's vital that obese pregnant women are able to receive specialist advice , support and risk management throughout their pregnancy . "
But she stressed that the UK was one of the safest nations in which a woman could give birth .

I think it 's a non-issue for the most part , and that Apple and Microsoft are doing the right thing for the mass market by limiting multitask use for third party apps .
The irony here is that one of the biggest criticisms for years was Windows Mobile 's lack of a task manager and the ability to kill applications that were running .
Complaints were so high about multitasking that almost every phone shipped with some sort of third - party task manager .
Likewise , the first software I download for any Android device is a task manager to kill background tasks and apps
The reason is simple .
Running in the background , too many third - party apps overuse system resources , memory , and network to the point where almost any machine with multitasking capability ends up running slowly and killing battery life .
With fast suspend and resume of existing app processes there 's very little need for most third party apps to run as background processes , with a few notable exceptions .
It would be easy to simply dismiss third party apps running in the background , except there are two use cases that do matter .
First are music apps such as Pandora and Rhapsody .
I 'd love both of those apps to work on the background of my device and using those apps on Android and WebOS phones is a big differentiator .
Second , GPS and turn - by - turn direction programs both benefit from the ability to access GPS content while another app is running such as a navigation program .
There 's arguments for apps like Twitter as well but I think most of those use cases could easily be handled through things like notifications services to let me know something has happened .
What I 'd really like to see is Apple and Microsoft figure out some way to allow third parties to do multitasking and run in the background .
While it may not be a mass market case , there 's a lot of folks like me who want to be able to control this activity .
It really needs three aspects .
One , the ability for me to designate which applications I want to run as background tasks .
Second , an easy way ( as Palm has shown in WebOS ) to switch between them .
Finally , there needs to be a way to kill unneeded apps -- in particular , this is where Windows Mobile 6.x and Android fail , despite their multitasking capabilities .
Multitasking is far more important on the personal computer -- whose windowed UI and raw horsepower make it not just a luxury but a necessity -- and one way the personal computer trumps the phone .
That said , vendors need to address the mainstream use case of background media functions and location services for third parties to truly make their platforms valuable to users .
Longer term , the smart ones will let the power users make the call of performance and battery life for themselves .

Dharavi , Mumbai , where population density reaches 1 m people per square mile
In 1983 , architect Peter Calthorpe gave up on San Francisco , where he had tried and failed to organise neighbourhood communities , and moved to a houseboat in Sausalito , a town on the San Francisco Bay .
He ended up on South 40 Dock , where I also live , part of a community of 400 houseboats and a place with the densest housing in California .
Without trying , it was an intense , proud community , in which no one locked their doors .
Calthorpe looked for the element of design magic that made it work , and concluded it was the dock itself and the density .
Everyone who lived in the houseboats on South 40 Dock passed each other on foot daily , trundling to and from the parking lot on shore .
All the residents knew each other ’s faces and voices and cats .
It was a community , Calthorpe decided , because it was walkable .
Building on that insight , Calthorpe became one of the founders of the new urbanism , along with Andrés Duany , Elizabeth Plater - Zyberk and others .
In 1985 he introduced the concept of walkability in “ Redefining Cities , ” an article in the Whole Earth Review , an American counterculture magazine that focused on technology , community building and the environment .
Since then , new urbanism has become the dominant force in city planning , promoting high density , mixed use , walkability , mass transit , eclectic design and regionalism .
It drew one of its main ideas from the houseboat community .
There are plenty more ideas to be discovered in the squatter cities of the developing world , the conurbations made up of people who do not legally occupy the land they live on — more commonly known as slums .
One billion people live in these cities and , according to the UN , this number will double in the next 25 years .
There are thousands of them and their mainly young populations test out new ideas unfettered by law or tradition .
Alleyways in squatter cities , for example , are a dense interplay of retail and services — one - chair barbershops and three - seat bars interspersed with the clothes racks and fruit tables .
One proposal is to use these as a model for shopping areas .
“ Allow the informal sector to take over downtown areas after 6 pm , ” suggests Jaime Lerner , the former mayor of Curitiba , Brazil .
“ That will inject life into the city . ”
The reversal of opinion about fast - growing cities , previously considered bad news , began with The Challenge of …

LIONS AND CROCODILES WRESTLE OVER A FREAKING CALF THAT LIVES ! "
In 2007 , a Harvard law professor , Elizabeth Warren , urged the creation of a consumer financial protection agency to guard against abusive , unfair and deceptive lending practices .
Consolidates authority for protecting consumers , which is currently dispersed , into one free - standing Consumer Financial Protection Agency , with an independent director , appointed by the president .
Gives the new agency broad powers to write as well as enforce rules for banks , credit unions and other financial companies .
Exempts certain categories of businesses , including retailers and auto dealers , from the new agency ’s oversight .
Preserves the federal ability to pre-empt tougher state consumer protection laws under certain circumstances .
Nach­dem das Bun­des­ver­fas­sungs­ge­richt der Vor­rats­da­ten­spei­che­rung einen Rie­gel vor­ge­scho­ben hat , kom­men jetzt wie­der die beson­ders däm­li­chen Argu­men­te .
Eine schö­ne Samm­lung davon fin­det sich heu­te bei Welt Online .
Da wäre zunächst der Bund Deut­scher Kri­mi­nal­be­am­ter , BDK , des­sen Vor­sit­zen­der fol­gen­des arti­ku­liert :
Der Vor­sit­zen­de des Bun­des Deut­scher Kri­mi­nal­be­am­ter , Klaus Jan­sen [ … ] mahn­te eine schnel­le Neu­re­ge­lung an . [ … ]
In zwei von drei Fäl­len sei die Poli­zei bei ihren Ermitt­lun­gen inzwi­schen auf Vor­rats­da­ten ange­wie­sen .
sag­te Klaus Jan­sen .
In der „ Pas­sau­er Neu­en Pres­se “ ergänz­te er : Es müs­se nun schnell ein Gesetz auf den Weg gebracht wer­den , „ das uns als Kri­mi­na­lis­ten wie­der hand­lungs­fä­hig macht “ .
Herr Jan­sen hat offen­sicht­lich nicht den Fun­ken einer Ahnung , über was er da her­um­schwa­dro­niert .
Ich fän­de es jeden­falls ver­wun­der­lich bis besorg­nis­er­re­gend , wenn die Poli­zei bei zwei Drit­tel aller Ermitt­lun­gen auf Daten zugreift , die laut Ver­fü­gung des Bun­des­ver­fas­sungs­ge­richts nur „ mit Geneh­mi­gung eines Ermitt­lungs­rich­ters und im Zusam­men­hang mit schwe­ren Straf­ta­ten ” ver­wen­det wer­den dür­fen – zumal auch dann nur , wenn „ ein durch Tat­sa­chen begrün­de­ter Ver­dacht vor­liegt , und ande­re Ermitt­lungs­mög­lich­kei­ten wesent­lich erschwert oder aus­sichts­los sind . ”
( Zita­te : Wiki­pe­diaar­ti­kel „ Vor­rats­da­ten­spei­che­rung ” )
Über­trof­fen wird die­se Ein­las­sung noch durch die Nicht­ar­gu­men­te des Vor­sit­zen­den der Gewerk­schaft der Poli­zei :

Bei Herrn Frei­berg ist offen­sicht­lich das Raum - Zeit - Kon­ti­nu­um in gehö­ri­ge Unord­nung gera­ten .
Wie sonst kann er den Zugriff auf die soge­nann­te „ Sauer­land­grup­pe ” am 4 .
Sep­tem­ber 2007 als Argu­ment für die Vor­rats­da­ten­spei­che­rung brin­gen , die doch erst am 1 .
Janu­ar 2008 gestar­tet ist .
Das ist dumm , dreist und in höchs­tem Maße ver­lo­gen .
Tat­säch­lich wäre das näm­lich ein schla­gen­des Argu­ment dafür , dass sich auch Ter­ro­ris­ten auf­de­cken las­sen , ohne dass man zur Gene­ral­über­wa­chung der Bevöl­ke­rung grei­fen muss .
Die Her­ren Poli­zei­funk­tio­nä­re argu­men­tie­ren arro­gant und fak­ten­be­freit .
Man kann dies nicht laut und häu­fig genug sagen .
Die in dem Welt - Arti­kel eben­falls zitier­te Jus­tiz­mi­nis­te­rin hat da schon ganz recht :

The recent allocation of the 1.0.0.0/8 and 27.0.0.0 / 8 not only triggered a lot of media attention due to IP v4 exhaustion exceeding the 90 % mark , it also sparked the curiosity of many technical folks .
Specifically the NANOG mailing list triggered quite a lively discussion about the allocation of 1.0.0.0/8 ( http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2010-January/017402.html ) .
History
1.0.0.0/8 ( 1/8 ) was reserved by IANA since 1981 .
Since then is has been used unofficially as example addresses , default configuration parameters or pseudo - private address space .
The most prominent unauthorised use of 1/8 is anoNet.
anoNet is a decentralised peer - to - peer network that allows users to anonymously share content .
It uses 1 / 8 in order to hide the real IP address of its users .
Up until 22 January 2010 an article about anoNet on Wikipedia stated :
" To avoid addressing conflict with the internet itself , the range 1.0.0.0 / 8 is used .
This is to avoid conflicting with internal networks such as 10/8 , 172.16/12 and 192.168/16 , as well as assigned Internet ranges .
In the event that 1.0.0.0/8 is assigned by IANA , anoNet could move to the next unassigned / 8 , though such an event is unlikely , as 1.0.0.0/ 8 has been reserved since September 1981 . " ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnoNet )
Only recently , in 2008 , 1/8 was moved from " the IANA reserved " to the " IANA unallocated " pool of addresses .
In January 2010 it was finally allocated to APNIC in order to be distributed to Local Internet Registries in the Asia - Pacific region .
Announcing in 1/
8
As part of APNIC 's debogonising effort , carried out by the RIPE NCC upon their request , a number of prefixes out of the 1/8 range were announced from one of the RIS Remote Route Collectors ( rrc03.ripe.net ) :
1.255.0.0/16
1.50.0.0/22
1.2.3.0/24
1.1.1.0/24
Of course 1/8 was never expected to be a " clean " prefix .
In fact various prefixes out of 1/8 have been announced in the past 3 months , as seen by the RIPE NCC RIS tools .
For instance , 1.1.1.0/24 was withdrawn just a few days before the RIS announced it as part of the debogonising effort .
Nevertheless , what we saw just minutes after 1.1.1.0/24 was announced on the morning of 27 January , 2010 was more than surprising :
The RIS RRC from which we announced 1.1.1.0/24 has connections to AMS - IX , NL - IX and GN - IX .
The above image shows the incoming traffic on the AMS - IX port ( 10 MBit ) , which was instantly maxed out , mostly by traffic coming towards 1.1.1.1 .
The AMS - IX sflow graphs suggested that all together our peers were trying to send us more than 50 MBit /s of traffic .
Most of this traffic was dropped due to the 10 MBit limit of our AMS - IX port :
# ping 1.1.1.1 PING 1.1.1.1 ( 1.1.1.1 ) : 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 64 bytes from 1.1.1.1 : icmp_seq=3 ttl=62 time=19.267 ms
Request timeout for icmp_seq 4 64 bytes from 1.1.1.1 : icmp_seq=5 ttl=62 time=20.503 ms
Request timeout for icmp_seq 6
( Note : We are not announcing 1.1.1.0/24 anymore .
Therfore 1.1.1.1 is not pingable at the moment ! )
The NL - IX port ( 100 Mbit ) also showed some excess traffic ( about 3 MBit on average ) .
The GN - IX port did not see any significant increase .
The outbound traffic is routed through the RIPE NCC networks and showed an increase of 5 - 6 MBit .
The network run on the RRC is designed to collect BGP routing data rather than actually route any traffic .
Therefore these numbers are just an indication of what might happen when these prefixes are announced in a high capacity network with multiple transit providers .
The Traffic
Although the AMS - IX port of the RRC was already maxed out by announcing 1.1.1.0 / 24 , we still decided to do some traffic analysis .
These measurements have to be taken with a grain of salt since we had no way of telling what kind of traffic was dropped before it could reach the RRC .
For that reason we also decided not to include transfer rates in these measurements .
We can however present a good indication of what kind of traffic is generated in the 1/8 space .
To get an idea of the stability of the traffic pattern we collected 100,000 packets every 30 minutes over a period of 12 hours on 28 January 2010 .
We found that the distribution is fairly stable over time , with UDP being the predominant type of traffic .
Furthermore we analysed a sample of 100,000 packets collected at 10:00 on 28 .
January 2010 in more detail .
Almost 90 % of the packets that we analysed were sent towards 1.1.1.1 .
Approximately 4 % was sent towards 1.2.3.4 .
Other addresses out of 1.1.1.0/24 are following .
We found that almost 60 % of the UDP packets are sent towards the IP address 1.1.1.1 on port 15206 which makes up the largest amount of packets seen by our RRC .
Most of these packets start their data section with 0x80 , continue with seemingly random data and are padded to 172 bytes with an ( again seemingly random ) 2 byte value .
Some sources ( http://www.proxyblind.org/trojan.shtml ) list the port as being used by a trojan called " KiLo " , however information about it seem sparse .
Another big portion of the packets sent towards 1.1.1.1 uses UDP port 2427 and 2727 , which are part of the " Media Gateway Protocol " .
All of these packets seems to originate from one telecommunications provider and can probably be attributed to misconfigured VoIP equipment .
Almost 50 % of the TCP packets were attempted HTTP connections on port 80 .
A small proportion of those packets , however , was seen as " established " HTTP connections , in particular HTTP POST requests .
Some research showed that those requests looked very similar to the ones used by an Asian online game .
Since the RRC is not running a webserver and should therefore not see any established HTTP connections , this can most likely be attributed to a bug in an HTTP client .
Withdrawing 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.2.3.0/24
Since the traffic patterns seemed to be stable we decided to withdraw the announcement of 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.2.3.0/24 on 2 February 2010 .
This was necessary in order to keep the debogon addresses pingable and to ensure overall smooth operation of the RRC .
Shortly after withdrawing the announcements the traffic at our AMS - IX port dropped to the regular 2 Mbit again .
Conclusion
We can certainly conclude from this that specific blocks in 1/8 such as 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.2.3.0/24 are extremely polluted .
Unless the traffic sent towards those blocks is significantly reduced they might be unusable in a production environment .
Although the limited capacity in our setup did not allow us to record accurate real - world numbers in terms of transfer rates and traffic - types , we were able to get a good indication of where the largest problems lie .
In order to collect real - world data the experiment would have to be repeated on a high - capacity network that more accurately resembles real - world scenarios in terms of transit providers and peering agreements .
We would like to hear your opinion on this subject :
Do you have any experience with this kind of traffic ?
What should be done to reduce it ?
Would further research on this subject be useful ?

Advertisement A mine laid by North Korea during the 1950 - 53 Korean
War may have caused the blast which sank a warship from the South on Friday , Seoul says .
South Korean Defence Minister Kim Tae - young said the North had placed thousands of mines during the conflict - and not all of them had been cleared .
Rescuers saved 58 crew from the Cheonan and are still hunting for 46 more sailors believed to have been trapped .
Divers who reached the ship on the sea floor reported no signs of life .
Seoul has played down suggestions that Pyongyang could have deliberately sunk the ship , although Mr Kim said the possibility would be investigated .
He told a parliamentary meeting that the North had placed some 4,000 mines in its waters during the 1950 - 53 war .
He said most had been removed but " it must have been impossible to retrieve them all " .
He added : " It is possible that a North Korean sea mine could have drifted into our area . "
Another suggested cause of the sinking is that there was an accidental explosion on board .
Pyongyang has made no official comment on the incident .
' Leave no doubt '
The 1,200 - tonne Cheonan naval patrol vessel sank near the disputed maritime border with the North , known as the Northern Limit Line .
Rescue officials said an explosion broke the ship into two pieces .
Some 58 crewmen were saved , and the authorities had hoped the other 46 were trapped in underwater air pockets in the wreckage .
Distraught relatives have been demanding answers from officials
But earlier on Monday , navy divers tapped on the stern of the Cheonan and heard no response .
" Divers went underwater several times , working in a very limited time of about seven to eight minutes each time , but failed to find any survivors , " said a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Lee Ki-shik .
South Korea 's official Yonhap news agency quoted officials as saying parts of the ship were able to shut out water for a maximum of 69 hours .
Two dozen military vessels , with air support , were involved in the search , said Yonhap .
A US rescue vessel , with more than a dozen divers on board , has also joined the operation .
Relatives of those missing have angrily demanded progress and answers from officials .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak earlier urged rescuers not to give up hope of finding survivors and urged officials to investigate the incident thoroughly .
South Korea recognises the Northern Limit Line , drawn unilaterally by the US - led United Nations Command to demarcate the sea border at the end of the Korean War .
But it has never been accepted by North Korea , and the area has been the scene of deadly clashes between the navies of the two Koreas in the past .

Racism and refusal to evacuate alongside support for a democratic system of government – these are the jumbled sentiment of Israel 's high school students , according to a recent poll .
They support a democratic form of government , but more than half of them believe that Arabs should not be allowed to vote in Knesset elections .
One out of every six students would not want to study in the same class with an Ethiopian or an immigrant from the former Soviet Union , and 21 % of them think that " Death to Arabs " is a legitimate expression .
Rally Israeli Arabs : State 's racism will lead to ' explosion '
Sharon Roffe - Ofir
Tens of thousands , including a number of Jews , mark ninth anniversary of October riots amid general strike in Arab sector .
' Zionist regime will pay a heavy , bloody price , ' Tali Fahima says .
MK Tibi :
We 'll triumph over racism Israeli Arabs : State 's racism will lead to ' explosion '
The students were asked questions regarding their viewpoints on the IDF and insubordination .
Some 91 % of secular high school students said they want to enlist in the IDF , versus 77 % of religious students .
Eighty - one percent of the religious students said they would refuse orders to evacuate outposts and settlements in the West Bank , versus 36 % of secular students .
Overall , 43 % of the students polled said they would refuse orders .
The teens were asked about the rights of Arab Israelis .
Here , too , there was a gap in the opinions of religious and secular students .
While 82 % of religious students responded that they do n't believe Arabs should be granted equal rights as Jews , 36 % percent of seculars responded that they do not believe in equal rights for Arabs and Jews .
Overall , 46 % students believe there should not be equality between Jewish and Arab citizens of the State of Israel .
The poll showed that many students believe the phrase " Death to Arabs " is racist , and , therefore , not legitimate .
Forty - five percent of religious students and 16 % of secular students , however , believe it is a legitimate statement .
Some 82 % of the religious students believe Arab Israelis should not be allowed to vote in Knesset elections , versus 47 % of seculars .
Overall , 56 % of the high school students polled believe Arabs should not be allowed to vote .
Students were asked if they would be willing to have an Arab friend who is the same sex and age as they are .
Out of the religious students polled , 81 % said they would not be willing , versus 23 % of secular students who would not want to have an Arab friend .
Overall , 32 % of students said they would not want to have an Arab friend .
' Do n't want immigrants in our class '
The poll showed that secular high school students tend to be more willing to accept immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union .
When asked if they would want Ethiopian students to study in the same class as them , 16 % of secular students and 23 % of religious students answered in the negative .
When asked about their willingness to study with a classmate from the former Soviet Union , 12 % of secular students answered that they would not , versus 32 % of religious students .
Regarding their opinions on the character of Israel 's government , the students were asked which type of government they would prefer .
Eighty percent chose democracy ; 16 % chose dictatorship ; and 4 % responded that they did not know .
Seventy - five percent of Jewish students , versus 64 % of Arab students think Israel is considered a democratic country .
Some 20 % of Arab students responded that they believe it is legitimate to forcefully oppose government policies to which they are opposed – about two times the percentage of Jewish students who believe so .
In the political sphere , the teenagers ( 38 % ) responded that there preferred prime minister is Benjamin Netanyahu .
Next in line were Tzipi Livni with 24 % , Shimon Peres – 19 % , Avigdor Lieberman – 13 % , and Ehud Barak – 6 % .
The survey was conducted by the Maagar Mochot research institute on 536 youth between the ages of 15 and 18 from the Jewish and Arab sectors on the topic of today 's youth and the face of tomorrow 's Israel .
Programs do more and more scientific work - but you need to be able to check them as well as the original data , as the recent row over climate change documentation shows
One of the spinoffs from the emails and documents that were leaked from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia is the light that was shone on the role of program code in climate research .
There is a particularly revealing set of " README " documents that were produced by a programmer at UEA apparently known as " Harry " .
The documents indicate someone struggling with undocumented , baroque code and missing data – this , in something which forms part of one of the three major climate databases used by researchers throughout the world .
Many climate scientists have refused to publish their computer programs .
I suggest is that this is both unscientific behaviour and , equally importantly , ignores a major problem : that scientific software has got a poor reputation for error .
There is enough evidence for us to regard a lot of scientific software with worry .
For example Professor Les Hatton , an international expert in software testing resident in the Universities of Kent and Kingston , carried out an extensive analysis of several million lines of scientific code .
He showed that the software had an unacceptably high level of detectable inconsistencies .
For example , interface inconsistencies between software modules which pass data from one part of a program to another occurred at the rate of one in every seven interfaces on average in the programming language Fortran , and one in every 37 interfaces in the language C .
This is hugely worrying when you realise that just one error — just one — will usually invalidate a computer program .
What he also discovered , even more worryingly , is that the accuracy of results declined from six significant figures to one significant figure during the running of programs .
Hatton and other researchers ' work indicates that scientific software is often of poor quality .
What is staggering about the research that has been done is that it examines commercial scientific software – produced by software engineers who have to undergo a regime of thorough testing , quality assurance and a change control discipline known as configuration management .
By contrast scientific software developed in our universities and research institutes is often produced by scientists with no training in software engineering and with no quality mechanisms in place and so , no doubt , the occurrence of errors will be even higher .
The Climate Research Unit 's " Harry ReadMe " files are a graphic indication of such working conditions , containing as they do the outpouring of a programmer 's frustrations in trying to get sets of data to conform to a specification .
Computer code is also at the heart of a scientific issue .
One of the key features of science is deniability : if you erect a theory and someone produces evidence that it is wrong , then it falls .
This is how science works : by openness , by publishing minute details of an experiment , some mathematical equations or a simulation ; by doing this you embrace deniability .
This does not seem to have happened in climate research .
Many researchers have refused to release their computer programs — even though they are still in existence and not subject to commercial agreements .
An example is Professor Mann 's initial refusal to give up the code that was used to construct the 1999 " hockey stick " model that demonstrated that human - made global warming is a unique artefact of the last few decades .
( He did finally release it in 2005 . )
The situation is by no means bad across academia .
A number of journals , for example those in the area of economics and econometrics , insist on an author lodging both the data and the programs with the journal before publication .
There 's also an object lesson in a landmark piece of mathematics : the proof of the four colour conjecture by Apel and Haken .
They proved a longstanding hypothesis which suggested - but had never been able to show and so elevate to a theory - that in any map , the regions can be coloured using at most four colours so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour .
Their proof was controversial in that instead of an elegant mathematical exposition , they partly used a computer program .
Their work was criticised for inelegance , but it was correct and the computer program was published for checking .
The problem of large - scale scientific computing and the publication of data is being addressed by organisations and individuals that have signed up to the idea of the fourth paradigm .
This was the idea of Jim Grey , a senior researcher at Microsoft , who identified the problem well before Climategate .
There is now a lot of research and development work going into mechanisms whereby the web can be used as a repository for scientific publications , and more importantly the computer programs and the huge amount of data that they use and generate .
A number of workers are even devising systems that show the progress of a scientific idea from first thoughts to the final published papers .
The problems with climate research will do doubt provide an impetus for this work to be accelerated .
So , if you are publishing research articles that use computer programs , if you want to claim that you are engaging in science , the programs are in your possession and you will not release them then I would not regard you as a scientist ; I would also regard any papers based on the software as null and void .
I find it sobering to realise that a slip of a keyboard could create an error in programs that will be used to make financial decisions which involve billions of pounds and , moreover , that the probability of such errors is quite high .
But of course the algorithms ( known as Gaussian copula functions ) that the banks used to assume that they could create risk - free bonds from sub - prime loans has now been published ( http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all).
That was pretty expensive .
Climate change is expensive too .
We really do need to be sure that we 're not getting any of our sums wrong - whether too big or small - there as well .

Steve Jobs held a town hall meeting with Apple employees late last week following the iPad launch .
Wired reports on what was said at the meeting by Steve Jobs .
Two of the biggest topics included Google and Adobe .
On Google , Jobs confirms the much - reported competition between the two companies .
On Google :
We did not enter the search business , Jobs said .
They entered the phone business .
Make no mistake they want to kill the iPhone .
We wo n't let them , he says .
As for Adobe , Jobs said they are lazy and Jobs blames Adobe for a buggy implementation of Flash on the Mac as one of the reasons they wo n't support it .
Apple does not support
Flash because it is so buggy , he says .
Whenever a Mac crashes more often than not it 's because of Flash .
No one will be using Flash , he says .
The world is moving to HTML5 .
Those are the main points covered by Wired 's article .
We had received a more detailed report of the Apple meeting , but had n't been able to corroborate it until now .
Many of the details of the Wired report were identical to our anonymous submission , so we believe it to be accurate .
Some additional key points that we learned :
- Apple will deliver aggressive updates to iPhone that Android / Google wo n't be able to keep up with
- iPad is up there with the iPhone and Mac as the most important products Jobs has been a part of
- Regarding the Lala acquisition , Apple was interested in bringing those people into the iTunes team
- Next iPhone coming is an A+ update
- New Macs for 2010 are going to take Apple to the next level
- Blu -Ray software is a mess , and Apple will wait until sales really start to take off before implementing it .
No mail on Saturdays :
The first step
The U.S. Postal Service wants to end Saturday delivery in an effort to save $ 3 billion a year .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Saturday mail could be one step closer to cancellation when the United States Postal Service submits an official proposal to a government regulatory board on Tuesday to eliminate six - day delivery .
A new five - day delivery schedule could save the cash - strapped Post Office $ 3 billion annually , the agency said .
Earlier this month , USPS said it plans to incur about $ 238 billion in losses in the next 10 years if it does n't revamp its outdated business model .
" Every day , every month , every year this gets delayed , we end up further in the hole , " said USPS Deputy Postmaster Patrick Donahoe at a Monday briefing in New York .
Donahoe said a service cut would result in the loss of about 40,000 full - time jobs .
About 600,000 workers currently work for the Post Office .
The Post Office hopes to drop Saturday mail in its next fiscal year , which starts Oct. 1 . But first , it has to jump through a series of regulatory hoops that could take much longer .
Although it's an independent government agency and does not receive taxpayer dollars , USPS is overseen by the Postal Regulatory Commission , a separate government agency with five commissioners appointed by the president .
Ruth Goldway , chairwoman of the commission , said that once the board receives the proposal , it will open the issue to public comments and hold hearings throughout the country .
Those reviews take time -- usually between six and nine months -- and it wo n't be an easy road for the Post Office to make the change , she added .
Along the way , the Post Office will face questions about job cuts and opposition from unions .
Finally , Congress would have to approve the 5 - day schedule , since the current schedule is mandated by federal law .
Postmaster General John Potter warned of possible service cuts in testimony before a Senate subcommitee last year .
Just weeks later , Rep. Sam Graves , R - Mo. , proposed a bill that urges USPS to continue its 6 - day delivery schedule .
The bill garnered the support of 49 co-sponsors and was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in February 2009 , but has n't moved since .
Earlier this month , Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , expressed skepticism over the proposal to cut Saturday mail .
Collins is the ranking member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee , which has oversight of the U.S. Postal Service .
Opposition from the four major postal unions will also pose challenges for USPS .
In a release earlier this month , the American Postal Workers Union warned that 5 - day delivery would begin a " death spiral " for the agency .
" In addition to thousands of jobs lost , there will undoubtedly be an erosion of confidence in the Postal Service 's ability to provide the services the public relies on , " said Myke Reid , the union 's legislative and political director .
In an effort to shrink its massive deficits , USPS has slashed more than 100,000 jobs in the last five years .
Earlier this month , the agency said it expects another 30,000 employees to retire this year .
The proposed 5 - day delivery schedule is only one part of a larger plan announced by USPS on March 2 .
The plan also calls for restructuring USPS 's timeline for prepaying retiree health benefits -- a cost - saving measure which would also require congressional approval .
A federal law passed in 2006 requires the Post Office to pay $ 5.5 billion into its prepaid retiree health benefits each year .
Changing to a " pay - as - you - go " system instead could save the agency as much as $ 3 billion each year , said Donahoe .
USPS posted a $ 3.8 billion loss in its 2009 fiscal year and mail volume was down 12.7 % for the year , a trend the agency expects to continue over the next decade as more consumers opt for online alternatives to " snail mail . "
Nanotubes are wire - like molecules billionths of a metre across Minuscule tubes coated with a chemical fuel can act as a power source with 100 times more electrical power by weight than conventional batteries .
As these nano - scale " fuses " burn , they drive an electrical current along their length at staggering speeds .
The never - before - seen phenomenon could lead to a raft of energy applications .
Researchers reporting in Nature Materials say that unlike normal batteries , the nanotubes never lose their stored energy if left to sit .
The team , led by Michael Strano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , coated their nanotubes - cylinders just billionths of a metre across - with a chemical fuel known as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine .
" One property that nanotubes have is that they conduct heat very , very well along their length , up to a hundred times faster than in metals , " Dr Strano told BBC News .
" We asked what would happen if you perform a chemical reaction near one of these , and the first thing we found is the nanotube will guide the reaction , accelerating it up to 10,000 times . "
The team used a laser or an electric spark to set off the reaction in a bundle of coated carbon nanotubes , filming the results using a high - speed camera .

But they also found that , through a mechanism that is still poorly understood , the process creates a useful voltage - a phenomenon they have dubbed " thermopower waves " .
Their nanotube bundles carry , gram for gram , up to 100 times as much energy as a standard lithium - ion battery .
Since just a tiny amount of energy is needed to start the reaction before it becomes self - sustaining , Dr Strano says it could be initiated in a small device with the energy in the push of a finger .
And unlike standard batteries , the stored energy would not leak away over time , and requires none of the toxic , non-renewable metals in many batteries .
The current implementation is for a one - time use , but Dr Strano says he believes the approach could be adapted to a system in which the fuel is doused over the nanotubes after the initial fuel supply is burned and converted into electrical energy .
" I 'm interested in the fuel cell concept , " he said .
" The conventional fuel cell has been around since the 1800s but corrosive fuels , catalytic deactivation and complexity have been a hurdle .
" From an engineering standpoint , thermopower waves could be a very simple alternative . "
For the team , however , the first task is to understand just what is going on in the nanotubes , whose mechanical and electrical properties continue to surprise researchers in a number of fields .
" What we 've discovered is more than just a replacement for batteries , " Dr Strano said .
" To our knowledge , it 's a new scientific area for research .
There are many , many questions about these waves : what their limits are what the applications might be . "

Despite a cold snap across much of the northern world , users of public transit systems in a number of cities took off their trousers for No Pants Day .
The event , which began in New York City in 2002 , sees participants with bare legs mingling with other passengers .
Organisers Improv Everywhere say 3,000 people took part in New York with more in 43 other cities in 16 countries .
The group says its mission is to cause " scenes of chaos and joy in public places " .
Participants were told to meet at a designated train station fully clothed before boarding and removing their trousers .
People are urged to keep a straight face , act normally and not acknowledge other people without trousers .
' Feeling of freedom '
One of the organisers in Washington , DC , said " there 's not really any point or any cause " to the event .
" We 're just trying to put smiles on people 's faces , " Bruce Witzenburg told the Washington Post .
With temperatures hovering around freezing in Edmonton , Canada , participant Sarah Jackson said she felt liberated by the event .
" People you know look around , they 're curious and interested and for some reason I feel incredibly comfortable in my underwear on the LRT , " she told CTV News .
On its website , Improv Everywhere said groups from Adelaide , Australia , to Zurich , Switzerland had organised their own No Pants Subway Rides .
During the course of a white person ’s education they will go through many phases including but not limited to : “ awkward , ” “ classic rock , ” and “ being really into a foreign country . ”
Of these phases , there is only one that all white people are required to go through before they can obtain their bachelor ’s degree .
It is known as “ Bob Marley . ”
Depending on the coolness of the white person , they can experience this stage anywhere between the sixth grade and their last year of college .
Regardless of when they went through this phase , every white person can tell you about the time when they had Legend on repeat .
If you wish to test this theory , go to any floor in a College Dorm and there is a 100 % chance you will find at least one Bob Marley poster .
It is also worth noting that white people tend get into smoking marijuana during this phase .
This is why all white people view the combination of the two as one of the most pleasurable experiences on earth .
But when white people really want to take it to the next level they will combine Bob Marley , Marijuana , a long weekend and some sort of notable outdoor location ( beach , cottage , or patio ) .
There are few activities on earth that are more appealing to white people .
The only acceptable reasons for declining participation are a prior engagement at a music festival or a commitment to go camping .
It ’s also worth noting that when talking to white people about Bob Marley there is no need to use his surname .
This is because all white people refer to him simply as “ Bob . ”
Since so many people are into Bob Marley , it is only natural for advanced white people to profess to only marginally liking Bob Marley ( note : it is impossible for a white person to outright dislike him ) .
Instead , these white people will claim to preferring more obscure artists like Burning Spear or Peter Tosh .
But be warned that a white person saying they like “ reggae ” what they really mean is “ reggae from 1965 - 1983 . ”
Under no circumstances should you ever bring a white person to a dancehall reggae concert , it will frighten them .
Note : if you are talking to a white person who is really into Bob Marley , has dreadlocks , and professes to be a Rastafarian , you should end the conversation immediately .
These people are of no value unless you need directions to a WTO protest or have questions about how bad a human can smell .

Authorities are investigating a package with white powder and an angry letter that referenced the health care legislation that was sent to Congressman Weiner 's Kew Gardens office today .
The letter said the Congressman should " drop dead " and complained about the historic health care legislation passed by Congress this week .
Preliminary field tests showed the white powder was harmless .
Such testing is routine to determine whether the substance is in any way hazardous .
It is being sent to a lab for further detailed testing as a precaution -- also common practice .
Most often , officials say , these letters are hoaxes .
Weiner 's fifth - floor office in a building on Kew Gardens Road was evacuated as were a doctor 's office and a law office on the same floor .
Nine people were inside Weiner 's office at the time .
The workers were decontaminated as a precaution .
In a statement , Weiner said his prime concern is the safety of his staff and others in the area .
" Earlier today an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter was delivered to my community office in Kew Gardens .
The NYPD was immediately alerted and have responded appropriately by sending a Haz - Mat team , " the statement read .
" My first priority is the safety of my staff and neighbors , and the authorities are currently taking steps to investigate and resolve the situation . "
The NYPD , the FBI and other emergency management officials responded as a precaution , spokesmen for the agencies say .
Weiner 's Kew Gardens office will be closed pending the completion of the investigation .
NYPD spokesman Marc Nell said the note was handwritten , contained white powder " and field tests conducted by the Emergency Service Unit determined the material to be non-hazardous . "
FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said the FBI was treating the case as a threat against the congressman .
" The communication in the letter could be deemed threatening .
It was related to the health care but would be inappropriate to say more at this time . "
The package sent to Weiner 's office , which was postmarked in New York , may be the latest in a series of threats directed against Democratic Congress members who voted to overhaul the U.S. health care system .
At least four Democratic offices in New York , Arizona and Kansas were struck and at least 10 members of Congress have reported some sort of threats , including obscenity - laced phone messages , congressional leaders have said .
No arrests have been reported .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday condemned vandalism and threats against members of Congress who voted to overhaul the U.S. health care system .
Republicans joined in , telling people to calm down and saying they too were being targeted in an increasingly venomous political atmosphere .
" I do n't want this to be a distraction " to the work of Congress , Pelosi said .
But she also asserted that such violence and threats of reprisal have " no place in a civil debate in our country " and must be rejected .
Her sentiments were echoed minutes later by House Republican leader John Boehner , who said that while many are angry over the health care measure , " threats and violence should not be part of a political debate . "
The House 's No. 3 Republican , Eric Cantor of Virginia , said at a brief news conference Thursday that someone fired a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond this week and he has received threatening e-mails .
Responding to Democrats who have accused Republicans of being too slow to condemn the attacks against lawmakers , he stressed that security threats are not a partisan issue .
" To use such threats as political weapons is reprehensible , " he said .
The actions against Democrats have included racial slurs thrown at black lawmakers , e-mail and phone death threats and bricks thrown through regional office windows .
Rep. Louise Slaughter , a New York Democrat and chairwoman of an influential House committee , said someone had left her a voice mail that used the word " snipers . "
On the Republican side , the office of Rep. Jean Schmidt of Ohio released a tape of a profanity - laced phone message in which the caller said Republicans were racists and , referring to an accident two years ago when Schmidt was hit by a car while jogging , said , " you should have broke your back , b... . "
Senate Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer told The Associated Press Thursday that there was " no evidence that annoying , harassing or threatening telephone calls or emails are coordinated .
Regrettably though , bloggers and twitters seem to feed off each other , leaving little room for creativity . "
At the news conference , Pelosi said it is " important for us to be able to express ourselves freely , not to diminish that in any way , but also to hit a standard that says some of the actions ... must be rejected . "
But the California Democrat also said she did not " subscribe to the theory that these acts sprang from the comments of my colleagues . "
The vandalism and threats surprised a researcher at a think tank that monitors extremist groups .
" I think it is astounding that we are seeing this wave of vigilantism , " said Mark Potok of the Alabama - based Southern Poverty Law Center .

Salinger belched as he rose from the table .
" The nectar of gassy release ! " he said , patting his sternum .
" It 's good for you .
Do it as often as you can . " " Even in public ?
" Salinger 's eyes widened .
" Especially in public !
How pleasant it would be if people burped instead of spoke .
Nature 's language carries more meaning than our inferior syntax .
Ah well .
Time to feed my babies !
" Salinger turned quickly and dashed outside before I could finish my raw beets and turnip cubes .
I threw down the burlap napkin and chased after him .
For an old man , Salinger was spry .
Salinger raised his hands , wiggling his fingers .
He looked to the sky and began chanting .
" Lobsang Gyalwa Tsedzin Bodhisattva Gyaltsen ! " he repeated several times .
" Fill the air with your conquerors !
Eternal adamantine nature !
Bring forward your feathered prophets !
" As if on cue , at least a dozen birds appeared , flapping around Salinger 's head .
Robins , starlings , finches , and a few crows , who kept their distance .
" Take my seed ! "
Salinger instructed .
" Excuse me ? " " My seed !
In that barrel to your left .
Scoop up a healthy serving .
My babies are starving .
" An old Maxwell House can lay atop the barrel .
I lifted the lid , sank the can into the seed , and pulled out an ample portion .
" Now , pour the seed into my mouth , then dump the rest on my head .
Hurry man !
" I followed Salinger 's orders , fighting off the hungry birds .
His large mouth held most of the can 's contents , the remaining third sprinkled over his silver mane .
I stepped back and watched in silent wonder .
The birds chirped and squawked , pecking furiously at Salinger 's mouth and through his hair .
But this was no Hitchcockian nightmare .
Salinger stood completely still , becoming a human birdfeeder .
Not even the splatter of bird shit rattled him .
It remains one of the most serene sights I 've ever witnessed .
The birds finished and flew off .
The crows stared , cawed , then left as well .
Salinger spat out some stray red and yellow pellets , fell to his knees and began sobbing . "
You okay ?
" Salinger stared up at me , tears streaking the bird shit on his cheek .
" This is what it 's all about .
This is what they 'll never understand , with their deadlines and dead lives and personalized coffee mugs .
ASSASSINS !" Salinger stopped crying , wiped his face with his sweater sleeve , stood and clapped his hands .
" Who 's in the mood for a cocktail ?
" Twice - filtered urine and vermouth on ice .
Salinger 's favorite .
He told me of this in one of his letters .
Heightens your awareness , he claimed .
I was n't crazy about the offer , but I could always go heavy on the vermouth .
Whatever made Salinger happy .
I slipped on the blue party dress and pig - tailed wig laid out for me , then joined Salinger in the den for drinks and dancing .
Call it “ the Gateway Bill ” — or “ Cheech and Chong ’s Law . ”
Albany is looking at legalizing “ medical marijuana ” — and then making it unique among prescription drugs by taxing it .
Maybe it ’s a step on the way to legalizing pot altogether — or maybe to taxing all medications .
Revenue projections from prescription pot are part of the state Senate ’s budget for 2010 - 11 — and the bill to legalize and tax it looks to be on the fast track .
The bill , sponsored by Senate Health Committee Chairman Thomas Duane and Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried ( both Manhattan Democrats ) , passed the Senate Code Committee last week and will now go to the full Senate for a vote .
Albany would collect in two ways .
First , the state Health Department would issue licenses to specific dispensaries and growers ; the Senate budget projects this could yield as much as $ 15 million for the state next year alone .
But the real gold is in the sales tax on every dope purchase — which could bring in up to $ 500 million for Albany ’s coffers .
But weed would be unique in having a sales tax attached to it .
The purchase of prescription pharmaceuticals , and even some over - the - counter drugs , is generally exempt from taxation because of their medicinal value .
As the Tax Foundation ’s Bill Ahern asks , “ If they are going to tax marijuana , is n’t that just like an admission that it has no medical value ? ”
Alternately , of course , perhaps state lawmakers figure this is a good test for taxing all medicines .
Not a good idea , and not likely — on the other hand , they might decide it ’s a good way to close those multibillion - dollar budget gaps .
And the taxes could start small . . .
But it ’s much more likely to be just a step toward broader legalization .
In other states with medical - MJ laws , potheads find plenty of ways to get prescriptions .
In California , it ’s a matter of finding the right doctor who will then prescribe pot to treat such varied symptoms as general anxiety , trouble sleeping and other vague “ nervous conditions . ”
And it ’s hard to believe New York ’s state Health Department — which notoriously can’t even police nursing homes — is going to do much to stop the same thing from happening here .
California , meanwhile , might make the leap from prescription pot to legalization .
After a decade , the Golden State is only getting $ 100 million a year in revenue from its pot tax .
Democrat Assemblyman Tom Ammiano proposed a bill to fully legalize marijuana — which the state ’s tax collectors estimate would bring in about $ 1.3 billion a year .
The bill failed to pass — but a legalization measure will be on the ballot in November .
Voters might approve it just for the revenue .
“ The state of California is in a very , very precipitous economic plight .
It ’s in the toilet , ” says Ammiano .
“ With any revenue ideas , people say you have to think outside the box . . . and I feel that the issue of the decriminalization , regulation and taxation of marijuana fits that bill . ”
Back to New York , where the Senate bill would plainly tax “ medical ” marijuana as the state does cigarettes and alcohol , with consumers paying a premium for the privilege .
Sure looks more like a “ sin tax ” than a compassionate act for people in chemotherapy and others with real illnesses .
Maybe New York is ready for a stealth path to legalizing pot :
It ’s already decriminalized — or largely overlooked by the cops — in much of the state .
Full legalization would simply mean that Albany makes some of the profit off what ’s now a huge black market .
But if we ’re going to go there , let ’s be honest about it — and not pretend “ medical marijuana ” is about the sick .

And if you can't get out , reach out to others start hitting news websites and blogs immediately .
Most news websites give you the ability to leave comments at the bottom
of their stories .
Reporters often use this to gauge public sentiment and
reflect it in their news stories .
Congress pays attention to the news
and it affects their votes .
Spend the afternoon commenting on as many health care related stories as you can .
Hit national news websites , local news sites , political blogs , and any other public venue you can find .
We must leave no stone unturned .

So , here 's what we need to do once the health bill passes in the House .
We can't just celebrate in our little corner here on Dailykos , we need to go across the blogs as well and tell Republicans that this is THEIR Waterloo , and that they will suffer the consequences for opposing this health bill in the House AND in the Senate .
Here 's a list of blogs we need to hit right away with the news about the bill 's passing in the House tonight :
We also need to hit our local newspapers and leave comments to counteract the massive freeping that will be going on .
This is why they 've been able to dominate the discourse because as you can see in the Tea Party e-mail above , they know that comments can influence the reporting of stories on bills :
Most news websites give you the ability to leave comments at the bottom of their stories .
Reporters often use this to gauge public sentiment and reflect it in their news stories .
Congress pays attention to the news and it affects their votes .
Also , if there 's anyone in the DC / MD / VA area , can you PLEASE go to the Capitol as well tonight and take pictures and video clips of what the teabaggers are doing ?
We need to show them as the stupid racists that they are .
We also need people in the Capitol by the congressional buildings to show SUPPORT for the health bill , just to show that the teabaggers are n't the only ones there at the Capitol .
Please , go and do this , if you live in the Capitol area .
I used to live in D.C. , and if I could , I 'd be right there , but I can't .
So , for the millions of Americans whose lives will be changed by this health bill , and for the children that will no longer face pre-existing conditions , please go .
UPDATE : Teabagger advocating assassination of the President .
This is being investigated by the FBI .

Researchers may be overlooking an insidious pollinator crisis — one that has little to do with bees and everything to do with booming markets for raspberries , pears , and chocolate .
By Nathanael Johnson
Beekeeper Eric
Olson has lost so many bees in the past few years , he ’s had to consider closing shop .
But nothing prepared him for what he found when he went out early one November morning to do a final check on “ his girls , ” as he calls them .
The first hive was dead — completely empty .
So was the second one .
And the third .
He began to wander through the yard , lifting lids at random , “ just to see how drastic it was , ” he says .
“ It was such a shock , I had to find out if we had anything left . ”
He had lost 90 percent of these bees , which had been buffeting blueberry flowers in western Washington a few months earlier .
“ What the heck happened that in one month those beehives went from sky - high , jam - packed , full of bees , doing great — to dead ? ”
You may already know about the global pollinator crisis .
Over the past 50 years , the number of domestic honeybee colonies in the U.S. has dropped by more than half .
Olson watched the number of beekeepers in Washington fall from around 45 to only eight today .
At the same time , wild pollinators have been disappearing .
No one has seen a Franklin bumblebee ( native to Oregon and California ) since 2006 or a rusty - patched bumblebee ( once common in New York ) since 2005 .
As if this were not enough , beekeepers began telling stories about something utterly strange : sterile worker bees were abandoning hives , leaving their queens and pupae behind to die .
In 2006 , researchers began calling this phenomenon colony collapse disorder and pegging it as the source of a global pollinator crisis .
The media picked up the story , and it quickly embedded itself in the public consciousness — and in the scientific community .
It ’s a truly cautionary tale .
Instead of a crisis that impacts humanity directly , such as a tidal wave or a pandemic , this one hits us as collateral damage through our ecological partners .
As such , it ’s tempting to use this crisis as an object lesson : we mess up the environment , pollinators suffer , harvests fail — and in the end , the cascade triggered by humanity rolls back on us in the form of hunger .
Perhaps this circular justice was too poetic to resist ; perhaps stories from beekeepers such as Olson were a little too compelling — because in all the excitement , few researchers stopped to question whether the bee crisis was a genuine global trend .
Then , last year , Argentine scientist Marcelo Aizen hit upon an elegant way to test that assumption .
If there really were a crisis , he figured , harvests from crops that depend on bees and other pollinators should be declining or at least leveling out .
Yet the yields of pollinator - dependent crops have grown at about the same rate as those of wind - pollinated crops .
With Lawrence Harder , Aizen went on to show that instead of crashing , the total number of commercial honeybees has increased 45 percent in the past 50 years .
It ’s not that the dire stories were false ; they just did n’t represent the big picture .
Call it a scoping problem — the conclusions you draw from looking through a microscope may be opposite to those you arrive at after examining the same evidence through a telescope .
By drawing on both perspectives , scientists have come to a new , more - nuanced revelation : a pollinator crisis does indeed loom , but the crisis they see has little to do with a decline in bees and everything to do with economic globalization and the world ’s growing appetite for raspberries , cashews , chocolate , and other luxury crops .
You do n’t have to don a protective suit and poke around beehives to see this crisis : it ’s there in your local supermarket when you find watermelons for sale in December .
The first person to point out the scoping problem was Jaboury Ghazoul .
Ghazoul is an ecologist with enough sense of whimsy to poke fun at himself : his curriculum vitae webpage shows a picture of him looking beleaguered , with a crying infant straining from his backpack .
“ Jaboury Ghazoul , ” the caption reads , “ . . .he has a hard time with his children . ”
Perhaps it was this willingness to acknowledge human foibles that allowed Ghazoul to stand against the incoming tide of orthodoxy .
The examples of pollinator declines were absolutely accurate and troubling to Ghazoul .
But he was also troubled by the fact that scientists were using these zoomed - in , microscope - type observations to make generalizations about the big picture .
In 2005 he wrote an opinion piece in Trends in Ecology and Evolution , pointing out that , while many pollinators had decreased , others had surged to take their place .
( 1 ) Furthermore , he wrote , most of our staple crops —rice , corn , wheat , soy — do n’t rely on pollinators .
Despite all the talk , there was no evidence that crop productivity was going down .
Ghazoul ’s purpose was not to defend big agriculture but to protect the credibility of conservationists .
Big - picture claims should be evaluated using big - picture data , he wrote , “ lest we overplay our hand in demanding conservation action for the wrong reasons . ”
The paper was incendiary .
“ There are still some people who practically do n’t speak to me anymore , ” Ghazoul said .
A group of scientists shot back a heated critique of this opinion piece , citing still more pollinator declines — along with historical examples of crop decrease due to loss of pollinators and studies showing that crops closer to wild habitat were more productive than plants in the middle of the field .
Still , there was no big - picture analysis to show whether the declines were actually translating into crop losses .
To prove this — or to prove , as Ghazoul suspected , that crop yields were doing just fine — scientists would need to assemble information on every farmer ’s harvest worldwide .
They ’d need to find a vast store of data .
That trove of data , it turned out , was hidden in plain sight .
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has kept statistics on global crop productivity for years .
“ When we came across these data sets , I said , well this is what we needed , ” Aizen notes .
“ Here is the data , which is publicly available , to test this . ”
In his analysis of the FAO numbers , he notes that , if there really were a global pollinator crisis threatening food supplies , there should be a related decline in average yield for all crops — or , at least , relatively lower yields for pollinator - dependent crops . ( 2 )
But when Aizen and his coauthors plotted out the productivity gains of plants that need bees alongside those of wind - and self - pollinated plants , they got two lines trending upward in tandem .
Chocolate depends on pollinators , and yields from cocoa farms have doubled since 1961 .
Watermelon , another plant that needs bees , has seen yields increase by 158 percent in the developed world and 161 percent in the developing world .
This means that , on average , each watermelon patch is producing more each year than it had the season before .
These are not numbers that would indicate a crisis .
Working with Lawrence Harder , Aizen then turned the telescope provided by the FAO numbers toward honeybees .
( The organization tracks the number of commercial hives around the world . )
They found that , although the number of hives in the U.S. had indeed dropped precipitously , the global population of managed honeybee hives had increased by 45 percent in the previous 50 years , and total honey production had increased more than 100 percent since 1961 .
( 3 ) In other words , the bee business has been outsourced .
Since the 1960s , U.S. honey producers have been forced out of the industry by cheaper , imported honey .
U.S. bee losses have been dwarfed by increases in places such as China , Argentina , and Turkey — countries which now dominate the honey supply .
“ At least for honeybees , ” Aizen said , “ the pollinator crisis is not happening . ”
But that does n’t mean there ’s not a crisis .
Aizen and Harder could have stopped with their repudiation of conventional wisdom , but instead they took their analysis a step further .
What they found was sobering .
Over the past half - century , the earth ’s farmers have doubled their production of major crops that do n’t need pollinators .
These plants — corn , wheat , potatoes — are staples , and their increase reflects the basic need to fill 3 billion more bellies ( the doubling in production roughly mirrors a doubling in population ) .
In that same time period , however , production of pollinator - dependent crops ( cardamom , cantaloupes , and cashews ) has quadrupled — and the number of beehives has increased .
But Aizen and Harder point out that the 45 - percent increase in honeybees seems less impressive beside a 400 - percent increase in flowering crops .
The fact that yields have increased despite the disparity between bees and flowers could indicate that wild pollinators are supporting farmers .
But Aizen and Harder warn that , as more land is devoted to luxury crops and as small , diverse fields are converted to vast , high - tech monocultures , farmers could wipe out native bees — effectively knocking down the prop holding them up .
Furthermore , if farmers in Africa turn to the likes of Eric Olson to ship in domestic honeybees , it could compound the problem .
“ Do n’t forget , ” Harder told me , “ honeybees are an invasive species in most places . ”
They do n’t always contribute to the relationships that have evolved between local species over the eons .
They take pollen from native plants but often do n’t fertilize them as well as the local bees .
This means fewer seeds , fewer native flowers , and fewer wild pollinators .
In the process of demonstrating that no global pollinator crisis was occurring , Aizen and Harder found the portents of , well , a global pollination crisis .
However , the crisis they foresee is one driven not by mysterious die - offs but by market pressures plainly visible in the produce aisle .
It has to do with people in poor nations developing an appetite for good cocoa and coffee .
It has to do with people in wealthy countries assuming that tomatoes will be ripe and readily available year - round .
Bee scarcity , in other words , is an economic problem caused by economic forces .
So how does this economic explanation square with the clear and present biological crisis that Eric Olson faces on the ground in Yakima , Washington ?
“ We are not denying that there are serious biological problems , like in the U.S. with colony collapse disorder , et cetera , ” Harder said .
“ But our argument is that this sort of thing is a short - term episode in a much - longer declining trend that ’s probably more related to the economics of the honey industry . ”
The very fact that it ’s so difficult to wrap your mind around the idea that dying bees could be a symptom of something as abstract as global economics speaks to the essence of the scoping problem : good science takes that which seems obvious to the naked eye and — by looking at it from a new perspective — provides a new and often counterintuitive model for explaining things .
It seems obvious , for example , that the sun travels around the earth until you spend some time looking through a telescope . ❧

Last year the BitTorrent search engine is oHunt lost in court against the MPAA .
A Californian court ruled that isoHunt was guilty of inducing copyright infringement and granted summary judgment .
IsoHunt , however , does not intend to crack so easily as it sets course towards an appeal and launches a ' Lite ' version of the site .
Early 2006 , the MPAA issued a complaint against isoHunt and its sister site Torrentbox , claiming that owner Gary Fung operated file - sharing services and profited from copyright infringement .
The lengthy legal procedure that followed came to a temporary end December last year , when a US Federal Court in California ruled that isoHunt was indeed guilty of violating US copyright law .
Since the circumstances of the case were so similar to earlier ones involving Napster and Grokster , the judge decided there was no need to have a full trial and instead granted a summary judgment against isoHunt .
That was not the end of the case though .
Last month at the status conference the judge opened the door for an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .
“ Before we appeal however , we must undergo injunction motions and that ’s what we are doing now , ” Gary Fung told Torrent Freak .
The MPAA has already filed its injunction and suggested that isoHunt should filter its search results based on generic keywords that may be used to describe copyrighted titles .
In a response is oHunt has filed an injunction stating that such a feature is a bad idea for several reasons .
“ The Plaintiffs ’ [ MPAA studios ] proposed injunction and its keyword type filter , in our view , raises serious issues on the balance between freedom of speech , fair use and copyright protectionism .
Such a keyword filter is also impossible to implement if it ’s to have any sort of precision , nor can it avoid conflict with free use cases , free commerce , or extra-territorial law , ” Fung said .
“ If it were actually to be mandated and put into operation , plaintiffs ’ proposed filter would make Swiss cheese out of the dictionary , ” is oHunt ’s lawyer Ira Rothken writes in the injunction , arguing that a keyword filter would also censor a lot of legal content .
“ If a new TV show title is based on a popular phrase that is already in the name of an amateur film or Linux program , distribution of the film or program will be blocked , ” the lawyer added .
Instead of filtering isoHunt proposes to use a Lite version of isoHunt instead , a version of the site that no longer contains any of the red flags for inducement that were found at Summary Judgment .
In other words , the ‘ lite ’ version of the site is no different than search engines such as Google and Yahoo ! , except that it ’s limited to torrent files .
“ Should the Court accept a version of isoHunt Lite during the injunction phase , it may become the required interface for our US users , ” Gary Fung told TorrentFreak .
It is noted in the injunction that Google and Yahoo !
and other search engines can serve as torrent search engines also , and that most of the files that can be found via is oHunt are indexed by these other search engines as well .
Gary
Fung even conducted a test on a sample of torrent files to prove this point .
“ This test shows that 95 % of the torrent files indexed on isoHunt are equally available through the main search engines , ” is oHunt ’s lawyer writes to the court .
With the Lite version of isoHunt Gary Fung hopes to prevent the site ’s closure in the US .
If the Court somehow rules that it ’s still violating copyright law , one has to wonder what implications this has for Google , Yahoo ! and other search engines .
The case continues .

The importance of the ability to automatically reverse engineer application - level protocols and file format specifications has increased recently because of the growth in concern for network and system security .
The availability of such application - level protocol and file format specifications information provides security applications such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems the context information of a network communication or file parsing session , which is important for accurately detecting or preventing intrusions .
The ability to automatically reverse engineer application - level protocols and file format specifications alleviates the time - consuming and error - prone manual reverse engineering operation and provides tools to effectively combat contemporary security threats .
Most of the current efforts in reverse engineering of input formats of application - level protocols and file format specifications involve a manual operation .
The time involved in accomplishing this task can sometimes be measured in years and this effort may prove unfeasible if the application - level protocol or file format changes faster than engineers can complete the reverse engineering .
Existing technology that attempts to automatically reverse engineer application - level protocols and file format specifications also falls short of current market demands .
Current tools for automatically reverse engineering protocols are limited to network protocols utilizing a network trace and are limited by the information available in the network trace .
Consequently , binary fields and repetitive elements are difficult to identify .
The increase in interest in network and system security combined with a greater sophistication in application - level protocols and file specification formats has created a market demand for a system capable of automatically reverse engineering application - level protocols and file format specifications for areas other than network protocols .
In addition to the security uses reference above , the results obtained from the reverse engineering is also valuable for network management applications and Generic Protocol Analyzers .
The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding and high - level survey .
This summary is not an extensive overview .
It is neither intended to identify key or critical elements nor to delineate scope .
The sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description later presented .
Additionally , section headings used herein are provided merely for convenience and should not be taken as limiting in any way .
The subject innovation is a tool for automatically reverse engineering an application - level protocol or a file specification format while providing rich information including the identification of binary fields and repetitive elements .
The innovation includes dynamic data flow analysis based on observing how network or file input is parsed and consumed by a program .
The novel concepts provided by the subject innovation first include automatically reverse engineering a grammar based on a Backus - Naur Form ( BNF ) - like rule base supporting alternation and repetition .
The grammar output allows more accurate covering of input formats and lends itself more easily to use by generic protocol analyzers .
Next , in addition to identifying field boundaries , the subject innovation also infers input constraints .
Input constraints are necessary for use in applications that generate and validate input .
Next , the analysis includes reconciliation over a large number of input samples .
The large sample base increases coverage and drives the reverse engineering output to a more complete representation .
Next , the intra-message constraints described above are expanded to infer inter-message constraints .
Inter - message constraints provide for the accurate reverse engineering of protocols involving a sequence of messages .
Finally , in addition to observing the programs use of the input data , the subject innovation also observes the use of the input data in system and library calls .
In one exemplary non-limiting embodiment , a method of automatically reverse engineering an input format includes observing a programs execution on a machine language level , and automatically determining if the input format is four - byte or two - byte addressing .
A computing system includes in one exemplary non-limiting embodiment , a memory and a processor coupled to the memory , the processor is configured to automatically identify boundaries of records in a record sequence .
In another exemplary non-limiting embodiment , the system includes means for observing a programs execution on a machine language level , and means for automatically identifying a record sequence of a plurality of records .
Significant advances have been made in using dynamic data flow analysis for automatic reverse engineering .

The exemplary non-limiting algorithm embodiment can classify records in such sequences according to their types .
The exemplary non-limiting algorithm embodiment can derive constraints of various types that express dependencies across fields or messages , such as checksum fields or sequence number fields .

The exemplary non-limiting algorithm embodiment can derive constraints of various types that express dependencies across fields or messages , such as checksum fields or sequence number fields .
These additional and enhanced capabilities produce more accurate input format specifications with a richer set of structural relationships like nested structures , unions , and arrays as well as constraints among the fields or across messages .
Most application - level protocols involve the concept of an application session , consisting of a series of messages exchanged between two hosts for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task .
Associated with this concept are two essential components in an application - level protocol specification , a protocol state machine and a message format .
The protocol state machine characterizes all possible legitimate sequences of messages , while the message format specifies all possible legitimate messages .
Files are different from protocols in the sense that each file is a single " message " and therefore there is no " session " concept in a file specification .
Referring initially to FIG .
1 , a reverse engineering system 100 for automatically reverse engineering input formats using dynamic data flow analysis is depicted .
It should be appreciated that the ever increasing threats to system and network security combined with the increase in complexity of network and application - level protocols and file format specifications have created a market demand for a system level tool capable of automatically reverse engineering network and application - level protocols and file format specifications .
Counter to conventional practice in the protocol and file format reverse engineering domain , innovations described herein provide for the generation of a rich BNF - like grammar supporting alternation and repetition .
It is contemplated that the reverse engineering system 100 can form at least part of a network and system security system but is not limited thereto .
For example , the HTTP protocol input to a web server on a corporate network can be analyzed to determine if someone is attempting to penetrate the network through a currently unknown vulnerability .
Reverse engineering system 100 comprises binary program component 102 , input data component 104 , binary program translator component 106 and data flow engine component 108 .
The binary program component 102 provides for the selection of the binary program used to analyze the application - level protocol or file format input data .
One of the novel features of this innovation is the use of a binary program in the analysis to identify the types and numbers of accesses to different locations of the input data .
For example , the size of a data field can be determined by a combination of how many times the first byte of the data field is accessed by particular processor instructions known to access data of a certain size .
The input data component 104 provides , in a similar fashion as the binary program component 102 , for the selection of a file , stored either locally or remotely , or an application - level or network protocol for use as the input data for a reverse engineering analysis .
For example , the user might select a Windows Metafile ( WMF ) containing an arbitrary sequence of records mapping graphic display functions ( GDI ) corresponding to a specific graphic image with the result of the analysis being the determination of the format of the file producing the graphic image .
The binary program translator component 106 provides for the replaying of traces from the binary program .
The ability to replay traces provides the framework for the novel analysis abilities of identifying fields and repetitive elements .
The binary program translator 106 merges the input data from the input data component 104 with the trace of the binary program from the binary program component 102 to provide a reproducible simulated execution of the binary program allowing repetitive analysis by the data flow engine component 108 .
For example , a trace of a file transfer protocol ( FTP ) program can be provided to the binary program translator component 106 by the binary program component 102 while the FTP program connects to an FTP server to download files of various sizes and formats .
The data flow engine component 108 provides for the analysis of the input data in the context of the running binary program as simulated by replaying the binary program trace in the binary program translator component 106 .
For example , the data flow engine component 108 can analyze the trace of a domain name server ( DNS ) binary program while the binary program does lookups on various hostnames .
The data flow engine component 108 can then automatically reverse engineer the data necessary to generate a BNF - like grammar representing the format of the DNS responses .
Referring to FIG .
2 , a reverse engineering system 100 for automatically reverse engineering input formats using dynamic data flow analysis is depicted and further comprises the binary program file 202 repository , and the protocol message input 204 and file input 206 input data types .
In another aspect of the reverse engineering system 100 represented in FIG .
2 , the data flow engine component 108 comprises the field identification component 208 , the record identification component 210 , the equivalent field identification component 212 , the grammar inference component 214 , and the constraint identification component 216 .
In another aspect of the reverse engineering system 100 represented in FIG .
2 , the grammar output component 218 provides the BNF - like grammar representing the associated file format specification or the network or application - level protocol .
The binary program file 202 is the binary image of the program used in the analysis of the input data as provided to the binary program component 102 .
The novel feature of using the binary program associated with the input data allows the subject invention to repetitively analyze either the same or different input data to create a more accurate and complete representation of the input data .
For example , a binary program that reads its initial configuration from a file of an unknown format can be selected and analyzed while it reads the input data from the configuration file .
The analysis can be repeated with the configuration changed between each analysis and after multiple runs of the subject invention , a BNF - like grammar is produced representing the file format specification of the configuration file .
The protocol message input 204 and the file input 206 are the input data to the input data component 104 .
In the case of the protocol message input 204 , this can be but is not limited to HTTP messages sent to a web server or data messages sent to a file transfer protocol program .
In the case of the file input 206 this can be any file associated with a binary program where the binary program reads from or writes to the file .
The field identification component 208 maps each position in the input data to a base type in the grammar .
The mapping is created by observing how the input data is accessed when the trace from the binary program file 202 is run by the binary program translator component 106 .
For example , if two consecutive byte locations in the input data are processed as a two - byte word throughout the simulation then the subject invention will identify the two consecutive byte locations as a word data value .
In another aspect of the field identification component 208 , the subject invention can resolve conflicts between consecutive bytes of data accessed by different operand types .
For example , the binary program trace simulation can access a four consecutive byte location of input data as a single 32 - bit value or two 16 - bit values or four 8 - bit values .
The field identification component 208 resolves this conflict by the use of a novel scoring algorithm .
The scoring algorithm maintains a score of access of a given section by each operand type and calculates and adjusted score for each operand type accessing a particular section at the completion of the simulated run .
An adjusted score is calculated for each operand type by subtracting the unadjusted score of each conflicting operand type form the unadjusted score of the subject operand type .
At the end of the analysis , the operand with the highest adjusted score is considered the most valid operand and the size of the subject data field in the input data is set to the size of the data accessed by the most valid operand .
In a similar fashion , field identification component 208 can recognize byte ordering such as big-endian integers by recognizing access of bytes in reverse order .
The input data is tracked at byte level granularity .
In another aspect of the field identification component 208 , different score values are assigned to different instructions based on the type of instruction .
The subject invention divides all instructions into four levels with each level having a different score value .
The first level has the highest score value and comprises comparison instructions showing an input value equal to some value .
The second level has a score value less than the first level and greater than the third level and comprises input values treated as arguments to function call instructions .
The third level has a score value less than the second level and greater than the fourth level and comprises all other comparison instructions in addition to all arithmetic and logic instructions .
The fourth level has a score value less than the third level and comprises all memory move type instructions .
Field identification component 208 discloses another novel aspect of identifying sequences of bytes of input data from contiguous offsets , known as chunks , and associating these identified chunks with identified fields .
The disclosure accomplishes this association by finding a subset of chunks selected to maximize the sum of the weights of the chunks .
The invention uses the Greedy algorithm for weighted setpacking to compute the best subset from application traces of input data .
Any field untouched by the application during the simulation of the particular input data is marked as a virtual field .
In another novel aspect of the field identification component 208 , string input data values are identified by recognizing one of a small group of a consistent series of optimized instructions present when string input data is manipulated .
The impact of this correction is not to overweigh a particular instruction because of its use in moving strings from one memory location to another .
The record identification component 210 identifies sequences of records belonging to the same data entity , such as an array .
The novel algorithm used by the record identification component 210 to identify the sequences is based on the concept that applications tend to process a sequence of records in a loop construct .
Based on this theory , the record identification component 210 first determines the locations of all of the loop constructs in the application binary image .
Next the record identification component 210 determines the fields accessed by instructions within each loop construct .
After completing the field to loop mapping , the record identification component 210 identifies the record boundaries of the sequences of records in the input data .
The first step of the record identification component 210 identifies all the loops in the execution trace .
The record identification component 210 searches for cycles in the control flow graph .
The control flow graph is simply a graphical representation of all possible paths through a program during its execution .
This analysis yields a complete list of all the loops in the application binary image and their relationships .
For example , this analysis would disclose relationships such as nested loops .
The list of possible loops is filtered by considering only loops with a single entry point .
The record identification component next maps the loop information to the execution trace to identify the loops in the execution trace .
The record identification component 210 then uses the processors instruction pointer value to identify the list of all subsequences of the execution trace corresponding to execution of the loop .
Finally , the loop iterations within the subsequences are identified by determining where the execution trace intersects the entry point of the loop .
The second step of the record identification component 210 identifies which fields accessed by the instructions of the loop constructs are specific to the iteration of that instruction .
For example , if an instruction touches the same input data field on every iteration then the association between the instruction and the input data field is described as iteration independent .
Alternatively , if an instruction touches a different input data field on every iteration then the association between the operand and the input data field is described as iteration dependent .
The record identification component 210 uses iteration dependent associations to identify sequences of records .
The third step of the record identification component 210 groups the identified fields into records and indentifies the record boundaries .
The identification algorithm assumes that a record is a contiguous sequence of fields and a record sequence is composed of contiguous records .
Loops accessing fields outside of the currently processed record are acceptable but loops processing records not in the order the records appear in the input data are ignored .
The algorithm is invoked for each identified loop containing iteration dependent instructions .
The algorithm sets the start of the first record to the first field in terms of order in the input data accessed by iteration dependent instructions in the first iteration of the loop .
Next , the algorithm identifies the set of iteration dependent instructions accessing the field at the beginning of the first record in the first iteration .
The algorithm assumes that this set of instructions is likely to access the beginning of other records .
Therefore the algorithm looks for these iteration dependent instructions from other iterations and sets the start of the corresponding record accordingly .
The process is repeated for the case that an iteration does not use any iteration dependent instructions from this set .
The end of a record is set to the byte preceding the start of the next identified record .
Finally , the end of the last record is set to the last input byte accessed by any iteration dependent instructions in the last iteration .
The following pseudo code represents this algorithm .
- US - 00001 Find Record Boundaries ( 1 . IN n , // number of loop iterations 2 . IN ( l1 , ... , ln ) , // iteration dependent instructions for each loop iteration 3 . OUT ( s1 , ... , sn ) , // start offset of each record 4 . OUT ( e1 , ... , en ) ) // end offset of each record 5 . 6 . for ( j from 1 to n ) sj= - 1 ; // mark start of record j as unknown 7 .
8 . for ( j from 1 to n ) { 9 . if ( sj= = - 1 ) 10 . then sj= min{ Offset ( Field ( inst ) ) : inst 2 lj } 11 . l = { inst 2 lj : Offset ( Field ( inst ) ) =
Sj } 12 . for ( i from j + 1 to n ) 13 . if ( l \ li 6 = { } ) 14 . si= min{ Offset ( Field ( inst ) ) : inst 2 li \ l} 15 .
} 16 . 17 . for ( j from 1 to n - 1 ) ej= Sj+ 1 - 1 ; 18 . en= max { Offset ( Field ( inst ) ) + sizeof ( Field ( inst ) ) : inst 2 ln}Reconciliation of results across all loops is performed in one exemplary non-limiting embodiment .
Consider two record sequences .
Two sequences are denoted as equal , disjoint , overlap or that one sequence is contained in the other if positions in the input at which the two record sequences are located have the corresponding relations .
Let A and B be two record sequences .
If A and B are equal then treat A and B as the same sequence .
If A is completely contained in a single record of B then one can consider A as a child record sequence of B .
If A and B overlap in any other way , one can replace A and B by the following disjoint record sequences : C : the sequence that covers the interval on which A and B overlap ; D : the part of A or B that precedes C ( possibly empty ) ; and E : the part of A or B that follows C .
At the end of this step , all pairs or record sequences are either disjoint or in a parent - child relationship .
This gives rise to the tree representation .
This tree representation can be easily transformed into a BNF grammar that describes the input format .
The Backus - Naur form ( BNF ) is a metasyntax used to express context - free grammars : that is , a formal way to describe formal languages .
John Backus and Peter Naur developed a context free grammar to define the syntax of a programming language by using two sets of rules : i.e. , Lexical rules and Syntactic rules .
BNF is widely used as a notation for the grammars of computer programming languages , instruction sets and communication protocols , as well as a notation for representing parts of natural language grammars .
Many textbooks for programming language theory and / or semantics document the programming language in BNF .
There are many extensions of and variants on BNF .
The cutting of overlapping record sequences into smaller parts is motivated by the common pattern in string processing .
The application first scans the entire string in search of keywords or delimiters , thus identifying substrings .
After that , it processes the substrings .
Length determination : outputted for each record sequence is how its length is determined .
Consider the following three cases : ( a) The length is determined by a termination record ( cf. null terminated ASCII strings ) ; ( b) The length is determined by a separate length field ; ( c ) The length is fixed an implicitly determined by the protocol specification .
The equivalent field identification component 212 identifies fields in the input data having the same semantics and the equivalence is not restricted to a single input data sample .
For example , a record size field in one record of an input data file is equivalent to a record size field in another record of the same input data file or a record size field in a record of a different input data file .
The basis of equivalence used by the subject invention is that if the same sequence of instructions from the application binary file operates on different fields then the fields are likely semantically equivalent .
The equivalent field identification component 212 implements this novel concept by assigning a TerminalID to each field .
The TerminalID is a compact signature representing the list of the opcodes that have operated on the subject field .
After the analysis is complete the TerminalID for each field is compared and the fields with the same TerminalID are equivalent .
The equivalent field identification component 212 recognizes sequences of instructions included in loops and assigns those sequences of opcodes to a TerminalID only if the sequence of opcodes operates on field input data in an iteration dependent fashion .
The grammar inference component 214 collects the output information provided by the field identification component 208 , the record identification component 210 and the equivalent field identification component 212 and uses this information to generate the BNF - like grammar rules representing the automatically reverse engineered input format .
The BNF - like grammar may be generated over a single input data such as a file input 206 for reverse engineering a file format specification or it may be generated over multiple inputs such as the requests and responses for an HTTP communication between a client and a server .
In one aspect , the novel grammar inference component 214 generates the grammar rules associated with a single input data in a bottom - up recursive fashion from the bottom up with respect to previously determined nested records .
First , the grammar inference component 214 makes every field containing a TerminalID a unique terminal in the generated grammar .
Next , the grammar inference component 214 constructs a data tree representing the record nesting hierarchy .
The inference component 214 identifies records in a nested loop as children of the record corresponding to the iteration of the parent loop .
The inference component 214 repeats this identification through as many nested levels as required based on the input data .
A record can be identified as a child record , a parent record or a parent / child record depending on the record 's location in the record nesting .
Next , the inference component 214 generates a non-terminal for each leaf record by concatenating the terminals of all the fields in the leaf record .
Next , the inference component 214 generates two non-terminals for each sequence of leaf records .
One non-terminal is generated with an alteration rule and the other non-terminal is generated with a repetition rule .
The repetition rule generated non-terminal represents the sequence of records and implies that the input allows a sequence of records represented by the non-terminal generated by the alteration rule .
In another aspect , the subject invention determines the record type for each identified record .
Based on observations that applications typically have a separate handler function for each record type , the subject invention identifies records belonging to the same type if the loop iterations processing the records execute " mostly " the same instructions .
A complicating factor is introduced when record sequences are nested .
For example , when one or more records of a sequence contain other sequences then the instructions processing the sequence also depend on the embedded sequence , producing the appearance of an additional or different record type .
Therefore the algorithm requires more than simply looking for similar instruction sequences .
The novel subject innovation addresses this added complexity by first defining l as an iteration dependent loop , r as the record sequences processed by the iteration dependent loop l and n as the number of records in record sequence r. Next , for i.di-elect cons .
{1 , . . . , n} , the algorithm defines Qas the subset of instructions from the set of iteration dependent instructions Ithat access fields in the i-th record of r and compute the sets Qfor ever record sequence .
The set Qis a superset of the dependent instructions considered relevant to the analysis and therefore the algorithm next transforms the set Qto Q'of instructions representing the child loops .
The subject innovation computes Q'by collapsing every segment of the instruction trace containing an execution of a child loop into a single virtual instruction and assigning the virtual instruction a virtual instruction pointer such that two virtual instructions have the same virtual instruction pointer if and only if they correspond to executions of the same loop .
Finally , Q'is set to Qwith the added restriction that all instructions in the child loop execution are replaced with the identifier of the virtual instruction representing the child loop .
The effect of this transformation is that iteration dependent loops processing child record sequences contribute a single virtual instruction to the parent record sequence and eliminate differences based on what happened during the child loop sequence execution .
The algorithm only wants to know if the child loop was executed and identifies two records i and j as having the same type if Q'= Q' In another aspect , the grammar inference component 214 generates grammar rules with a top - down approach .
The grammar inference component 214 outputs identified fields and record sequences in the enhanced BNF format by generating a rule listing the top - level fields and record sequences in the order of their positions in the input data , referred to as the root rule .
For each record sequence , the grammar inference component 214 generates an alternation rule to cover all the record types included in the record sequence .
For each record type , the grammar inference component 214 generates a rule listing the fields and child record sequences for the record type .
This algorithm is recursively continued for all of the record sequences and record types .
In another aspect , the grammar inference component 214 generalizes the single input data grammar rules by extending the analysis over multiple input data samples and providing a single format specification .
The grammar inference component 214 accomplishes the task by matching fields , record sequences and record types across different execution traces of the same application binary image with different input data .
First , grammar inference component 214 identifies matching fields from different execution traces if the fields are accessed by the same set of instructions in the different execution traces ( or say with the same TerminalID ) .
Similarly , grammar inference component 214 identifies matching records from different execution traces if the record sequences are processed by the same loops .
Records from matching record sequences are identified as having the same type if the records contain the same nested child loops .
Next the grammar inference component 214 combines the grammar from the individual execution traces by identifying the pairs of grammar rules that can be merged based on root rules and the grammar rules of matched record sequences and record types .
The first step is to align the list of fields and record sequences using a type - based sequence alignment technique .
If all the fields and record sequences are matched then the two rules are identical and only one is included , otherwise , new alternation rules are created for each pair of unmatched fields or record sequences .
Finally , a new rule is created listing matched fields and record sequences as well as the new alternation rules for the unmatched fields or record sequences .
The constraint identification component 216 identifies which locations of the input data are input values , constants hard - coded in the binary application or field length values .
In one aspect of the subject invention symbolic predicates are identified that depend only on input values and constants in the binary program and are accordingly general to the input format .
The constraint identification component determines if all leaf nodes in a data flow graph are either inputs or constants .
For example , the immediate operands of the instructions in the binary program contain values hard - coded in the application representing checksums and hash values used to validate the integrity of the input data .
In another aspect , the constraint identification component 216 provides a novel algorithm that uses a database of symbolic predicates with known semantics .
For example , the algorithm is aware that a particular system call returns the size of an input file in a known output parameter .
The constraint identification component 216 algorithm will decorate the known output parameter with a special label and the label is propagated by the previously described data flow mechanics .
The symbolic predicate leaf node search described above detects the presence of the special label and issues a known semantics constraint and label for use by the grammar inference component .
In another aspect , the constraint identification component 216 determines inter-message constraints for a multi-message network protocol .
For example , the value of an input data field in a later message is based on the values of one or more input data fields in earlier messages such as session IDs and packet numbers .
The constraint identification component 216 generates a symbolic predicate at the point the algorithm sends " tainted " input data .
Specifically , the constraint identification component 216 generates an equality symbolic predicate based on the data flow graphs of the tainted data .
In another aspect , the constraint identification component 216 identifies the length fields in the input data that specify the length of a sequence in the input .
The constraint identification component uses three techniques to identify length fields .
The three techniques can be used independently or in combination with each other .
The first technique identifies a length field by detecting the use of an input field for constructing a pointer accessing another input data location .
The constraint identification component 216 technique eliminates false identifications by requiring that the constructed pointer must be tainted by consecutive input bytes .
The constraint identification component 216 associates the specified length to a field or record by comparing the adjusted value of the specified length with the length of each field or record between the specified length field and the destination input data .
The first technique further determines if the specified length is for all fields and records between the specified length field and the input data by the specified length adjusted value with the length of all fields and records between the specified length field and the destination input data .
The first technique then completes by adjusting the length value based on the data flow graph associated with the pointer .
For example , a length field determined to be a length of four - byte elements will present an observation of the length field multiplied by four in the data flow graph .
The second technique relies on observations collected by the record identification component 210 .
The second technique identifies a length field by comparing the adjusted value of iteration independent instructions with the number of records identified by the loop , the length field is validated by equality to the number of records in the loop .
The third technique identifies length fields using information embedded in known call interfaces .
For example , an input field used as the size argument to a " malloc " memory allocation call is identified as a length field .
The third technique determines the portion of the input data written to allocated buffer to associate the length field with the proper location in the input data .
The grammar output component 218 collects the grammar generated by grammar inference component 214 and combines it with the constraints identified by the constraint identification component 216 creates the completed BNF - like grammar rules in a format usable by other tools such as a generic protocol analyzer or a network or system security application .
Referring to FIG .
3 , the sequence 300 of processing stages performed by one exemplary non-limiting embodiment is depicted .
A raw input 302 is first segmented into basic fields 304 producing a sequence of fields 306 .
The next processing stage identifies record sequences 308 producing a sequence of records at 310 .
Next , the records are classified into record types 312 identified in the input in the previous stage 302 , thus generating a sequence of record types .
A more complete list of the record types can be generated by repeating the analysis for several inputs .
Another exemplary non-limiting embodiment comprises a taint tracking engine .
The taint tracking engine associates data structures with addresses in the application 's address space and updates the data structures as the application executes .
In one aspect , the data structures indicate whether the value stored at an address depends on input data .
When input data arrives in the application 's address space , the memory locations storing the input data are marked as tainted .
Whenever an instruction reads and writes data , the data structure for the destination address is updated depending on whether any of the source operands are tainted .
More complex data structures , known as data flow graphs , allow more detailed information to be tracked , including which bytes in the input data the value at a tainted memory location depends on and how that value was computed .
The algorithm now uses the heuristic that the instructions in I are likely to access the beginning of a record whenever they appear .
Thus , it looks for instructions from I in each iteration ( line 13 ) and sets the start of the corresponding record accordingly ( line 14 ) .
The process is repeated ( line 8 ) for the case that an iteration does not use any instruction from I .
Finally , the end of each record is set to the position immediately before the start of the next record ( line 17 ) .
The end of the least record is set to the last input byte accessed by any iteration dependent instruction in the last iteration ( line 18 ) .
This procedure is performed for all iteration dependent loops .
As above , a loop is ignored if the computed record start addresses are not increasing .
Knowledge of the semantics of platform specific functions such as system calls , application programming interface ( API ) functions and functions in runtime libraries can significantly enhance the accuracy and functionality of one exemplary non-limiting embodiment .
As a preliminary step , one can add specifications of string processing functions and memory allocation functions to one exemplary non-limiting embodiment .
These specifications are used in the following areas :
Field identification :
Use of an input chunk as a function parameter can provide strong evidence that the chunk is a field .
This evidence is incorporated into the field recognition step by increasing the weight w( c ) of the chunk if one exemplary non-limiting embodiment sees a call to a known function in the execution trace .
Identification of record sequences : Functions can have record sequences ( or pointers to them ) as parameters .
For example , a call to a standard string processing function with a character pointer that points to tainted data indicates the pointer marks the start of a string .
Constraint identification : function calls can provide information about different kinds of constraints .
One can use knowledge of memory allocation functions to identify length fields .
For example , a call to malloc with a tainted size parameter indicates this parameter is a length field .
In general , one may not consider the parts of the execution trace that are spent inside any of the known functions in the analysis .
Effectively , this collapses calls to these functions into a single virtual instruction with special semantics .

Any inference as described herein can be done by fully or partially utilizing an artificial intelligence ( AI ) layer or component .
The AI layer or component can be employed to facilitate inferring and / or determining when , where or how to allocate fields , records , record sequences , constraints , etc .
Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and / or stored event data , whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity , and whether the events and data come from one or several event (s ) and data source (s ) .
The AI component can also employ any of a variety of suitable AI - based schemes in connection with facilitating various aspects of the herein described innovation .
Classification can employ a probabilistic and / or statistical - based analysis ( e.g. , factoring into the analysis utilities and costs ) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed .
The AI layer can be used in conjunction with the security layer to infer changes in the data being transferred and make recommendations to the security layer as to what level of security to apply .
For example , a support vector machine ( SVM ) classifier can be employed .
Other classification approaches include Bayesian networks , decision trees , and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed .
Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority .
The disclosed and described components , for example in connection with matching or inference tasks , can employ various artificial intelligence - based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof
For example , inference or likely search terms or matching of topological maps or sets of demographic information , among other tasks , can be carried out by a neural network , an expert system , a rules - based processing component , or a support vector machine .
A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector , X=(x , x , x , x , . . . x ) , to a confidence that the input belongs to a class , that is , f ( X ) =confidence ( class ) .
Such a classification can employ a probabilistic and / or statistical - based analysis ( for example , factoring into the analysis utilities and costs ) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed .
In the case of a page - biased search system , for example , attributes of a reference set of information to be used in a comparison can be used to determine whether a similar set can be considered to match the reference set .
A support vector machine ( SVM ) is an example of a classifier that can be employed .
The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs , which hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events .
Intuitively , this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near , but not identical to training data .
Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include , for example , naive Bayes , Bayesian networks , decision trees , and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed .
Classification as used herein also includes statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority .
As will be readily appreciated from the subject specification , components disclosed or described herein can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained ( for example , by a generic training data ) as well as implicitly trained ( for example , by observing user behavior , receiving extrinsic information ) .
For example , SVMs are configured by a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module .
Thus , the classifier (s ) can be used to automatically perform a number of functions including but not limited to ranking search results .

Similarly , the server (s ) 1220 are operably connected to one or more server data store (s ) 1230 that can be employed to store information local to the server (s ) 1240 .
With reference to FIG .
13 , an exemplary environment 1300 for implementing various components includes a computer 1312 .
The computer 1312 includes a processing unit 1314 , a system memory 1316 , and a system bus 1318 .
The system bus 1318 couples the system components including , but not limited to , the system memory 1316 to the processing unit 1314 .
The processing unit 1314 can be any of various available processors .
Dual microprocessors and other multiprocessor architectures also can be employed as the processing unit 1314 .
The system bus 1318 can be any of several types of bus structure (s ) including the memory bus or memory controller , a peripheral bus or external bus , and / or a local bus using any variety of available bus architectures including , but not limited to , Industrial Standard Architecture ( ISA ) , Micro - Channel Architecture ( MCA ) , Extended ISA ( EISA ) , Intelligent Drive Electronics ( IDE ) , VESA Local Bus ( VLB ) , Peripheral Component Interconnect ( PCI ) , Peripheral Component Interconnect Express ( PCI Express ) , ExpressCard , Card Bus , Universal Serial Bus ( USB ) , Advanced Graphics Port ( AGP ) , Personal Computer Memory Card International Association bus ( PCMCIA ) , Firewire ( IEEE 1394 ) , Serial Advanced Technology Attachment ( SATA ) , and Small Computer Systems Interface ( SCSI ) .
The system memory 1316 includes volatile memory 1320 and nonvolatile memory 1322 .
The basic input / output system ( BIOS ) , containing the basic routines to transfer information between elements within the computer 1312 , such as during start - up , is stored in nonvolatile memory 1322 .
By way of illustration , and not limitation , nonvolatile memory 1322 can include read only memory ( ROM ) , programmable ROM ( PROM ) , electrically programmable ROM ( EPROM ) , electrically erasable ROM ( EEPROM ) , or flash memory .
Volatile memory 1320 includes random access memory ( RAM ) , which acts as external cache memory .
By way of illustration and not limitation , RAM is available in many forms such as synchronous RAM ( SRAM ) , dynamic RAM ( DRAM ) , synchronous DRAM ( SDRAM ) , double data rate SDRAM ( DDR SDRAM ) , enhanced SDRAM ( ESDRAM ) , Synchlink DRAM ( SLDRAM ) , and direct Rambus RAM ( DRRAM ) .

I 've always thought of stouts and porters to be the desserts of the beer world .
Their dark caramelized flavors are reminiscent of coffee and chocolate — bitter , sweet , and creamy .
With a flavor profile like that , it 's no surprise that stouts and porters make an easy passage into the world of baking .
This Irish Porter Cake from Forgotten Skills of Cooking by Darina Allen is the St. Patrick 's Day version of of a Christmas fruitcake — except you actually want to eat this one since it 's doused in Guinness and ridiculously delicious .
The cake starts out with a warm mix of butter , sugar , and stout .
Dried fruit and citrus peel are left to rehydrate or infuse in the sweet , buttery , and beery mixture .
The rest of the batter consists of flour , eggs , and a mix of sweet - savory spices known as mixed spice ( a British Isles export combining cinnamon , nutmeg , allspice , ginger , coriander , and a few others but you can approximate your own at home or use a jarred pumpkin pie spice ) .
Once the cake emerges from the oven and cools , you have the option of pouring a few tablespoons of porter over it .
The added porter imparts a bitterness that complements the sweet - spiciness of this cake perfectly .
Ideally , Darina Allen would let this cake sit for a day or two before slicing it but the scent from the freshly baked cake makes it pretty much impossible to resist .
With St. Patrick 's
Day only one day away I would advise getting a head start on this one .
Okay , it 's official .
There is absolutely nothing that the Republican party wo n't say no to .
Today , RNC Chairman Michael Steele refused to sign a joint statement with DNC Chairman Tim Kaine that would read :
As leaders of our respective national parties , we want to speak to all Americans about the importance of conducting our political debates in a manner and tone that respects our political system and demonstrates to the world the strength of our democracy .
We have a system of government that allows the great issues of our day to be resolved peacefully and civilly and that serves as a beacon of hope to those around the world who yearn for political freedom , political stability , and governing without the threat of violence .
We have a system that allows people to express approval of their government or change the party in power peaceably through the ballot box .
Our Constitution affords Americans the right to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
Clearly , we have different positions on the merits of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act .
However , we together call on elected officials of both parties to set an example of the civility we want to see in our citizenry .
We also call on all Americans to respect differences of opinion , to refrain from inappropriate forms of intimidation , to reject violence and vandalism , and to scale back rhetoric that might reasonably be misinterpreted by those prone to such behavior .
Most press coverage of the eurozone troubles has focused on Greece , which is understandable : Greece is up against the wall to a greater extent than anyone else .
But the Greek economy is also very small ; in economic terms the heart of the crisis is in Spain , which is much bigger .
And as I ’ve tried to point out in a number of posts , Spain ’s troubles are not , despite what you may have read , the result of fiscal irresponsibility .
Instead , they reflect “ asymmetric shocks ” within the eurozone , which were always known to be a problem , but have turned out to be an even worse problem than the euroskeptics feared .
So I thought it might be useful to lay out , in a handful of pictures , how Spain got into its current state .
( All of the data come from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database ) .
There ’s a kind of classic simplicity about the story — it ’s almost like a textbook example .
Unfortunately , millions of people are suffering the consequences .
The story begins with the Spanish real estate bubble .
In Spain , as in many countries including our own , real estate prices soared after 2000 .
This brought massive inflows of capital ; within Europe , Germany moved into huge current account surplus while Spain and other peripheral countries moved into huge deficit :
IMF
These big capital inflows produced a classic transfer problem : they raised demand for Spanish goods and services , leading to substantially higher inflation in Spain than in Germany and other surplus countries .
Here ’s a comparison of GDP deflators ( remember , both countries are on the euro , so the divergence reflects a rise in Spain ’s relative prices ) :
IMF
But then the bubble burst , leaving Spain with much reduced domestic demand — and highly uncompetitive within the euro area thanks to the rise in its prices and labor costs .
If Spain had had its own currency , that currency might have appreciated during the real estate boom , then depreciated when the boom was over .
Since it did n’t and does n’t , however , Spain now seems doomed to suffer years of grinding deflation and high unemployment .
Where are budget deficits in all this ?
Spain ’s budget situation looked very good during the boom years .
It is running huge deficits now , but that ’s a consequence , not a cause , of the crisis : revenue has plunged , and the government has spent some money trying to alleviate unemployment .
Here ’s the picture :
IMF
So , whose fault is all this ?
Nobody ’s , in one sense .
In another sense , Europe ’s policy elite bears the responsibility : it pushed hard for the single currency , brushing off warnings that exactly this sort of thing might happen ( although , as I said , even euroskeptics never imagined it would be this bad ) .
Am I calling , then , for breakup of the euro .
No : the costs of undoing the thing would be immense and hugely disruptive .
I think Europe is now stuck with this creation , and needs to move as quickly as possible toward the kind of fiscal and labor market integration that would make it more workable .
But oh , what a mess .
For the last few years , Mark Sisson has been a central figure in the growing movement of individuals who reject the politicized conventional wisdom on food and exercise , and instead have embraced a lifestyle that puts the " real " back into their world .
The main thrust behind the paleo or primal lifestyle is that we humans are hunter - gatherers , and our genes are partial to real food just like our ancestors .
We have not evolved to adapt to the heavily processed , sugary , high - carbohydrate , grain - loaded , corn oil - crazed garbage diet of the modern era .
Oftentimes , those of us who reject this conventional diet negatively refer to it as the Standard American Diet ( SAD ) .
The effects of this food have been devastating on all of human health , and not only in America .
Everywhere the SAD is embraced , people are suffering all of the same afflictions associated with modern western civilization : obesity , diabetes , inflammation , autoimmune disorders , gluten intolerance , heart disease , cancer , ambiguous mental disorders ( such as depression and anxiety ) , and dubious behavioral disorders .
In 2009 , Mark Sisson released his book that promotes his principles of food and diet , as well as all the aspects of living that make us whole , healthy , and happy .
Sisson ’s Primal Blueprint : Reprogram Your Genes for Effortless Weight Loss , Vibrant Health , and Boundless Energy , is based on the enormous amount of material Mark has made available on his superb and informing website , Mark ’s Daily Apple , since 2006 .
His message , in short , is eat real food , move around a lot , do n’t overtrain to gain , and get some sun without gobs of Coppertone SPF 85 covering your body and blocking that healthy — and necessary — Vitamin D .
Anti-State and Pro-Person
There are a few Kings of Paleo who have won international notoriety .
Among the most well - know are Loren Cordain , PhD , founder of the Paleo Diet , and Dr. Michael R. Eades , MD , the prolific author of numerous books and proprietor of an outstanding website .
Then there ’s Mark Sisson .
Mark Sisson is a lean , blonde surfer - looking guy who , at fifty - something years old , can turn conventional wisdom on its ear .
He is unique in that he is not a doctor or a PhD , but rather a former world - class athlete who has lived , obsessed , and lost from his many years of following The Conventional Wisdom .
As he puts it , his book :
Represents the culmination of my primal philosophy , which has taken shape over the past 20 years through extensive research and life experience .
I am not a scientist or doctor ; I ’m an athlete , a coach , and a student on a lifelong quest for exceptional health , happiness , and peak performance .
I have an insatiable curiosity about what we need to do to achieve such goals and a growing mistrust of the answers that have been heaped upon us by the traditional pillars of health " wisdom " ( Big Pharma , Big Agra , the AMA , the FDA , and other government agencies ) , the health and fitness profiteers glorified by Madison Avenue , and even the know - it - all multilevel marketer next door .
The Primal Blueprint : ... Sisson , Mark Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 4.70 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
That paragraph does n’t need a MasterCard jingle alongside it to be deemed priceless .
In addition , Sisson clearly affirms his lack of ties to any government agency or special interests that will force - feed and filter his message .
He ’s just a regular guy who stands alone and passes on his immense knowledge from his years of research , practical application , and commitment to truth .
In fact , the book ’s premise is to show you how to take control of your health and fitness through food and activity by making educated decisions based on relevant and clear - cut information .
That ’s what makes him so unique and special in an industry — health and fitness — that misinforms , shills for special interests , and consistently trots out one moneymaking gimmick after another .
Mark Sisson is the first person that I am aware of who used and promoted the " primal " label .
Primal and paleo are often used interchangeably by various whole food enthusiasts , but there are major differences between strict primal or strict paleo , or even general low - carb diets , such as diverging views on oils , grains , and saturated fat .
Those are distinctions I do n’t really care about for purposes of this review .
Readers can do their own research to judge the merits of various food worldviews .
What I care about is adopting — and teaching — the habit of learning about , selecting , and eating only natural , whole , real foods that we , as humans , were meant to consume .
If you are a person who desires to cut corners in the short - term , slim down for your sister ’s wedding , or make a New Year ’s or " Summer Beach " resolution , do n’t read this book .
It is not for you .
This book is about lifestyle , not fad diet .
The book recommends suitable activity that you can maintain without devoting tons of your free time or becoming an exercise addict .
The book stresses the tenets of engaging life and health over time , not going from beer - and - bread gut to buff in sixty days , or looking thin for a one - night party or a series of wedding photographs .
What I like most about Sisson ’s book is that he can engage the average , curious reader where other authors have been less successful .
For those who are interested in the more complex science of food , Dr. Eades and others have written phenomenal books for food and nutrition hobbyists .
I love to read all of those books , but I know that most of my non -hobbyist friends will not stay interested long enough for the information to be absorbed and the good habits integrated into their lives .
That is why I recommend Primal Blueprint to everyone who wishes to engage my knowledge on the topic of food and diet .
Mark ’s style is for the layman .
He takes science and pares it down to simple and intuitive principles for living .
He offers no gimmicks , no promises , no regimens , and he does n’t offer to provide you with expensive and ridiculous meal plans .
Again , the premise of Primal Blueprint is putting the responsibility for your health into your hands , and teaching you how to win control over your life in spite of the numerous sources of conventional wisdom that are consistently shilling for big politics , special interests , and the establishment .
Practice , Not Perfection
A unique perspective from Sisson , that he advocates before his introduction , is his " 80 % Rule . "
I like this inclusion because I ’ve always lived by a similar standard .
This refers to his belief that you avoid failure by not striving for total perfection .
In other words , forget the strict regimen , and instead , as he states , " build momentum toward becoming even more compliant , with less effort , as time proceeds . "
After all , can you think of anything that leads to more " failures " and discouragement in peoples ’ lives than diet and / or exercise programs ?
Most people always fail at diet and exercise because they set painstaking regimens that ca n’t be easily adhered to , and this results in disillusionment , and eventually , the person walks away and often goes on a binge in the opposite direction .
Do n’t get me wrong — Mark Sisson ’s Primal Blueprint does n’t allow for " occasionally " ingesting toxic foods , or being self - destructive twenty percent of the time .
Instead , he tries to lure the reader into dropping the obsessive , regimented mentality of most short - term " diets " while making the best decisions possible within the constraints of your current conditions .
In essence , the Sisson eating philosophy takes into account that people have " real - world concerns " and they need to strive for obtainable goals .
Challenging the Establishment
Early on in Primal Blueprint , Sisson sets the pace for his dissent when he introduces his framework for challenging the conventional wisdom .
He attacks and counters the traditional folly on grains , cholesterol , fiber , saturated animal fat , cardio training , strength training , sunlight , Big Pharma ’s poison , results - oriented goals , and most importantly , meal habits .
He points out that the establishment view , which suggests that our genes determine our destiny and we just have to buy into the results , is pure fabrication .
This perspective , in fact , supports the large and wealthy pharmaceutical and medical interests that claim you need its products / services to be healthy and whole .
Thus the excuse mongering is a win-win for the powerful and wealthy establishment - based industries , and it is the equivalent of surrender for you , the individual .
The Sisson approach is that although some of us may have shortcomings or genetic tendencies , in the end it is we , as individuals , who make the lifestyle choices that determine our outcome .
In a sense , he is staunchly denying the victimology that is promoted by the Conventional Wisdomists , and in its place he provides a program for what he calls " controlling how your genes express themselves in constantly rebuilding , repairing , and renewing your cells . "
In Sisson ’s view , it is almost impossible , for most people , to be ,
… lean , fit , energetic , and healthy following Conventional Wisdom . "
Instead , we succumb to the forces of consumerism designed to placate our pain with silly shortcuts , comforts , conveniences , and indulgences .
… A huge percentage of all doctor visits today are a direct consequence of lifestyle choices that are misaligned with the environmental and survival conditions that shaped our primal genetic makeup .
All of the erroneous information handed down by the Conventional Wisdomists over the years has led to , as Sisson describes it , " one giant step backward for mankind . "
Only lifestyle modifications at the individual level can turn the momentum around in your favor .
It ’s the Insulin , Stupid
In the chapter " Primal Blueprint Eating Philosophy , " Sisson gathers up quite a few stones and heaves them at the establishment ’s hypotheses on some of the nagging issues of our time , like insulin , cholesterol , and macro nutrients .
Here is where I come across one of the few quibbles I have with this book , and it ’s a relatively minor one .
I think he should have turned the " calories in , calories out " concept on its ear .
The problem for most people is the regimen mentality , especially concerning calories .
Since we already know that body composition is more sophisticated than " calories in , calories out " ( see Gary Taubes ’s Good Calories , Bad Calories ) , the system of counting calories — in meals , with pedometers , etc. — is , and has always been , a recipe for failure for almost everyone .
This is one area I wish that Sisson would attack with more fervor .
However , Sisson does emphasize that an eating program in the style of Primal Blueprint , with an 80 % rule , will successfully optimize your end results .
The rest of the chapter is where Sisson really shines in his ability to make tedious biochemical particulars easily understood , and dare I say — exciting .
Until people understand what it is that insulin does to their bodies , and how processed carbohydrates drive insulin production , they cannot possibly make informed decisions on food choices .
Sisson does a marvelous job of simplifying some complicated concepts on the issue .
Another big hitting point for Sisson is the vilification of cholesterol by the establishment hacks that do the bidding for Big Pharma and the medical establishment while they nurture your sickness to keep their industries in high demand .
He calls attention to one of the great scams of our lifetimes — the lipid hypothesis of heart disease .
Along with that he discusses the irrelevance of total cholesterol numbers , and how the Lords of conventional wisdom have used that as a diagnostic tool for disease and , of course , the need for pharmaceutical drugs .
Sisson includes several pages of important and easily understood material about cholesterol and its breakdown between HDL , LDL , and types of LDL .
It ’s important that people understand how the medical establishment has come to demonize cholesterol and categorize otherwise healthy Americans as " sick " based on a numbers game — a game where the acceptable cholesterol numbers keep being lowered in order to get more people in the " sick " category , and therefore produce new patients for Big Pharma ’s very profitable statin drugs .
A Couple of Real Pyramids to Live By
The Primal Blueprint food pyramid , unlike the government ’s fraudulent apparatus , is not influenced by food subsidies , profiteering politics , special interests , or payoffs from powerful players in the food industry .
You wo n’t see a primal pyramid recommending 6 — 11 servings daily of bread , pasta , and cereal .
Low - fat diets that emphasize grains have made people fat , and not just here in America .
In Sisson ’s view , vegetables , fruit , meat , fish , fowl , and eggs should sit at the bottom portion of the food pyramid .
He includes a primer on fats and oils — I especially note his wicked defense of healthy - yet - demonized fats and oils ( coconut oil , unprocessed palm oil , lard , tallow , butter , etc. ) that became politically unpopular because of the drive to promote the subsidized oils ( think corn and soybean ) that are heavily refined and genetically engineered .
In keeping with the 80 % Rule , even dark chocolate — with 70 % or more cocoa — and alcohol make the grade when consumed moderately , in Sisson ’s primal world .
Sisson also gives his version of the primal fitness pyramid .
Mark thinks people should spend most of their exercise time moving frequently , and at a slow pace .
That is to be punctuated with moments of short intense efforts ( intervals ) and full - body functional strength sessions .
Primal fitness has the goal of avoiding overtraining , or as Sisson often calls it , chronic cardio .
This advice comes from a guy who was a pre-med student and a world - class endurance athlete .
Sisson was a top five finisher in the 1980 US National Marathon Championships , and he won a qualifying spot for the 1980 US Olympic Trials , that is , until illness and injury took a toll on his athletic career .
Since he discovered that too much exercise is detrimental rather than beneficial , he has worked hard to convince others that chronic cardio or endurance sports lead to sickness , burnout , hormone problems , injuries , and the acceleration of aging and disease .
I often note that professional endurance athletes often look like aging skeletons at a young age .
Most triathletes and marathoners look aged beyond their years , and even my favorite athlete , Tour de France cycling champ Lance Armstrong , looked like an old man at the young age of thirty - four .
Your Doctor and Personal Trainer Are Making You Fat
Early in the book , Sisson states in his book that his goal is to " expose much of the lucrative health and fitness industry as ethically and scientifically bankrupt . "
He follows that with his sage advice on a non-gimmicky fitness approach and some intense coaching on how to take total control over the food choices you make .
Mark Sisson calls himself " non-political , " but his message is unmistakably libertarian .
Adding my own two cents , I ’d prefer to get a bit nastier than Sisson and make the statement that the majority of the mainstream mob of medical doctors , so - called nutritionists , dieticians , health experts , and personal trainers are know - nothing , conventionalist hacks with a paper degree who lack any real passion or knowledge of the topics for which they claim expertise .
My burning question has always been this : what makes a medical doctor — even if he is a great doctor — an automatic " expert " on food and nutrition , let alone exercise ?
Answer : nothing at all .
People make the mistake of automatically granting expertise to their ( often overweight ) family medical doctor who had very little in the way of basic nutrition training way back in those medical school days .
Unless an MD has a burning passion for deeper knowledge on food and nutrition science , or has actually gone into the field professionally , he ’s not sitting around reading the food and nutrition science journals and following the hot and debated issues of the day .
So , in my mind , you need to forget your family doctor ’s uninformed , pharmaceutical - influenced advice and learn to control your own destiny through a process of self - education .

Burning question number two : look around you at any gym , and tell me about all of the overweight , pudgy , or big - gut personal trainers you see training other people at $ 60 + per hour ?
Every day I see " personal trainers " doing the following : 1 ) sitting at their laptop and shouting out to their clients as they do a routine 2 ) lazily plopping down on benches and drinking huge , sugar - loaded coffees while they yell out useless instructions to a paying client , and 3 ) having clients do a zillion sets and reps of deep - knee bends or working with sitting machine exercises like leg extensions or useless abductor / adductor movements .
When you realize how easily and quickly one can get a paper certificate to " certify " himself / herself as a " trainer , " then you realize why the industry is such a joke .
In fact , I ’d go so far as to say that most of the personal training industry exists to keep out potential competitors — who do n’t have paper certificates — while it hoodwinks its uninformed subjects with lots of undelivered promises and ill - informed instruction at exorbitant prices .
On the Eve of Destruction ?
To wrap up , Sisson makes some of his strongest — and best — statements in the book ’s conclusion .
Stepping back for a moment to grab a wide - angle view of the wide angles in the buffet line at a Vegas casino , it ’s evident how ridiculously out of control this situation has become .
No offense , but Americans look like one giant yard of fattened cattle ready for slaughter , complete with a significant percentage of " downers " ( a term for sick cattle that ca n’t stand up ; they are dragged with forklifts to slaughter ) .
Sisson ’s scrutiny is more than welcome here .
He brings up one of my favorite topics , time preferences , which play a huge role in obesity , food choices , and selecting a fitness program .
Of course , I have found that it is always very politically incorrect to associate time preferences with behavioral choices because people take those criticisms personally and tend to get defensive .
Sisson points out :
Today , peak physical and intellectual performance and self - discipline are no longer requirements for survival .
Man has become self - indulgent and has reverted to behaviors that provide short - term gratification .
Therefore , it follows that Sisson ’s Primal Blueprint lays out a plan for humans who live in the modern world to revert to some of the habits and characteristics of our primal ancestors .
Otherwise , the populace will become sicker and fatter , creating more permanent patients for Big Pharma and Big Medicine .
We know that bookstores are loaded with an abundance of " health " and " fitness " books that offer up one tediously conventional bit of useless wisdom after another .
Just walk into a Borders or Barnes & Noble and look up front near the entrance doors .
You ’ll see piles of books , all with fluffy names and great covers plastered with beautiful people who call out to you as you walk by .
These books sell , but they are rarely read .
It ’s just like the plethora of treadmills , Nordic Track skiers , Bowflex machines , and assorted home ellipticals that have come to make for handy clothes hangers in the home until they eventually sell for one - third price on Craigslist .
Primal Blueprint wo n’t provide a convenient spot to hang yesterday ’s sweater — it exists to be read .
And then read again .
All said and done , I have not come across a single book that is so readable , so comprehensive , and so full of bona fide information , along with the presentation of an entire foundation for finally succeeding at food and fitness .
Sisson is interesting , engaging , and fun .
He plays Frisbee and runs the beach in five - fingered shoes .
His writing pops out at the reader who needs a little coaxing , and it can hold the attention of the experienced primalist who needs a little brushing up or extra motivation .
Compare that with the boring and unappealing Dean Ornish , with his fatty and inflamed face , who advocates a low - fat , vegetarian , pro-soy diet and sells the conventional lipid hypothesis of heart disease .
Sisson ’s book , because of its variety , exceptional detail , readability , unconventional writing , and irreverence , is the single best book available on the subject of changing your life and health through diet and exercise .
As hard as I looked for faults , I found very few points to criticize .
Well , I can think of one bone of contention — he emphasizes a few too many sentences with exclamation points (! ) , and that could be tamed a bit .
I like Sisson ’s model primal human , Grok , and how he uses Grok as a symbol for model living .
Grok lives in the modern world but reverts to the best habits of his ancestors in order that he may mimic some of those fight - or - flight survival tactics that made Grok so adaptive and healthy .
I just do n’t fancy the mainstream media and its fascination with the use of the " caveman " term when writing about the primal or paleo real - food , real - fitness lifestyle .
It gets a bit tedious and obnoxious .
Sisson wisely avoids that comparison .
Get primal , get paleo — or whatever you want to call it .
Just start to critically assess the received opinion that has made you a pawn for large , wealthy food and medical interests that use government to keep you in their vicious circle of bad food and enduring illness .
Sisson notes that his book can be " the centerpiece of a vibrant community of people connected by the Internet and committed to living their lives to the fullest potential , challenging the status quo , and trying something old . "
Amen .
If you finish Sisson ’s book and are not completely motivated to have a " processed food throwing - out party " and hit the ground running toward a more vibrant life of real food and real fitness , then there ’s probably not much in life that can motivate you .

Policies to Improve Affordability and Accountability
Example for a family of four with income of $ 66,000 :
Maximum percent of income paid for premiums : 9.5 %
Percent of costs paid by health insurance plan : 70 %
Penalty for remaining uninsured : ( in 2016 ) the higher of $ 695 ( with indexed increases ) or 2.5 % of income
Hardship exemption – threshold income below which the penalty is waived :
The income tax filing threshold ( $ 9,350 for a single or $ 18,700 for a married couple in 2009 )

Comment :
By Don McCanne , MD
The greatest significance of President Obama ’s health care reform proposal released today is that he has now formally placed his stamp of approval on the fundamental policies already contained in the House and Senate reform bills .
While remaining silent on some of the third rail issues ( public option , Medicare buy - in , pregnancy termination , etc. ) , he and his staff merely tweaked the bills and added insurance premium rate review , whatever that ’s worth , and some rhetoric on waste , fraud , and abuse .
His proposal still falls far short on two of the most important goals of reform : 1 ) insuring everyone , and 2 ) ensuring that health care is affordable for each of us .
Merely tweaking the Senate version , which is what they did , could not have attained these goals since the most effective policies were already traded away before serious negotiations began .
That said , let ’s look at what the President expects a family of four with an income of $ 66,000 to pay for health care .
The premium contribution would be 9.5 % of income , or $ 6270 for the basic plan with an actuarial value of 70 % .
If they wanted or needed a better plan , they would have to pay the full difference in the premium .
At an actuarial value of 70 % , they would also have to pay an average of 30 % of all health care costs .
This can vary considerably because of plan design in the form of deductibles , copayments , coinsurance , non-covered benefits , stop loss , out - of - network care exempt from stop loss , and other factors .
If they either elected not to or were unable to pay the premium , they would have to pay a penalty of $ 1650 , but then , of course , they would have no protection at all against potential health care costs .
Clearly , President Obama has not done any better than Congress in protecting families from financial hardship should they have the misfortune of developing significant medical problems .
Unaffordable underinsurance is not the change that we needed .

Writing is a way of organizing our thoughts and making better sense of our world .
I would even consider it a form of contemplative meditation .
When writing , we connect different concepts together in our heads , mull over different ideas , and often aim at trying to paint a picture or tell some kind of story , narrative , or theme .
“ Meditation is the tongue of the soul and the language of our spirit . ”
– Jeremy Taylor
Whenever we write we are embracing these ideas , allowing them to be expressed , and letting their energy flow through us onto the paper .
Throughout this creative process we too are changing .
We are not only becoming more aware of our inner world of meaning , but at the same time we are given a medium to release these built up thoughts , ideas , stresses and desires .
We are practicing a form of alchemy – by channeling our energies from something psychological to something material and tangible .
It ’s a healing process
Like all forms of art therapy , writing can be healing ; that is why I encourage everyone to pursue some kind of creative endeavor .
It allows us to step back and put the world into perspective .
It also gives us a sense of power and purpose , so we do n’t feel completely swallowed up by our daily anxieties , stresses , and fears .
When we create we have something to be proud of , something to show for our efforts , and something that is distinctly unique and ours .
This builds up our self - worth and inspires us to be more productive .
Pursing any art has shown to do some incredible things for mental health , and it plays a big role in what Positive Psychologist Martin Seligman calls The Meaningful Life , which he considers a central component to happiness .
Carl Jung saw the manifestations of our dreams as ways in which our psyche maintains homeostasis and balance .
I believe art and writing can have the same effect .
This one video supports this point by showing how art therapy can be used effectively in treating those with schizophrenia .
Do a little everyday
Whether your thing is writing , painting , dancing , or playing guitar , try to do a little bit of it everyday .
Think of it as your daily meditation or prayer .
It is your way of provoking reality and creating a world of meaning and purpose .
Many people find it therapeutic to keep a journal or diary .
Personally , I have been maintaining this blog since June of last year and I already feel ten times better mentally , emotionally , and spiritually .
I like to write music too , but writing is something that resonates with me at a level I can manage the best .
It clears up my thoughts in ways that I find hard accomplishing with other arts .
But , everyone may be a little different .
Writing is easy to become engaged in
For many , pursuing an art or writing is a lot more fun and exciting than meditation .
While meditation is about stillness and silence , art gives us a way to find tranquility through active expression .
When you finish a piece of writing or art there is a wave of relaxation and comfort , not to mention a distinct sense of pride and accomplishment .
So for those who find it difficult to spend time on the cushion , why not turn to writing and art as a secondary form of meditation ?
It could even still be considered a spiritual practice .
After all , who says we need religion and false dogmas ?
Maybe the true evolution of man is when we recognize that we can harness the same creative power of nature that we so often attribute to God .
In a sense , our capacity for creativity and innovation may even make us out to be our own gods and goddesses .
In this recognition , we are aware of our own divinity .
When we find something we love doing , it becomes much easier to be engaged in .
And engagement is an important aspect to any meditative or spiritual practice .
A stronger sense of self
When we walk away from a piece of writing we have a stronger sense of ourselves .
We are a part of the transformation and by the end of the process we have been re-born into something new .
And – is n’t this often the crux of any meditation practice ?
To increase self - awareness and to watch ourselves grow and change with time ?
Should n’t we all practice this to some degree , even if it is only to facilitate our own personal development and well - being ?
Just a few minutes a day of reflection and writing can aid one ’s life in so many different ways .
The mental state of writing
When we are physically in the state of writing it is just like a state of deep contemplation .
We become absorbed in the process of our ideas , thoughts , feelings and emotions .
We then attempt to integrate them all in a way that reveals a clear message .
When I am in a state of writing that cannot be disturbed it is like I am in a trance .
All my focus is concentrated on the task at hand and on accomplishing what it is I am setting out to do .
All of my being is dedicated into channeling my energy outwards into my creation .

Fast food , frighteningly slow decay : Mother keeps McDonald 's Happy Meal for a whole year ... and it STILL has n't gone off
Advertisement
Glancing at the two McDonald 's Happy Meals pictured here , you may feel they look pretty much identical .
Astonishingly , however , this is the same meal , photographed 12 months apart .
Where any other food might be a mouldy , decomposing mess after a year , the McDonald 's meal shows few signs of going off apart from the beef patty shrivelling and the stale burger bun cracking .
I had the windows open many times , but flies and other insects just ignored the Happy Meal .
What does that tell you , if they can't be bothered with it ?
Proof , says the American nutritionist who took these photographs , that it contains so many preservatives that it is bad for the children it is aimed at .
Joann Bruso said : ' Food is supposed to decompose , go bad and smell foul eventually .
The fact that it has not decomposed shows you how unhealthy it is for children . '
Mrs Bruso left the Happy Meal uncovered on a shelf at her home near Denver , Colorado , to see what would happen .
She has revealed the results on her blog , in which she gives healthy eating advice to parents .
The 62 - year - old , who has eight grandchildren , admitted that the arid temperature of her home near the Rocky Mountains meant there was little moisture in the air with which to speed decomposition .
Health concerns : Blogger Joann Bruso
But she added that during the year - long experiment , no flies or other insects were attracted to the food .
She said : ' I had the windows open many times , but flies and other insects just ignored the Happy Meal .
What does that tell you , if they can't be bothered with it ?
' Food is broken down into its essential nutrients in our bodies and turned into fuel .
Our children grow strong bodies when they eat real food .
' If flies ignore a Happy Meal and microbes do n't decompose it , then your child 's body can't properly metabolise it either .
' Now you know why it 's called junk food . '
McDonald 's has made great efforts to show that its food is healthy amid growing concerns about childhood obesity .
All its restaurants list the calories in each item as well as the individual ingredients .
Recent research showed that each product has an average of seven E numbers .
The bun has several preservatives such as calcium and sodium propionate , while the pickle slice has the preservative sodium benzoate .

Dec 17 ( Reuters ) - A “ cap and dividend ” bill introduced in the U.S. Senate last week would reduce the role of Wall Street in carbon markets by returning money raised from emissions credit auctions to the public .
It stands in contrast to the climate bill stalled in the Senate that would likely have a “ cap and trade ” market at its heart more open to trading of emissions permits by companies and investors .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hopes climate legislation could be taken up by the full Senate in early spring .
Below are some of the differences between the two market plans .
Cap and trade is represented as “ C&T ” while the other is “ C&D ” .
STATUS OF THE BILLS
* A climate bill with C&T passed narrowly in the House of Representatives in June , known as Waxman - Markey after its sponsors .
In the Senate , Democrat John Kerry , Republican Lindsey Graham , and independent Joe Lieberman , are working on compromise legislation that builds on the House bill , but they have not decided on they method to price carbon .
They are casting the bill as one that would create jobs
* The C&D bill was introduced last week by Senators Maria Cantwell , a Democrat , and Susan Collins , a Republican .
It comes late in the game as many lawmakers are already committed to C&T .
It would also have to be passed in the House .
KEY SUPPORTERS
* The Obama administration , many Democrats in Congress and major environmental groups support C&T , saying it is the most efficient way to cut emissions .
* The C&D bill has not been out long enough to garner as much attention .
HOW THE BILLS ARE BEING TOUTED - JOBS AND CHECKS
* Kerry , Graham and Lieberman are touting the compromise bill , which would likely contain C&T , as legislation that will add jobs in clean energy like nuclear and solar and wind power .
* C&D would result in tax - free monthly checks sent to every American and averaging $ 1,100 a year for a family of four .
RISKS
* C&T opponents do not want Washington to establish what could become a trillion - dollar carbon market after recent massive mismanagement in the banking industry and lack of government oversight .
* C&D opponents say the system does not give companies enough flexibility to convert to renewable energy like wind and solar or buy offsets .
COMPLEXITY OF THE BILLS
* C&T bill , known as Kerry - Boxer in the Senate , is over 1,000 pages .
* C&D came in at under 40 pages .
TARGETS OF THE 2 PLANS
* C&T targets big polluters , such as power plants , oil refineries , and makers of glass , cement and chemicals .
Transportation sources would also be targeted .
* C&D only targets producers and importers of fossil fuels such as coal mining companies and oil importers .
HOW THEY WOULD WORK
* C&T would initially auction 25 percent of the permits to pollute and distribute the rest of the permits to polluters .
The proceeds would go to state regulators to invest in cutting power bills or to develop energy efficiency programs .
Companies and investors would be allowed to sell the permits in a market to polluters that need the credits to meet an ever - declining emissions cap .
The market gives companies the option of cutting their own output of greenhouse gases or buying credits representing emissions cuts .
* C&D would institute monthly auctions in which companies covered by the legislation would have to buy permits to pollute .
Most of the proceeds would go to the public , while 25 percent would go to the development of clean energy .
EMISSIONS TARGETS
* C&T backers are focusing on a 17 percent cut by 2020 under 2005 levels , with much stronger cuts by 2050 .
* C&D backers want a reduction of 20 percent by 2020 under 2005 levels and stronger cuts by 2050 .
PARIS , France —
By the time Gregory Hendricks noticed his wife ’s passport was missing during their Paris - bound flight from Washington Dulles International airport , it was already too late .
After they arrived at Paris ’ Charles De Gaulle airport , the Hendricks were escorted through a security checkpoint to board a return flight home .
The in - flight theft that Gregory Hendricks blames for ruining the surprise French vacation he gave his wife might be more common than you think .
While no government agency or industry group keeps statistics on in - flight theft , it ’s not hard to find examples of the crime .
Last month , five business - class passengers traveling from Tokyo on an overnight Air France flight to Paris woke to find 4,000 euros in cash and other currency missing .
A police investigation is ongoing in that case .
In April , the son of television actress Cybill Shepherd is scheduled to stand trial for in - flight theft .
Cyrus Shepherd - Oppenheim , 22 , was arrested last month after passengers identified him as the person who stole cash , a digital camera and other items from the carry - on bags of fellow travelers during a flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia .
“ There ’s a false sense of security on a plane , ” said Steven Frischling , a frequent flyer turned airline industry blogger , who has written about the subject .
“ People feel safe because they ’re in a confined metal tube .
What can happen ? ”
Once passengers disembark and the items are gone , there is little anyone can do .
The Tokyo - Paris flight may have attracted attention because it involved a large sum and it occurred in a business - class cabin , which is generally smaller and thought to be safer .
Nevertheless , an Air France spokeswoman said , “ Passengers bear the sole responsibility for baggage that is not checked - in . ”
The company maintained that such occurrences are “ infinitesimal ” when considering that the airline transports about 150,000 passengers on 1,700 flights daily .
Detectives in flights ’ destination cities do follow up on cases and network with each other , according to Paul Sireci , the chief of police at Tampa International Airport .
His department , for instance , generated seven in - flight theft reports in 2008 , compared to 131 theft reports airport - wide .
“ If you are a victim of a theft then one theft is a problem , ” Sireci wrote in an email .
“ But considering the number of flights we have during the year , seven reports of theft is a very small occurrence . ”
The incident involving the Tokyo passengers was covered by the media and likely will be forgotten in a few months .
But for passengers who ’ve experienced a similar inconvenience , it ’s a lesson learned hard and remembered .
“ I was kind of jaded in thinking that people who made that trip were pretty honest folks , ” said Hendricks , 49 , by telephone .
Asked why , he said , “ because of the price of the ticket . ”
Upon further reflection , he added , “ Now , it might be why they can afford to fly . ”
How they do it
Frischling said he has been in anonymous contact with thieves who make a living stealing at airports .
“ There is a definite method to doing this , ” he said .
In - flight thieves , Frischling said , would be likely to check - in online 24 hours in advance , picking a seat toward the rear of the plane .
They prefer aisle seats and may feign an injury so they ’re allowed to board early .
This way , they can observe who is putting what where and how into the overhead bins .
Are fellow passengers placing the zipper side of a suitcase toward the back wall or not , allowing for easy access ?
Which bags have locks ?
Are laptops being stored overhead ?
Or the culprit could be one ’s seatmate , as Paula Patrice , a New - York based model and actress , suspected when $ 350 was missing from a wallet inside her large Louis Vuitton bag after she used the restroom during a flight .
When she was n’t able to produce $ 5 to pay the flight attendant for her beverage even though she knew it had been there just moments before , “ I was conflicted , so I did nothing , ” she wrote in an email .
“ It seemed like there was no good recourse . ”
Patrice , a frequent traveler , did n’t want to cause a scene or accuse her seatmate without any firm evidence .
“ She did n’t take the wallet , so how does one identify cash ? ” said Patrice .
Hendricks said he remembered a man coming from the back of the plane and rummaging through the compartment above his seat .
At the time , “ I was thinking there is no room up there , ” he said , but he did not say anything .
Passengers are generally too polite to stare and reluctant to speak up , Frischling said .
Thieves are also rather specific about what they ’re looking for : wallets , cell phones , compact cameras and other small electronics that can be sold on eBay or to a pawnshop , Frischling said .
Passports are usually not their primary targets since doctoring them has become increasingly difficult .
Hendricks said that after informing the crew about the missing passport , he innocently thought passengers would be searched as they exited the plane .
“ I thought they would stop everyone before they got too far . ”
But all the flight attendants could do was search the cabin and apologize .
Lessons learned
“ I ’m a savvy sort of person , ” said Tom Hayes , 59 , an international labor expert .
“ I know how to look after myself . ”
But he distracted and tired last month on an American Airlines overnight flight from Chicago to Brussels , when his passport disappeared .
Hayes was seated in business class and allowed the flight attendant to hang up his jacket in a closet with his Irish passport inside .
Normally , he said , he would n’t have left the passport in the jacket pocket .
Had he not been a “ middle - aged white guy ” with European Union citizenship , Hayes said , things might have turned out differently at the immigration counter in Belgium where he was allowed to enter the country .
( A spokesman for the Brussels Airport immigration division said border police have the discretion to admit travelers into the country based on some proof of identity . )
“ It ’s not an issue I ’ll be dealing with again , ” Hayes said .
Patrice said she learned to “ keep petty cash on hand separate from your travel stash . ”
The Hendrickses learned a few valuable lessons too .
Since the incident in late 2006 , they have kept their passports “ in one of those carriers that go around your neck and down your shirt . "
The travel insurance they had so dutifully purchased did not protect them from in - flight theft .
And calling the U.S. embassy in Paris on a Sunday for help to replace a stolen passport , Gregory Hendricks said , was “ like getting a recording at a hospital ” that said , “ If this is an emergency , we ’ll be open tomorrow . ”
Field studies with skateboarders show that a hot girl turns men into idiots :
Alternately , a lot of what you 've always thought you knew about testosterone is probably right .
Some Australians recruited male skateboarders , and asked them to perform tricks .
After a break , they were invited back , and asked to perform again , " either for the same male experimenter or for an attractive 18 - year - old female experimenter who was blind to hypotheses . "
With the attractive teen around , testosterone levels shot up , and the boarders increased their tendency to take risks .
Some of those paid off with smooth landings , but the number of cases where they experienced crash landings did , as well .
" These results suggest that men use physical risk taking as a sexual display strategy , " the authors deadpanned .
The downside is that the response to hot girls makes all females think men are idiots :
Apparently , all it takes for a woman to get annoyed at men in general is to think about them subjecting a woman to catcalls .
In psych - speak , said women " experienced greater negative intergroup emotions and motivations towards the outgroup of men after overhearing the cat - call remark . "
So , even if you 're well behaved , you may not escape the stigma of being the same sex as an idiot .
Weird Science publishing , round II : Last time we covered this ground , we 'd mentioned how quirks in the PNAS review system let someone publish a hypothesis that was already obviously incorrect , based on data we 've had for years .
This past week , an article in Nature News made me aware of an entire journal that has dedicated itself to publishing crank material : Medical Hypotheses .
Its founder , a nonscientist , claimed that " The history of science has repeatedly shown that when hypotheses are proposed it is impossible to predict which will turn out to be revolutionary and which ridiculous , " while its current editor has said he " tries to favor unfashionable and unpopular views . "
Of course , a hypothesis that 's inconsistent with data we already have does nobody any good and , in the field of medicine , could be downright dangerous .
Fortunately , peer review should catch many of these ideas — except that Medical Hypotheses has refused to implement peer review .
Issues came to a head when the journal published articles from HIV / AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg ; the ensuing outcry caused publisher Elsevier to put together a panel of experts that eventually withdrew the papers .
Now , Elsevier is demanding that everything get peer reviewed , the editor is refusing , and the dispute may not end until the editor 's contract runs out .
Disappointed , but not depressed :
The competition for places in undergrad institutions has gotten incredibly fierce in recent years , to the extent that I doubt I could manage to get in to the place that awarded me a degree .
Undoubtedly , that 's produced a population of students that have n't ended up with the sort of college achievements they expected — is n't that just a bit depressing ?
Apparently not .
" Results indicate almost no long - term emotional costs of ' shooting for the stars ' rather than planning for the probable , once educational attainment is taken into account . "
The attainment issue is significant — if you bomb out entirely , you 're still going to be at a greater risk for depression .
Why the Crips might want to consider a group coverage plan : Apparently , having health insurance correlates with better survival following gunshot wounds .
Lest you think it 's a matter of the insurance cards deflecting bullets , the authors controlled for the severity of the wounds , and the benefit of insurance remained .
" These findings underscore the need for improvement in social determinants of health , like insurance coverage , among people affected by violent trauma , " said one of the authors .
WARSAW ( Reuters Life ! ) - A Polish priest has installed an electronic reader in his church for schoolchildren to leave their fingerprints in order to monitor their attendance at mass , the Gazeta Wyborcza daily said on Friday .
The pupils will mark their fingerprints every time they go to church over three years and if they attend 200 masses they will be freed from the obligation of having to pass an exam prior to their confirmation , the paper said .
The pupils in the southern town of Gryfow Slaski told the daily they liked the idea and also the priest , Grzegorz Sowa , who invented it .
“ This is comfortable .
We do n’t have to stand in a line to get the priest ’s signature ( confirming our presence at the mass ) in our confirmation notebooks , ” said one pupil , who gave her name as Karolina .

In the documentary Helvetica , incensed graphic designer Michael Bierut hilariously critiques ads from old copies of Life Magazine .
He attacks the verbosity and shrill insistence of early 1950s Coke ads prior to the introduction of Helvetica then flips admiringly to a minimalist ad set in the new font .
Here again is a reminder of how design and material delivery can influence the content of a message .
Just as I ’m not likely to meet many wedding invitations written in a ransom - note font , I ca n’t imagine reading a romantic novel on an e-book .
Given both historical precedent and the exponential rate of media evolution , eventually I will do much of my reading on some kind of e-reader .
Novels did n’t exist without industrialization ( i.e. , the printing press ) .
With the hindsight of history , it ’s easy for us to dismiss as naive the seventeenth - century book collectors who vowed never to own that cheap , ghastly and faddish new thing — the printed book .
Today , newspapers already feel so last century , with their slaughter of trees for a day ’s worth of programming which is pushed at crowds indiscriminately , not pulled selectively by readers .
But then here I am , preferring my tales of head and heart on paper , not any kind of screen .
If I can see the relationship between literacy and democracy with the technological shift from handwritten to printed books , what holds me back from doing the same with digitization , that next step in media evolution ?
The answer lies in the nature of the novel itself .
Medieval literature was laboriously copied by hand .
With this material preference for brevity , the author of medieval literature worked long before the writing advice “ Show ; do n’t tell . ”
Medieval quests were written with bald declarations like , “ He was very afraid . ” Harold Bloom ’s Shakespeare : The Invention of the Human goes so far as to say that a few centuries after the medieval romance , Shakespeare essentially invented the three - dimensional character .
With their self - investigative soliloquies and their observation by an audience , if not other characters , Shakespeare ’s characters are formed within their stories , not before them .
( I know , I know : here come the parchment - and - quill hate mail from the medievalists ) .
But these were plays : as with today ’s noisy , ad - saturated cinema , you had to see them in a crowd , and on their schedule , not yours .
The novel — which you can read on your own schedule — is the child of poetry and drama , and like most children it displays inherited traits from both parents .
Like the hand - copied medieval manuscript , the novel is read in private , not viewed in public like a play .
But the novel also carries the play ’s gene for evolving action and characters - in - flux .
In The Art of the Novel , Milan Kundera admits , “ As soon as you create an imaginary being , a character , you are automatically confronted by the question :
What is the self ?
How can the self be grasped ?
It ’s one of those fundamental questions on which the novel , as novel , is based . ”
In love stories like Mordecai Richler ’s Barney ’s Version or Haruki Murakami ’s Norwegian Wood or Michael Ondaatje ’s The English Patient , characters find out who they are — and are simultaneously revealed to the reader — as they find out who they love .
If that ’s the content I ’m looking for , I want the nakedness , tactility and privacy of a paper book , not the proprietariness and gadgetry of an e-reader .
There ’s a tactile nakedness and independence to the book well - suited to the expansions and confessions I want from literature .
I still have the copy of Louis de Bernières ’s Captain Corelli ’s Mandolin that I read a decade ago on the Greek island of Cephallonia , where the novel is set .
I ’d rather pass a romantic partner that copy , not an e-file .
After all , for the past 400 years , literature has combined abstract words with the subtle physicality of paper books .
That subtlety presents a challenge .
In From Where You Dream : The Process of Writing Fiction , American fiction writer and creative writing professor Robert Olen Butler notes that literature is unique amongst the arts for not being inherently sensuous .
Abstract and symbolic writing does not have the emphatic physicality of theatre , visual art or music .
Books have to make the most of what they ’ve got :
If a romantic novel and I are going to undress each other , I want to feel each page unfurl .
And I want to be able to read it in the bath .
Modern Paleo Principles
By Diana Hsieh
A " paleo " approach to health uses the evolutionary history of homo sapiens , plus the best of modern science , as a broad framework for guiding daily choices about diet , fitness , medicine , and supplementation .
The core of paleo is the diet : it eschews grains , sugars , and modern vegetable oils in favor of high - quality meat , fish , eggs , and vegetables .
The principles below offer further details .
Importantly , the paleo approach is an ever - evolving framework of principles for living well , not dogma written in stone by any supposed authority .
Experts and laypersons in the paleo community differ in some of their recommendations , as well as in their personal choices .
Such debate is healthy , particularly while our knowledge of the principles of robust health remains in its infancy .
Moreover , individuals differ in their tolerances and preferences .
Each individual must experiment to discover what works best for him .
The following recommendations represent my own grasp of the best practices of the paleo approach to nutrition , fitness , and supplementation .
However , I am a layperson : I 'm a philosopher , not a scientist .
These principles represent my own personal opinions .
They should not substitute for your own research , thinking , and experience -- or for the advice of your doctor .

You ’d think that once the Governor of Nevada and his wife revealed they were getting a divorce , it would n’t be such a big problem that he was seeing another woman .
But Gov. Jim Gibbons ( R - NV ) is such a hound that he just ai n’t any governor or any pol .
From his alleged assault of a woman in a parking garage back in 2006 to the girlfriend - texting scandal in 2007 and 2008 , Gibbons really gets around — all the while peppering his antics with completely superrogatory and preposterous statements , likely his recent and deeply TMI claim that he has n’t had sex in 15 years .
And now a local TV station has caught him red- handed — so red - handed he just had to ‘ fess up — taking the texting woman with him to the National Governor ’s Association meeting in Washington after repeatedly denying it .

22 reported dog bite related human fatalities in the United States in 2004 , 2007 - 29 human fatalities , 2008 - 26 .
In 2009 , there were 33 human fatalities .
45 % of the attacks occurred to adults over the age of 18 , and 55 % occurred to ages below .
Pit bull type dogs were responsible for 67 % of fatalities , the next closest breed was the rottweiler at 12 % .
But all dog breeds are potentially dangerous .
In 2000 , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) reported that 25 breeds of dogs were involved in 238 fatal dog bites from 1979 - 1998 .
Here it is the compiled list of the most dangerous dog breeds :
10 . Dalmatian ( Weight : 40 - 70 lbs. )
This breed is distinguished by intelligence and perfect memory , independence and survival instincts .
Sometimes Dalmatians can be aggressive towards people .
9. Boxer ( Weight : 50 - 70 lbs. )
These dogs are intelligent , frisky and full of energy .
It is not so easy to train them as they are self - willed breed .
In addition , boxers are not typically aggressive by nature .
8. Presa Canario ( Weight : 80 - 115 lbs. )
It is well known that an attack of this guard dog can bring to the death any prey .
One of the main features of this dog is fearlessness , huge power and man-stopping ability .
6. Doberman Pinschers ( Weight : 65 - 90 lbs. )
Doberman Pinschers are famed by such features as alertness , intelligence and loyalty .
Therefore they are considered to be one of the best guard dog breeds .
The dog usually attacks only in case its family is in danger or when being provoked .
7. Chow Chow ( Weight : 50 - 70 lbs. )
The Chow Chow seems to be distant and independent , however they require staunch attention .
If badly bred they can become aggressive dogs .
5. Alaskan Malamutes ( Weight : 75 -100 lbs. )
This breed requires a lot of exercises to be happy as being bored they become disobedient .
On the whole their characteristic features are energy and activity .
4. Huskies ( Weight : 44 - 66 lbs. )
Despite of their energy and intelligence this breed is not regarded a good guard dog .
It is caused by its kind temperament and personality characteristics .
However it should be marked that between 1979 and 1997 fifteen fatal cases were caused by huskies .
3. German Shepherds ( Weight : 70 - 100 lbs. )
This breed of dogs is known as a smart and vigilant one .
As German Shepherds proved to be confident and fearless local authorities such as the police K - 9 unit use German Shepherds as a police dog .
2. Rottweilers ( Weight : 100 - 130 lbs. )
Due to their intense territorial instinct these dogs are very aggressive .
Rottweilers are commonly used as guard dogs .
1. Pit Bulls ( Weight : 55 - 65 lbs. )
Pit bull is one of the most brave and dauntless dogs that usually takes on any opponent .
Therefore they take part in dog fighting .
It is common knowledge that this dog breed can even mangle the human to death as pit bull locks its jaws onto the booty until it is dead .
- For each US dog bite fatality there are about 670 hospitalizations and 16,000 emergency room visits , 21,000 other medical visits ( office and clinic ) , and 187,000 non-medically treated bites
- 46.1 % ( nearly half ) of dog bite injuries were triaged in emergency rooms as " urgent-emergent "
- Dog bites are the second highest reason why children seek emergency treatment
That 's about 60,000 bites per fatality and that information is dated .
It is reported today that a US citizen is bitten by a dog every 75 seconds .
Kevin Smith stood me up .
I was scheduled to interview him one - on - one , but he skipped out on our date so he could go ogle the booth babes and tchotchkes at the Belkin booth here at Macworld Expo , apparently .
Snootchie bootchies to you , too , jerk .
( Sob . )
So I had to sit in the audience with all the other sweaty Mac nerds and listen to him tell us how the iPad might change the future of movies .
" Will it change filmmaking ? " Smith said during his question - and - answer session at Macworld Expo 2010 on Thursday .
" I 'm sure it 'll be used to kill somebody in a movie at one point .
Some guy 's got an iPad sticking out of his head .
And Steve Jobs is like , that 's not what I wanted . "
At least he put on a good show .
Hailed by many as the man who made comic - book - loving Star Wars geeks cool , Smith sprinkled words of wisdom in between smatterings of F - bombs and references to his genitalia in response to questions posed by audience members .
Smith was the only celebrity to appear at Macworld Expo now that Apple – led by that guy who wears turtlenecks and granddaddy jeans – has permanently backed out of the 25 - year - old trade show .
The writer and independent director , well known for his films Dogma , Chasing Amy and Mallrats , shared his thoughts on Avatar , the drama between Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno , and the future of independent filmmaking in a troubled economy .
" I enjoyed it for what it was , " Smith said of James Cameron 's Avatar .
" I 'm totally with the big blue fucking cats .
Especially the one cat that was sexy and I wanted to fuck her . "
As for the Tonight Show , Smith snarkily replied that nobody watches either of the hosts ' shows anyway , as shown by their ratings .
He admitted he never watches TV , because , he said , " I smoke a lot of weed so I fall asleep at like 8 o'clock at night . "
Filmmaking students in the audience asked Smith what they should do to succeed as film creators after college .
" I 'd make one , " he said .
" Make one that everybody likes .
What do you think happened ?
Think I was standing over a virgin holding a necronomicon ?
The trick is to make something everybody digs . "
However , Smith , whose mainstream movie Cop Out , starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan , is due in theaters Feb. 26 , acknowledged that the independent cinema scene has fallen on hard times .
He mourned over Disney 's recent shutdown of art - house production company Miramax Films .
" I was very sad when Miramax shuttered , " he said .
" It shows you the state of the business right now .
Hate to throw that out to the independent filmmakers , but the market is fucked . "
Updated 9 p.m. PDT : Smith and I have clarified over Twitter that he did not stand me up ; our inability to connect was likely a failure between public relations flacks .

Various members of the DNC contacted their respective RNC counterparts this week in hopes of getting RNC Chairman Michael Steele to co-sign a document with Kaine.
RNC rejects joint ' civility ' statement
The Republican National Committee has rejected a proposal from its Democratic counterpart to sign a joint “ civility ” statement , POLITICO has learned .
Various members of the DNC — including Chairman Tim Kaine , Executive Director Jen O’Malley Dillon and Communications Director Brad Woodhouse — contacted their respective RNC counterparts this week in hopes of getting RNC Chairman Michael Steele to co-sign a document with Kaine that , in part , called for “ elected officials of both parties to set an example of the civility we want to see in our citizenry . ”

“ We also call on all Americans to respect differences of opinion , to refrain from inappropriate forms of intimidation , to reject violence and vandalism , and to scale back rhetoric that might reasonably be misinterpreted by those prone to such behavior , ” read the proposed joint statement , which came at the end of a week that saw acts of vandalism and threats of violence directed at members of Congress from both parties , but mostly aimed at Democrats who voted yes on the health care bill .
Republicans see the statement as an attempt to force them to either reject the statement — allowing Democrats to say the RNC finds the incidents acceptable — or to sign on to something that the DNC would later wield against them .
The proposed statement was faxed and hand - delivered to the RNC at midmorning Friday .
POLITICO learned Friday afternoon that the RNC would not sign the DNC statement .
RNC Communications Director Doug
Heye told POLITICO that Steele chose not to agree to the statement because “ we do n’t need to do anything on their schedule or on their timetable . ”
“ Obviously , a large majority of Americans — a broad coalition of Republicans , Democrats and independents — are upset that President Obama , Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid pushed through health care legislation that increases premiums and raises taxes and did so through strong - arm tactics , closed - door meetings and sweetheart deals .
Voters have a right to be angry .
Unfortunately , some have chosen to engage in language and actions that go too far , ” Heye said , insisting that “ among the first voices to condemn such activities was Michael Steele’s . ”
Referring to an appearance by the two chairmen Sunday on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” during which Steele called tea party protesters who used racist language during a weekend rally “ idiots , ” Heye said that Kaine “ did not take the opportunity to condemn these activities on ' Meet the Press . '
We are glad he is now willing to do so . ”
Steele ’s condemnation came after he was asked about the protesters ’ behavior , while Kaine was not asked the same question during their joint appearance .
“ Further , we hope the Democratic National Committee and , indeed , all party committees will cease and desist in any efforts to politicize or raise money — such as Organizing for America ’s recent fundraising solicitation — off of rhetoric and behavior that is so clearly over the line , ” Heye concluded .
Republicans and Democrats have been fighting all week over who is to blame for the acts of vandalism and threats of violence aimed at members of both parties , but mostly at Democrats .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) said Wednesday that Republicans are not going far enough to condemn attacks against Democratic members — who Hoyer said are at risk — while House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) contends that Republicans also face threats and charged Democrats with using the attacks to score political points .
Woodhouse told POLITICO that the DNC is “ disappointed ” that the RNC would not agree to a statement that “ would carry a lot weight symbolically . ”
“ It ’s very disappointing , but perhaps not surprising , that Chairman Steele , who authored a fundraising presentation that depicted the president as the Joker , the speaker of the House as Cruella de Vil , raised money online showing the speaker on fire and said she should be put before a firing squad would refuse to do a joint statement with Chairman Kaine to ratchet down the rhetoric and condemn the violence and threats which Republican supporters have engaged in since the passage of health reform , ” Woodhouse said .
“ Chairman Steele ’s own overheated rhetoric and the Republican Party ’s fear tactics have contributed to an environment of anger and frustration that is unhealthy and counterproductive to our political dialogue , ” he added .
“ Rather than take responsibility for their own actions , Chairman Steele not only refused the good - faith offer of issuing a joint statement , he then sent his spokesperson out to go on the attack in a breathtaking display of chutzpah and hypocrisy .
Chairman Kaine and Democrats will continue to work towards a civil and responsible debate on the issues of the day even as Republicans continue to be pulled farther and farther towards the radical extreme . ”
Both of the committees have been accused of using controversial fundraising tactics this week in the wake last Sunday passage of health care reform .
The RNC raised more than $ 1 million in a “ Fire Nancy Pelosi ” fundraising campaign that depicted the House speaker surrounded by flames .
The DNC , meanwhile , was criticized by Republicans for sending out an e-mail from Kaine to its donors under the subject line “ Heroes under attack , ” urging supporters to defend the threatened members via funds to the committee .
“ They 've launched a campaign to ‘ fire ’ Nancy Pelosi , complete with imagery of the first female speaker of the House surrounded by flames .
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter had a brick thrown through her office window .
A Virginia blog posted Congressman Tom Perriello's home address , urging tea partiers to ‘ drop by , ’ ” the fundraising e-mail read .
“ The Democratic National Committee is already fighting back hard , with a sophisticated ad strategy , events on the ground and the best rapid - response program in the history of politics .
But we need your help to keep it up . ”
FOR a regional competition last spring , eight students from California State Polytechnic University , Pomona , spent six months of Saturdays practicing how to defend a typical business computer network from attacks .
Then , over two grueling days , they outscored teams from five other schools at blocking worms and other efforts to disrupt their e-mail and Internet systems .
For the six seniors in the group , all in computer information systems , the victory was even sweeter .
Boeing , the giant aerospace and military company , offered them jobs .
Boeing ’s decision to snap up all the graduates on the team shows how urgent the demand for computer - security experts has become , and helps explain why colleges are scrambling to add courses and specialized degrees in the once - exotic field .
In fact , as attacks on vital computer systems proliferate , surveys show a serious shortage of talent to combat them .
Banks , military contractors and software companies , along with federal agencies , are looking for “ cyber ninjas ” to fend off a sophisticated array of hackers , from criminals stealing credit card numbers to potential military adversaries .

Special relationship between UK and US is over , MPs say
There has been much speculation about the " special " bond The UK government needs to be " less deferential " towards the US and more willing to say no to Washington , a group of MPs have said .
The Commons Foreign Affairs committee also said it was wrong to speak of " the special relationship " with the US , as it was fostering other alliances .
However , the MPs did agree that the link between the countries was " profound and valuable " .
The Foreign Office said the two nations share a " unique " bond .
The committee said the phrase " the special relationship " did not reflect the " modern " Anglo - American relationship .
It was originally coined more than 60 years ago by Winston Churchill .
' Potentially misleading '
The committee said although Britain and the US still had close ties , the UK 's influence had " diminished " as its economic and military power had waned .
" The use of the phrase ' the special relationship ' in its historical sense , to describe the totality of the ever - evolving UK - US relationship , is potentially misleading , and we recommend that its use should be avoided , " the committee said .
" The overuse of the phrase by some politicians and many in the media serves simultaneously to de-value its meaning and to raise unrealistic expectations about the benefits the relationship can deliver to the UK . "
Three Labour MPs and two Conservatives voted unsuccessfully for the recommendation to be dropped but were over - ruled .
The committee said that the relationship was more associated now with the perceived support Britain gave to President George W Bush over the Iraq war .
Over the longer - term , the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past
Mike Gapes
Send us your comments Foreign Affairs Committee evidence session on the " special relationship " " The perception that the British government was a subservient ' poodle ' to the US administration leading up to the period of the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath is widespread both among the British public and overseas , " it said .
" This perception , whatever its relation to reality , is deeply damaging to the reputation and interests of the UK . "
The committee also said US President Barack Obama had taken the same " pragmatic " attitude as it was recommending now since entering the White House in 2009 .
It said : " The UK needs to be less deferential and more willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries ' interests and values diverge .
" The UK 's relationship should be principally driven by the UK 's national interests within individual policy areas .
It needs to be characterised by a hard - headed political approach to the relationship and a realistic sense of the UK 's limits . "
Committee chairman Mike Gapes said : " We must be realistic and accept that globalisation , structural changes and shifts in geopolitical power will inevitably affect the UK - US relationship .
" Over the longer - term , the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past . "
' Unique ' A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the British media 's " preoccupation " with the state of the relationship was often at the " expense of coverage of the more substantive aspects of the relationship " .
" It does n't really matter whether someone calls it ' the special relationship ' or not , " she said .
" What matters is that the UK 's relationship with the US is unique , and uniquely important to protecting our national security and promoting our national interest . "
Sir Winston had first coined the phrase during his famous " Iron Curtain " speech in March 1946 .
He had been inspired by the countries ' shared struggle against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union .
And throughout the Cold War , cultural and historical similarities , diplomatic consultation and defence and nuclear co-operation meant that Anglo - American relations were particularly close .

If no health care overhaul passes Congress , health insurers may be in for a windfall — and one far larger that most Americans probably realize .
According to a study by a pro-health reform group published Thursday , the nation ’s largest five health insurance companies posted a 56 percent gain in 2009 profits over 2008 .
The insurers including Wellpoint , UnitedHealth , Cigna , Aetna and Humana , which cover the majority of Americans with insurance .
ADVERTISEMENT
The insurers ’ hefty profit gains came even as 2.7 million more Americans lost their insurance coverage due to the declining economy .
A lobbyist for American ’s Health Insurance Plans , the trade group that represents insurers in Washington , D.C. , attributed the gain in 2009 profits to a poor performance in 2008 .
In 2008 , insurers were forced to write down their stock holdings because of the US market ’s declines .
Insurance companies keep a great deal of money in the markets , earning interest from the time between premiums are paid and the time when health providers are paid .
“ It is disingenuous to look at the profits at one company today compared to where it was in the depth of a recession , ” Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , told the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
The insurer profit study was prepared by the liberal - leaning group Healthcare for America Now , an organization bankrolled by labor unions , which typically take strong positions in favor of Democratic policies , while historically being highly critical of Republicans .
“ Insurers will – perversely – try and blame the economy for their record - breaking fortunes , saying employers have been shedding jobs and therefor dropping insurance coverage , leading to a decrease in customers , ” a press release for Health Care for America Now said .
“ And they ’re certainly right in the sense that less jobs equals less employer - based health coverage , but that obscures the fact that employers have been steadily dropping health coverage for more employees for 15 years – even during good times – because the insurance industry ’s prices keep skyrocketing much faster than inflation . ”

“ None of the excuses can explain away the basic reality that insurers make more money when they insure less people .
They can pay their CEOs more ( “ administrative costs ” rose this year ) when they can charge the healthy exorbitant prices and drop or deny these loyal customers when they become sick and therefore expensive , ” the release added .
Notably , the study also found that insurers spent less money on medical care as a percentage of their premiums from customers .
Salaries , administrative expenses and profits made up more of the insurer ’s expenses in 2009 .
Wellpoints Anthem Blue Cross California created a stir earlier this week by announcing that they will raise premiums on individuals by 39 percent in 2010 .
The increase was so high it drew a rebuke from the Obama Administration .
Wellpoint defended the increase , saying the decline in customers had increased the percentage of sick patients under their care , thus warranting a higher charge to consumers .
Wellpoint also pointed out that their California division actually lost money in 2009 .

Yet , the company posted a profit of $ 4.7 billion for the year .
That put them at a higher profit margin ( 7.3 percent ) than any of the other top five American insurers .
Wellpoint ’s CEO also recently said they are considering paying a dividend to their investors — a sign of their profitability — which might further rankle insurance company critics .

Insurance companies typically average a profit margin closer to four percent , with about 80 - 85 percent of premiums spent on reimbursing patients ’ medical expenses .
The remainer goes to administrative costs , salaries and marketing .
Under a bill under consideration in the Senate , medical “ loss benefit ratios ” would be set at 80 - 85 percent , meaning insurers would face little pressure to trim administrative costs relative to medical care .
Other highly profitable insurers in 2009 included Humana , which saw a profit yield of 7.1 percent .
Despite record 2009 profits , insurers are under increasing pressure to deliver gains for investors , as the pool of insured Americans continues to fall .
Insurance companies that make much of their money from businesses ’ healthcare plans have seen declining rolls amid an economy roiled by a nearly 10 percent unemployment rate .

Some analysts have also said that the failure of the health insurance reform package could damage insurance companies in the long run , because subsidies from the federal government would have likely insured 30 million new customers .
Health Care for America
Now ’s study also highlighted the following statistics :
* The five largest insurance firms firms made $ 12.2 billion , an increase of $ 4.4 billion , or 56 percent , from 2008 .
* Four out of the five companies saw earnings increases , with CIGNA ’s profits jumping 346 percent .
* The companies provided private insurance coverage to 2.7 million fewer people than the year before .
* Four out of the five companies insured fewer people through private coverage .
UnitedHealth alone insured 1.7 million fewer people through employer - based or individual coverage .
* All but one of the five companies increased the number of people they covered through public insurance programs ( Medicaid , CHIP and Medicare ) .
UnitedHealth added 680,000 people in public plans .
* The proportion of premium dollars spent on health care expenses went down for three of the five firms , with higher proportions going to administrative expenses and profits .
Correction :
The first version of this article said insurers posted a 57 percent gain , instead of 56 percent .
It has been corrected in this edition .
Michael Muhammad Knight ( MMK ) is in New York , my hometown .
He lets me pick a place to meet .
I walk right by him , because I do not recognize him .
I curse him , thinking that he , a New York newbie , has given me the wrong street corner .
After I keep him waiting for 30 minutes ( because of my mistake ) , I offer to buy him a cone from The Big Gay Ice Cream Truck .
He pays for his .
I am not sure where the cone , or his boot , may end up as we talk .
MMK is considered to be the father of the American Muslim Punk Movement .
His originally self - published novel , The Taqwacores , was photocopied and spiral - bound .
Sold out of car trunks , given away for free , or bought over the internet ( like I did in 2003 ) , it was a sensation at the time .
It is a sensation now , but for very different reasons .
Soft Skull Press released a perfect - bound edition , with minor changes to the content , and it ’s amazing what a difference presentation will make .
In addition , they are releasing three more of MMK ’s books : the sequel to Taqwacores , Osama Van Halen ; his travelogue through Muslim America , Blue - Eyed Devil , as he searches for the true identity of Nation of Islam founder W.D. Fard , and his autobiography , Impossible Man .
It ’s easier to understand the unease MMK causes when you consider his work together .
The Taqwacores was seen as inflammatory by dominant Muslim - American voices when it emerged , packed as it is with drinking , drug use , sex , and Sunni - Shi’ah friendship .
But it undeniably captured a sense of what a post - 1965 immigrant Muslim community could look like .
All the characters are recognizable .
It is as much Islam in America as Malcolm X , as Al - Maghrib , or as Muslims for Progressive Values .
I do not want to take anything away from MMK , but he did not create a community , he gave it voice .
These people existed before his book , but by writing about them , he put them in the spotlight .
People have since coalesced around the core community , so he can clearly be credited with helping to grow it .
What he did create , inadvertently , was a Muslim punk scene — as many thought the bands he wrote about were real .
The following passage from Taqwacores , captures this ‘ unorthodox ’ community perfectly :
I was surrounded by deliberately bad Muslims but they loved Allah with a gonzo kind of passion that escaped sleepy brainless ritualism and the dumb fantasy - camp Islams claiming that our deen [ religion ] had some inherent moral superiority making the world rightfully ours .
A New American Exotic
The Taqwacore movement is the name of the Muslim punk scene .
Taqwa means God-consciousness , while the suffix comes from the hardcore community , a subgenre of punk .
Perhaps the most famous of the groups to emerge is the Kominas , who have recently gone on tour and have had several articles written about them .
Of course , the best reporting comes from smaller venues , although this LA Times feature does capture one of the more important reasons the Taqwacores is infamous now :
Cavicchi said the constant emphasis on the Muslim - punk angle was unavoidable , especially in the context of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ However , I would hate to see Taqwacore stall in public discourse as a form of exotica , ” he wrote .
“ Their songs are actually quite catchy , with interesting dynamics and a variety of sound textures , all of which are a testament to their musicianship . ”
The book now represents a new American exotic , a testament to the wide diversity of religious , immigrant , convert , gendered , racial , etc. experiences of America that are represented .
And it deserves to be taken seriously across disciplines .
MMK is not only an amateur anthropologist , but a keen observer of character , and a good historian .
Osama Van Halen , a sequel of sorts to the Taqwacores , is far more fragmentary , and less geared towards a continuous narrative .
MMK inserts himself , breaking the wall between fiction and reality .
As a story , it is not as strong .
However , MMK continues to demonstrate a keen eye for the issues of the Muslim - American community .
On page 124 , he lays out the following conversation :
” You see , ” droned the MSA ’s Fonz apparent , “ it ’s haram for a muqallid to do ijtihad , the same way that it ’s haram for a mujtahid to do taqleed . ”
The other kids nodded like zombies .
Amazing Ayyub went over to them and just stood there , waiting for someone to acknowledge him .
Saliha rolled her eyes at the oversize machine gun resting on his shoulder .
Amazing Ayyub is a carryover character from Taqwacores and is on a mission to kill zombies .
When he walks in on this conversation , it is the typical college conversation of students who believe they are discovering truths that have never been known before , and getting it all wrong .
The setting is a post - MSA ( Muslim Student Association ) event , and some boy is apparently trying to show how intellectual he is , using terms like muqallid ( one who follows ) , ijtihad ( independent reasoning ) , mujtahid ( one who does independent reasoning ) , and taqleed ( to follow someone else ) .
The flexibility in these terms makes the statement sound like a truism : one who follows does not think ; one who thinks does not follow .
However , the reality is very different and the passage is in fact a very erudite criticism of superficial understandings of the faith .
There is also an undercurrent of Shi’ah - Sunni misunderstandings present in this statement , and throughout much of MMK ’s work .
In his autobiography , Impossible Man , we learn that MMK converts to Islam at the age of 16 and adopts a Salafist ( conservative , in popular parlance ) stance on religion .
He associates mostly with South Asian immigrants , even going to Pakistan for a while , which , I believe , explains his ability to render the immigrant experience so well .
He has a crisis of faith that happens as he learns about Shi’ism :
I had been taught to revere that first generation .
The Prophet had said that they would be the greatest Muslims of all time , seconded by the generation immediately after them , and then the generation after that , and the generation after that , each a little weaker in the deen than the one before it , until the final days when one could not tell the Muslims from the kafrs .
I stood on the far end of a declining history , sixty generations removed from the blessed companions of the Prophet , sixty degrees weaker in my faith .
But now I learned that for politics , the owners of that Golden Age would kill the Prophet ’s own family and rip Islam down the middle forever .
And here I was , fretting over missed prayers .
I began to understand why Sunnis wished that Shi’as did not exist .
For Sunnis , the keepers of what has become “ orthodox ” or “ standard ” Islam , the presence of dissenting opinion kills that myth of Islamic unity , the ummah .
But there was no such thing as the ummah , at least not since the day the Prophet died .
It had always been sects and factions and war .
Those fuckers , they ruined it for me ; my great Muslim heroes , the pious forebears , stole the whole religion out of my hands .
If they were the starting point for Islamic history , the tradition now looked like fourteen centuries ’ worth of turds heaped on a diamond .
Ayyub , the character from both Taqwacores and Osama Van Halen , is Shi’ah , with the word Karbala , the place where the Shi’ah Imam Husayn was martyred , tattooed on his chest .
The conflict MMK experiences is played out through the characters in his books , and while not autobiographical , elements of his novels clearly reflect some his own life experiences .
Perhaps none is more striking than his urinating on the Qur’an , which he sees as desecrating an idol , and a scene in Taqwacores where a singer urinates on the Qur’an and then recites from it with “ absolute sincerity ” .
The insights that MMK offers on Muslim American life are woven throughout his non-fiction and fictional works .
Between Impossible Man and Osama Van Halen , for example , we get one insider ’s view of the implosion of the Progressive Muslim Union , the first female - led prayer in the U.S. , and a view of the problems with contemporary Muslim - American organizations .
Blue - Eyed Devil , a must for any syllabus on Islam in America , is a different work altogether .
It is a travelogue of MMK ’s quest to see all that makes Muslim - America prior the 1965 wave of immigration , and tied to the true identity of W.D. Fard , founder of the Nation of Islam .
One of the most interesting discussions he has is with a white member of the Five Percent , a group that emerges from the Nation of Islam .
To find a white member seems impossible , but MMK not only finds one ( who takes the name Azrael , the Angel of Death ) but also becomes initiated into their teachings .
He also meets with Peter Lamborn Wilson , Hakim Bey , and joins a Moorish Lodge .
What he reveals is more than a simple summary could capture , but it is material that is no other single source that I have ever seen .
MMK also offers his usual insights to the condition of Muslims in America .
He says :
From that point it became easy to hate girls .
Since they knew that I was only a man and could be no other way , it was their job to keep my thoughts clean ; so who were they to walk where I could see them ?
Looking back on it , I think I made shirk to my testicles ; I feared them more than I feared Allah .
I ’ve gone through some well - documented ups and downs to crawl out of that .
Maybe I ’m not qualified to write on Islamic feminism , being Captain Handjobs at the ISNA Convention and all ; but if this oversexed manchild can pray with a woman and keep his gaze lowered , do you want to be the man who can’t ?
The sociology of the pull of conservatism is on display in this particular work .
The “ threat ” posed by difference , whether gender , culture , or theology , can be massaged away by looking for a “ true ” Islam that makes all other wrong .
Individually , with the exception of Osama Van Halen , all of MMK ’s works are fascinating individual insights into the nature of Islam in America .
However , there is a value that exceeds the sum of the parts in reading all four books together .
OVH works much better in conjunction with the other books .
Although not on Soft Skull Press , his book The Five Percenters is an important part of this theme as well .
Add in the Autobiography of Malcolm X and you have all the core books for a course on modern Islam in America .
Since MMK is an autodidact , he does not see what is happening as unique to Islam in America , but part of larger trends in Islamic intellectual thought .
He weaves in references to al - Hallaj , the malamati — Sufis who sought disapproval , lest all they seek was approval — and various theological debates .
In the fall of 2009 he will be starting a Masters program at the Harvard Divinity School .
His obvious intellectual ability , I think , allowed him to keep his boot and his ice cream cone in the right places .
In an effort to boost sales , sellers of a fake antivirus product known as Live PC Care are offering their victims live technical support .
According to researchers at Symantec , once users have installed the program , they see a screen , falsely informing them that their PC is infected with several types of malware .
That 's typical of this type of program .
What 's unusual , however , is the fact that the free trial version of Live PC Care includes a big yellow " online support " button .
Clicking on the button connects the victim with an agent , who will answer questions about the product via instant message .
Symantec says the agent is no automated script , but in fact a live person .
This lends an " air of legitimacy " to the program , said Marc Fossi , a manager of development with Symantec Security Response .
" Obviously if they 've got live tech support , it must be real , " he joked .
The tech support does n't help much , though .
According to Symantec , the support staff simply try to convince victims to shell out between US$ 30 and $ 100 for the product .
This is n't the first time a fake security product has been spotted offering tech support .
Another company called Innovative Marketing operated a call center to support its security products , including a program called WinFixer .
According to security experts , Innovative Marketing 's tech support technicians acted in the same way as Live PC Care 's , trying to reassure victims that they were buying a legitimate product .
These so - called rogue antivirus products can sometimes lower security settings on a victim 's computer .
At best , they offer a false sense of security because the products never protect computers from the latest security threats .
Rogue antivirus has been a major headache for users over the past year .
It is often installed via annoying pop-up ads that try to convince the victim that something is wrong with their PC .
Symantec tracked 43 million rogue AV installation attempts between July 2008 and July 2009 .
Oh yes , the deficit hawks are circling .
Obama 's decided to throw them some fresh meat in his State of the Union address -- and since he 's ruled out cuts in defense spending , this money will come from someplace else .
According to Jared Bernstein , chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors , this wo n't be as bad as it sounds : " No stupid Hooverism around here . "
While I can't help but wonder if this will be taken from the programs that serve the neediest ( since those are the constituencies without powerful political backers ) he says this will be targeted to specific waste .
Well , we 'll see .
Maybe this is just political theater , where Obama " proves " he can stand up to liberals .
( Krugman says it looks like " pure disaster . " )
I just have to wonder if he'd do this without getting some concessions in return from the Blue Dogs .
We do know it 'll make Evan Bayh happy , and that 's what 's important !
WASHINGTON --
Facing voter anger over mounting budget deficits , President Barack Obama will ask Congress to freeze spending for some domestic programs for three years beginning in 2011 , administration officials said Monday .
Separately , Obama unveiled plans to help a middle class " under assault " pay its bills , save for retirement and care for kids and aging parents .
The spending freeze would apply to a relatively small portion of the federal budget , affecting a $ 477 billion pot of money available for domestic agencies whose budgets are approved by Congress each year .
Some of those agencies could get increases , others would have to face cuts ; such programs got an almost 10 percent increase this year .
The federal budget total was $ 3.5 trillion .
The three - year plan will be part of the budget Obama will submit Feb.
1 , senior administration officials said , commenting on condition of anonymity to reveal private details .
The Pentagon , veterans programs , foreign aid and the Homeland Security Department would be exempt from the freeze .
What a difference a year makes !
At first glance , there would n’t seem to be a lot of obvious upsides to Kevin Smith ’s getting ejected from a Southwest Airlines flight for being too fat .
Even if the director ranks among Twitter ’s hottest trending topics , significantly goosing the number of media mentions for his new action - comedy , “ Cop Out , ” which hits theaters on Feb. 26 .
But while the incident — and Smith ’s subsequent Tweakout about the ordeal , dubbed “ Fatgate ” — continues to generate headlines worldwide , it ’s not the first time the “ Clerks ” writer - director has suffered an ignominious , weight - related embarrassment just days before theatrically releasing a new movie .
In 2008 , just before the roll - out of his under - performing romantic comedy “ Zach and Miri Make a Porno , ” Smith suffered a similar humiliation :
He admitted that his self - described “ morbid obesity ” had been responsible for the destruction of a household appliance .
And then , as now , he milked it for all it was worth on his blog and in interviews .
“ I broke a toilet , ” he told The Times .
“ That ’s how heavy I am .
I ca n’t take all the credit .
That was an old toilet and a very water - logged wall .
But still , there ’s no excuses , dude .
I cannot cognitively reframe it and be like , ‘ It was n’t me .
It was the toilet . ’
It was definitely me !
And that ’s a wake - up call . ”
Asked why he would volunteer such a potentially embarrassing story about himself , Smith demurred .
“ It ’s a good story , ” he said .
“ It ’s tough not to tell even though I ’m the fat clown at the center of it .
Putting it out there is saying , ‘ I get it .
I understand . ’ ”
In the immediate aftermath of the director ’s Twitter tirade , various blogs weighed in on the matter .
Gawker.com hailed the director ’s Tweakout as “ the best thing Kevin Smith has written since ‘ Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . ’ ” TMZ , meanwhile , observed “ Southwest Should Fit Wide Loads ” in its headline about the incident .
Although it is too soon to gauge Smith ’s impact on Southwest ’s bottom line , anecdotal evidence suggests that he has galvanized his Twitter constituency by vilifying the airline ’s treatment of Customers of Size .
“ Wanna tell me I ’m too wide for the sky ?
Totally cool , ” Smith tweeted Saturday .
“ But fair warning folks : IF YOU LOOK LIKE ME , YOU MAY BE EJECTED FROM @SouthwestAir . ”
The response from many of Smith ’s followers has been unequivocal .
On Sunday , one named @chaseronio likened the director to no less than Martin Luther King Jr. in a tweet : “ Ur the MLK of fatties . "
“ I have a Dream , ” Smith twittered back with deadpan aplomb .
“ And two lunches ( meatball parm & Trix ) .
And a couple of Twinkies .
And a Diet Coke . ”

IN THE days before the health care bill was passed , President Obama vowed it would “ end the worst practices of insurance companies .
. . insurance companies will be banned forever from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions . ’’
When the bill passed last week , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proclaimed , “ We are hearing from families who are so thrilled because no longer will their children be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing condition .
That starts this year . ’’
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said , “ You have a guarantee that your kids will be covered even if they have a pre-existing condition .
. .
These guarantees are not a promise .
They are part of the law right now .
And we are not going to let them take it away from the American people . ’’
But in the insidious underworld of health care , forces are already trying to take this guarantee away from the people .
Most notably and shamelessly , insurance companies are attempting to say that they actually do not have to insure all children with pre-existing medical conditions by this fall .
Last week , the Associated Press and Congressional Quarterly reported the first weasel words from insurance industry officials that the language in the law allows them to duck away from full coverage of sick children .
Insurers say they read the law to mean that , sure , if we offer insurance to a family , we cannot discriminate for children ’s pre-existing conditions .
But , ah , they say , there is nothing in the law that says we have to offer insurance to the family in the first place until 2014 , when insurance companies have to accept all Americans for coverage , regardless of medical conditions .
The dispute concerns families who lack employment - based insurance and seek coverage in the non-group market .
The industry take on this sounds like the Peter Sellers “ Pink Panther ’ ’ routine where he sees a dog at the hotel door and asks the clerk if his dog bites .
The clerk says no ; the dog bites ;
Sellers re-questions the clerk and the clerk says , “ but that is not my dog . ’’
The insurance companies are saying , “ but that is not my policy , ’’ and in real life , it is American children and their parents about to be bitten again , at a time when the health burdens of children in our epidemic of obesity and explosion of diabetes are rising .
Insurance industry lawyer William Schiffbauer told the New York Times , “ The fine print differs from the larger political message .
If a company sells insurance , it will have to cover pre-existing conditions for children covered by the policy .
But it does not have to sell to somebody with a pre-existing condition .
And the insurer could increase premiums to cover the additional cost . ’’
Thus , the undermining is already underway .
On one hand , the insurance industry purports to be a team player .
Since 2008 , its top lobbying group , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , has claimed it was ready to stop denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions .
But , of course , that is with the minor detail that Congress must let private insurers remain the only providers of health insurance .
The industry bitterly fought any attempt to have a public option that could compete with its outrageous rises in premiums .
The government reported earlier this year that five top insurers , under current practices , scored a 56 - percent rise in profits last year , totaling $ 12.2 billion .
The Obama administration is aware of the dispute .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said last week that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will soon issue regulations to assure “ that the term ‘ pre- existing ’ applies to both a child ’s access to a plan and his or her benefits once he or she is in a plan . ’’
They need a fix quick , because look who ’s talking now , as if he really cares .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who did his best to destroy the bill and protect the old system , said , “ Just one day after the president signed this bill into law , we got word that one of its celebrated early features — a ban on discriminating against children with pre-existing conditions — wo n’t immediately protect children after all . ’’
This loophole needs to be closed to ensure sick children the medical care insurers would prefer to deny them .

How Steve Jobs does customer service .
Personally — and with brevity .
The New York Times tracks down some mundane Apple customer service e-mails sent by none other than the famously reclusive founder Steve Jobs .
" Apple is a notoriously secretive company , " writes Brad Stone .
" But Mr. Jobs sometimes takes a more intimate approach to information - sharing — and when his e-mail messages pop up on the computer screens of random fans and critics , they can inspire ecstasy and awe . "
Jobs 's emails are usually brief , with a tossed - off quality , but even a one word email from the founder — " No , " was the entirety of one Jobs response to a question about the forthcoming iPad — is enough to send the lucky customer into a tizzy , and to generate lots positive attention in the blogosphere once the e-mail is inevitably posted there .
Valleywag flags the post and suggests a few funny email possibilities .

Google expands behavioral targeting .
Never heard of remarketing or retargeting ?
You will .
A year ago , Google started testing its own brand of " behavioral targeting " ( tracking people 's visits across different websites and serving them ads based on where they go ) .
Now , AllThingsD reports , Google is taking its " remarketing " ( what other companies refer to as retargeting ) out of beta .
Google 's description of the service : a basketball team that puts a code on the " buy tickets " page of its website , so that the team can serve basketball ads every time a previous visitor comes to its site or when that visitor browses other sites through Google .
AllThingsD thinks it sounds very innocuous .
The rub ?
Google makes it extremely difficult to opt out .

Entrepreneurship by accident .
Necessity may be the mother of invention , but it may also serve as the impetus behind a new business .
The San Francisco Chronicle has a list of seven businesses started by " unintentional entrepreneurs , " regular folks who started businesses as a way to solve some of life 's everyday problems .
For example , during a business trip in Reno , Nevada , Mario Moretti Polegato , punctured holes in his rubber - soled shoes as a way to relieve his sweaty feet .
That idea gave birth to Geox shoes , a worldwide company that produces breathable shoes .
Among the other companies that were born out of necessity are a sugar - free cookie line , a clothing line designed for nursing mothers , and a macho cupcake company called Mancakes .
Go Daddy to stop hosting new Chinese websites .
Just a few days after Google closed down its Chinese website , Go Daddy , the Bob Parsons - led giant domain name registrar , announced that it would stop offering hosting services to new Chinese .cn sites .

" We made the decision we did n't want to act as an agent for the Chinese government , " the company 's general counsel said .
Is the electric - car battery industry the next to collapse ?
A new report by the German consulting firm Roland Berger is forecasting that the electric car battery industry will collapse by 2017 ( GreenBeat via peHUB ) .
They expect that only one in 10 EV lithium ion battery makers will survive the decade .
While this is n't an atypical fail rate for budding businesses , with so many opportunities in the electric car ecosystem you 'd think there would be higher demand .
The hidden perk of all these expired Energizers : the price of the batteries , which are some of the more expensive parts of an electric vehicle , could come way down .

Locked and loaded with both Nerf guns and balled - up socks , students from around the state gathered at the University of Colorado ’s engineering building Saturday night for a game of hunting zombie specimen that escaped from the lab around 11 p.m .
The stairwells are the worst — dark and twisted with plenty of nooks and crannies for the zombies to hide .
Six humans , marked by bandanas around their arms , surround the stairwell door , before one of them kicks it in , immediately ducking to avoid being attacked by any lurking zombies , recognized by bandanas on their heads .
“ All clear ! ” one of them yells as they jog down the stairs to the first floor without so much as lowering their weapons .
Taking a deep breath , the leader motions to the others to quietly follow him into the long dark hallway , realizing that the slightest sound could give them away .
Human teammates — led by CU juniors Arthur Zimmerman and Scott Mclean — made up of students from CU - Boulder , CU - Denver and Colorado State University set out on a zombie chase Saturday night during a “ top secret ” session of Humans versus Zombies — the popular college game of “ tag . ”
This was the second zombie invasion in a month at the University of Colorado , following a weeklong game earlier this month that hosted more than 200 players .
But Saturday night ’s event was no ordinary game .
The university allowed players to use Nerf guns for the first time since December , when officials enforced a campus policy and banned the use of simulated weapons during play .
The university Police Department issued the students a temporary weapons waiver for the weekend session because it was played in a “ controlled and secure ” building , where bystanders were clearly informed about the game and the purpose of the weapons , according to police spokeswoman Molly Bosley .
“ I would n’t go as far as calling it a reward but their ability to cooperate with us and coming into the meetings organized and willing to work with our concerns , made us more willing to work with them too , ” Bosley said .
The game was kept “ top- secret ” according to HvZ organizers and was only played by approved students who received a personal invitation to join the fun .
“ By keeping the participation limited , the game will be easier to control and we want to keep it as organized as possible so that the university will continue to cooperate and let us play , ” HvZ organizer Scott Serafin said before the game , which the zombies eventually won .
Players said the indoor game was much more intense than the weeklong university - regulated game played earlier in the month , because the confined location allowed for “ suspense around every corner . ”
“ Being able to use the guns and play the game consistently for five hours is really intense , ” Zimmerman said .
“ What a way to start spring break . ”
The late - night mission was confined to the first and second floors of the engineering building , with permission from the college to lock down the space as long as a security guard was on duty and bystanders were properly informed of the game .
Though an exception was made for the weekend mission , both university officials and game organizers said they were not encouraged to think the weapons ban or other regulations , such as area and time restrictions , would be removed for future extended games .

Lisa Murkowski is the rare Republican senator who not only acknowledges that global warming exists but says she wants to do something about it .
She likes to point out that her home state of Alaska is “ ground zero for climate change ” ; about two years ago , she championed a bipartisan bill to rein in carbon emissions .
In a party where Oklahoma Sen .
Jim Inhofe — who calls global warming the “ greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people ” — is the preeminent Republican voice on climate , Murkowski ’s views stand out .
After President Barack Obama took office , environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers courted Murkowski enthusiastically , hoping she ’d be a crucial GOP vote for historic legislation to deal with global warming .
But while Murkowski ’s climate stance may differ from GOP orthodoxy , it ’s become increasingly difficult to distinguish her actions from those of her denialist colleagues .
Like every Republican senator except Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins , Murkowski has n’t joined any of the current congressional efforts to curb carbon pollution .
Instead , she ’s gone on the offensive against the White House ’s signature environmental initiatives .
She has launched an assault on the Environmental Protection Agency ’s ( EPA ) authority to regulate carbon dioxide .
Murkowski has also made it plain that the price for her vote on any climate bill is a lengthy list of handouts for the oil and gas industries .
Murkowski once seemed to represent a new voice on climate change among congressional Republicans — but she ’s now their most effective obstructionist .
Murkowski ’s climate stance embodies the political paradox of Alaska .
In the Last Frontier , oil is king and senators from both parties cater to their industrial backers , but Alaska is also one of the states most imperiled by rising temperatures .
Murkowski was appointed to the Senate in 2002 to finish her father ’s term when he became governor , and campaigned heavily on her support for the oil and gas industry in her 2004 reelection bid .
But in 2006 , she broke with most of her Republican colleagues on the subject of climate change , observing , “ I believe it is a reality that man is contributing to the current warming trend .
Accordingly , it is appropriate , and quite frankly our responsibility , to take steps to curb the growth of greenhouse gases . ”
With only a handful of Republicans acknowledging that global warming is occurring , Murkowski quickly assumed a major role in shaping climate policy .
On the Energy and Natural Resources Committee , where she is the ranking GOP member , she has worked closely with Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) , the chairman , on energy - efficiency measures .
In 2007 , she cosponsored Bingaman ’s cap - and - trade bill , the Low Carbon Economy Act .
But after Obama took office — creating the possibility that a climate bill might actually become law — Murkowski ’s enthusiasm for tackling global warming quickly cooled .
In March 2009 , she resisted a decision by the Bush administration ’s Interior Department to list the polar bear as a species endangered by climate change , citing fears that the designation could threaten oil and gas development in Alaska .
Last September , she introduced legislation — written with help from two lobbyists for big polluters — to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions .
After that bid failed , she offered another measure in January seeking to block EPA carbon rules .
Then , this month , Murkowski provided a 91 - page document to Lindsey Graham listing the oil and gas measures she ’d like to see included in a climate bill .
Chief among them was a demand that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil drilling — a poison pill for environmentalists who have battled for decades to protect the pristine 19.6 million - acre natural reserve .
Other requests included allowing drilling up to 35 miles off the US coastline and weakening the environmental review process for oil and gas operations .
“ To secure my vote on a climate bill , we have to develop a good policy , ” she told reporters .
“ In my mind , that good policy would include [ drilling in ] ANWR . ”
For a long time , environmental groups had been reluctant to criticize Murkowski publicly , hoping that she might yet be won over .
But with her bid to insert ANWR drilling in the climate bill , their patience has expired .
“ We ’ve been giving her the benefit of the doubt in our thinking for some time , ” says David Jenkins , vice president for government and political affairs at Republicans for Environmental Protection .
“ For her to throw [ ANWR ] out there as a price for her vote on climate shows that she ’s really not serious about addressing the problem . ”
He now believes her statements calling for action on global warming are “ just lip service , ” concluding , “ She has no intent to do anything about the climate . ”
Murkowski’s ANWR gambit , says Melinda Pierce , a lobbyist for the Sierra Club , is the “ mother of all nonstarters ” — especially considering that one of the bill ’s authors , Joe Lieberman , has described ANWR drilling provisions as a “ dealbreaker . ”
Robert Dillon , a spokesman for Murkowski , maintains that Graham had asked them to list provisions they ’d like to see in a bill and suggested they include ANWR drilling .
Dillon added , “ Graham seems to be throwing our boss under the bus a bit . ”
As for her move against the EPA , Murkowski claims that it was motivated by a concern that greenhouse - gas regulations would cripple the Alaskan economy .
But two of her biggest contributors are Edison Chouest Offshore and Exxon Mobil , which have significant oil and gas interests in her state .
Murkowski is also heavily backed by coal - powered electric utilities — like Maryland - based Constellation Energy and Georgia - based Southern Company — which do n’t have strong Alaska ties but would n’t fare well under carbon constraints .
Instead of regarding Murkowski as a potential ally , environmental advocates are now wondering whether she ’s simply using her influential position to stump for polluters .
The National Wildlife Federation and Friends of the Earth have started running attack ads against her in Alaska , highlighting her ties to lobbyists and fossil - fuel interests .
“ I ’ve been in meetings where she admits that global warming is a problem , ” says Pamela Miller , Arctic program director at the Northern Alaska Environmental Center .
“ I think she uses that to make herself seem reasonable , but then she makes these outrageous suggestions . ”
Yet although environmentalists are now wary of Murkowski , she ’s still being included in key negotiations .
In early March , Murkowski was one of six GOP senators invited to the White House to meet with Obama and other lawmakers to discuss how to formulate a climate bill that could clear the Senate .
She described the talks as “ encouraging ” and shortly afterwards put her attempt to block the EPA on hold .
But she still refuses to support any existing climate legislation .
“ I think she ’s very interested in trying to see if there ’s a way to get the problem solved , ” says Bingaman .
“ I do n’t know that she ’s expressed any willingness to embrace the current cap - and - trade proposals that have been put forward . ”
For her part , Murkowski insists that she still believes climate change is a significant concern — so significant that Congress should n’t act too fast to address it .
“ I think it is too important an issue to rush and get wrong , ” she said .
“ The devil is always in the details , and those details are a long way from resolution . ”
Murkowski ’s stance comes as cold comfort to Alaskans who are already watching their communities melt .
On the same day that she met with Obama , a group of Alaska natives was visiting Washington , DC , to plead with legislators to protect their homeland from climate change .
Robert Thompson , a member of the Iñupiat tribe and the board of directors of Resisting Environmental Destruction on Indigenous Lands , says his family ’s property along the coast in Kaktovik has receded 100 feet in recent years , a result of waves lapping at the thawing permafrost .
“ Land that ’s been there for millions of years , just washed away , ” said Thompson , a middle - aged man sporting a polar bear bolo tie .
The iconic white bears , he says , are wandering into town to rummage through dumpsters for food ; Porcupine caribou and musk ox are disappearing .*.
Inland lakes are drying up and forest fires grow worse every year .
Last month , it rained — something that never happened during the winters of his youth .
Kaktovik sits at the tip of an island off the coast of northeastern Alaska — within ANWR ’s boundaries .
Thompson pointed to the problem with Murkowski ’s push for oil drilling to be included in the climate bill .
“ It ’s contradictory that you ’re going to advocate for drilling in something related to climate , ” he says .
“ That ’s the problem that ’s causing the climate to change . ”

This story originally referred to porcupines and caribou , not Porcupine caribou .
The Democratic candidate for Northern California 's Second Congressional District Jim Reed narrates the following when you open the card :
In a recent townhall meeting in Redding , California , a man stood up and declared , Man : " And I want to say I 'm a proud right wing terrorist ! "
( Crowd cheers )
Shockingly , Republican Congressman Wally Herger responded , Herger : " AMEN , God bless you , now that 's a great American ! "
( Crowd cheers and whoops ) MSNBC 's Keith Olberman named Herger The Worst Person In the World : Olbermann : " You 're a U.S. Congressman , damn it !
You 're not entitled to serve as Redding 's dog catcher , let alone to serve in the House of Representatives ! "
Join me , Jim Reed , and join our campaign to take back California 's second Congressional district .
Help us send the message the right wing terrorism should not be applauded .
Help us end Wally Herger 's reign .
I instantly got on the phone and contacted Jim Reed 's campaign manager , Crystal Martin , who was relieved by my praise for the mailer after just fielding a negative phone call .
" After 23 years of Wally Herger 's reign we felt we needed something to get people 's attention , " she said .
Well , this talking card , the first ever sent out by a political campaign , certainly does make some noise .
I 'm hoping Keith Olbermann gets wind of it !
Although the sound quality is undeniably tinny , when you first open the card the sheer novelty of a talking card that is n't made by Hallmark initially grabs your attention .
Hearing town hall craziness effectively and unexpectedly used against the Republican who openly praised it is deeply satisfying .
This is brilliant , and I hope to see this kind of audio- visual approach used in more campaign mailers .
The more Wally Herger's , or any Republican 's crazy talk is repeated aloud , in their own voices , the more we can rub their noses in it .
Yes indeed , those of us progressives who live in WallyWorld nearly despaired when Jeff Morris , riding the Obama bounce in Chico , still could n't oust the conservative Republican .
Herger 's base is deep , and he can easily raise millions of dollars for his campaigns .
Even more depressing than Herger 's re-election was his participation in last August 's town halls , where he infamously praised the self - proclaimed " proud right wing terrorist . "
I thought to myself , if the next Democrat who runs against Herger does n't smack him repeatedly with this like a wet trout to the face it 's political malpractice .
And now someone has the guts to throw Herger 's words back at him with the most innovative political mailer I 've ever encountered .
Campaign manager Crystal Martin is hopeful , saying " California ’s second congressional district is the majority of Northern California , and is a perceived Republican stronghold .
But the party numbers are almost 50 /50 now , and we ’re going to make the noise needed to win this election . "
The mailer does n't just rely on the voice gimmick to get your attention .
While I 've never heard of Jim Reed , the first plank of his campaign would make any progressive happy :
Jim supports health care reform that ensures affordability for families and access for all , not a bailout for insurance companies .
A mailer like this can't be cheap , so feel free to show some love at Act Blue .
( Oh , and Markos , Jim Reed is also an avid bicyclist ! )

Normally , this would n't be such a big deal , but we 've been looking for someone for a year and a half .
In this time , we 've interviewed at least a dozen candidates and phone - screened at least a couple dozen more .
Practically every candidate we 've talked to had at least two years of C++ experience , rated himself a 7 or 8 on a scale of 10 in C++ skill , and had one or two lucrative offers on the table .
Unfortunately , we would have rated almost all of them somewhere between a 4 and a 6 .
In my opinion , this goes to show you that working with C++ for a long time does n't guarantee you really understand the language .
Over this time , I 've developed a stock interview question that 's proven to be a pretty good gauge of C++ knowledge .
No one has yet been able to just rip out the correct answer , but we 've had several , including the guy we hired , who understood the important issues and were able to get the question right with prompting .
As a public service , I 'd like to share my stock question and its answer with you and explore the various programming issues it presents .
The question is as follows :
Consider the following class definition : class TFoo : public TSuperFoo { TBar * fBar1 ; TBar* fBar2 ; // various method definitions go here ... }
You have a class , TFoo , which descends from a class , TSuperFoo , and which has two data members , both of which are pointers to objects of class TBar .
For the purposes of this exercise , consider both pointers to have owning semantics and TBar to be a monomorphic class .
Write the assignment operator for this class .
This seems like a simple enough exercise , but it gets at some interesting issues .
It 's a good way to test a programmer 's grasp of C++ syntax and C++ style , but more importantly , it tests the programmer 's knowledge of C++ memory management and exception handling .
For the impatient among you , let 's cut right to the chase :
One correct answer to this question would look something like this : [*]
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { TBar * bar1 = 0 ; TBar* bar2 = 0 ; try { bar1 = new TBar ( * that . fBar1 ) ; bar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; } catch ( ... ) { delete bar1 ; delete bar2 ; throw ; } TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = bar1 ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = bar2 ; } return * this ; }
Yes , it 's a lot of code .
Yes , it 's ugly .
But all the code you see here is necessary .
We 'll go through it all piece by piece and see why this is .
" But I never have to write an assignment operator ! "
The first reaction I usually get from people is something along the lines of " But I never have to write assignment operators . "
You should .
If you 've ever created a new class , you 've needed to write an assignment operator .
Let 's examine why this is so .
In C++ , there are three things every object is expected to be able to do :
An object should be able to initialize itself to a default state , it should be able to initialize itself from another instance of the same class , and it should be able to assume the semantic state of another instance of the same class .
In C++ , these operations are expressed with the default constructor ( e.g. , TFoo : : TFoo ( ) ) , the copy constructor ( TFoo : : TFoo ( const TFoo& ) ) , and the assignment operator ( TFoo::operator= ( const TFoo& ) ) .
These three functions are special in C++ :
If you do n't provide them yourself , C++ provides them for you .
And automatically makes them public .
Among other things , this means you have to define these operations even if you do n't want a client to be able to copy or default - construct a particular class .
If you do n't want a class to be copied , for example , you have to define an empty copy constructor and assignment operator yourself and make them private or protected .
Furthermore , the compiler is n't guaranteed to create versions of these classes that do exactly what you want them to do .
For copying and assignment , for example , the automatically - generated code will do a shallow memberwise copy .
If your class has pointer members , this is practically never what you want , and even when you do n't have pointer members , this is n't always the right behavior .
It 's definitely not what we want in our example .
Even when the default versions of the special functions do what you want them to , it 's still generally a good policy to always spell that out explicitly by writing them yourself .
It avoids ambiguity , and it forces you to think more about what 's going on inside your class .
Always give any new class a default constructor , a copy constructor , and an assignment operator .
Copy vs. assign
Another misconception I see often is a fuzzy idea of the difference between the copy constructor and the assignment operator .
They 're not the same thing , although they 're similar .
Let 's take a moment to look at the difference .
The copy constructor and assignment operator do similar things .
They both copy state from one object to another , leaving them with equivalent semantic state .
In other words , both objects will behave the same way and return the same results when their methods are called .
If they have public data members ( generally a bad idea ) , they have the same values .
This does n't necessarily mean that the objects are identical : some purely internal data members ( such as caches ) might not be copied , or data members pointing to other objects might end up pointing to different objects that are themselves semantically equivalent , rather than pointing to the same objects .
The difference between the copy constructor and assignment operator is that the copy constructor is a constructor  a function whose job it is to turn raw storage into an object of a specific class .
An assignment operator , on the other hand , copies state between two existing objects .
In other words , an assignment operator has to take into account the current state of the object when copying the other object 's state into it .
The copy constructor is creating a new object from raw storage and knows it 's writing over garbage .
For many classes , the current state of the object does n't matter and both functions do the same thing .
But for some classes ( including the one in our example ) , the current state does matter , and the assignment operator is more complicated .
Defining the Function
What parameters does the function take ?
C++ requires that an assignment operator take one parameter : the thing on the right - hand side of the = sign .
This can be of any type , but the assignment operator that C++ automatically generates for you ( and therefore , the one we 're interested in here ) is the one where you have the same type of object on both sides of the = sign .
That means the parameter is either an instance of or a reference to an instance of the same class as the object on the left - hand side .
You 'll pretty much always want to use a reference rather than a full - blown instance of the class ( i.e. , pass by reference instead of pass by value ) .
This is because passing an object by value requires creating a new instance of the class with the same state as the object passed as a parameter : in other words , its copy constructor must be called .
This is n't necessary , and it wastes time .
The parameter can be either a const or a non-const reference , but since it would be terrible form for the assignment operator to have side effects on the object on the right - hand side , you should use a const reference .
What does the function return ?
An assignment operator can return anything it wants , but the standard C and C++ assignment operators return a reference to the left - hand operand .
This allows you to chain assignments together like so :
x = y = z = 3 ;
Unless you have a really good reason , you want to follow this convention .
Returning a reference to the right - hand operand or a value ( i.e. , another whole TFoo ) would both still allow the simple chain described above to work , but have subtle differences in semantics from the way the standard operators do it that would come out in more complicated expressions involving assignment .
Returning a value also forces unnecessary trips through the object 's copy constructor , costing you in performance .
So the outer shell of a properly - written assignment operator would look like this :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const TFoo& that ) { // copy the state ... return * this ; }
( By the way , note that the return statement is " return * this " , rather than " return this " .
That 's because this is a pointer to TFoo .
You have to dereference it to get a reference to TFoo .
Of course , if you forget this , the compiler will remind you . )
Virtual or non-virtual ?
I had one applicant suggest that operator= should be a virtual function .
Let 's take a look at this issue .
Many C++ programmers are trained to make everything virtual , and in fact , some older frameworks do just that .
In the specific example of the assignment operator , however , it 's not a good idea .
An override of a virtual function has to take the same parameters as the function it 's overriding .
Therefore , TFoo 's operator= function would have to be declared as
virtual TSuperFoo& TFoo::operator=( TSuperFoo& that ) ;
You could declare the function this way and still have it return this , of course , because a reference to a TFoo is a reference to a TSuperFoo , but we have no way of knowing whether that is a reference to a TFoo or a reference to some other subclass of TSuperFoo .
If it 's not a TFoo , you have several problems .
You 'd have to check that 's class , which can be expensive .
If it is n't a TFoo , you obviously would n't want to try to carry out the assignment , but then you 'd have to define some kind of error - handling protocol to handle this situation .
Better just to make operator= take the right type and let the compiler check the classes of your operands for you at compile time .
Of course , as soon as each class has operands with different types , the functions have different signatures and the operator= function is no longer being overridden .
So it does n't make sense to make operator= virtual .
Owning and Aliasing Pointers
Okay , now that we 've got the preliminaries out of the way , we can get into the actual nitty - gritty of having our assignment operator actually perform an assignment .
Let 's refresh our memory of what the object we 're working on looks like :
class TFoo : public TSuperFoo { TBar * fBar1 ; TBar* fBar2 ; // method definitions ... } ;
It seems the obvious way to do the assignment would be this :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { fBar1 = that .
fBar1 ; fBar2 = that .
fBar2 ; return * this ; }
Unfortunately , that 's the wrong answer here .
Remember that in the original question I said that fBar1 and fBar2 are owning pointers .
To understand why the above example wo n't do what we want , we need to take a look at the unique problems of C++ memory management .
Because of its evolution from C , C++ is much closer to the hardware than most other object - oriented languages .
One of the chief consequences of this is that you have to do your own memory management .
Every new that happens during a program 's execution must be balanced by one and only one delete .
You do n't want objects you 've allocated to clutter up memory after you 're done with them , you do n't want to try to delete an object more than once and you do n't want to access an object after you 've deleted it .
Double - deleting an object can corrupt the memory manager 's free list , leading to crashes down the road ; reading through a pointer to a deleted object ( a " dangling pointer " ) can lead to wrong results ; and writing through a dangling pointer can corrupt other objects or cause crashes .
Failing to delete an object you 're done with ( a " memory leak " ) is less obviously malignant , but can seriously degrade performance and eventually cause crashes when the system runs out of memory .
In a system of any complexity , sticking to this " one delete for every new " rule can be quite difficult , so a strict protocol for managing memory is necessary .
The basic rule we follow at Taligent is that for every object in the runtime environment , there is one and only one pointer to it through which the object can be deleted .
This pointer is an " owning pointer , " and the object or function containing that pointer is the object 's " owner . "
All other pointers to the object are called " aliasing pointers . "
The owner of the object expects to delete the object ; objects with aliasing pointers do n't .
So when we say that TFoo 's two TBar pointers are owning pointers , we 're saying that TFoo expects to delete those TBar s.
In other words , its destructor looks like this :
TFoo ::~TFoo( ) { delete fBar1 ; delete fBar2 ; }
You can see that if more than one TFoo object points to a given TBar , then as soon as one of those TFoo s is deleted ( taking the TBar s down with it ) , the other TFoo s are hosed .
The next time any one of them tried to access one of its TBar objects , it'd be reading or writing through a dangling pointer , with potentially disastrous consequences .
Therefore , every TFoo must have its own unique TBar objects , which means our assignment operator must create new copies of the source object 's TBar s for the destination object to point to .
In some cases , of course , it 's overkill to make a copy of an object , because the current owner of the object is just going to delete that object after passing its content on to another object .
In other words , one object is transferring ownership of an object to another object .
This happens quite frequently , in fact .
A simple factory method starts out with ownership of the object it creates , but when it returns its value , it passes ownership of that object to the caller .
Its return value is an owning pointer .
At other times , a function returns a pointer to an object but intends that the caller merely use it for a short time to perform some operation .
Ownership is not transferred ; the return value is an aliasing pointer .
When you have functions that return pointers or have pointer parameters , you must make it explicit whether the function transfers ownership , and you must then make sure that code calling the function upholds these semantics .
C++ does n't do any of this for you .
Sometimes you can do this through the parameter types ( references are virtually always aliases , and const pointers are always aliases ) , and sometimes you have to do it with naming conventions ( at Taligent , for example , we use " adopt , " " orphan , " and " create " in the names of functions that transfer ownership ) .
In the case of the assignment operator , our parameter is a const reference to another TFoo .
That alone signifies that we are not taking ownership of its internal state ( there are some very rare , but important , exceptions to this rule we 'll look at one later ) .
Since TFoo 's pointers are defined as owning pointers , however , we have to reconcile the difference in semantics by making new copies of the objects the other TFoo points to .
As an aside , it 's worth mentioning that there are occasions where copying objects to maintain ownership semantics is too expensive .
In these situations , a technique called reference counting can be used .
We 'll touch briefly on reference counting later .
memcpy ( ) is evil !
So we have to copy the TBar s in our assignment operator .
I 've seen a lot of interesting attempts to do this .
The most frightening was
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const TFoo& that ) { memcpy ( & fBar1 , & that .
fBar1 , sizeof ( fBar1 ) ) ; memcpy ( & fBar2 , & that . fBar2 , sizeof ( fBar2 ) ) ; return * this ; }
I really hope this guy was just nervous .
This code just copies the pointer values from one TFoo to the other .
In other words , it 's an ugly way of doing
fBar1 = that .
fBar1 ; fBar2 = that .
fBar2 ;
Closer to the mark , but ever scarier in terms of its results , is
memcpy ( fBar1 , that .
fBar1 , sizeof ( TBar ) ) ; memcpy ( fBar2 , that .
fBar2 , sizeof ( TBar ) ) ;
This would copy the data members of that 's TBar s into this 's TBar s , so this and that retain their own separate TBar objects .
So we 're doing well so far .
The problem is that it bypasses the assignment operator and copy constructor for TBar , so if TBar has any owning pointers of its own , you have the same problem .
You 'll also have problems if TBar owns locks or system resources that need to be properly cleaned up or duplicated when you change the internal state of the object .
And , of course , if any of these pointers is NULL , you 'll probably crash .
Finally , I had one applicant propose
fBar1 = new TBar ; memcpy ( fBar1 , that .
fBar1 , sizeof ( TBar ) ) ; fBar2 = new TBar ; memcpy ( fBar2 , that .
fBar2 , sizeof ( TBar ) ) ;
This is kind of a cheap way of initializing brand - new TBar s from existing ones , or copy constructing them without using the copy constructor .
It suffers from all of the same limitations as the previous example , plus an additional one we 'll get to in a moment .
Keep in mind one thing : memcpy ( ) is evil !
It 's a C construct you should never use in C++. memcpy ( ) operates on bits and bytes , not on objects .
At best , it just looks ugly and forces you to be concerned with things you should n't need to worry about , like the size of TBar .
At worst , it fails to take into account what 's actually being stored in the objects you 're copying , leading to erroneous results , or even uglier code that takes the special cases into account .
Never use memcpy ( ) in C++ code .
There are always better , more object - oriented ways to do the same thing .
So what 's the right answer ?
Since the TFoo expects to delete the TBar s it points to , we have to create new ones for it to point to .
And we can create duplicates of the other TFoo 's TBar s by using TBar 's copy constructor ( remember from our introduction that every object has a copy constructor ) , so the correct solution ( so far ) would look like this :
TFoo& TFoo::operator= ( const TFoo& that ) { fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ; fBar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; return * this ; }
Plugging the leaks
Of course , there 's still a glaring error here : Remember that fBar1 and fBar2 are owning pointers .
This means that TFoo is responsible for deleting them .
Here , we 've copied right over the top of these pointers without taking into account their former values .
This 'd be okay if we were writing a copy constructor , where we 're guaranteed that fBar1 and fBar2 contain garbage , but it 's not okay for an assignment operator .
In the assignment operator , fBar1 and fBar2 are both valid pointers to TBar objects .
If you just write over them , you now have two TBar objects in memory that nobody points to anymore ( or at least , no one who points to them expects to have to delete them ) .
This is a memory leak .
Memory leaks wo n't cause your program to crash or produce wrong results , at least not right away .
Instead , depending on how numerous and bad they are , they 'll slowly degrade your program 's performance .
And if you run the program long enough , you 'll run out of memory and it will crash .
So we have to delete the objects that we currently own before we can create new ones :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const TFoo& that ) { delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; return * this ; }
Assigning yourself
Now we 're beginning to get to something reasonable .
But we 're not quite there yet .
Consider the following expression :
foo1 = foo1 ;
This might seem like kind of a silly example , but it does happen .
Consider a setter function on some object where the variable being set is a TFoo and the other value is passed in .
A caller knows he wants to set that variable to " x . "
The caller should n't have to check to see whether the value of that variable is already " x . "
If the value already is " x " and the caller does n't check for this , look at what happens in our code : this and that refer to the same object , so by the time we get down to " fBar1 = new TBar ( * that . fBar1 ) " , that .
fBar1 is gone .
" delete fBar1 " also deleted that .
fBar1 .
The call to TBar 's copy constructor will either crash because it 's trying to access a deleted object , or it'll get away with that , create a brand - new TBar , and initialize it with the potentially random contents of raw memory .
Worse , most of the time the data that had been in those two objects wo n't have been overwritten yet , so it 'll probably work right 90 % of the time and randomly fail the other 10 % .
This kind of bug is notoriously hard to track down .
There are many ways of coding around this , but the obvious answer is the best : just check at the top of the function to see whether you 're assigning to yourself , and drop out if you are .
Of course , you can't just write
if ( this == that )
because this and that are different types ( this is a pointer and that is a reference ) .
There are two ways of rectifying this : you can turn this into a reference , or turn that into a pointer .
In other words , you could write
if ( * this == that )
or you could write
if ( this == & that )
Keep in mind that these two expressions do n't do the same thing .
The first example tests semantic equality , and the second example tests identity .
In other words , " if ( * this == that ) " calls TFoo 's equality operator .
If that object does n't have one ( it 's not required or created for you ) , you 're automatically hosed .
If it does , it 'll go through all the externally - visible data members of the two objects one by one looking for a difference , which is bound to be much slower than " if ( this != & that ) " , which is a simple pointer comparison . " if ( this == & that ) " will return true only if this and that refer to the same object , not merely to two objects that " look the same . "
You 'll occasionally do some unnecessary work this way , but it saves a lot of time and it protects you from crashing , which is really the point .
So ( switching to " != " for simplicity ) our operator now looks like
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; } return * this ; }
Honoring your ancestry
We 've also forgotten one other important detail .
Remember the first line of our sample class definition :
class TFoo : public TSuperFoo {
TFoo is not a root class ; it has a base class .
This means we have to copy over the base class 's data members too .
If we were writing a copy constructor , we would n't generally have to worry about this , because the compiler will make sure our base class members are initialized before our constructor is called .
But the compiler does n't do anything like this for us with assignment operators ; we have to do it ourselves .
The easiest way to do this is to call our superclass 's assignment operator ourselves .
You could do this by casting yourself to your base class :
*(( TSuperFoo * ) this ) = that ;
but it 's much more readable to just call the inherited function by name :
TSuperFoo : :operator= ( that ) ;
By the way , I 've had a couple of people try
inherited : :operator= ( that ) ;
Some of the older compilers on the Mac provided the inherited keyword , which I always liked .
Unfortunately , it 's not included in the C++ standard because it does n't work well with multiple inheritance : in portable C++ , you actually have to refer to your immediate superclass by name .
So now we have
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; } return * this ; }
Cleaning up after yourself
We 're still not really out of the woods here .
The code above will work great ... unless we encounter an error while trying to create one of our TBar objects .
If we get an exception while creating a TBar object , the data member we 're setting retains its old value , which now points to a deleted object .
If we continue to use this TFoo , we 'll probably eventually crash because of the dangling pointer .
If we delete the TFoo in response to the exception , we 'll probably blow sky high trying to double - delete the TBar .
If we know that the calling function will delete the object if assigning to it fails , we can just zero out the pointers after deleting the objects they refer to :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = 0 ; fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = 0 ; fBar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; } return * this ; }
Unfortunately , this only works if you 're certain the calling function will catch the exception and delete the TFoo , or if NULL is a valid value for the TBar pointers .
( Actually , if NULL is a valid value , you 'll also have to check the incoming object 's fBar1 and fBar2 for NULL before trying to new up new TBar s from them . )
A better way to handle the problem is to make sure that the creation of a new object succeeds before you do anything to the variable you 're assigning to .
This way , if creation fails , you 're still pointing to a perfectly good TBar  the assignment operation simply did n't have an effect .
In fact , since we have two TBar s , we should new up both of them before carrying out the assignment .
This will ensure that the TFoo is always in an internally consistent state ; either the whole assignment happened or none of it did :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { TSuperFoo :: operator= ( that ) ; TBar * bar1 ; TBar * bar2 ; bar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ; bar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = bar1 ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = bar2 ; } return * this ; }
But there 's a problem with this solution : Consider what happens if creation of bar1 succeeds and creation of bar2 fails .
You 'll exit with the actual object untouched , but what happens to the TBar pointed to by bar1 ?
That 's right ; it leaks .
In order to avoid this , you actually have to catch and re-throw the exception and delete bar1 if it 's been created .
In order to tell if you 're created bar1 , you need to set it to NULL first , too .
And , so we 're really sure the assignment does n't do anything until we know we 've been able to create both of the new TBar s , we can't call our inherited operator= function until after the try / catch block .
So this all gets rather complicated :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { TBar * bar1 = 0 ; TBar* bar2 = 0 ; try { bar1 = new TBar ( * that . fBar1 ) ; bar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; } catch ( ... ) { delete bar1 ; delete bar2 ; throw ; } TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = bar1 ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = bar2 ; } return * this ; }
Delegating our work
Of course , we 're not really handling the exception here ; we 're just catching the exception to enable us to clean up properly .
The try / catch block is a really ugly construct to have to use in this way .
It 'd be really nice if we could lose it .
One of the niceties of C++ exception handling is that destructors for any stack - based objects are guaranteed to be called even if the function that declares them exits prematurely with an exception or a return statement .
We can take advantage of this behavior by having an object whose destructor deletes the object that would otherwise leak .
The new ANSI C++ standard provides us with just such an object :
It 's called auto_ptr .
Using auto_ptr , we can write
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { auto_ptr < TBar > bar1 = new TBar ( * that .
fBar1 ) ; auto_ptr < TBar > bar2 = new TBar ( * that .
fBar2 ) ; TSuperFoo::operator= ( that ) ; delete fBar1 ; fBar1 = bar1.release ( ) ; delete fBar2 ; fBar2 = bar2.release ( ) ; } return * this ; }
The release ( ) function gets rid of the auto_ptr 's reference to the object so that it wo n't delete the object in its destructor .
So the auto_ptr will only delete the object it points to if we exit the function with an exception before getting to the release ( ) call .
Which is correct ; the only things in this function which can fail are the constructor calls .
Taking full advantage
You 've probably already guessed this part :
We can actually utilize auto_ptr more fully than this .
auto_ptr actually implements owning pointer semantics for us ; if you assign to an auto_ptr , it deletes the object it points to before taking on the new pointer , and if an auto_ptr goes out of scope , it also automatically deletes the object it points to .
So if we relaxed the rules of our exercise to allow us to redefine the class , we could redefine the class using auto_ptr :
class TFoo : public TSuperFoo { auto_ptr < TBar > fBar1 ; auto_ptr < TBar > fBar2 ; // method definitions ... } ;
Functions accessing the objects pointed to by fBar1 and fBar2 would look exactly the same as they did when fBar1 and fBar2 were regular pointers ; auto_ptr defines its * and -> operators to do the same thing as those for a regular pointer .
And now we can take full advantage of auto_ptr in our assignment operator :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; fBar1 = new TBar ( * that . fBar1 ) ; fBar2 = new TBar ( * that. fBar2 ) ; } return * this ; }
auto_ptr also takes care of deleting the objects previously pointed to by fBar1 and fBar2 .
One thing it does n't automatically do for us , however , is create a new object to point to ; we have to do that ourselves .
If we just did
fBar1 = that .
fBar1 ; fBar2 = that .
fBar2 ;
instead , we 'd actually inadvertently affect that , when that 's not what we want to do ( in fact , by declaring that as const , we 've promised not to affect it ) .
This is because an auto_ptr 's assignment operator passes ownership from one object to the other ( this is the once exception to the rule about passing ownership that I mentioned earlier ) ; in other words , it 'd leave that .
fBar1 and that .
fBar2 with null pointers .
Actually , our auto_ptr solution does n't do exactly the same thing as the previous example .
If we want to make sure that all of the assignment happens or none of it , we still need the temporary variables .
But this is a situation where the ownership - passing property of auto_ptr 's assignment operator helps us :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { auto_ptr < TBar > bar1 = new TBar ( * that .
fBar1 ) ; auto_ptr < TBar > bar2 = new TBar ( * that .
fBar2 ) ; TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; fBar1 = bar1 ; fBar2 = bar2 ; } return * this ; }
Here , if the second new operation fails , the first new TBar will be deleted by auto_ptr 's destructor when we exit the function .
But if both new s succeed , the assignments will delete the objects fBar1 and fBar2 previously pointed to , and will also zero out bar1 and bar2 so that their destructors do n't delete anything when we exit the function .
The other beauty of auto_ptr is its documentary value ; if a pointer is declared as an auto_ptr , you know it 's an owning pointer .
If you consistently use auto_ptr s for all owning pointers and regular pointers only for aliasing pointers , the meanings of pointers are no longer ambiguous and you do n't have to worry as much about naming conventions and documentation .
Of course , auto_ptr is n't available on all C++ compilers yet ; if you 're concerned about portability , do n't use it .
Do the assignment the first way I described , or make your own auto_ptr - like class .
But if your compiler provides auto_ptr , and you 're not worried about portability , it 's definitely the way to go .

I 've gotten a couple questions in interviews that I probably should address briefly here .
First , I had at least one applicant ask me why I could do things like
fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ;
when fBar1 is a private member .
The answer is that access control in C++ is done on an class by class basis , not on an instance - by - instance basis .
Any instance of a class can access the private members of any other instance of the same class , so code like that shown in the example above is legal .
I also sometimes have people write code like
if ( fBar1 != 0 ) delete fBar1 ;
This is actually unnecessary .
The delete operator in C++ automatically performs this null check for you , so it 's okay to delete a null pointer .
The real answer
Actually , I lied at the beginning of this article .
There is an infinitely better solution to the problem as I stated it than the one we just worked our way to .
To see what I 'm getting at , consider two points :
If any other objects contain aliasing pointers to TFoo 's TBar objects , they will be invalid after you assign to the TFoo .
's objects , they will be invalid after you assign to the .
Every object in a well - designed C++ system has a default constructor , a copy constructor , and an assignment operator .
That 's right ; you can perform the whole assignment just by calling TBar 's assignment operator .
That solution looks like this :
TFoo& TFoo::operator= ( const TFoo& that ) { TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; * fBar1 = *( that . fBar1 ) ; * fBar2 = *( that . fBar2 ) ; return * this ; }
This is so much easier .
So why did n't I start with this at the outset ?
There are several reasons :
Going with the longer solution was a good way to explore many of the details of C++ memory management and syntax .
The shorter solution wo n't work if NULL is a valid value for fBar1 and fBar2 .
In this case , you 'd have to use a hybrid solution : follow the longer example when you 're copying an object into a null pointer , and the shorter example when you 're copying an object into an object .
( I 'll leave this example as an exercise for the reader . )
is a valid value for and .
In this case , you 'd have to use a hybrid solution : follow the longer example when you 're copying an object into a null pointer , and the shorter example when you 're copying an object into an object .
( I 'll leave this example as an exercise for the reader . )
The shorter solution wo n't work if we want to transactionize the whole assignment .
In other words , if we have a situation where both assignments have to complete successfully in order for our object to be in a consistent state , we can't use the simple solution because there 's no way to roll back our changes to fBar1 if assigning to fBar2 throws an exception .
You 'd have to use the longer example .
However , if the two data members are unrelated , or you know their assignment operators can't throw an exception , this solution is perfectly adequate .

You 'd have to use the longer example .
However , if the two data members are unrelated , or you know their assignment operators can't throw an exception , this solution is perfectly adequate .
The shorter solution wo n't work if TBar is a polymorphic class .
Let 's take a closer look at this situation .
Handling polymorphism
I stated in the original problem that you could assume for the purposes of the exercise that TBar was a monomorphic class that is , that TBar has no subclasses .
If TBar is a polymorphic class that is , if we know it has or can have subclasses then the shorter solution wo n't work .
Let 's pretend for a moment that TBar is an abstract class and that it has two concrete subclasses , TDerivedBar1 and TDerived Bar2 ( yeah , I know I 'm really creative with these names ) .
All we have in our short example are pointers to TBar .
Each assignment above will call TBar 's operator= function , not the operator= function of TDerived Bar1 or TDerived Bar2 ( remember , operator= ( ) is n't virtual ) .
This means that any data members defined by the TDerived Bar classes wo n't be copied .
This is called slicing , and it 's something you have to watch out for in C ++.
You must always pay special attention to whether a class is polymorphic or monomorphic .
Polymorphism imposes special restrictions on what you can do with your objects , and the compiler does n't enforce these restrictions .
Of course , we could theoretically get around these problems by making TBar 's operator= function virtual .
If this -> fBar1 is an instance of TDerived Bar1 , you 'll call TDerivedBar1 : :operator= ( ) instead of TBar : : operator= ( ) .
But if it 's a TDerived Bar2 , you 're in trouble .
TDerived Bar1 is n't going to know what to do with TDerived Bar2 's members ; it has nowhere to put them .
You really want it to look like the object pointed to by this ->
fBar1 has morphed from a TDerived Bar2 to a TDerived Bar1 .
There 's only one way to do this , and that 's to delete the TDerived Bar2 and new up a brand - new TDerived Bar1 .
So our longer solution , where we delete the old objects and replace them with newly - created objects ( either directly or with auto_ptr ) , is closer to the mark .
But it wo n't work as written , either .
Consider the line
fBar1 = new TBar ( * that. fBar1 ) ;
If TBar is an abstract class , this will generate a compile - time error , because you 're trying to create an instance of a class that can't be instantiated .
If TBar is a concrete , but polymorphic , class , it 'll compile , but you 'll get slicing again : the new expression will only return an instance of TBar , even if the original object was a TDerived Bar1 .
At best this is n't a real copy and at worst it has incomplete and inconsistent state .
The C++ language does n't provide a built - in way around this problem , unfortunately  if you need to copy an object polymorphically , you have to do it yourself .
The typical way to do this is to define a virtual function called clone ( ) and have every class that inherits clone ( ) override it to call its own copy constructor .
class TBar { ... virtual TBar* clone ( ) const = 0 ; ... } ; TDerivedBar1 :: clone ( ) const { return new TDerived Bar1 ( * this ) ; } TDerivedBar2 ::clone ( ) const { return new TDerived Bar2 ( * this ) ; }
Once you 've given all the classes in question a clone ( ) method , you can go back and rewrite TFoo 's assignment operator properly :
TFoo& TFoo::operator=( const
TFoo& that ) { if ( this != & that ) { auto_ptr < TBar > bar1 = that .
fBar1 -> clone ( ) ; auto_ptr < TBar > bar2 = that .
fBar2->clone ( ) ; TSuperFoo ::operator= ( that ) ; fBar1 = bar1 ; fBar2 = bar2 ; } return * this ; }
Counted pointers and other esoterica
There are a few other points about owning and aliasing pointers that I wanted to make .
The first is that aliasing pointers can be fragile .
If you have other objects that have aliasing pointers to a TFoo 's fBar1 object , they 'll be bad after a call to TFoo 's assignment operator .
This means you have to be careful that any aliases have a shorter lifetime than the object 's owning pointer .
Typically , aliases are short - lifetime objects :
You obtain a aliasing pointer to a TFoo 's fBar1 at the top of a function , use it to perform some operations on the TBar , and then let it go out of scope at the end of the function .
If you were instead trying to keep the alias around for an indefinite period of time by making it a data member of some other object ( you 'd probably do this for performance or convenience ) , you 're asking for trouble .
The solution to this problem is almost always to make the persistent pointer point to something with a longer and more well - defined lifespan ( for example , the TFoo that owns the TBar you 're interested in ) .
Of course , there are situations where the relative lifetimes of a network of objects are n't clear , and therefore it is n't clear who should own whom , or which pointers can be kept around persistently .
The solution to this problem is the same as the solution to the problem of spending too much time copying objects to maintain clear ownership semantics : reference counting .
In reference counting , each object keeps track of how many other objects point to it .
These objects refer to the counted object through a counted pointer , which functions more or less like an aliasing pointer except that it notifies the object when it no longer refers to it ( either because it now points to something else , or because it 's going away ) .
Nobody deletes the counted object ; the counted object deletes itself when no one is left pointing to it .
The C++ standard does n't provide canned auto_ptr - style objects that do reference counting , but most frameworks do .
It can be expensive , especially in virtual - memory environments , though , so think twice before resorting to this solution .
An additional caveat is that if you use reference counting to improve performance in a situation where you 'd otherwise be copying objects at the drop of a hat , you do n't want to change the semantics of what you 're doing .
When you 're sharing to avoid unnecessary copying , every object still expects to behave like he has his own copy of the shared object .
That means the object can only be shared until someone tries to change it .
At that point , the object trying to change it must create a copy of his own .
This behavior is called copy - on - write semantics .
Often , it 's convenient to create a special counted - pointer class that enforces copy - on - write semantics transparently .
This is almost never provided by a framework , however ; you 'd have to code it yourself .
Note , by the way , that in a garbage - collected environment like Java , much of this material is still relevant .
It 's true that the garbage collector frees you from having to worry about deleting things ( much as reference counting does , but usually with less overhead ) , but that 's it .
It does n't free you from having to make sure your object remains in a consistent state if the assignment fails halfway through .
It does n't free you from worrying about ownership semantics with resources other than memory blocks ( such as disk files , window - system elements , or locks ) .
And it does n't free you from having to worry about when you need to duplicate an object and when an object can be shared .
In fact , it exacerbates the last two problems .
In C++ , for example , an object can release its system resources in its destructor , so that all you have to worry about is deleting the object itself ( and not even that if it 's in a local variable ) , whereas you have to explicitly release them in Java .
In C++ , you can usually use " const " in interfaces to tell whether an object can change another object 's state or not , where Java lacks " const , " forcing the use of ad - hoc conventions similar to the ones we use in C++ for ownership semantics ( or forcing a lot of extra copying ) .
And in both languages , you have to worry about which objects referring to a shared object should see the change if the shared object changes ( i.e. , when do you give an object its own copy of another object , and when can you legitimately share ? )
Garbage collection is definitely not a panacea .
Conclusion
Well , there you have it : a whirlwind tour of some of the finer points of C++ memory management , as seen through the lens of a simple assignment operator .
C++ is a monster of a language , and writing good code in it takes some practice and some concentration .
I hope these pointers help illuminate some of the more esoteric but important areas of C++ programming for you and help you to write better code .
And who knows ?
My team still has an opening .

The more advanced programmers reading this will probably be able to come up with one or two better ways of doing this than this particular example .
Stick with me ; I 'll get to them .
I present this example as a good general solution to the problem that works with almost all C++ compilers .
Japan 's foreign minister says an anti-whaling activist being held onboard a Japanese whaling vessel in the Antarctic Ocean will be taken to Tokyo and will not be released to a third country .
Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada says Peter Bethune , from the Sea Shepherd conservation group , is being held aboard the ship under international maritime law .
" In principle we will not hand the activist over to a third country .
We are preparing to bring him to Japan , " he said .
" He is under protective custody in accordance with the law . "
Mr Bethune was detained two days ago after jumping aboard the Shonan Maru 2 and attempting to present its skipper with a $ 3 million bill for the destruction of the Ady Gil powerboat , of which he was captain .
Japanese media reports say that after Mr Bethune has been taken to Tokyo , the government will try to establish a criminal case and possibly charge him with piracy .
Japan 's NHK television is reporting that the New Zealander will be detained on the Shonan Maru 2 , the security ship shadowing the Japanese whaling fleet in the Antarctic .
" Bethune is to be handed over to the Japan Coast Guard when the ship returns to Japan in about a month , and could face charges under Japanese law , " the report said .
" Bethune would be the first Sea Shepherd member to be questioned by Japanese authorities . "
Mr Okada will visit Australia this weekend for talks with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his foreign and defence ministers , and Japan 's whaling program is again expected to be high on the agenda .
" We are going to discuss various bilateral issues as well as global issues such as climate change and nuclear disarmament , to develop a strategic partnership between our two countries , " said Mr Okada .
" Probably we will discuss [ the ] whaling issue as well .
Australia has various opinions about research whaling .
So we discuss these sufficiently " he says .
While threatening legal action against Japan over its whaling program , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has insisted he will try to find a diplomatic solution first .
Two years ago two Sea Shepherd activists boarded a whaling ship and tied themselves to the deck , but they were later released with the help of an Australian government ship .
It 's easy to think about games in terms of winning and losing .
They are a series of increasingly complex challenges that you either pass or fail .
Reaching a fail state leads the player to a bitter few seconds of rebuke , before he or she is presented with the same problem again .
This is the oldest and most basic stricture of game design , from Jacks to Go .
The inherent power of video games is their ability to make take these rudimentary principles of interaction into an authored space that affects a player 's senses .
I remember teaching my younger cousin how to play Super Mario Bros .
when we were kids .
At every jump she jerked the controller upwards , and she cried out in mock pain upon falling into a lava pool .
Immersion is a concept that appears with great frequency in game design , but the means to conjure it can be elusive .
For all the attention to detail put into art and animation , inconsistent AI or awkward lip - synching can make players roll their eyes .
Likewise , a grainy DS Pokémon game on the Nintendo DS can hold young players rapt for hours .
How do games hold players ' attentions without running aground on disbelief and incredulity ?
How can designers turn a feeling into lines of code , and then into an experience that moves a player to keep pushing through an interactive fantasy ?
It Moved Me , and It Moves Me Still
Movement is the most basic element of 3D game design .
You can create a world and a series of rules to govern the objects in that world , but until there is a cipher to move among those objects the game is lifeless .
Movement is also the first and most persistent layer of interaction which developers are able to communicate with players .
" Movement is the core of the game and because of that we focused heavily on that until we got it right , " said Owen O'Brien , senior producer on DICE 's Mirror 's Edge .
" The movement was the first thing we developed before Faith , before the story , before anything else . "
Without a cutscene , dialog box , or instructional manual , character movement can communicate a lot of dramatic qualities .
In Mirror 's Edge , the emphasis on momentum and slight left to right movement of the camera with each step , subconsciously draw players towards its acrobatic gameplay .
Killzone 2 and Gears of War give players a sense of constraint with the lumbering movement animation that subconsciously encourage methodical play and special attention to cover .
" We had a series of designer - constructed test rooms for every aspect of player movement so we could prototype everything in exhaustive detail , " said Michael Kelbaugh , president and CEO of Retro Studios , discussing the development of Metroid Prime .
" Only when we had that really mastered did we begin the bulk of world construction . "
It can be tempting to rush past this stage of the prototyping process to get to the actual content creation , but having an evocative movement system can be a turnkey in evolving a staid genre .
Need for Speed Shift took one of EA 's annual franchises out of the oxidizing conventions of its predecessors by focusing on first person racing .
After bottoming out with 2008 's Need for Speed Undercover , Shift added twenty points to its Metacritic score on a wave of largely admiring reviews .
" The key aim with the cockpit view was to translate that raw intensity that you feel in a real - life race car to a player holding a control pad , " said Andy Tudor of Slightly Mad Studios , describing Shift 's design .
" At high speed we do a combination of things ; blurring the cockpit out to make you concentrate on the upcoming apex , camera shake , and even having the driver 's hands shake and grip the wheel tighter as they try to control the car .
All these combined give you the cues you need to get an exhilarating sensation of speed . "
These ambient flourishes suggest consequence to the in - game action that has a real - life counterpart .
It 's one thing to see your in - game performance evaluated through abstract meters in a HUD , but it 's much more frightening to think a mistimed input could send you through the terrible experience of a full speed car crash in first person .
It can be easy to think about what the player is supposed to accomplish , but the best games also focus on what they want their players to feel while they busy achieving objectives .
" We wanted the player to feel as if they were actually inside Samus ' helmet , " said Kelbaugh .
" Our first idea was that beads of water could appear on the faceplate when Samus moved into and out of water or steam .
When this test worked so well , we began to look for more opportunities to use this function , like enemy goo , Samus ' reflection , and so on . "
With the recently released Dead Space Extraction , Visceral Games and Eurocom invested a lot of time in motion capture , facial animation , and creating a library of first person movements to create a more cinematic horror experience .
" We were pretty fortunate that Eurocom has a really fantastic motion capture studio right there at their offices , " said Wright Bagwell , creative director at Visceral .
" We basically had one of the actors carrying the camera around and they were just acting out these big scenes we had designed . "
" We discovered early on that if you have a guy running around with a camera and you take that capture straight out of the studio , it can be pretty obnoxious . "
Steve Cofield -- who seems to be the only credentialed reporter who 's willing to ask Dana White a tough question -- asked Dana about Frank Mir 's recent comments about wanting to literally kill Brock Lesnar in the Octagon .
He got no response from Dana beyond an icy stare .
Here 's Cofield 's commentary on the situation :
It seemed like the perfect platform to explain why he was so upset with Frank Mir's " first death in the Octagon " comments .
Dana
White had a big audience at Radio City Music Hall and good representation from the New York / New Jersey media .
...
So we 'd figured let 's tee it up for White , he 'd probably come up with a good answer about why he thought the " death " comments could be damaging .
Instead we found out just how steamed White was about the initial comments ( 1:25 mark - cleaner version at UFC.com ) .
White gave us an icy glare and then emboldened by the booing crowd of a 1,000 - plus at Radio City , smirked and said , " next question . "
Here 's how The Globe and Mail 's Stephen Brunt interpreted Dana 's response :
The lesson : Dana
White , though a master at playing to any audience , from corporate powerbrokers to the hardest of the UFC hard core , does not like to be embarrassed in public , especially with so much on the line .
Brunt goes on to get a bit philosophical :
There is skill and there can be beauty in boxing , and anyone who has seen Saturday 's other headliner , Georges St - Pierre , in action , ca n't help but see in his grace and agility and balance a lot of the same qualities that caused many a celebrated intellect to swoon over the great boxer / dancers ( Ali , Willie Pep , Ray Robinson ) ; and it is human cock - fighting , as is boxing , in that those watching circle round , feeling none of the pain , moved by the bloodletting at a distance , feeding instincts buried deep in the genetic code .
But Dana
White can't stand up , as politicians are testing the breeze , and say you ought to let us do this because people like to watch it .
Behind that silent smile , though , the civilizing facade temporarily pulled down , you could n't blame him if that was exactly what he was thinking .
Here 's Cofield 's summation :
White was n't pleased with the question in such a celebratory / rah - rah environment .
That 's certainly understandable .
He 's hard to figure out sometimes .
By trying to hide his take on something or bury a story , he simply calls more attention to something that in the end is pretty stupid .
Words should not be more impactful than actions .
And the talk of " killing " or " destroying " an opponent has a long history in fighting .
By shying away from talking out the issues and calming down the morons who would like to use Mir 's comments as some anti-MMA crutch , White is only allowing their voice to be heard without a rebuttal .
As you can see from Brunt 's free association based on Dana 's non-answer which settles on the old " human cockfighting canard " ( albeit dressed up in a more nuanced manner ) , Cofield is exactly right .
By refusing to engage in an honest critical dialog with the press , Dana
White left the field clear for a traditional sports writer at a major paper in one of the two key markets where the UFC is currently not allowed ( Ontario ) to muse himself back around to the old John McCain human cockfighting position .
Obviously , Brunt was making a more nuanced argument and was n't using " human cockfighting " in the original pejorative ( or even in an incorrect ) manner , but nevertheless , it 's definitely not the spin that Dana and Ontario MMA fans want to see out there in the biggest paper in Ontario just at the point when regulation seems like a real possibility .
This is not an isolated situation , rather it is reflective of an almost obsessive and self - defeating desire on the part of the UFC brass to whitewash problems ( or airbrush tattoos ) rather than address them directly and in a mature manner .
The logo for the new UK Space Agency launched by the United Kingdom on March 23 , 2010 .
The United Kingdom ( U.K. ) launched a new national spaceagency Tuesday along with plans for a multimillion - dollar space innovationcenter in England .
The U.K. Space Agency is slated to open its doors byApril 1 .
This hub for all British space activities will be based at a new ? 40 million ( nearly $ 60 million U.S. )
International Space Innovation Centreannounced today along with the new space agency , British space officials saidduring the announcement .
? The action we ?re taking today shows that we ?re reallyserious about space , ? said Lord Paul Drayson , U.K. Minister for Science and Innovation , in a statement .
?
The U.K. Space Agency will give the sector themuscle it needs to fulfill its ambition . ?
Drayson said that the Britishspace industry has remained strong despite recessiontroubles elsewhere and could grow into a ? 40 billion ( $ 60 billion ) - a- year industryand create more than 100,000 jobs over the next 20 years .
? The government ?s commitments on space will help thesector go from strength to strength , ? he said .
The United Kingdom ?s spaceand satellite industry currently supports about 68,000 jobsand contributes ? 6 billion ( $ 9 billion ) annually to the economy .
The new U.K. Space Agency ?s International SpaceInnovation Centre is expected to serve as a nexus for data collected byEarth - observation satellites , British space officials said .
At least one usefor that data includes understanding and countering climate change , they added .
The center is also expected to advise U.K. officials onhow best to maintain the ? security and resilience of space systems andservices , ?
agency officials said in a statement .
The new space center will be built near the EuropeanSpace Agency ?s U.K. Research Center in Oxfordshire , England . ?
The U.K. Space Agency will replace the British NationalSpace Centre as the management hub for all civilianspace activities performed in England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
British space officials also said they envisiondeveloping a national space technology strategy for the United Kingdom , strengthening climate - monitoring abilities to boost the U.K.?s role in climatechange policy and science , as well as setting up an expert panel to take stockof emerging technologies for space - based security and defense projects .
British space officials said they are also interested inusing space - based systems to support the next generation of broadbandcommunications services in the United Kingdom .
Doing a complete website redesign of my online store has been on my “ to do ” list for a very long time , but I could not get myself to pull the trigger because it was never a priority .
Here ’s the thing .
My conversion rate has always been pretty good ( > 3 % ) .
And my online store has been growing in the double digits every year so why rock the boat ?
But then I attended a mastermind meeting 3 months ago with a bunch of other ecommerce veterans and decided to bring this up during my turn on the “ hotseat ” .
Hey everyone .
I ’m thinking about doing a site redesign , but the my current conversion rate is still pretty good .
Do I need to update it right now ?
And do you think it ’s bad enough that I need to fix it today ?
Can I put it off another year ?
The answers I received were excruciatingly painful to hear .
This website looks like it was designed in the 90’s .
If you did a redesign , I bet you could get a 50 % bump in conversion rate .

These are the types of sites I like to buy , fix up and then resell at a profit .
– Dana Jaunzemis
Hearing these comments really hurt my pride and I tried my best to not be defensive .
But as soon as I got back from the mastermind I immediately contacted my designer , whipped up a quick mockup in Photoshop , and started cranking on it .
My process for the implementation was pretty straightforward .
I went through and plowed through each and every page myself , laid it out “ roughly ” how I wanted it to look and had my designer pick up the pieces to make it “ look better ” .
I budgeted about 6 weeks to get the redesign done with me contributing about 40 hours of my own time .
Every single page on the site was completely redone .
Overall , the project ended up taking 7 weeks due to unforeseen circumstances with browser compatibility ( I hate you IE ! ) and cost me $ 1840 .

Here ’s a link to my new site and you can use the wayback machine to see the old version .

My Website Redesign Results
The following conversion results are for mobile , desktop and tablet for Google CPC traffic only .
Because my site gets a ton of traffic from content pages that do not necessarily convert to sales , running the numbers for targeted ppc ad traffic made the most sense for comparison purposes .
Desktop conversion rates increased by 46 % Updated !
rates increased by 46 % Mobile conversion rates increased by 21 % Updated !
rates increased by 21 % Tablet conversion rates increased by 25 % Updated !
Note :
My conversion rate data was compared to the exact same period as the prior year to eliminate variables like seasonality and fluctuations in demand .
That being said , the only true way to measure conversion rate differences is to split test the designs which I did not do in the interests of time .
First off , the increase in desktop conversion rate really shocked me as I was not expecting such a large jump .
I knew that my old site needed work but not this much !
( Update : After a few months of more data , the conversion rate increase for desktop is at 46 % )
For tablet customers , the conversion rate increase was actually higher than 15 % because I found a major bug in the tablet implementation a few weeks after launch which were mixed in with the results .
( Update : After a few months of more data , the conversion rate increase for tablet is at 25 % . )
And for mobile , I had already implemented a pretty decent mobile site back in 2013 so I was n’t expecting any huge jumps but 12 % is still pretty good .
( Update : After a few months of more data , the conversion rate increase for mobile is at 21 % . )
In any case despite the increase in conversion rate , not all of the data was rosy .
For some reason , my onsite metrics like bounce rate have increased roughly 10 % across the board .
Editor ’s Note : Right now , I suspect it ’s because I removed the left hand navigation from the site but I ’ll need to sift through the data to find out exactly why that is happening .
Update !
I stopped support for several browser versions in this redesign which contributed to this issue .
What Shopping Cart Am I Using ?
The most common question I always get asked with every redesign is …
Steve what shopping cart is this ?
Is it Shopify ?
Or is it Bigcommerce ?
And when I tell everyone that I ’m still using my heavily modified old school open source shopping cart , they are usually shocked .
Here ’s the thing …
The shopping cart that you choose has nothing to do with the way your shopping cart looks , or the way your website looks .
The main purpose of your shopping cart is to handle and process transactions .
If your shopping cart has all of the backend features that you need , then you do n’t necessarily need to switch .
The aesthetics of your website have very little to do with the shopping cart engine .
So even if you have a shopping cart that ’s old like mine , as long as it has all the features you need , you should n’t judge it by the way it looks , because you can always change the way it looks .
The best part is that if you are on an open source platform , you can add your own features whenever you want because you have full control .
For example for this site redesign , I implemented this nifty little social proof feature for my shop .
Basically every 5 - 15 seconds , a little window pops up in the lower left corner that displays a previous purchase made on the site .
On Shopify , you can purchase a plugin to do the exact same thing and pay $ 15 / month .
But it took me roughly 5 hours ( it really should have taken 2 hours but my coding was rusty ) to pump out the same thing with no recurring fees .
Anyway , these are just some of the advantages of owning the source code .
If you are technically inclined , I recommend giving open source a try .
But if you are clueless about web design and you do n’t want to have to deal with anything technical , then go with a Shopify or a BigCommerce .
Changing Out The Color Scheme
One of the biggest complaints about my site from an aesthetic perspective was the color scheme .
The old site was purple and yellow and the color palette I chose made the site look old fashioned .
Editor ’s Note :
Here ’s a link to my new site and you can use the wayback machine to see the old version .
What ’s ironic is that in my Create A Profitable Online Store Course , I actually teach lessons on color theory but I did n’t have this knowledge back in 2013 so I never got a chance to put it into practice .
Anyway in a nutshell , I used a site called color .
adobe.com to choose complementary colors for my new design .
And to freshen up the look and feel , I chose teal , hot pink and yellow .
Why 3 colors ?
It ’s because I wanted a specific color associated with “ taking action ” .
I wanted a specific color to “ draw attention ” .
And finally , I wanted a bright overall color to make the site feel “ young and hip ” .
Teal is my background color .
Yellow is my “ attention ” color if I have any special offers , and hot pink is used for every single action button on the site because it stands out and pops .
Every single page on my site is designed to have a singular objective .
For the front page , I want people to browse our personalized collection because it ’s the section with the highest margins .
On the category pages , I want people to click on a product .
And on a product page , I want people to click “ Add To Cart ” .
The 3 Pillars Of Conversion
One big mistake that I see people make when designing their own websites is that they try to copy Amazon.com .
Amazon is the largest ecommerce platform on the planet so why would n’t I model my site after theirs ?
First of all , Amazon ’s website design is ugly , generic and not suitable for most niche online stores .
The reason that Amazon can get away with an ugly website is because everybody knows who they are , they are used to the interface and they already trust Amazon .
But when you have your own website , you have to establish that trust from scratch because no one knows who you are .
Overall , there are three main things that are crucial to anyone landing on your site for the first time .
One , you need to let people know that you offer free shipping .
Some sort of free shipping offer is now par for the course thanks to Amazon and the other big box ecommerce shops .
Two , because you are an unknown entity , you want to reassure customers that they can return their merchandise if they are not satisfied .
And finally , the third thing you must establish with a new customer is trust which is perhaps the most important factor of them all .
If a customer lands on your site and they do n’t trust your store because they ’ve never heard of you , they ’re just going to pick up and leave .
For my redesign , I enforce trust in many different ways .
In the header of every single page , I emphasize free shipping , no hassle returns and my phone number .
Having a phone number in plain view is VERY IMPORTANT !
Whenever I shop online at a new boutique , the first thing I always do is click on the contact page and look for a phone number and an address .
And if neither of those items are displayed or if only one of the two are present , I will not shop there .
Customers want the ability to contact a store should something go wrong with their purchase .
And as a result , you want this information as visible as possible on every single page including your store hours .
Having “ official store hours ” also makes your shop seem more professional because you come across like an established business with “ real ” office hours .
Social Proof And Trust
Towards the bottom of every single page , I have a dedicated section for social proof which lends to the credibility of my site .
After all , we ’ve been featured on a whole bunch of different magazines and we ’ve been on the Today show , so what ’s the point if we do n’t brag about it ?
Our social proof / press mentions section is on every single page of the site so even if you do n’t see it the first time around , you will eventually notice .
I also asked a bunch of our customers for their photo and a testimonial which is displayed just below the press section .
These are real customers who shopped on our site , were very happy with their purchase , and were willing to leave a very nice testimonial for us .
One particular customer Sherri has purchased over a hundred and fifty times from our site because she really likes our handkerchiefs .
And finally , I ’ve included some verbiage that reassures the customer that their satisfaction is our main concern .
We never let a customer leave unhappy .
And if anything ever goes wrong we provide full refunds .
Changing Up The Navigation
Redesigning the navigation for my new site was an area where I struggled .
First off , I ’m a HUGE fan of left hand side navigation .
My old design had it and my customers loved it because the menu was always visible and accessible .
The left side of a webpage is also where your eye naturally gravitates towards and it ’s the most obvious place to start shopping .
But here was my dilemma …
If I were to include a dedicated left hand column for navigation , everything else on the site would have to shrink .
For example , all of my product images would need to be reduced significantly which would negatively impact conversions .
My category images would be smaller which would lower the CTR .
The verbiage on each page would take up more screen real estate which would push products further down the page .
So ultimately , I went with a top level , hover - style , drop down menu .
The beauty of a top level navigation bar is that it behaves similar to a left hand navigation bar , but it does n’t occupy the same amount of screen real estate .
And by moving the navigation to the top , I was able to blow up my category and product images by 300 % which made them really pop .
The other advantage of using top level navigation was the ability to separate out distinct categories in a very clean fashion .
For example , I now have a distinct “ Shop By Occasion ” category pull down whereas in my old design , this section was mixed in with the rest of the left hand menu so it did n’t stand out .
I also added a special section dedicated for personalized goods , best sellers , new arrivals , a FAQ page , a contact page , the about page , view cart and check out .
Basically , all of the most important navigation items are now in the main bar for everybody to see .
Emphasizing My Unique Value Proposition
One important principle that I teach in my ecommerce course is that every single landing page on your site must have a strong unique value proposition .
Why should someone buy from your store ?
Why should I shop here as opposed to a competitor ?
The answer should be clear right away .
So for this design , I chose to emphasize our strengths front and center on every page on our site .
For example on the front page , our value proposition is right smack within the splash image .
On our category pages , I implemented a special text box to convey why our store is special .
The ultimate goal is to convince a customer within the first 5 seconds why they should buy from you and not a competitor .
Beautifying The Product Pages
One of the biggest takeaways from my site critique was that my product pages were not up to par .
Here ’s a product page from the old design .
Here ’s that the same page looks like on my new site .
Do you notice any differences ?
First off , because I removed the left hand side bar , I was able to increase the size of the product image by 266 % .
Not only is the main image a lot larger , but I also rearranged the elements of the product page to encourage more “ Add To Cart ” clicks .
For example right next to the “ Add To Cart ” button are text boxes that reassure the customer of free shipping and no hassle returns .
There is also a link up top that dynamically tells the customer when they ’ll receive their order depending on whether they choose standard or express , and all the related shipping fees involved .
I also superimposed Pinterest and Facebook buttons directly on the image itself to encourage sharing after noticing that most visitors did n’t even look at the dedicated share buttons on my old site .
One thing that is interesting to note is that I originally had two huge blue and red buttons to share on Facebook and Pinterest right under the image as shown below .
But ultimately I decided to remove them because they stood out more than the hot pink “ Add To Cart ” button .
In the end , I value an “ Add To Cart ” action far more than a social media share .
Finally , I also increased the size of the cross sell section to entice the customer to buy similar items .
Improving Checkout
Improving the checkout process was n’t a huge priority for me because there were n’t any gross problems with the old site .
But since I had the hood opened up already , I decided to fix some outstanding issues that have been lingering on my site for quite some time .
First off , every now and then we would get calls from people who were confused and wondered if they needed an account to shop on our site .
Here ’s what the first checkout page looked like on our old site .
The solution to this problem was to hide the login by default and only display two hot pink buttons for check out .
I also made the trust logos more prominent to reassure the customer that checkout is secure and that their satisfaction is guaranteed .
The other major change was that I made the checkout completely responsive .
Note :
If you are on Shopify , then you ’ve probably already seen what a good looking responsive checkout process looks like .
So instead of reinventing the wheel , I basically emulated Shopify ’s checkout design because it ’s pretty awesome .
In a nutshell , here ’s what my checkout looks like now across different screen sizes .
For desktop …
For tablet and mobile
A Few Words About Mobile
During my last site redesign in 2013 , I implemented a completely separate mobile website apart from the desktop site which lived in a different subdomain .
And while I still believe that it was the right decision at the time , it is definitely not the case today .
Today , there are many frameworks like BootStrap which make responsive design so much easier .
Over the past several years , it has been a major pain in the butt to keep my mobile and desktop sites in sync so I ’m happy to now have a single unified site across all platforms .
The main downside of going responsive was that I had to thoroughly test the site across 3 completely different platforms , desktop , tablet and mobile .
And within each platform were multiple browser versions and screen resolutions to deal with .
For example , I had to test IE 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 for Windows machines .
I had to test Safari 6,7 and 8 for Macs .
In the end , I went through my Google Analytics account to perform usability testing for each and every browser that has been used on my site in the past year using a tool called Browser Stack .
Needless to say , this process sucked and was my least favorite part of the redesign : (
Anyway , here are a few highlights regarding the new mobile design .
Most of these line items are pretty standard so I wo n’t bore you with too many details .
On tablet and mobile , I changed the the menu to collapse to a single pull down menu .
Based on my previous mobile site , I discovered that everyone tends to go straight for the search bar so I made sure to include the search bar front and center on every single page on the mobile site .
Because the screen real estate is much smaller on a phone , I removed certain “ non essential ” elements of the page for smaller screen sizes .
Pinterest Changes
The final change I made was I completely revamped my content pages .
As I ’ve mentioned many times in the past , I use our arts and craft pages to funnel people over to our online store .
And Pinterest is a large traffic source for these pages .
As a result , I completely redid most of the craft images and made special tall and skinny versions just for Pinterest .
I also made brand new images for our product photos as well .
For example , instead of using a rectangular image for Pinterest when you click on the “ pin ” button you now get a tall and skinny version that is hi res .
Conclusion
All in all , 7 weeks and $ 1840 is a pretty good investment for the gains that I ’m now experiencing .
My main problem right now is that I have too many projects going on simultaneously and not enough time to work on each one .
But here ’s the thing …
Even though my conversion rate was good before , the net increase in sales due to an even better conversion rate will likely trump the other traffic building efforts I had planned to implement this year .
And if there ’s a lesson to be learned here , it ’s that increasing the conversion rate for your site will increase sales across all of your other traffic sources .
The foundation for your ecommerce business starts with your platform and it ’s important to have all of your ducks in place BEFORE you focus on building traffic .

How to Write Interesting Sentences ( at the expense of Saskatchewan )

First there was the “ tea party ” protester .
Now meet the Tea-publican .
Conservative activists who once protested the political establishment are now flooding the lowest level of the Republican Party apparatus hoping to take over the party they once scorned -- one precinct at a time .
Across the country , tea party groups that had focused on planning rallies are educating members on how to run for GOP precinct representative positions .
The representatives help elect county party leaders , who write the platform and , in some places , determine endorsements .
“ That ’s where it all starts .
That ’s where the process of picking candidates begins .
It ’s not from [ GOP leader ] Michael Steele ’s office down .
It ’s from the ground up , ” said Philip Glass , whose National Precinct Alliance is among the groups advocating the strategy .
“ The party is over for the old guard . ”
Advertisement
In Arizona and Ohio , Republican Party officials report an increase in candidates running for precinct positions , which often sit open because of a lack of interest .
In South Carolina , a coalition of tea party groups has made a formal agreement with the state GOP to urge its members to get engaged at the precinct level .
In Nevada , a group of “ constitutional conservatives ” working under the tea party banner has already taken control of the Republican Party in the Las Vegas area , gaining enough strength to elect six of the seven members of the county executive committee .
Glass ’ group and others say their work is nonpartisan ; their hope is that people will reshape both major political parties .
But for most of the small - government conservatives of the tea party movement , the Republican Party is a more natural fit .

The shift to local party politics is a notable turn for the group , which emerged in opposition to national financial bailouts supported by both parties .
But protesting has its limits , said Darla Dawald , national director for a conservative social networking site , ResistNet.com , that is directing people to local party contacts .
The protests were a way to “ catapult people off their couches .
But then we needed to give them something to do , a way to get engaged . ”
Dawald took a look at her own precincts in Arizona ’s Pinal County .
She said only 40 % of precinct committee positions were filled .
In Maricopa County , home to Phoenix , only 30 % of the positions were occupied , she said .
Dawald , who owned a gift shop that had closed in the recession , said it looked to her like no one was minding the store .
“ It ’s not like we ’re going in and replacing people .
We ’re going into positions that are open , things nobody is doing , ” she said .
“ It was clear that a small group of people within the party were making decisions for everyone . ”

After several months of organizing , Maricopa County now has 50 % , or about 3,000 , of its precinct committee positions filled .
In Nevada ’s Clark County , the number of occupied precinct slots has swelled from roughly 200 to nearly 1,000 , party officials said .
Party meetings that were once held in conference rooms have been moved to casino ballrooms .
Many Republican
Party leaders have welcomed the activity , particularly because they worried that the energy driving the tea party movement might create a third party that would split the conservative vote .
That scenario played out in New York ’s 23rd Congressional District in a special election last year , a cautionary tale in Republican circles because it led to a Democrat capturing a longtime GOP House seat .
The precinct strategy is a sign that tea party activists are finding a home -- or in many cases are willing to return to a home -- in the GOP .

“ We believe we have a whole lot more in common than not , ” said Patrick Haddon , the Republican Party chairman in Greenville , S.C. “ We believe we can help each other .
They know what they believe , they ’re passionate about it , they can organize .
And we have a lot of experience in how elections are run and how campaigns are run . ”
The South Carolina GOP announced at a news conference last week that it had reached an agreement to work more closely with the Upcountry Coalition of Conservative Organizations , a collection of tea party groups in the state .
Under the deal , the coalition will help the party rebuild at the precinct level .
The party agreed to support fiscally conservative candidates .
Haddon will act as a liaison between the groups .
But some reaction to the agreement shows how many in the tea party are still skittish about associating with the GOP -- or worse , being viewed as a party appendage .
After state party Chairwoman Karen Floyd described the agreement on television , activists cried foul , saying she had left the impression that the party and the tea parties had merged .
Coalition spokesman Harry Kibler said he felt “ betrayed ” and “ used . ”

Another news conference was called to clarify the terms .
“ We are independent .
We will remain independent .
And we will vote for the most conservative candidates regardless of party , ” Kibler said Friday .

Remember when you ran out to buy a T - Mobile G1 right away when it was launched 14 months ago ?
Google apparently does n't -- it 's only extending the $ 179 subsidized price for the Nexus One to new T - Mobile customers , meaning existing customers are being told they have to pay the full sticker of $ 529 for the Snapdragon device .
As you can imagine , that 's got quite a few T - Mobile customers pretty angry -- especially since Google 's systems are n't even allowing upgrade - eligible T- Mo subscribers to purchase at a discount , and there 's no customer service line to call and complain .
We 're hoping this is just a glitch while Google takes its first steps into direct phone sales , but we 'll keep an eye on the situation .

Lewis Hamilton described the Australian Grand Prix as one of the finest drives of his career , and blamed a poor strategy and Mark Webber 's mistake for costing him a good finish .
The McLaren driver fought through from 11th on the grid to challenge Robert Kubica for second by half - distance , but then pitted for fresh tyres along with most of the field .
Jenson Button , Robert Kubica , Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso decided to nurse their tyres to the finish , though , leaving Hamilton back in fifth .
He caught the battle between the Renault and the two Ferraris , then was pushed into a spin by Webber with two laps to go and finished only sixth .
" To sum up the race I think I probably had one of the drives of my life and unfortunately , due to the strategy , I was put further back and then I got taken out by Mark Webber , " Hamilton told the BBC .
" I 'm happy with the job that I did .
I think I honestly drove my heart out today and I think I deserved better than what I ended up with , but I 'll keep fighting to the next race . "
Hamilton had criticised McLaren 's strategy over the radio , and he remained certain that pitting for a second time had been the wrong move .
" All I know is the guys do , always , a fantastic job , but the strategy was not right , " he said .
" Everyone else in front of me did one stop and for some reason I did two . "
When asked whose decision the second stop had been , Hamilton replied : " I do n't know , we 'll find out . "
What Does a Mesothelioma Diagnosis Mean ?
Mesothelioma is a rare , aggressive form of cancer that develops in the lining of the lungs , abdomen , or heart .
Mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos .
Although this cancer has a poor prognosis , there are many long - term survivors .
Prognosis
The stage of the disease , cell type , location , and subtype ( i.e. pleural or peritoneal ) are some of the most important factors for a patient ’s survival .
Additional factors that have an impact on life expectancy include the overall health of the patient at the time of diagnosis , age of the patient , whether or not the cancer has spread , and treatments chosen .
Staging
Upon diagnosis , the physician will categorize the disease into one of four stages .
The most commonly used criteria for staging is the TNM System ( Tumor , Lymph Nodes , Metastasis ) .
The four stages of mesothelioma are as follows :
Stage 1 : The mesothelioma tumor is located in only one area and has not spread to other parts of the body
Stage 2 : A large tumor may have progressed to nearby area and / or the lymph nodes , but has not gone any further
Stage 3 : Tumors have typically spread beyond the local area to several nearby locations and lymph nodes
Stage 4 : The tumors have spread into multiple areas and throughout the lymphatic system , invading other organs throughout the body
Typically , Stage1 and Stage 2 mesothelioma may be treated effectively with surgery and other forms of therapy .
However , palliative care options are generally the only treatment options available for Stage 3 and Stage 4 mesothelioma , unless the patient selects a clinical trial or alternative approaches .
Treatment
Standard treatment options for mesothelioma patients are similar to the treatment options associated with other forms of cancer and include : surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy .
Usually , a combination of these treatments ( surgery and chemotherapy / radiation therapy ) is used in an effort to combat this disease .
For people who do not respond well to conventional treatments , newer treatments studied in clinical trials may be available .
Mesothelioma treatments can be used as a means to improve the patient ’s prognosis and extend the life expectancy of a patient , or can be used palliatively to reduce pain and discomfort associated with mesothelioma .
What Do I Do Now I Have Been Diagnosed With Mesothelioma ?
A diagnosis of mesothelioma can be frightening , confusing , and frustrating .
Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer that is challenging to treat .
However , once a definitive diagnosis is obtained , the primary goal of the patient is to live as long as possible with this rare cancer .
There are multiple steps a patient can take in order to extend their life after a mesothelioma diagnosis .
Seek a second opinion about your diagnosis from a mesothelioma specialist .
Mesothelioma may be difficult to diagnose and easy to misdiagnose , therefore , seeking a second opinion for confirmation can be smart .
Explore all your treatment options such as conventional , clinical trials , and alternative approaches .
If the disease is diagnosed in the early stages , conventional therapies such as surgery may be helpful .
In more advanced cases , other options should be explored because conventional treatments are limited .
Meet with more than one doctor and make sure these doctors have a track record of success with mesothelioma .
Improving diet and exercise will improve your overall health and may improve your response to treatment .
As a patient , your overall goal should be to have good quality and life and live as long as possible once a diagnosis has been reached .
This means keeping an open mind to the entire universe of treatment options .
What Support Is There For Mesothelioma Sufferers ?
Patients with mesothelioma need support in many ways including physically , emotionally , and financially .
There are foundations and organizations across the country that are ready to help .
Support Groups
Support groups can offer mesothelioma patients renewed hope as they help mesothelioma patients connect with each other and share their experience living with the disease .
This sense of camaraderie can give mesothelioma patients a sense of control and empowerment and this sense of control can reduce the feelings of anxiety , loneliness and depression .
In addition , support groups allow patients to share knowledge about doctors , cancer centers , and treatments that have been successful .
Support groups are available in - person , via telephone , and online to allow patients to choose the format that best suits them .
Travel Resources
It is not uncommon for patients to have to travel to the best mesothelioma specialists for treatment .
There are organizations that give free flights to patients with mesothelioma and other forms of cancer .
When patients receive treatment at hospitals , there is often discounted housing available for families and nearby hotels usually offer reduced rates .
Financial Assistance
There are several type of financial compensation available to offset the costs associated with mesothelioma treatments .
These include : legal claims ( lawsuits and claims against asbestos trust funds ) , and VA claims .
Many companies put asbestos deliberately into products long after they knew that asbestos was dangerous and could cause disease .
Today , these companies are responsible for compensating mesothelioma victims .
More information about the legal side if the disease is available here .
The percentage of top earners is growing rapidly under the Democratic Congress .
2,000 House staffers make six figures
Nearly 2,000 House of Representatives staffers pulled down six - figure salaries in 2009 , including 43 staffers who earned the maximum $ 172,500 — or more than three times the median U.S. household income .
Starting salaries on Capitol Hill are still low — many entry - level congressional jobs pay less than $ 30,000 a year .
And many of the most highly paid staffers could make several times the maximum by jumping to lobbying and consulting jobs in the private sector .
Advertisement
But the salary data , compiled for POLITICO by LegiStorm.com , show that it ’s possible to make an enviable living in Congress , even without winning an election .
The 43 staffers who maxed out at $ 172,500 — the salary cap for leadership and committee staffers — include John Lawrence , chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ; Paula Nowakowski , the late chief of staff to House Minority Leader John Boehner ; and House Parliamentarian John Sullivan .
They earned only slightly less than rank - and - file members of Congress , who make $ 174,000 .
All the salary data are part of the public record and are culled from congressional office disbursement reports .
Most of the staffers at the top salary level serve on upper - level committee and leadership office staffs as staff directors , policy advisers and legislative counsels — positions that have often had direct input on the formation of major legislation , such as health care .
Many of those staffers also have law degrees .
But while these top earners are a small percentage of the overall congressional work force , their numbers are growing at a rapid rate under the Democratic Congress .
The number of staffers earning within the upper 3 percent of House salaries — currently $ 163,358 or more — has increased by nearly 39 percent in the past four years , according to LegiStorm data .
In 2005 , there were 203 staffers earning in the top 3 percent .
That number spiked to 304 people in 2008 but then dropped in 2009 to 282 , likely caused in part by the economic downturn .
Pelosi ’s leadership office has several high earners , including Arshi Siddiqui , a tax and trade policy adviser who was closely involved in the formation of the Democratic health care legislation .
In a recent health care speech on the House floor , Pelosi praised Siddiqui ’s work , saying that she was one of several who had done a “ remarkable job — dazzling us with their knowledge and know - how . ”
“ These are people who could be making a lot more money in the private sector , but they choose to work here , ” said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly , who also makes $ 172,500 .
“ Often some of the junior - level staffers make $ 25,000 a year and work very long hours .
They ’re certainly not being overpaid .
Many of these people have a great deal of expertise . ”
Between 2009 and 2010 , the speaker did not increase top - level salaries for members or top- earning staffers , meaning staffers who already earned the maximum amount did not receive a raise over the past year .
There are approximately 10,000 House staffers , including district office workers , according to the chief administrative officer .
According to LegiStorm ’s data , 53 personal office
House staffers are making the most money possible in a regular congressional office — $ 168,411 .
Among those are Kathy Perdue , the House ’s assistant chief administrator for administrative and financial services , , and Jedd Moskowitz , chief of staff to Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - N.Y . ) .
Ryan Ellis , tax policy director of Americans for Tax Reform , says that the sheer number of staffers who are earning the maximum amount of pay — or are creeping close — is troubling for taxpayers .
An additional 80 staffers are only a raise away — about $ 2,000 — from hitting that $ 168,411 cap .
And 117 are a few thousand dollars away from hitting the $ 172,500 limit .
This trend is very likely setting a salary standard for new employees , Ellis said , making staffers more likely to demand certain pay levels based on the salaries of other workers — all of which are public record .
“ When you have a whole bunch of people making very , very high salaries , you ’ll have people who are expecting to be paid certain salaries and benefits .
That ’s not a good thing for taxpayers , because ultimately ... taxpayers are going into debt , ” Ellis said .
Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that in many cases , government jobs actually pay better than equivalent private - sector work .
Average federal salaries in 2008 were higher than the average private - sector pay in 83 percent of comparable work , the data show .
But several congressional offices with highly paid employees — including the Chief Administrative Office , where CAO Dan Beard makes $ 172,500 ( $ 90,000 from the House payroll , $ 82,500 in federal retirement benefits from his previous government service ) — say their pay levels reflect talent and experience .
For instance , many CAO staffers have been with the office their entire careers .
“ Staff are compensated appropriately according to their skill sets , length of career within the CAO ... and in direct relation to the salary grade similar professional credentials could achieve in the executive branch or in the private sector in a major metropolitan area like Washington , D.C. , ” said CAO spokesman Jeff Ventura .
“ Salaries are designed to retain the talent necessary to successfully maintain operations of the House of Representatives . ”
Despite the significant income of some staffers , there are many within LegiStorm ’s data who barely make enough to pay rent in Washington , one of the most expensive cities in the country .
For example , Chris Schaeffer , a staff assistant for Rep. Brian Baird ( D - Wash . ) , made $ 30,833 .
California GOP Rep. Daniel Lungren ’s congressional aide , Jonathan Langford , made only $ 28,583 .

Lawmakers working to craft a new comprehensive immigration bill have settled on a way to prevent employers from hiring illegal immigrants : a national biometric identification card all American workers would eventually be required to obtain .
Under the potentially controversial plan still taking shape in the Senate , all legal U.S. workers , including citizens and immigrants , would be issued an ID card with embedded information , such as fingerprints , to tie the card to the worker .
The ID card plan is one of several steps advocates of an immigration overhaul are taking to address concerns that have defeated similar bills in the past .
The uphill effort to pass a bill is being led by Sens. Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) and Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , who plan to meet with President Barack Obama as soon as this week to update him on their work .
An administration official said the White House had no position on the biometric card .
" It 's the nub of solving the immigration dilemma politically speaking , " Mr. Schumer said in an interview .
The card , he said , would directly answer concerns that after legislation is signed , another wave of illegal immigrants would arrive .
" If you say they can't get a job when they come here , you 'll stop it . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - News
Corp will charge readers for online versions of its UK Times and Sunday Times newspapers from June , becoming the first media firm to test consumers ’ appetite to pay for mass - market news online .
People leave the News Corporation building in New York , June 26 , 2007 .

Access to two new websites for the two titles will cost 1 pound ( $ 1.49 ) per day or 2 pounds for a week .
Subscribers to the print versions will get free access , News Corp said on Friday .
“ This is just the start , ” said Rebekah Brooks , chief executive of News Corp ’s British newspaper unit News International which also publishes the Sun daily tabloid and sister paper The News of the World on Sundays .
“ At a defining moment for journalism , this is a crucial step toward making the business of news an economically exciting proposition , ” she said in a statement .
Newspapers in Western Europe and the United States have been battered by the recession while fighting a structural shift in their business from paid - for newspapers to largely free news on the Web .
Two business newspapers -- the Financial Times and News Corp ’s Wall Street Journal -- charge readers for online access but consumer publications have so far not followed , fearing a massive loss of readers .
News Corp chief executive Rupert Murdoch has become a kind of champion of paid - for online news , saying Internet giant Google has deprived the industry of revenue by making news articles searchable for free .
In January , The New York Times said it would start charging readers for access to online articles from next year , acknowledging that advertising revenues were unlikely to be able to fund its journalism in the future .
The editors of the Times and Sunday Times promised interactive features to get readers more involved , personalized news feeds , and coming versions for phones , e-readers , tablet computers and other mobile devices .
The Times and the Sunday Times will launch new , separate websites in early May , which will be free to registered customers for a trial period .
The print version of the Times costs 1 pound on weekdays and 1.50 pounds on Saturdays , and the Sunday Times costs 2 pounds .

Pressure group Care Not Killing said it was " bizarre " the BBC had not told police of the admission when it was filmed in December .
The BBC said it was under no obligation to report to police ahead of broadcast but would co-operate with the inquiry .
During a documentary on death and dying the Nottingham filmmaker said he had made a pact with his lover to act if his suffering increased .
In the BBC East Midlands programme , broadcast on Monday , he told how he smothered the man with a pillow while he was in hospital after doctors told him that there was nothing further that could be done for him .
It was n't clear ... whether his lover even wanted to be killed or asked to be .
Dr Peter Saunders
Read your comments Mr Gosling did not name either his lover or the hospital .
Dr Peter Saunders , from Care Not Killing , said Mr Gosling 's account sounded like a case " not of assisted suicide but of intentional killing or murder " .
He said : " It 's rather bizarre this was filmed more than two months ago and the BBC has been sitting on it and has n't informed the police and the case has n't been investigated .
" At the moment all we have is Ray 's word there was a pact and it was n't clear from his description whether his lover even wanted to be killed or asked to be .
" It 's not up to us as the viewing public , on the basis of one very brief selective testimony , to draw conclusions on what might be a very complex case .
" That 's why it 's so important all these cases be fully investigated so the true facts can come out . "

Following the broadcast , police confirmed they had begun an inquiry .
A spokesman said : " We were not aware of Mr Gosling 's comments until the BBC Inside Out programme was shown .
" We are now liaising with the BBC and will investigate the matter . "
A BBC spokesman said the organisation will co-operate fully with the investigation .
They said Mr Gosling 's " secret " was not known before he was commissioned to make the report on death and dying , adding : " The first the BBC knew of this incident was during filming for the programme that was broadcast on 15 Feb 2010 .
" The BBC is under no legal obligation to refer the matter to the police in these circumstances . "
In the film Mr Gosling describes smothering his lover .
' Terrible situation '
He said : " I said to the doctor : ' Leave me just for a bit , ' and he went away .
" I picked up the pillow and smothered him until he was dead .
" The doctor came back and I said : ' He 's gone . '
Nothing more was ever said .
" When you love someone , it is difficult to see them suffer . "
Mr Gosling said he was aware of the possible consequences and had no regrets .
He said : " It 's a terrible situation .
I loved him to bits .
Crucially , Ray Gosling 's loved one was terminally ill and clearly asked for help to die when he was suffering unbearably at the end of his life
Sarah Wootton , Dignity in Dying " We had a pact - he said if the pain gets bad and if nothing can be done , do n't let him linger on .
" I do n't think it 's a crime .
" If he was looking down on me now he would be proud . "
Sarah Wootton , chief executive of Dignity in Dying , said : " This case yet again demonstrates that this is a real and present problem , which can affect us all .
" Crucially , Ray Gosling 's loved one was terminally ill and clearly asked for help to die when he was suffering unbearably at the end of his life .
" This illustrates a need for formal assisted dying legislation to help those who want choice at the end of life , as well as protect people who may be vulnerable to coercion . "
Moral case The Right Reverend Tim Stevens , Bishop of Leicester , said the Church of England was against euthanasia , as it saw a need to protect the vulnerable .
He said : " The moral case is based on the fact for the Christian , all human lives are of equal value under God , regardless of whether people are sick , fragile or healthy .
" To say that it 's vital to reduce the pain and distress of the terminally sick is one thing , on the other hand to say that we legitimise the premature ending of human life by direct medical intervention is another thing . "
Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence , but interim guidelines issued in September by the director of public prosecutions set out the factors which weigh in favour of and against prosecution in different cases in England and Wales .

The British Intelligence Agency recently said the latest weapon of Al Qaeda is to use female suicide bombers with explosive breast implants , thus making it impossible to detect at security check - points .
While British agencies are finding it difficult to deal with this new technique , Indian agencies say that they are aware of the new technique .
It was in fact started by the Jaish - e - Mohammad .
However they had used this technique in men where bombs were planted inside the human body .
This was quickly picked up the Lashkar - e - Tayiba .
Indian agencies say that it was the Lashkar which was first to start using women in its organisation .
The IB says that there is a difference , however , in the manner in which Lashkar and Al Qaeda use women for terror .
While the Al Qaeda is clear that women would be used as bombers , the Lashkar uses them as foot soldiers and recruiters .
However of late , the Lashkar , too , has been mooting various ideas to use women as suicide bombers .
Finding a women suicide bomber is not a big deal for the outfits .
The Lashkar has also used women to circulate fake currency and as recruiters .
The Lashkar has managed to convince outfits such as the SIMI and the Indian Mujahideen to follow suit .
The SIMI , which opened up a wing called as the Shaheen Force to educate children , was soon converted into an all - woman force .
The role given to the women was to recruit children into the outfit .
The IB says that in future , women will play a much bigger role in terror attacks .
The British Intelligence MI5 had stated that the Al Qaeda has a dedicated set of doctors to implant the explosives .
They have been doing it with so much expertise that once the bomb is implanted it would be virtually impossible to detect .
Indian agencies say that detecting such a bomb will be extremely difficult unless there are sophisticated X - ray machines in place .
This new technique would not , however , be used in major explosions .
It has been specifically made for airline bombings .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia said on Friday it was “ very alarmed ” by Iran ’s failure to cooperate with the IAEA , after the U.N. nuclear agency said it feared Tehran might be working to develop a nuclear missile .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei repeated Iran ’s insistence that suspicions about its nuclear program were baseless .
But the United States said the IAEA report lent weight to its campaign for more sanctions against Tehran .
“ We are very alarmed and we cannot accept this , that Iran is refusing to cooperate with the IAEA , ” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the radio station Ekho Moskvy .
“ For about 20 years , the Iranian leadership carried out its clandestine nuclear program without reporting it to the IAEA , ” he said .
“ I do not understand why there was such secrecy . ”
The IAEA on Thursday made public its concerns over a classified analysis which concludes that Iran already has explosives expertise relevant to a workable nuclear weapon .
“ Some questions remain on the table and Iran has so far not reacted to them , ” Lavrov said .
“ We need to understand how several documents concerning military nuclear technology found their way to Iran . ”
Russia -- which wields a veto in the United Nations Security Council -- has in recent weeks raised suspicions publicly about Iran ’s nuclear activities , after for years saying it had no evidence Tehran was seeking to build a nuclear bomb .

Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko hinted that talks on a sanctions resolution could start soon .
“ No work is in progress at the U.N. Security Council in New York today to prepare a possible sanctions - based resolution on Iran ...
However , given the current circumstances , we cannot fully rule out the possibility of starting this work . ”
But Moscow reiterated its position that it will not block an export of S - 300 air defense missile systems to Iran , something the United States and Israel say may help Iran protect its nuclear facilities from any future air strikes .
“ There is a contract to supply these systems to Iran , and we will fulfill it , ” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax .
“ It is absolutely incorrect to put the emphasis on the issue of S - 300 supplies . ”
[ ID:nLDE61I25 W ]
Washington ’s U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice said the IAEA report “ plainly underscores that Iran continues to flout its international obligations . ”
The nuclear watchdog ’s comments showed “ the urgency of making the choice real to Iran that it could engage and uphold its international obligations or , on the contrary , face increased international pressure , ” she told reporters .
Germany , one of the six powers negotiating with Iran on the nuclear issue , added its voice to the pressure .
“ The persistent defiance ... of United Nations resolutions and Tehran ’s continuation of a dangerous nuclear policy are forcing the international community to pursue further comprehensive sanctions in New York against the regime in Tehran , ” government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said .
But he added : “ We rule out a military solution . ”
The United States says it wants a diplomatic solution but has not ruled out military action .
German exporters called on Friday for tough sanctions , even though Germany is among Iran ’s biggest trading partners , exporting more than 3.3 billion euros ’ worth of goods in 2009 .
Khamenei was quoted as saying by Iranian media : “ The West ’s accusations are baseless because our religious beliefs bar us from using such weapons ...
We do not believe in atomic weapons and are not seeking that . ”
A government watchdog is criticizing the Obama administration for establishing a " meaningless " goal for its flagship mortgage assistance program .
The report issued late Tuesday by Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program , says the Obama administration is measuring the performance of the program by a questionable standard .
At the program 's launch in February 2009 , Obama officials said it would help 3 million to 4 million homeowners .
But with only 170,000 borrowers completing the program so far , administration officials now emphasize that the plan 's goal is to merely offer help to those millions .
" Defining success by how many offers are given can reasonably be perceived as essentially meaningless , " Barofsky wrote .
Instead , the program 's goal " must relate to how many people are helped to avoid foreclosure . "
Herbert Allison , an assistant Treasury secretary , acknowledged in a letter written in response to the report that officials ' statements about the plan 's goals " have not always been precise . "
But he argued that offers of help are a meaningful measurement because some borrowers who do n't qualify for the government program will still be able to avoid foreclosure .
The Obama program is designed to lower borrowers ' monthly payments by reducing mortgage rates to as low as 2 percent for five years and extending loan terms up to 40 years .
The government has set aside $ 75 billion in subsidies to entice mortgage companies to participate .
More than 100 have signed up .
To complete the program , homeowners need to complete a three month trial period and provide proof of their income , plus a letter documenting their financial hardship .
But getting banks and homeowners to complete the process has been tough .
Barofsky said in his report that an unnamed Treasury official estimated that 1.5 million to 2 million homeowners would complete the program by the end of 2012 .
That , Barofsky noted , " may only be a small fraction of the foreclosures that will occur in that period . "
The report is strongly critical of the government in other areas .
Barofsky noted that numerous changes to government guidelines " caused confusion and delay " and said the government did not do enough to advertise the program .
In response , Allison noted that the program " is the largest , most complex mortgage modification program of its kind " and said there was little precedent for how to design such an endeavor .

Assange demande à Hollande une loi pour protéger les lanceurs d'alerte
Last week , the full US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit upheld an earlier ruling by a partial panel , invalidating a biotech patent that originated in research at MIT and Harvard .
The patent covered any of three ways to disable a signaling pathway involved in the immune response , and would have enabled its licensee , Ariad Pharmaceuticals , to go after companies that already have drugs on the market .
The court held , however , that simply specifying different ways of interfering with a protein without any written description of how to do so constituted insufficient grounds for granting a patent .
This case , and a similar one ( University of Rochester v. Pharmacia ) that served as precedent , both followed a similar pattern .
In each case , basic research in a university context identified a key protein involved in inflammatory responses .
For Rochester , it was the enzyme Cox - 2 ; drugs that inhibit it included Celebrex and Vioxx , both painkillers with lower risk of stomach irritation than aspirin .
In the new case , it was the NF - kappaB signaling pathway , which is involved in the immune response to pathogens .
Excessive activation of the NF - κB creates chronic inflammation .
In this case , Eli Lilly had two drugs already on the market .
In each case , the patent that was granted contained a generic description of how to inhibit the protein involved .
For the Ariad patent , three methods were mentioned : blocking the signaling pathways that activate NF - κB , reducing the protein 's activity , and preventing the protein from binding DNA .
Neither patent specified the actual biochemical mechanism for performing any of these inhibitory functions , nor did they describe any substances that could actually do so .
In short , they covered any possible method of targeting a specific biochemical pathway .
As soon as the patents were granted , the grantees turned around and sued the pharmaceutical companies that had actually done the hard work of finding an implementation of these generic concepts .
The first suit , which was decided in 2003 , did n't go well for the patent holders , as a judge ruled that the patent , as granted , did n't include a sufficient description of an actual invention .
The new case resulted in a jury trial , which Lilly lost , leading its lawyers to request that the verdict be vacated as a matter of law .
The presiding judge declined , leading to the appeals process .
An initial ruling by a three - judge panel overturned the Ariad patent on the grounds of an insufficient written description , but the full court decided that the issue was significant enough to merit consideration .
The relevant passage of the US patent code was quoted in full in the decision :
The specification shall contain a written description of the invention , and of the manner and process of making and using it , in such full , clear , concise , and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains , or with which it is most nearly connected , to make and use the same , and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention .
To a certain extent , the argument is over where to put the commas in the statute , which determines what , precisely , needs to appear in the written description .
Based on its reading , the Court has determined that " nothing in the statute ’s language or grammar that unambiguously dictates that the adequacy of the ' written description of the invention ' must be determined solely by whether that description identifies the invention so as to enable one of skill in the art to make and use it . "
So , even though a skilled biochemist could view the rough descriptions in the patent and know how to develop an inhibitor , that alone is not enough to mean that the patent is valid .
With that interpretation of the law stated , the court focused on whether the patent defined anything that could reasonably be described as an invention .
" Every patent must describe an invention , " the decision states .
" It is part of the quid pro quo of a patent ; one describes an invention , and , if the law ’s other requirements are met , one obtains a patent . "
Its conclusion is that this sort of description is nowhere to be found .
Using biological terminology , the Court concluded that the patent describes what it terms a " genus " of inventions , but neglects to specify any " species " — meaning actual chemicals — that are sufficient to show that the patent holder can actually claim to have implemented the genus .
Instead , using language from an earlier decision , it dismisses this approach as " no more than a ' wish ' or a ' plan ' . "
Just as the court decided in the Rochester case , without a description of an actual chemical that performs these functions , a patent cannot be considered to have provided an adequate written description .
Although it simply reaffirms the Rochester decision , the new opinion attempts to explicitly set a standard for written descriptions that apply generally .
And the standard it sets is a rather significant one .
Based on the last several decades of biochemistry and molecular biology , it 's really easy to identify proteins that help regulate a variety of essential processes , and suggest a variety of routes to inhibiting them .
Actually developing something that does so successfully is where the hard work and creativity — the inventiveness , as it were — comes in .
In short , this interpretation of the statute appears to bring patent law more in line with the general intent of the patent system .
The decision is also a good sign that the Appeals Court ( or at least its clerks ) have come to grips with modern biology .
The decision includes a decent description of the NF - κB signaling process , and casually discusses testimony regarding whether the protein has a transcription activation domain that 's distinct from its DNA binding domain .
It 's not a stretch to expect that a court that finds the biology mysterious will be more likely to grant deference to technically complex but flawed patents , to the detriment of both research and society .
The fact that the court is comfortable discussing biochemistry suggests that this risk is receding .
In my new book , American Conspiracies , I included a chapter called “ Your Government Dealing Drugs . ”
It traces the history of how the CIA has funded a lot of its operations over the years with drug money , and still looks the other way in places like Afghanistan — where President Hamid Karzai ’s own brother is getting regular CIA payments while being simultaneously involved in the heroin trade .
Meantime , according to reports by Congress and the Treasury Department , American banks are “ collectively the world ’s largest financial beneficiary of the drug trade ” — with an estimated inflow of about $ 250 billion a year !
The hypocrisy is staggering when you consider that the Obama administration ’s “ drug war ” budget has about twice as much money going into the criminal justice system than to treatment and prevention .
This is despite President Obama having said many times that drug use needs to be looked at as a health issue .
In California , where you can get a prescription for medical marijuana , the L.A. County District Attorney claims that state law does n’t allow dispensaries to sell it – and they recently busted a popular distributor and charged him with 24 felonies !
In January , President Obama nominated a holdover from the Bush years , Michele Leonhart , to head up the Drug Enforcement Administration .
She has a history of cracking down on medical marijuana dispensaries , and most recently denying the research application of a University of Massachusetts botanist .
This is a ludicrous appointment , since Attorney General Eric Holder has already ordered federal agents not to go after medical marijuana outlets .
So is the administration talking out of both sides of its mouth ?
What follows is an excerpt from American Conspiracies :
****
But is n’t it high time for complete reform of our drug policy ?
We ’ve got a shadow economy happening , friends .
One hundred million Americans have sampled marijuana , and that includes almost half of all the seniors in high school .
More than 35 million Americans have tried cocaine at some point , and almost as many have taken LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs .
Meantime , we ’ve got “ grows ” or “ gardens ” of pot springing up all across our western states on public lands–and that includes almost 40 percent of national forests .
About 3.1 million marijuana plants were confiscated in national forests over a one - year period , September 2007 to September 2008 , carrying a street value calculated at $ 12.4 billion .
I mean , how stupid are we ?
Go back to Chicago and Prohibition , when Al Capone became more powerful than the government because we ’d outlawed the selling of liquor .
Legalize marijuana , and you put the cartels out of business !
Instead , we ’re going to further militarize our border and go shoot it out with them ?
And if a few thousand poor Mexicans get killed in the crossfire , too bad .
I do n’t get that mentality .
I do n’t understand how this is the proper way , the adult answer , when they could do it another way .
Eventually , after thousands more people get killed , they ’ll probably arrive at the same answer : legalization .
Because there ’s nothing else that will work .
And legalization would go a long way toward giving us a more legitimate government , too–a government that does n’t have to shield drug dealers who happen to be doing its dirty work .
There are clearly people in government making money off drugs .
Far more people , statistically , die from prescription drugs than illegal drugs .
But the powers that be do n’t want you to be able to use a drug that you do n’t have to pay for , such as marijuana .
Thirteen states now have voted to allow use of medical marijuana .
Thank goodness Barack Obama just came out with a new policy stating that the feds are not going to interfere as long as people are following state law .
That ’s a great step toward legalization .
You ca n’t legislate stupidity , is an old saying I used in governing .
Just because you make something illegal does n’t mean it ’s going away , it just means it ’ll now be run by criminals .
But is using an illegal drug a criminal offense , or a medical one ?
I tend to believe medical , because that ’s customarily how addictions are treated , we do n’t throw you in jail for them .
In a free society , that ’s an oxymoron–going to jail for committing a crime against yourself .
The government is telling people what ’s good for them and what ’s not , but that should be a choice made by us , not those in power .
Look at the consequences when it ’s the other way around .

Polis Calls On Holder To Rein In ‘ Rogue ’ DEA Agents
by Ryan Grim , The Huffington Post
Rep. Jared Polis has called on Attorney General Eric Holder to look into whether the Drug Enforcement Administration acted inappropriately and in defiance of federal government policy by raiding and arresting a small medical marijuana grower in Colorado .
Polis , a freshman Democrat who represents the state , told HuffPost that he also met with Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske and pressed him on the issue .
“ I was very impressed with him , ” said Polis .
Now he ’s working on Holder .
In February , Holder said that the Justice Department would not arrest or prosecute people for drug law violations if they are following state medical marijuana laws .
The department issued a memo to that effect in October .
The DEA raid and subsequent comments from top special agent Jeffrey Sweetin that the drug warriors would “ arrest everybody ” created a climate of “ widespread panic ” in Colorado , Polis wrote to Holder in a letter this week .
He asked the AG to clarify in writing whether the department ’s policy was still in effect .
The man captured in the raid has been charged by the U.S. Attorney for intent to distribute drugs .
“ It seems like there is a disconnect between the field and the White House policy , ” Polis told HuffPost .
“ You have rogue agents like the one in Colorado , like Jeff Sweetin , that are going around , that are making statements that are scaring people , and that are disrupting a doctor - patient relationship that is sanctioned by the people of Colorado . ”
Medical marijuana is legal as part of Colorado ’s constitution .
“ I think clearly the Attorney General and Washington need to have more clear guidelines and they need to enforce those guidelines nationally so that no other agents step out of line and scare people who are following state laws , ” said Polis .
The DEA was alerted to the defendant ’s pot -growing operation because he gave an interview to a local TV station .
“ Sometimes there ’s a subculture within law enforcement that seeks enforcement for the sake of enforcement .
And serious law enforcement professionals need to put a stop to that , ” said Polis .
“ The voters overwhelmingly passed a medical marijuana law , and regardless of what Coloradoans feel about medical marijuana , they overwhelmingly agree that the federal government should not intervene with what we believe to be a state and local decision , ” he said .
Polis compared the situation to alcohol enforcement — even if the grower broke state law , as the DEA insists , that is an issue that should be left to the state .
“ Until recently , Colorado had blue laws so we were n’t allowed to have liquor stores open on Sunday , ” said Polis .
“ I did n’t see any federal agents raid liquor stores on Sunday .
That was a state issue and so is this . ”

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Suspected drug hitmen killed a carload of children and teenagers in northern Mexico in the latest of a rash of attacks on minors that have angered the public as drug gang violence spins out of control .
Ten youngsters aged from eight to 21 died on Sunday when gunmen opened fire and lobbed explosives at their pick - up truck after it sped through an improvised roadblock on an isolated highway in Durango state , in Mexico ’s “ Golden Triangle ” drug - producing region , the attorney general ’s office in Durango said .
Mexico ’s drug cartels are growing ever more brazen , and a spate of brutal attacks in recent weeks , including the murder of two Americans , are worrying Mexicans along with tourists , foreign investors and the United States , which sent a high - level delegation to Mexico City last week .
Mexican soldiers on Monday captured a suspect linked to the fatal shooting this month of an American employee of the U.S. consulate in the border city of Ciudad Juarez , her U.S. husband and the Mexican husband of a fellow consulate worker .
Interior Minister Fernando Gomez
Mont said on Monday the rampant violence only showed the importance of keeping up the pressure with the government ’s army - led assault on drug traffickers .
He waved off the idea of backing down .
“ If some people think that events like those of the weekend where criminals slay youngsters in this cowardly way , if faced with these events Mexico is going to back off , they are mistaken , ” Gomez Mont told a news conference .
Nearly 19,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon took office in late 2006 and deployed tens of thousands of troops to drug hot spots across the country , sparking new turf wars between rival cartels .
But the conservative president ’s anti-drugs strategy has been criticized following several brutal attacks on youths in the violent region along the U.S. - Mexico border .
In January , suspected drug cartel gunmen burst into a high school birthday party in the border city of Ciudad Juarez and killed 15 people , mostly minors , sparking angry protests from relatives and other city residents sick of daily violence .
Several of Sunday ’s victims were related .
Gomez Mont said drug violence in Durango state was being driven by a violent turf war between the local Sinaloa alliance and the Zetas , the former armed wing of the rival Gulf cartel that is now trying to run its own smuggling operation .
Criminal gangs are known to sometimes set up military - style roadblocks to snag targets , and the northern business city of Monterrey was hit this month by a series of road barricades erected by armed men believed to be linked to drug gangs .
DETROIT --
The Detroit Red Wings are distancing themselves from the Calgary Flames in the battle for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference .
In fact , the Red Wings are n't going to be satisfied simply with the No. 8 seed .
They are setting their sights much higher -- on fifth place .
The Red Wings exploded for four consecutive goals in the second period Friday night and defeated the Minnesota Wild 6 - 2 at Joe Louis Arena , matching their season - high four - game winning streak .
Johan Franzen tallied two goals and two assists for his first career four - point game in the regular season .
Jonathan Ericsson , Tomas Holmstrom and Pavel Datsyuk each picked up one goal and one assist .
Drew Miller scored a goal .
Nicklas Lidstrom and Jason Williams both contributed two assists .
Goaltender Jimmy Howard celebrated his 26th birthday by making 25 saves in his 21st consecutive start .
Detroit tied the Colorado Avalanche for seventh in the West with 89 points , only one point behind the Los Angeles Kings and two back of the Nashville Predators , whom the Red Wings visit Saturday night .
Detroit is six points ahead of No. 9 Calgary .
Each team has eight games remaining .
" It sure helps to be on the right side of the eighth spot and not just being the team that 's chasing , " Lidstrom said .
" We know we 're not out of the woods yet .
We still have to make sure we 'll be in the playoffs .
Red Wings vs. Wild game highlights
" When you 're winning , you 're looking at the teams above you who you can catch , and Nashville is one of the teams that is real close to us now . "
The Red Wings will face the Predators without forward Dan Cleary , who reaggravated a pulled groin in the first period and did not return .
It was Cleary 's second game back after sitting out two games with the injury .
Playing their best hockey of the season , the Red Wings are 11 - 2 - 1 in their past 14 games .
" Guys have been playing well , we 've had it pretty much going since the Olympic break , " Howard said .
" ( The break ) allowed guys to relax and get their energy back for the last 20 games or so . "
The Red Wings were n't able to capitalize on three power - play opportunities in the first period , but it did n't come back to bite them in the second , when they outshot the Wild 19 - 9 and outscored them 4 - 1 .
After watching the Henrik Zetterberg - Valtteri Filppula - Todd Bertuzzi line carry the team the past three games , Holmstrom said of his line , with Franzen and Datsyuk : " It was our turn tonight . "
Franzen , who had gone pointless in his previous four games , launched the rally with his eighth goal at 1:19 .
Holmstrom scored on the power play at 4:32 , tipping in a slap - pass from Lidstrom .
" It was bouncing my way tonight , our way , " Franzen said .
" It happens .
Last game we did n't play good as a line , the couple of games before that we created a lot of chances , nothing went in .
Just the opposite tonight , everything went in .
" When we 're sharing the goal scoring , it 's hard to defend against . "
Said coach Mike Babcock : " I thought Mule ( Franzen ) was good .
Just one of those things , he had n't scored in a while .
It was good to see him get back at it .
I thought Pav 's line was good tonight .
When you got a good team , lots of different people can contribute . "
Ericsson made it 3 - 0 with a short - handed goal at 10:03 .
After exiting the penalty box , following a brief two - man advantage by the Wild , Ericsson lugged the puck into the offensive zone and then chased it down behind the net .
He passed back to Lidstrom at the blue line and skated into the slot to deflect in a blast by the captain .
It was Ericsson 's fourth goal of the season but his first in 43 games , dating to Oct. 29 .
" I was on my way to change , but then , I saw Nick was going to shoot it , " Ericsson said .
" I know he always gets the puck through and I just told myself to stay in front of the net .
It 's a lucky bounce , but it always feels good to get a goal . "
Datsyuk capped the rally with his team - leading 24th goal at 11:23 .
The Wild made it a little interesting by getting goals from Andrew Brunette , on the power play , at 16:07 of the second period , and Owen Nolan at 2:09 of the third period to cut their deficit to 4 - 2 .
Brunette 's goal snapped Detroit 's streak of 30 consecutive penalty kills , which dated to March 3 .
The Red Wings had n't allowed a power - play goal in their past 10 games .
On Nolan 's goal , Howard fanned on a bouncing puck , trying to direct it into the corner .
But the Red Wings put the game away with goals from Franzen , on the power play , at 5:29 , and Miller at 7:26 .
" I would have liked to have the second one back , should have played it like a shortstop and attacked it instead of having the puck play me , " Howard said .
" But bounces happen over the course of the season . "
The Glamorous Life of the Stripper Excerpted from a 1999 study by Kelly Holsopple .
Kelly , a former stripper , investigated violence in strip clubs , typical strip club activities and interactions , working conditions , and womens thoughts on stripping .
Her study had two parts .
In phase one , she interviewed 41 women for 1 to 4 hours each .
The interviews were qualitative and open - ended .
The phase one subjects ranged in age from 19 - 40 , and had been working as strippers anywhere from 3 months to 18 years .
They worked in both urban and rural clubs which , collectively , featured the following activities : topless dancing , nude dancing , table dancing , couch dancing , lap dancing , wall dancing , shower dancing , and bed dancing , peepshows , female boxing and wrestling with customers .
Some of the clubs also sold photographs of the dancers , or hired porn models and actresses as headliners .
After analyzing the phase one results , Kelly found that two most pronounced themes were low - self esteem and violence .
In phase two , Kelly interviewed a smaller group of women using a 26 - question survey .
It focused on the rules and work conditions at clubs , and incidents of verbal harassment , physical and sexual violence , and sexual exploitation experienced by the strippers .
These surveys and consequent discussions lasted from one to four hours .
The phase two subjects ranged in age from eighteen to thirty - five years old , and entered into stripping between the ages of 15 and 23 years old , with an average entry age of 18 years , 10 months .
In phase two , the women were asked to describe the various circumstances of their recruitment into stripping .
One woman recounted her recruitment as an eighteen - year - old .
She went to a gentlemens club to pick up her friend , waited at the bar , was served alcohol , and was asked for her ID by the owner .
Instead of kicking her out , he told her she could make $ 1000 per week working for him and pressured her to enter the amateur contest that night .
She won the $ 300 contest , and worked there three weeks before being recruited into an escort service by a patron pimp .
This kind of story is not uncommon .
Typically , a strip club manager asks a potential applicant to audition on amateur night or bikini night , popular with customers who hope to see girl - next - door types rather than seasoned strippers .
If the manager is pleased and there is an opening in the schedule , he may make a job offer .
Applicants are told working as a stripper is flexible , lucrative , and that they will not be forced to do anything they do not want to do .
Later , strippers discover that managers overbook them so they are forced to compete with each other , often gradually engaging in more explicit activities in order to earn tips .
It s important to understand that strippers are typically hired as independent contractors  rather than employees . 
They have no fixed wage , and their income depends on pleasing customers in order to earn tips .
They are not entitled to any of the following privileges : workers  compensation , health insurance , unemployment benefits , or filing discrimination claims .
Club owners save money by paying no Social Security , no health insurance , and no sick pay .
( see Joes Strip - o - Rama Employee Handbook )
Other club income collected by the management can include : door cover charges , beverage sales , sale of promotional novelty items , kickbacks , prostitution , and fines imposed on the women .
When not on stage , strippers are also encouraged to perform private dances for bigger tips .
These are usually performed in areas shielded from the larger club view .
As a rule , these transactions involve one female dancer and one male customer .
These situations skirt the definition of prostitution because of the contact involved .
Table dancing is performed on a low coffee table or on a small portable platform near the customers seat .
The womans breasts and genitals are eye level to the customer .
Couch dancing for a customer involves a dancer standing above him on a couch , dangling her breasts or bopping him in the face with her pubic area .
Lap dancing requires the woman to straddle the mans lap and grind against him until he ejaculates in his pants .
A variation involves the woman dancing between his legs while he slides down in his chair so that the dancers thighs are rubbing his crotch as she moves .
Bed dancing occurs in a private room and requires a woman to lie on top of a fully clothed man and simulate sex until he ejaculates .
Shower dancing is offered in upscale clubs and allows a clothed customer to get into a shower stall with one or more women and massage them with soap .
Wall dancing requires a stripper to carry alcohol swabs to wash the customers fingers before he can insert them into her vagina .
His back is stationary against the wall and she is pressed against him with one leg lifted .
Peep shows feature simulated or actual sex acts directed by masturbating customers who sit in darkened booths and view the women through a glass window .
In the second phase of her survey , Kelly found that : 100 % of the women reported physical abuse in the club .
100 % of the women reported sexual abuse in the club .
100 % of the women reported verbal harassment in the club .
100 % of the women reported being propositioned for prostitution in the club .
100 % of women also witnessed these things happening to other strippers in the club .
Customers committed the overwhelming majority of violent acts .
Club owners , managers , assistant managers , bartenders , music programmers or DJs , bouncers , security guards , floorwalkers , doormen , and valets were guilty to a lesser extent .
The women in the survey reported that customers have spit on them
sprayed beer at them
flicked lit cigarettes at them
pelted them with ice , coins , trash , condoms , room keys , pornography , and golf balls
hit them with cans and bottles
pulled their hair
yanked them by the arm or ankle
ripped their costumes or tried to pull their costumes off .
bitten , licked , slapped , punched , and pinched them Some strippers worked on elevated runways so narrow that they could not get away from customers on either side touching them , especially when they were kneeling down to accept a tip in the side of their g - strings / t- bars , or when they had their backs turned .
Despite claims from management that customers are prohibited from touching the strippers , this rule is consistently violated .
Strippers reported having these thoughts while on stage :  I daydream about nothing in particular to pass the time of 12 minutes . 
 Im thinking about how good I look in the mirrors and how good I feel in dance movements . 
 I tell myself to smile . 
 I think about getting high and that I am making money to get high . 
 I am giving these guys every chance to be decent , so that I dont have to be afraid of them . 
 I am filled with disdain for the customers who do not tip , but sit and watch and direct you to do things for no money . 
 I think of how cheap these fuckers are , what bills I need to pay . 
Strippers engaged in private dances reported these reactions :  I dont want him to touch me , but I am afraid he will say something violent if I tell him no . 
 I was thinking about doing prostitution because thats when customers would proposition me . 
 I could only think about how bad these guys smell and try to hold my breath . 
 I spent the dance hyper - vigilant to avoiding their hands , mouths , and crotches . 
 I was glad we were allowed to place towels on the guys  laps , so it wasnt so bad . 
 I dont remember because it was so embarrassing . 
Notice none reported thinking ,  Gee , this guy is so hot , I wonder if hell let me take him home . 

Interested in creating a game in a week ?
I mean who would n’t be .
Everybody ’s got great ideas for a game .
Unfortunately you ca n’t design fun on paper .
So the best way to see if a game is fun to play , is to create the damn game ( or at least a playable prototype ) .
That ’s enough of an excuse for any game developer to be interested in learning the art of rapid prototyping .
That and the fact that it takes more than 7 days to write the out dated 250 page design document that nobody reads .
I thought I would gather here a little list of articles about rapid game prototyping .
These are from very different contexts and there might be some segments in these articles not directly related to rapid development .
Even though the information might seem irrelevant its usually pretty interesting and useful in some way .
If you know other articles about rapid game prototyping please let me know about them and I ’ll update this list .
Easiest way of contacting me would be to write a comment or to send me a email at petri dot purho [ ät ] gmail.com .
How Not To GID by Paul Malyschko
http://www.garagegames.com/index.php?sec=mg&mod=resource&page=view&qid=5982
The first article on the list is about how to create a game in day .
Or actually how to not create a game in a day .
Game
In A Day ( or GID for short ) is semi competition hosted by Garage Games , where you have 24 hours to create a game .
It ’s not really a competition as much as its encouragement to create games in extremely short time span .
Article was written by Paul Malyschko and its about lessons he learned from trying to GID .
It ’s written more from a hobby game developer perspective , but the lessons told there are valuable to anyone trying to create a quick prototype .
How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days
http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20051026/gabler_01.shtml
The second article is the now classic paper by Carnegie Mellon students who started the Experimental Gameplay Project .
If you have n’t read the article GO READ IT NOW .
If you have read the article and your thinking about prototyping a game , go read the article again .
It ’s the article that inspired me to start developing experimental - done - in - a - week games .
Sol ’s “ rules ” for surviving Ludum Dare 48h
http://sol.gfxile.net/ldsurvival.html
Third article is Jari Komppa ’s ( A.K.A. Sol ) guide to surviving Ludum Dares 48 hour game development competitions .
Because its a real competition , where you have only 48 hours to make a game , the article has a lot of information about managing the stress of the competition .
That might not be relevant , when you have a week to create game and it ’s not for a combo , but there ’s also lots of info about the rapid game development .
For example the 3.2 Design considerations - segment is all golden rule stuff .
How To Build a Game In A Week From Scratch With No Budget
http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article2259.asp
Jay Barnson ( A.K.A. Rampant Coyote ) created a RPG in a week from scratch without a budget and without the help of any existing game engines .
It ’s impressive when you consider how content heavy genre RPG is .
I ’m just waiting for someone to do this with a MMORPG .
The article is more of a development log , which is interesting in its way , but the real meat for us is at the end of the article :
The postmortem , or the top ten lessons learned from developing a RPG in a week .
Like the “ Lesson 3 : Do n’t underestimate the art requirements ” .
Sounds like common sense , but I fell for that one .
Torque Game Engine Documentation – Step 4 ) Build a quick and dirty prototype
http://www.garagegames.com/docs/tge/general/ch02s05.html
This is snippet from the Torque Game Engine Documentation .
There ’s some general information about creating a prototype , experiences learned from Marble Blast ’s development .
At the end , there ’s some more specific info about how they created Marble Blast ’s prototypes using the Torgue Game Engine .
ALGDS – General Advice
http://www.algds.org/#Advice
Ad Lib Game Development Society runs these semi annual sessions where they create few game prototypes .
It ’s a little like Indie Game Jam .
The link is n’t really an article as its more of list of random pointers they picked up during the development .
It ’s more concentrated on how to create a prototype with a team and how to host the event .
I know this is n’t directly related but for the sake of completeness here ’s a link to Raph Koster ’s blog , where he gives an interesting alternative approach to gameplay prototyping .
There was also an interesting article about Paper Prototyping on gamasutra.com .
There was a lot of talk about prototyping in this years Game Developer Conference .
Unfortunately I was n’t there , but there is a nice trail of articles about GDC on the web from which I learned a lot .
The Experimental Gameplay project guys gave a talk about “ How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days “ .
What I understood from the blog coverages and the Power Point slides the information was mostly the same as in the gamasutra article .
But there were also developers from Maxis talking about their Spore prototyping experiences .
Their talks where more from the perspective of why you should prototype opposed to how you can prototype , but its makes an interesting reading none the less .
Advanced Prototyping
https://www.cmpevents.com/GD06/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=1914
Chris Hecker and Chaim Gingold talked about what makes a good prototype .
Here ’s the Game Spy ’s coverage about the presentation and Power Point slides .
There are some very good points even though its more from a professional game development teams point of view .
Pre-Production Through Prototyping
https://www.cmpevents.com/gd06/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=1619
Also Eric
Todd talked about what problems does prototyping solve for the preproduction .
There is a good coverage by Gamasutra and here are the Power Point slides .
Even though its more about how game designers see prototyping there are some good hints for creating a good gameplay prototype .
Like :
“ Though you do n’t want to obsess , Todd said , “ a little aesthetics goes a long way ” toward making your prototype something that people will actually use .
He called this minimal kind of design a kind of “ coating on the aspirin ” ”
That ’s about all the googling and bookmarks I had on this subject .
I do n’t know if there are some other articles about rapid game prototyping , but I know that the BEST source of information about this subject is experience .
So go and create a small game .
It does n’t ( or at least should n’t ) even take that much time .
Less reading more prototyping .
